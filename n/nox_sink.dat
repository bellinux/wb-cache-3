Hourly measurements were carried out between July 2004 and February 2005 with observed maximum and minimum mixing ratios of 52. 3 and ? 1 in spring and 0. 6 pptv d ? 1 in summer.

40|$|Tropical {{tropospheric ozone}} affects Earth's {{radiative}} forcing and the oxidative {{capacity of the}} atmosphere. Considerable work {{has been devoted to}} the study of the processes controlling its budget. Yet, large discrepancies between simulated and observed tropical tropospheric ozone remain. Here, we characterize some of the mechanisms by which the photochemistry of isoprene impacts the budget of tropical ozone. At the regional scale, we find that isoprene nitrates can account for up to 70 % of the local <b>NOx</b> <b>sink.</b> Using forward sensitivity simulations, we show that the modulation of Ox by isoprene nitrates photochemistry can be characterized by their net impact on NOx. We use adjoint sensitivity simulations to demonstrate that the oxidation of isoprene can affect ozone outside of continental regions through the transport of NOx over near-shore regions (e. g., South Atlantic) and the oxidation of isoprene outside of the boundary layer far from its emissions regions. The latter mechanism is promoted by the simulated low boundary-layer oxidative conditions. In our simulation, ~ 20 % of the isoprene is oxidized above the boundary layer in the tropics. Changes in the interplay between regional and global effect are discussed in light of the forecasted increase in anthropogenic emissions in tropical regions...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{observations}} of the reactive chemical composition of the tropical marine boundary layer (MBL) are rare, despite its crucial role for the chemical stability of the atmosphere. Recent {{observations of}} reactive bromine species in the tropical MBL showed unexpectedly high levels that could potentially {{have an impact on}} the ozone budget. Uncertainties in the ozone budget are amplified by our poor understanding of the fate of NOx (= NO + NO 2), particularly the importance of nighttime chemical NOx sinks. Here, we present year-round {{observations of the}} multiisotopic composition of atmospheric nitrate in the tropical MBL at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory. We show that the observed oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate are compatible with nitrate formation chemistry, which includes the BrNO 3 sink at a level of ca. 20 ± 10 % of nitrate formation pathways. The results also suggest that the N 2 O 5 pathway is a negligible <b>NOx</b> <b>sink</b> in this environment. Observations further indicate a possible link between the NO 2 /NOx ratio and the nitrogen isotopic content of nitrate in this low NOx environment, possibly reflecting the seasonal change in the photochemical equilibrium among NOx species. This study demonstrates the relevance of using the stable isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen of atmospheric nitrate in association with concentration measurements to identify and constrain chemical processes occurring in the MBL...|$|E
40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{isotopic composition}} of atmospheric nitrate (i. e., the simultaneous measurement {{of all its}} stable isotope ratios: 15 N/ 14 N, 17 O/ 16 O and 18 O/ 16 O) has been determined for aerosol samples collected in the marine boundary layer (MBL) over the Atlantic Ocean from 65 °S (Weddell Sea) to 79 °N (Svalbard), along a ship-borne latitudinal transect. In nonpolar areas, the d 15 N of nitrate mostly deriving from anthropogenically emitted NOx {{is found to be}} significantly different (from 0 to 6 per mil) from nitrate sampled in locations influenced by natural NOx sources (- 4 ± 2) per mil. The effects on d 15 N(NO 3 -) of different NOx sources and nitrate removal processes associated with its atmospheric transport are discussed. Measurements of the oxygen isotope anomaly (D 17 O = d 17 O - 0. 52 × d 18 O) of nitrate suggest that nocturnal processes involving the nitrate radical {{play a major role in}} terms of <b>NOx</b> <b>sinks.</b> Different D 17 O between aerosol size fractions indicate different proportions between nitrate formation pathways as a function of the size and composition of the particles. Extremely low d 15 N values (down to - 40 per mil) are found in air masses exposed to snow-covered areas, showing that snowpack emissions of NOx from upwind regions can have a significant impact on the local surface budget of reactive nitrogen, in conjunction with interactions with active halogen chemistry. The implications of the results are discussed in light of the potential use of the stable isotopic composition of nitrate to infer atmospherically relevant information from nitrate preserved in ice cores...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of NO(x) {{and ozone}} {{performed}} during the NOXAR project are compared with {{results from the}} coupled chemistry-climate models ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM and GISS-model. The measurements are based on flights between Europe and the East coast of America and between Europe and the Far East in the latitude range 40 deg N to 65 deg N. The comparison concentrates on tropopause altitudes and reveals strong longitudinal variations of seasonal mean NO,, of 200 pptv. Either model reproduced strong variations 3 km below {{but not at the}} tropopause, indicating a strong missing <b>NO(x)</b> or NO(y) <b>sink</b> over remote areas, e. g. NO(x) to HNO 3 conversion by OH from additional OH sources or HNO 3 wash-out. Vertical profiles show maximum NO(x) values 2 - 3 km below the tropopause with a strong seasonal cycle. ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM reproduces a maximum, although located at the tropopause with a less pronounced seasonal cycle, whereas the GISS model reproduces the seasonal cycle but not the profile's shape due to its coarser vertical resolution. A comparison of NO(x) frequency distributions reveals that both models are capable of reproducing the observed variability, except that ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM shows no very high NO(x) mixing ratios. Ozone mean values, vertical profiles and frequency distributions are much better reproduced in either model, indicating that the NO(x) frequency distribution, namely the most frequent NO(x) mixing ratio, is more important for the tropospheric photochemical ozone production than its mean value. Both models show that among all sources, NO(x) from lightning contributes most to the seasonal cycle of NO(x) at tropopause altitudes. The impact of lightning in the upper troposphere on NO(x) does not vary strongly with altitude, whereas the impact of surface emissions decreases with altitude. However, the models show significant differences in lightning induced NO(x) concentrations, especially in winter, which {{may be related to the}} different treatment of the lower stratospheric coupling between dynamics and chemistry...|$|R
40|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and oxygen}} (O) stable isotope composition (? 15 N 2 ̆ 6 ? 18 O) of nitrogen oxides (NOx) {{may be a}} useful tool for constraining NOx emission sources as well as for understanding the atmospheric oxidation pathways responsible for its removal if various <b>NOx</b> sources and <b>sink</b> processes exhibit characteristic isotopic compositions (??ngerprints?). However, this requires (1) an accurate and complete inventory of ? 15 N(NOx) values from major emission sources, (2) an assessment of the kinetic and equilibrium isotope e?ects that can impact ? 15 N and ? 18 O values of NOx, (3) and test these assumptions by conducting accurate in situ ? 15 N and ? 18 O measurements of atmospheric NOx. To this end, I have characterized the ? 15 N(NOx) signatures from various fossil-fuel NOx sources, including buses, trucks, lawn equipment, natural gas?red boilers, and airplanes. These ? 15 N(NOx) source characterization studies along with prior studies indicate that soil emission (nitri?cation/denitri?cation), ?thermal? NOx producedfromfossil-fuelcombustion, and?source? NOx producedfromcoal-?red power plants have relative distinctive values. In addition, both my experimental and theoretical investigations on the isotope e?ects associated with NOx oxidation indicate that isotopes e?ects via equilibrium isotope exchange and kinetic isotope e?ects occurring during NOx oxidation reactions may in?uence the ? 15 N and ? 18 O values of atmospheric nitrate. Using these calculated isotope e?ects, I developed a simple model for the production of atmospheric nitrate through its three major pathways thatinclude(1) NO 2 +?OH?HNO 3, (2) N 2 O 5 +surface? 2 HNO 3, and(3) NO 3 + R??R. This model indicated that these pathways result in distinctive ? 18 O-? 15 N relationships that tend to match reported literature values. Finally, in order to evaluate the in?uences of NOx emission sources and isotope e?ects on the isotope composition of NO 2, which serves as precursor molecule to atmospheric nitrate, ambient NO 2 was collected and analyzed for 15 N and 18 O. These results suggest that ? 18 O of NO 2 has a distinctive diurnal pro?le re?ecting the photochemical cycling of NOx while ? 15 N of NO 2 tends to track with NOx sources with small but signi?cant isotope e?ects altering daytime ? 15 N(NO 2) by approximately 2 - 4...|$|R

The changes in PAN mixing ratios typically occurred over periods of several days to a week and showed a strong similarity to the variation in alkenes. The mixing ratio of PAN at Halley has a possible seasonal cycle with a winter maximum and summer minimum, though the cycle is incomplete and the data are very variable. Calculations indicate that gross local PAN production is approximately 1 pptv d&minus; 1 in spring and 0. 6 pptv d&minus; 1 in summer.

40|$|Extensive {{chemical}} characterization of ozone (O 3) depletion {{events in the}} Arctic boundary layer during the TOPSE aircraft mission in March–May 2000 enables analysis of the coupled chemical evolution of bromine (BrOx), chlorine (ClOx), hydrogen oxide (HOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) radicals during these events. We project the TOPSE observations onto an O 3 chemical coordinate to construct a chronology of radical chemistry during O 3 depletion events, and we compare this chronology to results from a photochemical model simulation. Comparison of observed trends in ethyne (oxidized by Br) and ethane (oxidized by Cl) indicates that ClOxchemistry is only active during the early stage of O 3 depletion (O 3 3 ̆e 10 ppbv). We attribute this result to the suppression of BrCl regeneration as O 3 decreases. Formaldehyde and peroxy radical concentrations decline by factors of 4 and 2 respectively during O 3 depletion and we explain both trends {{on the basis of}} the reaction of CH 2 O with Br. Observed NOx concentrations decline abruptly in the early stages of O 3 depletion and recover as O 3 drops below 10 ppbv. We attribute the initial decline to BrNO 3 hydrolysis in aerosol, and the subsequent recovery to suppression of BrNO 3 formation as O 3 drops. Under halogen-free conditions we find that HNO 4 heterogeneous chemistry could provide a major <b>NOx</b> <b>sink</b> not included in standard models. Halogen radical chemistry in the model can produce under realistic conditions an oscillatory system with a period of 3 days, which we believe is the fastest oscillation ever reported for a chemical system in the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of NO-NO 2 -O- 3 {{trace gas}} {{exchange}} were performed for two transition season periods during the La Nina a year 1999 (30 April to 17 May, "wet-dry," and 24 September to 27 October, "dry-wet") over a cattle pasture in Rondonia. A dynamic chamber system (applied during the dry-wet season) {{was used to}} directly measure emission fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and surface resistances for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O- 3) deposition. A companion study was simultaneously performed in an old-growth forest. In order to determine ecosystem-representative NO 2 and O- 3 deposition fluxes for both measurement periods, an inferential method (multiresistance model) was applied to measure ambient NO 2 and O- 3 concentrations using observed quantities of turbulent transport. Supplementary measurements included soil NO diffusivity and soil nutrient analysis. The observed NO soil emission fluxes were nine times lower than old-growth rain forest emissions under similar soil moisture and temperature conditions and were attributed to {{the combination of a}} reduced soil N cycle and lower effective soil NO diffusion at the pasture. Canopy resistances (R-c) of both gases controlled the deposition processes during the day for both measurement periods. Day and night NO 2 canopy resistances were significantly similar (alpha = 0. 05) during the dry-wet period. Ozone canopy resistances revealed significantly higher daytime resistances of 106 s m(- 1) versus 65 s m(- 1) at night because of plant, soil, and wet skin uptake processes, enhanced by stomatal activity at night and aqueous phase chemistry on vegetative and soil surfaces. The surface of the pasture was a net <b>NOx</b> <b>sink</b> during 1999, removing seven times more NO 2 from the atmosphere than was emitted as NO...|$|E
40|$|Formation {{of organic}} nitrates (RONO 2) during {{oxidation}} of biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} (BVOCs: isoprene, monoterpenes) is a significant loss pathway for atmospheric nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx), but the chemistry of RONO 2 formation and degradation remains uncertain. Here we implement a new BVOC oxidation mechanism (including updated isoprene chemistry, new monoterpene chemistry, and particle uptake of RONO 2) in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model with [*]∼[*]  25  [*]x[*]  25  km 2 resolution over North America. We evaluate the model using aircraft (SEAC 4 RS) and ground-based (SOAS) observations of NOx, BVOCs, and RONO 2 from the Southeast US in summer 2013. The updated simulation successfully reproduces the concentrations of individual gas- and particle-phase RONO 2 species measured during the campaigns. Gas-phase isoprene nitrates account for 25 - 50  % of observed RONO 2 in surface air, and we find that another 10  % is contributed by gas-phase monoterpene nitrates. Observations in the free troposphere show an important contribution from long-lived nitrates derived from anthropogenic VOCs. During both campaigns, at least 10  % of observed boundary layer RONO 2 were in the particle phase. We find that aerosol uptake followed by hydrolysis to HNO 3 accounts for 60  % of simulated gas-phase RONO 2 loss in the boundary layer. Other losses are 20  % by photolysis to recycle NOx and 15  % by dry deposition. RONO 2 production accounts for 20  % of the net regional <b>NOx</b> <b>sink</b> in the Southeast US in summer, limited by the spatial segregation between BVOC and NOx emissions. This segregation implies that RONO 2 production will remain a minor sink for NOx in the Southeast US in the future even as NOx emissions continue to decline...|$|E
