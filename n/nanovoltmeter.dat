40|$|Refractometry of air is {{a central}} problem for interferometer-based {{dimensional}} measurements. Refractometry at the 10 − 9 level is only valid if air temperature gradients are controlled at the millikelvin (mK) level. Very precise tests of second-generation National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) refractometers involve comparing two instruments (two optical cavities made from ultralow expansion glass) that are located in nominally the same environment; temperature gradients must be kept below a few millikelvin to achieve satisfactory precision of these tests. In this paper we describe a thermal stabilization scheme that maintains< 1 mK thermal gradients over 100 h in a 0. 5 m× 0. 15 m× 0. 15 m volume. Our approach uses passive (aluminum envelopes and foam insulation) and active (thermistors, foil heaters, and proportional–integral–derivative control) temperature stabilization. Thermal gradients are sensed with thermocouples and a <b>nanovoltmeter</b> and switch; the reference junctions of the thermocouples being in thermal contact with a thermistor temperature standard. Our < 1 mK gradient performance {{is limited by the}} accuracy of the <b>nanovoltmeter</b> and switch. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{thickness}} of the Pd thin films was determined with an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco D 3100). Micrographs of the samples were all taken with a field emission-environment scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI_XL 30 SFEG) operating at an accelerating voltage of 20  kV. Electrical measurements were performed on a standard electrical probe station (EB- 6). The direct current was applied with a source meter (Keithley 2400), and the output voltage of each sensor was measured with a <b>nanovoltmeter</b> (Keithley 2182 A), both controlled with a homemade computerized data acquisition system using Labview program. The output voltage for each sensor usually stabilized after 10 – 40  s, depending on its distance to the heating zone, and the average stabilized voltages corresponding to different heating powers were used as the experimental values.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{electrometer}} is {{a highly}} sensitive electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that the current flowing into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for <b>nanovoltmeters.</b> Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|R
50|$|A quality {{general-purpose}} electronics DMM {{is generally}} considered adequate for measurements at signal levels greater than one millivolt or one microampere, or below about 100 megohms; these values are far from the theoretical limits of sensitivity, and are of considerable interest in some circuit design situations. Other instruments—essentially similar, but with higher sensitivity—are used for accurate measurements of very small or very large quantities. These include <b>nanovoltmeters,</b> electrometers (for very low currents, and voltages with very high source resistance, such as one teraohm) and picoammeters. Accessories for more typical multimeters permit some of these measurements, as well. Such measurements are limited by available technology, and ultimately by inherent thermal noise.|$|R
40|$|A {{traceable}} to {{dc resistance}} and dc voltage National Standards measurement technique to calibrate dc current shunts and resistors {{in the range}} from 10 mu Omega to 10 m Omega has been developed at National Institute of Metrological Research (INRIM) in addition to the primary reference system for low value resistors calibration. This technique is applicable in secondary and industrial metrological laboratories. It is based on a volt-amperometric method, to compare an unknown shunt with a standard one in 1 : 1 or 1 : 10 ratios. In the setup are involved: a dc current calibrator and a current generator to supply currents respectively up to 100 A and up to 1200 A, with a switch to reverse the current, two 7 1 / 2 digit <b>nanovoltmeters</b> (nVs) for the acquisition of the voltage on the standard and under calibration shunts and two Tinsley 100 mu Omega and 1 m Omega standard shunts kept in mineral oil and with a cooling system. An optional variation in the procedure that can reduce the measurement uncertainties is discussed. The 2 sigma relative capabilities of the technique span from 6. 0 x 10 (- 6) to 4. 6 x 10 (- 4). Compatibility results with the INRIM reference measurement system for low value resistors calibration are also given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The HIEB {{experiments}} in TEM {{were carried out}} on a 200 -kV Jeol 2010 F field-emission TEM. The e-beam current {{was measured to be}} ~[*] 5  nA with a Faraday cup. At the e-beam diameter of 0.5 – 1.0  nm, a nominal current density of (0.6 – 2.5) ×  106  A/cm 2 was yielded on the specimen. TEM specimens were prepared on lacey carbon grids from suspensions of the NWs in ethanol. The procedures employed for the patterning and welding of NWs followed the description in ref. [9]. SEM experiments were performed in an EBW- 3 H vacuum electron-beam welder and a field emission SEM (FEI QUANTA 600 F). Complicated wiring and connection between the device in the SEM vacuum chamber and measurement instruments outside vacuum chamber were specially designed and realized. Weak voltage signal outputs of the TFTC under irradiation of the e-beam of SEM at different spot size (from 1 to 7, a.u.) and accelerating voltage (from 2 to 30  keV) were measured with a homemade multiplexer and a Keithley 2182 A <b>nanovoltmeter</b> [39].|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of resistance measurement techniques {{is very important}} for characterization of future nanoelectronics. Pulsed IV measurement techniques are very useful for accurate resistance measurements on nanoscale samples because of the efficient removal of e. g. EMF errors. In the project we have designed a pulsed IV-setup based on a state-of-the art current source (6221) and <b>nanovoltmeter</b> (2182 A) from Keithley, and used the setup for resistance measurements on ferromagnetic samples. Two different samples were investigated using the pulsed IV system – ferromagnetic wires with a central nanoconstriction and amorphous microwires. We have tested the pulse delta system with different pulse widths, duty cycles and voltage levels. The results show a successful integration of the setup. From the measurement results we confirm that the pulse delta system provides accurate measurements with a low noise of about 0. 02 Ω. The resistance of the samples increases approximately quadratically with bias which is interpreted as a heating effect due to the very high current density of about 107 A∙cm- 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{conductivity}} {{of liquid}} sodium in a 0. 15 m diameter spherical flask is measured directly using a precision current source and a <b>nanovoltmeter,</b> and indirectly using skin depth analysis. Direct resistance measurements are accurate to 1 μΩ. Averaging techniques help minimize {{the effects of}} DC offset, and contact voltage effects have been eliminated by using oxygen-free high conductivity copper for all metal contact points. Measurements of the conductivity are repeated at different fluid velocities, all at low magnetic Reynold's numbers (0 ≤ R ≤ 10), with {{the hypothesis that the}} conductivity of the sodium will decrease as the fluid velocity is increased. These measurements, when incorporated into mean-field electrodynamic dynamo theory, yield information about the β-coefficient of our system; β is a correction factor due to turbulence for the EMF in mean-field theory. Data from direct measurement reveals a small but positive β, effecting a decrease in the conductivity of sodium of a few percent. Data from the skin depth measurements confirm the trend of a decrease of conductivity at increasing magnetic Reynold's numbers. but are not statistically significant on their own...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE Studies on the {{regulation}} of human blood flow revealed several modes of oscillations with frequencies ranging from 0. 005 to 1 Hz. Several mechanisms were proposed that might influence these oscillations, such as the activity of vascular endothelium, the neurogenic activity of vessel wall, the intrinsic activity of vascular smooth muscle, respiration, and heartbeat. These studies relied typically on non-invasive techniques, for example, laser Doppler flowmetry. Oscillations of biochemical markers were rarely coupled to blood flow. METHODS The redox potential difference between the artery and the vein was measured by platinum electrodes placed in the parallel homonymous femoral artery and the femoral vein of ventilated anesthetized pigs. RESULTS Continuous measurement at 5 Hz sampling rate using a digital <b>nanovoltmeter</b> revealed fluctuating signals with three basic modes of oscillations: ∼ 1, ∼ 0. 1 and ∼ 0. 01 Hz. These signals clearly overlap with reported modes of oscillations in blood flow, suggesting coupling of the redox potential and blood flow. DISCUSSION The amplitude of the oscillations associated with heart action was significantly smaller than for the other two modes, {{despite the fact that}} heart action has the greatest influence on blood flow. This finding suggests that redox potential in blood might be not a derivative but either a mediator or an effector of the blood flow control system...|$|E
30|$|Our TiSi NWs were {{synthesized}} via a low-pressure chemical vapor {{deposition process}} using TiCl 4 and titanium powder as precursors; no templates or catalysts were needed [5]. The growth mechanism and detailed structure and composition characterizations by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and other techniques have been reported by Lin et al. in [5]. Since these NWs can be readily coated by a thick (approximately 10 nm) oxide layer over the surfaces [5, 13], we choose the ‘invasive’ focused-ion-beam-induced deposition (FIBID) technique to fabricate the electrical contacts onto individual NWs. It should be stressed {{that the existence of}} the thick oxide layers prevented us from making good ohmic contacts when employing the electron-beam lithographic technique. After transferring the NWs onto the silicon substrate capped with a ≈ 500 -nm thick SiO 2 layer, the positions of individual NWs were first located by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) capability of the FIB system (Model FEI Nova 200, FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA). Platinum electrodes were then deposited onto the NWs using a 30 -KeV, 10 -pA Ga+ FIB. The Pt leads connected the individual NWs to the microelectrodes which were photolithographically pre-patterned on the SiO 2 /Si substrate. The substrate was thermally anchored to the sample holder mounted with a calibrated silicon diode thermometer on a standard 4 He cryostat. A standard four-probe current-reversal method was applied for resistance measurements using a Keithley K- 220 current source and a K- 182 <b>nanovoltmeter</b> (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA).|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the electrical characteristics of technical HTS tapes are of the key importance in determining the design and operational features of superconducting power apparatuses {{as well as to}} understand the external factors which affect the superconducting performance. In this work we report the systematic measurements of the electric field versus current density, E-J relation of short samples for three commercial HTS tapes (BSCCO- 2223 tapes, with and without steel reinforcement, and YBCO-coated conductor) at 77 K. In order to get sensitive and noiseless voltage signals the measurements were carried out with DC transport current and subjecting the broad surface tape to DC (0 - 300 mT) and AC (0 - 62 mT, 60 Hz) magnetic fields. The voltage is measured by a sensitive <b>nanovoltmeter</b> and the applied magnetic field is monitored by a Hall sensor placed on the tape broad surface. The comparison between the results obtained from the three tapes was done by fitting a power-law equation for currents {{in the vicinity of the}} critical current. For the current regime below the critical one a linear correlation of the electric field against the current density is observed. The BSCCO samples presented the same behavior, i. e., a decreasing of n-index with the increasing DC and AC magnetic field strength. Under AC field the decreasing slope of n-index is steeper as compared to DC field. The n-index curve for the YBCO tape showed similar behavior for AC field, however under DC field in the 0 - 390 mT range exhibited a slight decreasing of the n-index. CPFLFAPESPCNPq/PIBI...|$|E
30|$|The PVD {{growth was}} carried out in a Nabertherm B 180 {{horizontal}} tube furnace (Lilienthal, Germany) under constant nitrogen flow of 300 sccm at atmospheric pressure using Bi 2 Te 3 powder as a precursor. The furnace was flushed with nitrogen several times after loading Si(100) substrates (downstream) and the Bi 2 Te 3 precursor (upstream) into quartz boats. Then, the oven was ramped to the growth temperature of 600 °C and held constant for a growth time of typically 1 h. The samples were removed after the furnace cooled down to room temperature and subsequently analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Individual belts were placed on a silicon wafer with 300 nm of SiO 2 field oxide by a mechanical transfer method that provides sub-micrometer precision [20]. Four-point contacts were made by standard laser photolithography (using AZ 3007 photoresist). After writing the pattern, the sample was H 2 -plasma cleaned at 100 W for 90 s. A 50 nm layer of Au was sputter-deposited and subsequently lifted off. The devices were glued into chip carriers using silver paint and wire bonded using Al wires. Temperature-dependent resistance curves R(T) were measured by current-voltage sweeps in four-point configuration (using a Keithley 6221 current source and 2182 A <b>nanovoltmeter).</b> The samples were kept in a He atmosphere at ambient pressure. Subsequent to the transport measurements, cross sections were obtained using a Nova 600 NanoLab (FEI). First, the belt is covered with a platinum layer deposited at an electron voltage of 5 kV and a beam current of 0.4 nA. The platinum layer serves as protection layer and as thermal bridge to sink the heat during the focused ion beam etching. A gallium ion current of 50 pA is used at a voltage of 10 kV for etching.|$|E
40|$|Vortex {{structures}} in confined geometries are currently under close scrutiny {{due to their}} unique properties associated with their spatial confinement and the non-uniform distribution of the magnetization. The magnetic vortex is characterized by two boolean topological quantities: circulation (clockwise or counterclockwise c = ± 1) of the in-plane magnetization and polarity (up or down, p = ± 1) of the vortex core. These four degenerate states are quite stable and can accelerate {{the development of more}} compact and high performance magnetic memory devices. Thus an understanding of their dynamical behavior and a way to electrically detect these states is a major requirement for their development. Progress can be achieved by combining theoretical calculations, micromagnetic simulations and experimental approaches. The phenomenon of spin transfer torque is exploited to excite the lowest frequency (gyro) mode of the vortex core confined in a submicron magnetic (Permalloy - Ni 81 Fe 19) element. The gyrotropic motion of the vortex core leads to a periodic change in the magnetization and hence its resistance: due to the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect. This periodic change in resistance combines with the excitation current and generates a periodic homodyne voltage signal. An external static magnetic field is applied to break the symmetry and to rectify the homodyne voltage signal which we measure in a <b>nanovoltmeter.</b> It is found that the sign of the rectified AMR signal depends upon the handedness (cp) of the vortex structure. Micromagnetic simulations provide better understanding and are in good agreement with our experimental results. Additionally, vortex dynamics in these samples is investigated in a Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM) with a temporal (< 100 ps) and spatial (30 nm) resolution which allows us to verify the resonance frequency of the magnetic element as well as the power range to excite the vortex core. The AMR based technique thus can be used to detect the circulation and the polarity of the vortex state electrically and could open a route to implement magnetic vortex elements in memory and storage hierarchies. The phenomenon of Spin Motive Force (SMF) has also been studied by micromagnetic simulations. It is found that, in a particular configuration, the SMF signal shows a phase difference of 180 degrees for two polarities of the vortex core, when the voltage probe contacts are located parallel to the excitation rf field direction. No phase shift is observed in the perpendicular case. In addition, a 180 degree phase difference is observed for different circulations of the vortex structure. Therefore, this could also be a possible way to determine polarity and circulation of the magnetic vortex by carefully examining the phase relation of the SMF generated voltage signals. An attempt has also been made to measure the SMF experimentally. However, due to the small expected signal unambiguous detection of SMF was not successful so far...|$|E
