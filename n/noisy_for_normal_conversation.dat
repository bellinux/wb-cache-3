50|$|After {{these two}} meetings, Zündel wants to fulfil {{the main goal}} of his voyage: Getting an illegal handgun. This plan shipwrecks, too. Because of his naivety and gentleman's style, Zündel is frauded. Afterwards, he travels home. Extremely confused, undernutrited and now heavily {{addicted}} to alcohol, he enters the flat, where the distressed Magda has expected his return <b>for</b> days. A <b>normal</b> <b>conversation,</b> that would clear these misunderstandings (e.g. the not existing lover), isn't possible, because Zündel now is mentally ill.|$|R
40|$|The {{language}} of crosswords {{is intended to}} trick readers to some degree while still eventually leading them to the correct answer. While crosswords are governed by fairly strict rules dictating word length, grid structure, and clue content, clues are often purposefully ambiguous and provide a level of context that would be insufficient <b>for</b> <b>normal</b> <b>conversation.</b> In many newspapers, including the New York Times, daily puzzles become more difficult as the week progresses. For a puzzle later in the week, the creator may assume that solvers are seasoned enough to know the basic crossword patterns and can begin to play with conventions. This thesis explores how the methods by which crossword creators write difficult clues mirror the Gricean maxims. It breaks down crossword entries into several difficulty factors: requirement of cultural knowledge, obscurity, ambiguity, underspecificity, and trickiness. Each of these factors is explored at length and then analyzed quantitatively using a large data set of entries from New York Times crosswords. My findings indicate {{that many of these}} factors are interrelated. The distinction between puzzles at each day of the week is more nuanced than some abstract, monotonically increasing "difficulty" function. Some of the factors tum out to not be highly correlated to difficulty at all. In some cases, clues later in the week appear to favor entertainment value over sheer difficulty level. Additionally, I show how pragmatic theories can be applied to a highly restricted and unnatural form of communication. My work extends similar research into the use of Gricean maxims in jokes and advertisements. This thesis combines natural language processing approaches on a full corpus with detailed manual analysis, demonstrating that computational methods can be used to address an area such as pragmatics...|$|R

40|$|Communication is {{critical}} <b>for</b> <b>normal,</b> everyday life. During a conversation, information is conveyed {{in a number}} of ways, including through body, head, and facial changes. While much research has examined these latter forms of communication, the majority of it has focused on static representations of a few, supposedly universal expressions. <b>Normal</b> <b>conversations,</b> however, contain a very wide variety of expressions and are rarely, if ever, static. Here, we report several experiments that show that expressions that use head, eye, and internal facial motion are recognized more easily and accurately than static versions of those expressions. Moreover, we demonstrate conclusively that this dynamic advantage is due to information that is only available over time, and that the temporal integration window for this information is at least 100 ms long...|$|R
