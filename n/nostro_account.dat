25|$|The {{central bank}} {{maintains}} loro {{accounts for a}} group of commercial banks, the so-called direct payment banks. A balance on such a loro account (it is a <b>nostro</b> <b>account</b> {{in the view of the}} commercial bank) represents central bank money in the regarded currency.|$|E

50|$|The {{central bank}} CB(Ccy) of a {{currency}} can maintain a loro {{account for a}} bank (which the bank would call a <b>nostro</b> <b>account).</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1992 - Central Bank grants more {{licences}} for broader activities. Alfa Bank opens first <b>nostro</b> <b>accounts</b> in six foreign banks. First retail branch {{opens in}} Moscow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nostro</b> <b>accounts</b> {{are mostly}} {{commonly}} used for currency settlement, where a bank or other financial institution needs to hold balances in a currency other than its home accounting unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{controlling}} shareholder {{of the bank}} is SCM Finance (92.24% of shares), which is 100% owned by SCM Group. FUIB holds <b>nostro</b> <b>accounts</b> with 37 banks, while 61 banks hold vostro accounts with FUIB.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>nostro</b> <b>account</b> will be {{in foreign}} {{currency}} (it is a record of funds held by a bank in another country in the currency of that country) i.e. a bank in country A keeping a record of money held by a bank in country B, in the currency of country B.|$|E
50|$|A bank counts a <b>nostro</b> <b>account</b> with a {{debit balance}} as a cash asset in its balance sheet. Conversely, a vostro account {{with a credit}} balance (i.e. a deposit) is a liability, and a vostro with a debit balance (a loan) is an asset. Thus in many banks a credit entry on an account ("CR") is {{regarded}} as negative movement, and a debit ("DR") is positive - the reverse of usual commercial accounting conventions.|$|E
50|$|A {{vostro account}} {{is the same}} as any other bank account. It is a record of money held by a bank or owed to a bank by a third party (an {{individual}}, company or bank). The <b>nostro</b> <b>account</b> is a way of the bank whose money it is, keeping track of how much is being held by the other bank. It is similar to an individual keeping a detailed record of every payment {{in and out of his}} or her bank account so that she/he knows the balance at any point in time.|$|E
50|$|A {{correspondent}} account is an account (often called a <b>nostro</b> or vostro <b>account)</b> established by a banking institution to receive deposits from, make payments on behalf of, or handle other financial transactions for another financial institution. Correspondent accounts are established through bilateral agreements {{between the two}} banks.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computerised}} <b>accounting,</b> <b>nostros</b> and vostros just need to have opposite signs within any one bank's accounting system; that is, if a nostro in credit has a positive sign, then a vostro in credit must have a negative sign. This allows for a reconciliation by summing all accounts to zero (a trial balance) - the basic premise of double-entry bookkeeping.|$|R
5000|$|For example: First National Bank of A {{does some}} {{transactions}} (loans, foreign exchange, etc.) in USD, but banks in A will only handle payments in AUD. So FNB of A opens a USD account at foreign bank Credit Mutuel de B, and instructs all counter-parties to settle transactions in USD at [...] "account no. 123456 {{in name of}} FNBA, at CMB, X Branch". FNBA maintains its own records of that account, for reconciliation; this is its <b>nostro</b> <b>account.</b> CMB's record of the same account is the vostro account.|$|E
50|$|The {{central bank}} {{maintains}} loro {{accounts for a}} group of commercial banks, the so-called direct payment banks. A balance on such a loro account (it is a <b>nostro</b> <b>account</b> {{in the view of the}} commercial bank) represents central bank money in the regarded currency.Since central bank money currently exists mainly in the form of electronic records (electronic money) rather than in the form of paper or coins (physical money), open market operations can be conducted by simply increasing or decreasing (crediting or debiting) the amount of electronic money that a bank has in its reserve account at the central bank. This does not require the creation of new physical currency, unless a direct payment bank demands to exchange a part of its electronic money against banknotes or coins.|$|E
