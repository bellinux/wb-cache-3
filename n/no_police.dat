5|$|<b>No</b> <b>police</b> {{officers}} in the U.S. went out on strike until July 1974, when some Baltimore police, estimated at 15% to 50% of the force, refused to report for work for several days as a demonstration of support for other striking municipal unions.|$|E
5|$|Protesters were {{described}} by reporters as more confident and even celebratory as {{they felt they}} were nearing their objective—the end of Mubarak's regime—although they had no tangible evidence of this. An eyewitness told Al Jazeera that {{people of all ages}} and both genders were present. Demonstrators violated the curfew and no one attempted to stop them. Looting was also reported, while <b>no</b> <b>police</b> were visible.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{thousands}} of protesters continued {{to defy the}} curfew and, as the night progressed, troops and armoured vehicles deployed across Cairo to guard key places such as train stations, major government buildings and banks. The army had insufficient capacity to patrol neighbourhoods, so residents set up armed vigilante groups to drive off looters and robbers. A heavy army presence (though <b>no</b> <b>police)</b> was reported in Suez. Chaos was rampant in Suez during the night, but as day broke the streets remained relatively quiet. As in Cairo, many residents formed vigilante groups to protect their homes and businesses {{in the absence of}} police. The military set up numerous checkpoints throughout the city. An estimation of about 30 bodies including the bodies of two children were taken to El Demerdash Hospital in central Cairo.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Aztecs and the Inca, the Maya {{political}} system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area {{into a single}} state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships {{with each other and}} were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, Caracol, Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC. During the Late Preclassic, the Maya {{political system}} coalesced into a theopolitical form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion. The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with <b>no</b> <b>police</b> force or standing army. Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives. Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have {{played a key role in}} managing resources and internal conflict.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{good record}} in migrant integration, {{historical}} parallels can be drawn with Portugal's colonial past and modern police racism. According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001, however, <b>no</b> <b>police</b> officer has been {{held responsible for the}} deaths.|$|E
5000|$|Members of a regiment's Provost Section can be {{identified}} by the brassards they wear, which carry the letters [...] "RP". Unlike Service <b>Police,</b> RPs carry <b>no</b> warrant card and have no powers of arrest greater than those of citizen's arrest. They are not police officers and serve <b>no</b> <b>policing</b> function.|$|R

25|$|Some {{fighting}} {{continued as}} far away as Pearl and Chatham Streets, in the northern half of Park Row, but <b>no</b> <b>police</b> were dispatched. With {{the exception of a few}} nearby Metropolitan patrolmen, who were seriously injured, each police faction claimed the responsibility lay with the other. Police inactivity caused the situation to escalate in the next few hours.|$|E
25|$|Such {{events were}} now officially sanctioned {{and no longer}} {{discouraged}} by their managements. <b>No</b> <b>police</b> raids at these establishments took place. With these weekly gatherings for energetic dancing to let off steam and meet new friends, homosexuals felt the first bonds of a relatively cohesive community- a warm feeling of being welcomed into a new brotherhood, in contradistinction to erstwhile isolation, alienation and loneliness for many.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} was not recorded as officers were not wearing police bodycams; initially police reported they were unsure {{if that was}} the case, as their bodycam program had recently begun. However, portions of the standoff were recorded by Gaines and posted to social media. Police later stated that while there is <b>no</b> <b>police</b> footage of inside the apartment, some officers assigned to support roles outside were wearing body cameras.|$|E

5000|$|The {{historian}} Stephen Inwood {{describes the}} 4,000 parish constables existing {{in the early}} 19th century as [...] "of variable quality and commitment"; some London parishes, such as Kensington, Fulham and Deptford (with over 55,000 inhabitants between {{them at the time}} of the 1821 census) had <b>no</b> <b>policing</b> at all, and the quality of policing was generally considered inadequate by this period.|$|R
25|$|In 1961 the ACMHR helped {{organize}} the Alabama leg of that summer's Freedom Rides, sponsored by the Congress for Racial Equality. The demonstrations ended with marked violence as one bus was firebombed in Anniston and another was met by an organized mob at the Birmingham Trailways Station with <b>no</b> <b>police</b> in sight. ACMHR volunteers took injured riders {{to the hospital and}} kept them in their homes until rides could be secured to safety.|$|E
25|$|A common {{informer}} was {{a person}} who provided evidence on criminal trials or prosecuted for breaches of Irish penal laws solely for the purpose of being rewarded with the penalty recovered, or a share of it. In medieval England, there was <b>no</b> <b>police</b> force and the state bureaucracy was insufficiently well developed to be able to ensure obedience to new laws. The practice of allowing the public to sue for penalties was successful and soon became widespread.|$|E
25|$|On November 3, student Jonathan Butler {{launched}} a hunger strike, vowing {{not to eat}} until the president resigned. One of Butler's stated reasons for this was that Wolfe's car had hit him during a protest against Wolfe at the school's homecoming parade. As students confronted the president by linking {{arms in front of}} his vehicle, video showed Butler advancing towards the vehicle and making minimal contact. <b>No</b> <b>police</b> charges were filed in connection to the incident.|$|E
50|$|Reaching a 9-1-1 {{dispatcher}} {{does not}} guarantee that emergency services will {{actually be able to}} respond to the call, as they are funded and operated separately. One egregious example occurred during a budget crunch in Josephine County, Oregon in 2013, when <b>no</b> county <b>police</b> were on duty and <b>no</b> state <b>police</b> were available to respond to a female caller whose abusive ex-boyfriend {{was in the process of}} breaking into her apartment. After the caller spent ten minutes on the phone with the dispatcher, the ex-boyfriend succeeded in breaking in and raping her.|$|R

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 17, 1974, elements of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a group of heavily armed left-wing guerrillas, barricaded themselves in a residence on East 54th Street at Compton Avenue in Los Angeles. Coverage of the siege was broadcast to millions via television and radio and featured in the world press for days afterwards. SWAT teams engaged in a several hour gun battle with the SLA; <b>no</b> <b>police</b> were wounded, but the six SLA members died in the conflict, which ended when the house caught fire and burned to the ground.|$|E
25|$|UNRWA {{provides}} {{facilities in}} 59 recognized {{refugee camps in}} Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, and in other areas where large numbers of registered Palestine refugees live outside of recognized camps. For a camp to be recognized by UNRWA, {{there must be an}} agreement between the host government and UNRWA governing use of the camp. UNRWA does not itself run camps, has <b>no</b> <b>police</b> powers or administrative role, but simply provides services in the camp. Refugee camps, which developed from tent cities to dense urban dwellings similar to their urban surroundings, house around one third of all registered Palestine refugees.|$|E
25|$|The Yukon Field Force {{was created}} in {{response}} to the discovery of gold in the Canadian far north in the final years of the 19th century. There was no government presence in the Yukon in the late 19th century and the region was sparsely populated by First Nations and European prospectors. The borders in south-east Alaska had been disputed between the United States, Canada and Britain since the United States' purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. There were <b>no</b> <b>police</b> in the region, and the Permanent Force of the Canadian Militia was only around 800 strong across the whole of the country, with the nearest garrison in Winnipeg, Manitoba.|$|E

25|$|From its {{foundation}} in the 13th century Sligo was administered under local Fénechus (Brehon law) until {{the establishment of}} English Common law in the early 17th century after the battle of Kinsale. Courts were held regularly throughout the tuath at various buildings and on hilltops reserved for the purpose. Law enforcement was {{a function of the}} nobility and freemen of the area as <b>no</b> <b>police</b> force existed. No records survive from these early courts, but a case is recorded of a Dublin merchant being reimbursed by the local courts after he was fraudulently sold an out of date poem in the 1540s. Sligo then came under English martial law and eventually the common law as administered from Dublin and from which descends the present system.|$|E
25|$|The {{police were}} {{informed}} of the hijacking at 16:55 and immediately scrambled troops to Bulltofta {{to deal with the}} situation. Organised by the police superintendent on duty in Malmö, a low-profile police action was ordered, where <b>no</b> <b>police</b> officer should attempt any offensive action without prior orders. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer was alerted at 18:20. He was vacationing at his cabin in Ystad Municipality, located only kilometers from the airport, and was able to quickly arrive at the scene. Once briefed, he called a cabinet conference by alerting Prime Minister Olof Palme. Meanwhile, the National Police Board dispatched several of its members to the airport. Its leader, Carl Persson, joined the crisis cabinet. They decided to avoid the use of force and instead attempt to tire out the hijackers through extending negotiations.|$|E
25|$|In August 1988, a riot {{erupted in}} the park when police {{attempted}} to clear the park of homeless people; 38 people were injured. Bystanders as well as homeless people and political activists {{got caught up in}} the police action that took place on the night of August 6 and the early morning of August 7, after a large number of police surrounded the park and charged at the hemmed-in crowd while other police ordered all pedestrians not to walk on streets neighboring the park. Much of the violence was videotaped and clips were shown on local TV news reports (notably including one by a man who sat on his stoop across the street from the park and continued to film while a police officer beat him up), but ultimately, although at least one case went to trial, <b>no</b> <b>police</b> officers were found culpable. A punk rock festival has been held in the park in the years since, in commemoration of the event.|$|E
