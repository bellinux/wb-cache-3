5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E
5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> on her life.|$|E

5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a <b>new</b> <b>perspective,</b> based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|In remaking {{the film}} from a <b>new</b> <b>perspective,</b> Farhan Akhtar {{wanted to give}} a {{contemporary}} style and treatment to the original film and make a film that he believed would be perfectly suited to modern times. The director later bought the rights and conceived his adaptation as an homage to the original film and its cast and crew, and to the 1970s era in general. He co-wrote the screenplay with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original script with Salim Khan. He kept the basic plot but introduced some changes that included an international setting and a different ending. Principal photography commenced in Mumbai, before moving to Malaysia, where 80% of the filming was done. The soundtrack was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E
5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a <b>new</b> <b>perspective,</b> such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E

5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who introduced a <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance {{over the past}} 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, {{as well as the}} results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation {{and the rise of the}} germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E
