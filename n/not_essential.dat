5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is <b>not</b> <b>essential.</b>|$|E

A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> for its generation or expression.|$|E

Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures {{to increase the number}} of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.|$|E

Sodium and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are <b>not</b> <b>essential,</b> they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.|$|E
5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E

5|$|At 12:00, Dornal de Guy on Manche {{pulled away}} from her {{battered}} opponent, obeying Hamelin's order to join with his flagship. Hamelin then sent Manche and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom, using Vénus to chase Windham. Stewart had used the break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> stores overboard {{in an effort to}} make his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> {{for humans}} or other mammals; small amounts may be {{beneficial}} for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{understood}} how the activated RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs within the cell. Although the cleavage {{process has been}} proposed {{to be linked to}} translation, translation of the mRNA target is <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> for RNAi-mediated degradation. Indeed, RNAi may be more effective against mRNA targets that are not translated. Argonaute proteins are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called P-bodies (also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies), which are regions with high rates of mRNA decay; miRNA activity is also clustered in P-bodies. Disruption of P-bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference, suggesting that they are a critical site in the RNAi process.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium has no {{biological}} role as well, but it {{is found}} even in the highest known organism, the humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not. Lanthanum is <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> for humans and has a low to moderate level of toxicity. However, it is essential for the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the general similarity of the rare earths means that it may be substituted by some of the other early lanthanides with no ill effects.|$|E

5|$|Many camouflaged textile {{patterns}} {{have been}} developed to suit the need to match combat clothing to different kinds of terrain (such as woodland, snow, and desert). The design of a pattern effective in all terrains has proved elusive. The American Universal Camouflage Pattern of 2004 attempted to suit all environments, but was withdrawn after a few years of service. Terrain-specific patterns have sometimes been developed but are ineffective in other terrains. The problem of making a pattern that works at different ranges has been solved with pixellated shapes, often designed digitally, that provide a fractal-like range of patch sizes so they appear disruptively coloured both at close range and at a distance. The first genuinely digital camouflage pattern was the Canadian CADPAT, issued to the army in 2002, soon followed by the American MARPAT. A pixellated appearance is <b>not</b> <b>essential</b> for this effect, though it is simpler to design and to print.|$|E
5|$|Only recently, the {{assembly}} {{process of the}} 19S regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent. The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents, the base and the lid. Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals). These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA-ATPase subunits and their main function {{seems to be to}} ensure proper assembly of the heterohexameric AAA-ATPase ring. To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately, whether {{the assembly}} is templated by the 20S core particle, or whether alternative assembly pathways exist. In addition to the four assembly chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base assembly, but it is <b>not</b> <b>essential.</b> The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones.|$|E
