5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through this soft-soil burial ground (it was skirted using the <b>New</b> <b>Austrian</b> <b>Tunnelling</b> <b>method),</b> and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} opened, {{traffic on the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was light. By the 1970s, traffic along the roadway would {{increase}} with {{the completion of the}} connecting I-80 and the rising popularity of the Poconos as a vacation destination. As a result, the two-lane Lehigh Tunnel faced serious congestion. Plans were made to either bypass the tunnel or add a second tube. The turnpike commission decided it would build a second tunnel as the cost was lower than building a bypass. In 1988, a $37 million contract was awarded to build the second tube. Groundbreaking for the tunnel took place on February 14, 1989, with Governor Robert P. Casey in attendance. Excavation of the new tunnel began in July of that year. Construction of the second tube utilized the <b>New</b> <b>Austrian</b> <b>Tunnelling</b> <b>method,</b> which reduced the cost of the tunnel by $5 to $6 million. It was the first tunnel in the United States to use this construction method. The second tube at Lehigh Tunnel opened on November 22, 1991, with Governor Casey in attendance leading a line of antique cars. Construction of the tunnel cost $45 million. The new tube is used for southbound traffic while the original tube carries northbound traffic. The newer tunnel is wider, higher, and brighter than the original.|$|E

2500|$|Precast {{segmental}} linings in {{the main}} TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key. On the French side, a [...] diameter [...] deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was [...] below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the <b>New</b> <b>Austrian</b> <b>Tunnelling</b> <b>method</b> (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff - same place as the marine tunnels - not from Folkestone. The platform {{at the base of}} the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary, which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the Foster Yeoman coastal super quarry at Glensanda in Loch Linnhe on the west coast of Scotland.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Austrian</b> {{tunneling}} method (NATM), {{also known}} as sequential excavation method (SEM), is a popular <b>method</b> of modern <b>tunnel</b> design and construction.

Finally, the key result of my thesis involves extending the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>method</b> to model fermion emission. The previous tunnelling calculations all involved the emission of scalar particles. I will model the emission of spin- 1 / 2 fermions from various spacetimes including the Rindler spacetime and general non-rotating black holes. I will also model the emission of charged spin- 1 / 2 fermions from the Kerr-Newman spacetime to show that the method is also applicable to rotating spacetimes. In all these cases I show that the correct Hawking temperature (Unruh temperature in the case of Rindler) is recovered for spin- 1 / 2 fermion emission. Although this final result is not surprising, it is an important result because it confirms that Dirac particles will radiate from the black hole at the same temperature as scalar particles. It has always been assumed that this is the case but there is very little literature involving fermion radiation of black holes. So the results of my calculations are twofold, I demonstrate that Dirac particles are emitted at the same temperature as scalar particles from a black hole and it shows how robust the semi-classical tunnelling technique is...|$|R
