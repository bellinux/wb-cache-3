To meet this challenge, the Biozentrum has established a number of so-called Technology Platforms. It has facilities for electron and light microscopy, cell imaging and <b>nanoanalytics,</b> proteomics, biophysics, FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting) and Research IT. A microarray and a quantitative genomics facility are being shared with other regional research institute ...|$|E
50|$|Henning Stahlberg studied {{physics at}} the TU (Technische Universität) Berlin and {{graduated}} with a doctorate from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) in 1997. He continued his research as a postdoctoral fellow at the Biozentrum, University of Basel for the following 6 years. From 2003 he joined the University of California in Davis as assistant professor, where {{he was promoted to}} tenured associate professor in 2007. Since 2009, Stahlberg is a Full Professor for Structural Biology at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, where he heads the Center for Cellular Imaging and <b>NanoAnalytics</b> (C-CINA).|$|E
30|$|The X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) investigations {{were performed}} by the institute <b>nanoAnalytics</b> GmbH in Muenster, Germany. The measurements were done using an ESCALAB 250 from Thermo VG Scientific with appropriate test panels on which the Pani–Ag complex had been deposited under standard conditions. The information depth is about 5 – 10 nm, the detection limit differs from element to element but is around 0.1 At%. Monochromatic Al Kα X-rays were used (15 kV, 150 W) and the spectra were measured using a pass energy of 80 eV for survey spectra and 30 eV for core level spectra. If necessary charge compensation was done using a Flood Gun (e- energy ∼ 6 eV/ 0.05 mA current).|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper [Nat. Photon. 5, 166 (2011) ], we {{reported on a}} planar dielectric antenna that achieved 96 % efficiency in collecting the photons emitted by a single molecule. In that work, the transition dipole moment of the molecule was set perpendicular to the antenna plane. Here, we present a theoretical extension of that scheme that reaches collection efficiencies beyond 99 % for emitters with arbitrarily oriented dipole moments. Our work opens important doors {{in a wide range}} of contexts including quantum optics, quantum metrology, <b>nanoanalytics,</b> and biophysics. In particular, we provide antenna parameters to realize ultrabright single-photon sources in high-index materials such as semiconductor quantum dots and color centers in diamond, as well as sensitive detection of single molecules in nanofluidic devices.

40|$|A novel type of {{ultra-high vacuum}} {{instrument}} for X-ray reflectometry and spectrometry-related techniques for <b>nanoanalytics</b> {{by means of}} synchrotron radiation (SR) has been constructed and commissioned at BESSY II. This versa-tile instrument {{was developed by the}} PTB, Germany’s national metrology institute, and includes a 9 -axis manipulator that allows for an independent alignment of the samples with respect to all degrees of freedom. In addition, it integrates a ro-tational and translational movement of several photodiodes as well as a translational movement of a beam-geometry-defining aperture system. Thus, the new instrument enables various analytical techniques based on energy dispersive X-ray detectors such as reference-free X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, total-reflection XRF, grazing-incidence XRF, in addition to optional X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR) measurements or polarization-dependent X-ray absorption fine structure analyses (XAFS). Samples having a size of up to (100 × 100) mm 2; can be analyzed with respect to their mass depo-sition, elemental, spatial or species composition. Surface contamination, nanolayer composition and thickness, depth pro-file of matrix elements or implants, nanoparticles or buried interfaces as well as molecular orientation of bonds can be accessed. Three technology transfer projects of adapted instruments have enhanced X-Ray Spectrometry (XRS) research activities within Europe at the synchrotron radiation facilities ELETTRA (IAEA) and SOLEIL (CEA/LNE-LNHB) {{as well as at the}} X-ray innovation laboratory BLiX (TU Berlin) where different laboratory sources are used. Here, smaller chamber requirements led PTB in cooperation with TU Berlin to develop a modified instrument equipped with a 7 -axis manipulator: reduced freedom in the choice of experimental geometry modifications (absence of out-of-SR-plane and reference-free XRS options) has been compensated by encoder-enhanced angular accuracy for GIXRF and XRR. © 2016 Author(s...|$|E
