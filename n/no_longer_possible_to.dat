5|$|The Angel of Death was co-developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital, {{as opposed}} to the other games in the Broken Sword series, which had Revolution as the sole game developer. Cecil {{believed}} that because of the requirement for ever larger development team sizes, it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> maintain a large team to write single, original titles. As a result, Revolution concentrated on design, while Sumo concentrated on production. The game uses Sumo's Emmersion engine. It is the first game ever to be amBX enabled.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been aquatic animals, and Kräusel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in the course of an article reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet. Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E

5|$|On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin cabled British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{to request}} that the 9th Division be {{returned}} to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage {{and the demands of}} the war in the Pacific, it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request {{on the grounds that the}} 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.|$|E
