5|$|Coach's (Nicholas Colasanto) daughter, Lisa, (Allyce Beasley) {{arrives with}} her fiancé, Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), a {{door-to-door}} salesman who {{turns out to}} be abrasive and insensitive. Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E
5|$|Yusef first appears when Afia {{introduces}} him to {{her boyfriend}} Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). Tamwar feels he is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Afia in Yusef's eyes as he is from a poor background, but Yusef says that does not matter and approves of Tamwar. After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door open. When Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17, and Yusef's family had poured oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing {{for them to be}} married.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E

5|$|Stacey {{explains}} to Dot that Bradley {{knew he was}} not Lily's father. Dot informs Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), who tells her he already knows. Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, he wonders if she has ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder. He tells her {{that she needs to}} keep the truth about Lily's father {{and the fact that she}} killed Peggy's husband Archie (Larry Lamb) several months previously to herself. Phil tries to convince various people to let him out as he is suffering withdrawal symptoms, but nobody will. Janine awakens in Richard's flat and gets dressed, though they did not have sex. She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Janine fears that she is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Ryan, but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria, leaving Lily in a bedroom upstairs. She is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, and is frightened to hear Phil making noises in the living room. Stacey tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she killed Archie.|$|E

25|$|Inspection of the {{finished}} screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with {{the expense of the}} method tailored to the requirements of the product application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a nut onto it (for male threads) or a bolt into it (for female threads). This is plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although it is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision methods are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Kharlamov {{successfully}} tried-out for CSKA Moscow {{when he was}} 12, {{and joined}} their sports school. He joined the senior team for the 1967–68 season, and made his debut with CSKA on October 22, 1967 against HC Sibir. However Anatoli Tarasov, {{the coach of the}} team, felt Kharlamov was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the team so after 15 matches with CSKA sent Kharlamov to join Zvezda Chebarkul, who played in the third division. He would lead the team in scoring with 34 goals in 32 games.|$|E
25|$|TEAM Linhas Aéreas Flight 6865 (TIM6865) was a short-haul {{domestic}} passenger service between Macaé and Rio de Janeiro that flew into a mountain on 31 March 2006.

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, Tony's wife Hannah arrives on his doorstep, with the {{disturbing}} news that her new lover, Neville Agard (Gordon Case), had been beating both her and their daughter Cassie. Tony is furious and promptly confronts Neville, returning later covered in blood. Despite their past problems, Tony and Hannah decide to give their marriage another chance and both she and Cassie come to live in Albert Square. Problems still persist, however, and Hannah regularly nags Tony and makes it clear to him that Walford is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her. Things reach a climax when Tony hits Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer) in February 1987 for making a pass at Hannah. Hannah is furious and can't condone his violent actions, despite willingly allowing him to assault her ex-lover months earlier. Hannah subsequently decides that the marriage is over and she leaves Walford {{to live with her}} sister.|$|E
25|$|Another pre-game storyline {{involved}} backup Steelers tight end/fullback Sean McHugh. McHugh, {{who spent}} {{the past three seasons}} with the Detroit Lions, made that team's 53-man roster {{at the end of the}} preseason, only to be released 24 hours later alongside linebacker Anthony Cannon in order for the Lions to make room for linebacker Ryan Nece and running back Marcus Thomas. The Steelers promptly signed McHugh after the team traded center Sean Mahan back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a draft pick before the start of the season. The subsequent media attention surrounding McHugh had to do with him being deemed <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Lions (a team that would finish 0–16, the NFL's first imperfect season since the expansion 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), but good enough for a Super Bowl team such as the Steelers and being a valuable blocker for Ben Roethlisberger and Willie Parker. McHugh himself had mixed feelings about the situation, feeling bad for his former Lions teammates, but also feeling it's a little payback for the Lions for releasing him in the first place. McHugh would play in the Super Bowl as a blocker, much like his regular season role.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season the Asia League {{increased}} the amount of games played to 36. High1 once again won the Korea Domestic Championship making it their third in a row. While they were enjoying success domestically, they were not able to continue their success of the previous season. High1 finished the season in fifth place with 46 points. They split their season series with Halla at three wins each. The team was backed to playing a mixed home schedule with the majority being played in Goyang. High1 played nine games in Goyang, seven games in Chuncheon and two games in Mokdong. The team also fared poorly in the points race. Alex Kim's league-leading goals from the previous year failed to make a repeat and while he still led the team, he finished in seventh place with 15 goals. Ryan Haruo Kuwabara was tied for ninth place with 25 assists. Kim led with 36 points but it was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a top-ten finish, he also led the team in plus-minus with a +12. With the top five teams moving on to the playoffs, High1 had to play a three-game series against the fourth-place Cranes. They were defeated in two games, making it {{three years in a row}} where they were swept out of the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|Warning-track {{power is}} a {{derogatory}} term for a batter {{who seems to have}} just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run.

500|$|Gloucestershire played 10 matches {{against the}} other {{first-class}} county clubs and ended {{with a record of}} 4 wins, 4 draws and 2 defeats.

500|$|As {{with most}} of the Beatles' post-Sgt. Pepper 1967 recordings, their {{contributions}} to Yellow Submarine have traditionally been held in low regard by the band's biographers.

Mark Hertsgaard considers that [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] was [...] "understandably … rejected as <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Sgt Pepper", while MacDonald views it as [...] "dismal" [...] and a [...] "self-indulgent dirge".|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his tenure}} at Northwestern, Parseghian grew {{frustrated}} by the school's limited financial resources, curbs on football scholarships and academic standards for athletes that were more stringent than at other Big Ten schools.
