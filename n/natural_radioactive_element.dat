Changing milk radioactivity can be done either by increasing <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> content, or through artificial diversifying and commercial display of the finite produce. Taking into account the above, we aim at contributing the database concerning the radioactive content of cow milk in the Banat area.

Relatively little is known about the influence and toxicity of Th in the environment. In the present study, the toxicity of Th to the green algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa) was evaluated by algal growth inhibition, biochemical assays and morphologic observations. In the cultural medium (OECD TG 201), Th(NO 3) 4 was transformed to amorphous precipitation of Th(OH) 4 due to hydrolysis. Th was toxic to C. pyrenoidosa, with a 96 h half maximum effective concentration (EC 50) of 10. 4 μM. Scanning electron microscopy shows that Th-containing aggregates were attached onto the surface of the algal cells, and transmission electron microscopy indicates the internalization of nano-sized Th precipitates and ultrastructural alterations of the algal cells. The heteroagglomeration between Th(OH) 4 precipitation and alga cells and enhanced oxidative stress might play important roles in the toxicity of Th. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the toxicity of Th to algae with its chemical species in the exposure medium.

40|$|Radon, the {{heaviest}} of the noble gases on {{the periodic table}} of elements, is a <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> {{that can be found}} on water, soils and rocks. The main goal of this work is to present an evaluation of radon concentration on samples of water, used for human consumption, collected on uranium-rich granitic rock areas. Once the geological features of the sampling region evidence the presence of this natural radionuclides, their slow dissolution steadily increases concentration in ground water. Although, the most important contribution of natural radiation, for most populations, is from inhaled radon (generic term used commonly to refer to the isotope 222 Rn), in some circumstances, exposure to natural radionuclides, through drinking water, could exceed acceptable levels, and also present a hazard. Despite the fact that radon can be reduced if the water is boiled, this gas, dissolved in ground water, can be released into the air during household activities such as showering, dishwashing and laundry. So, the short lived radon decay products will contribute {{to increase the number of}} those which are present in particles suspended in the indoor air and can be accumulated up to dangerous concentrations. Once the radon progeny emits highly ionizing alpha-radiation, they may cause substantial health damage after long-term exposure. Radon concentration measurements were performed on thirty three samples collected from water wells at different depths and types of aquifers, at Covilhã's County, Portugal with the radon gas analyser DURRIDGE RAD 7.

40|$|Personal {{dosimetry}} for underground workers mainly concerns {{measurement of}} the concentration of radon (and its daughters) and the correct application of the data in dose calculation, using a biokinetic model for lung dosimetry. A conservative approach for estimating the potential dose in caves (or underground) is based on solid state alpha track detector measurements. The obtained dataset is converted into an annual effective dose {{in agreement with the}} ICRP recommendations using the “cave factor”, the value of which depends on the spectrum of aerosol particles, or on the proportional representation of the unattached and the attached fraction and on the equilibrium factor. The main difference between apartments and caves is the absence of aerosol sources, high humidity, low ventilation rate and the uneven surface in caves. A more precisely determined dose value would {{have a significant impact on}} radon remedies or on restricting the time workers stay underground. In order to determine  how the effective dose is calculated, it is necessary to divide these areas into distinct categories by the following measuring procedures: continual radon measurement (to capture the differences in EERC between working hours and night-time, and also between daily and seasonal radon concentration variations); regular measurements of radon and its daughters to estimate the equilibrium factor and the presence of 218 Po; regular indoor air flow measurements to study the location of the radon supply and its transfer among individual areas of the cave; <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> content evaluation in subsoils and in water inside/outside, a study of the radon sources in the cave; aerosol particle-size spectrum measurements to determine the free fraction; monitoring the behaviour of guides and workers to record the actual time spent in the cave, in relation to the continuously monitored levels of Rn concentration. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present state}} of the {{theoretical}} treatment {{of the field of}} nuclear phenomena, and in particular the basic subject of nuclear forces, is rather unsatisfactory. It appears quite probable that this subject will undergo a development parallel to that of atomic structures a considerable amount of information must be gathered before the theories which arise from time to time may be properly evaluated. As in the atomic oases one of the phenomena which a satisfactory theory must quantitatively explain is the existence of excited energy states in the nucleus, the presence of which are deduced from observation of quanta and particles emitted from such nuclei. In addition a satisfactory theory must certainly take into account the binding energies and, nuclear masses inferred from the energy release an the disintegration of nuclei. Of the many techniques currently employed to obtain the basic data mentioned above, one which yields great precision is that of charged particle energy measurement by magnetic analysis. In the past few years this method has been used to determine the disintegration energies, or "Q-values", and the energy levels of the light nuclei. It was for this purpose that the Rice Institute annular magnet was constructed: in 1949. This magnet has the advantage of being capable of absolute measurement, whereas the magnets employed by the groups at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology are calibrated by means of the alpha particle group from the <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> P 0210. The Rice Institute magnet has to date been used only to check some of the determinations made by these two laboratories, which have been responsible for most such determinations made in this country. The rice data have been in reasonable agreement with the results of these laboratories, and this fact indicates that the calibration standards are, at most, not very much in error. However, it was felt that it would be advantageous to use the facilities for absolute measurement available at Rice to check this standard. It is for that purpose that the experiments described in this thesis were conducted...|$|E

The Knížecí Stolec durbachitic pluton with high contents of <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> (Th, U and K) represents a body with no magnetically anomalous response but a pronounced positive gravity anomaly. The Křišťanov granulite massif, which is a host rock of the Knížecí Stolec pluton, exhibits low concentrations of Th and U, high abundances of K, slight magnetic and a negative gravity anomalies. The Plechý composite pluton is characterized by strikingly low gravity and an extremely monotonous magnetic field. One of its petrographic varieties (the Třístoličník granite) is enriched in <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements,</b> especially in Th and U. Metamorphic complexes of the Monotonous and Varied groups contain multiple magnetic anomalies mostly related to the intercalated metabasic rocks; they also cause positive gravity anomalies. The Linsser density boundaries {{at a depth of}} 0. 5 km clearly delimit the Plechý composite pluton and the Lhenice zone and indicate several structurally and/or lithologically different domains within the Křišťanov granulite massif and in the Knížecí Stolec pluton. The 2. 5 D gravity model indicates an asymmetric shape of the Knížecí Stolec pluton, which is deepest in its SE part (at least 4 km). The joint interpretation of the geophysical and structural data revealed that the maximum depth of the pluton is c. 4. 5 km, with gently to moderately dipping intrusive contacts in the north and subvertical orientation in the south. The asymmetric shape of the pluton is consistent with its inferred syn-tectonic emplacement coeval with the regional subvertical contraction and development of regional flat-lying fabric. The gravity model combined with structural analyses also implies a considerable depth of the south Bohemian granulite massifs. This indicates their steep exhumation path and is at variance with the model of the Moldanubian Zone as a sequence of flat-lying nappes.

Enhanced activity concentrations of 210 Pb could conceivably occur if large quantities of 222 Rn diffuse from adjacent high activity rocks into a lower activity coal seam with subsequent trapping of the decay products in the coal [2]. Variations can be quite large everywhere in the world even in the same area.

Analyses of the evergreen vegetation indicated that in general uranium is preferentially concentrated in the roots, followed by the twigs and leafs/needles. For the behavior of Th and Sr, we noticed that they in the first place concentrate mainly in the root that is just like in the case of U. Sr shows a different behavior. Sr is in conifers found to be more concentrated in needles and twigs than in roots and stems. Since the plants do not need U and Th neither for their metabolism, nor for their structure, it follows that the assimilation of these elements is being done through passive processes.

The behaviors of Abies alba and Picea excelsa are very interesting because they can reach and accumulate U, Th and Sr over very long periods of time.

40|$|Uranium is a <b>natural,</b> {{ubiquitous}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>element</b> {{for which}} elevated concentrations {{can be found}} in the vicinity of some nuclear fuel cycle facilities or intensive farming areas, and most often in mixtures with other contaminants such as cadmium, due to co-occurrence in geological ores (e. g. U- or P-ore). The study of their combined effects on ecosystems is of interest to better characterize such multi-metallic polluted sites. In the present study, the toxicity of binary mixture of U and Cd on physiological parameters of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was assessed over time. Descriptive modeling using concentration and response addition reference models was applied to compare observed and expected combined effects and identify possible synergistic or antagonistic interactions. A strong antagonism between U and Cd was identified for length increase and brood size endpoints. The study revealed that the combined effects might be explained by two nested antagonistic interactions. We demonstrate that the first interaction occurred in the exposure medium. We also identified a significant second antagonistic interaction which occurred either during the toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic steps. These findings underline the complexity of interactions that may take place between chemicals and thus, highlight the importance of studying mixtures at various levels to fully understand underlying mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} non-nuclear {{industries have}} been investigated regarding the presence of <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements,</b> with the focus on natural radioactivity. The aim of the studies {{was to investigate the}} flow of radionuclides in the processes and/or to estimate doses to exposed workers. The first industry investigated was phosphate processing in the manufacture of dicalcium phosphate (DCP), which is used as a feed supplement for domestic animals. The phosphate ore used at the plant had an average activity concentration of 837 Bq/kg of 238 U in secular equilibrium with its daughters. Investigation of the flow of radioactivity in the manufacturing process showed several separation and concentration processes. The major part of the uranium was found in the DCP, while the major part of radium was found in the by-product calcium chloride. Estimated doses to workers at the plant from external radiation and dust inhalation were below 1 mSv per year. The second study concerned the removal of radioactivity at a waterworks treating mainly surface water. Apart from <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements,</b> also 137 Cs, 90 Sr and 239 + 240 Pu, originating from fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapon tests and the Chernobyl accident, were included in the study. The method used for purification is a combination of coagulation/flocculation and filtration in sand beds. Two different coagulants are used, FeCl 3 and Al 2 (SO 4) 3. The results for both coagulants showed high removal efficiencies for uranium, thorium, polonium and plutonium, while radium, strontium and caesium passed through the process and could therefore subsequently reach the municipal distribution network with almost unchanged activity concentrations. The third investigation is a study of exposure to thorium during TIG-welding with thoriated tungsten electrodes. Breathing zone samples were collected for welders at five different workshops. Breathing zone samples from electrode grinding were collected at the laboratory. Dose assessments were made based on both realistic and conservative assumptions showing that, in the realistic case, the annual committed effective doses were below 0. 3 mSv for welding and 10 microSv for grinding. Based on conservative assumptions the annual committed effective doses were around 1 mSv or lower for welding and about 60 microSv for grinding. The fourth study concerned the use of zircon in the ceramics industry. Zircon is used as an ingredient (about 10 % by weight) in glaze, and samples collected from three different plants contained 3, 000 to 3, 900 Bq/kg of the uranium series elements and 470 to 740 Bq/kg of thorium series elements. The estimated annual effective doses to exposed workers were low, below 90 microSv. One waste stream from the manufacturing process was identified: glaze spill to the waste water system, and another is suggested to be 210 Po in the flue gases from the high-temperature furnaces...|$|R
50|$|In Earth's {{continental}} crust, {{the decay}} of <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> isotopes has had significant involvement in the origin of geothermal heat. The continental crust is abundant in lower density minerals but also contains significant concentrations of heavier lithophilic minerals such as uranium. Because of this, it holds the largest global reservoir of <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> found in the Earth. Especially in layers closer to Earth's surface, naturally occurring isotopes are enriched in the granite and basaltic rocks. These high levels of <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> are largely excluded from the Earth's mantle due to their inability to substitute in mantle minerals and consequent enrichment in partial melts. The mantle is mostly made up of high density minerals with high contents of atoms that have relatively small atomic radii such as magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), and calcium (Ca).|$|R
40|$|Natural {{gamma ray}} {{measurements}} are made routinely during core logging using the physical property multisensor track. The instrument provides {{a measure of}} the <b>natural</b> decay of <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> in the core, expressed in counts per second, which is generally used as a proxy for the clay content of nonmarginal marine sediments. At Site 1201 spikes of increased gamma ray emissions, up to six times the average for the entire core over depth intervals on the order of 20 - 50 cm, are observed from the sediments within 50 m of the basement contact. The spikes show a strong correlation with sediment color variations, coinciding with red/brown layers within otherwise green/gray-colored sediments. In this paper, the gamma ray spectra obtained from 21 measurements using a 4 -hr counting period are analyzed to obtain the absolute concentration of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements</b> K 2 O, U, and Th in both the intervals with spikes and the intervals with relatively low count rates. In addition, the concentration of these elements is estimated using the spectra obtained from the routine 20 -s counting period measurements and which, although exhibiting a great deal of scatter due to the high statistical uncertainty in the original measurements, are roughly similar to those obtained from the 4 -hr counting period. Baseline concentrations for U (1 ppm) and Th (5 ppm) match published averages for the amount present in deep-sea clays; the peak concentrations measured correspond to an additional concentration of 100 %- 200 %. The results are compared to those from downhole logging and shipboard inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry measurements. The gamma ray spectra results do not support postdepositional fluid flow through the sediment as the source of the enrichment of <b>radioactive</b> <b>elements.</b> It is more likely that the spikes in the gamma ray emissions are simply the result of interbedding sediments from two different sources, one with relatively high concentrations of K 2 O, U, and Th...|$|R
