METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 61 consecutive CTEPH patients (aged 53 +/- 14 years; 36 women) who underwent PEA between June 2002 and June 2005 were studied. Clinical, haemodynamic, and echocardiographic variables were assessed pre-operatively and at 3 months post-PEA. Timing of the notch was expressed as <b>notch</b> <b>ratio</b> (NR). Pre-operatively, seven patients had no notch, 33 had NR 1. 0. NR was associated with in-hospital mortality (P 40 mmHg) at 3 months post-PEA (P = 0. 01).

The main aim of the study is to suggest some new equations suitable for calculations of the J-integral under bending loading. Although some closed-form solutions exist in the literature based on elliptic integrals, some expressions, simple to be implemented, are useful as a rapid engineering tool. The semi-circular arc of the notch, which is traction-free, is assumed as the integration path and the J-integral is given as a function of the strain-energy density. For a numerical investigation of the strain-energy density distribution on the notch edge, the equation W(θ) = Wmax cosδ(θ) has been assumed, where the exponent δ has been determined from finite element analyses. The influence on δ of the notch acuity of the specimen width to the <b>notch</b> depth <b>ratio</b> w/a has been investigated by means of several parametric finite element analyses.

The use of finite element method has brought significant advantages to the designers, as well as researchers, working {{in the area of}} welded structures. However, the use of finite element poses many challenges, due to the various methods to predict the stresses acting on the welded joints, such as the hotspot stress and effective notch methods, and the finite element models associated with these methods. In this research work, the hotspot stress and effective notch methods that are used to predict the stresses acting on the joints and finite element models associated with the methods are studied. Different types of elements, element sizes and meshing techniques are also considered. A comparative study {{of the results of the}} two methods is also performed.

Spectral Doppler analysis including assessment of the resistive index, peak systolic velocity-to-end diastolic velocity (S:D) <b>ratio,</b> diastolic <b>notch</b> velocity-to-peak systolic velocity (N:S) ratio, and end diastolic velocity-to-diastolic <b>notch</b> velocity <b>ratio</b> was performed for each tracing.

Results of Doppler analysis were compared with cytologic or histopathologic findings. Results—The Doppler index with the highest diagnostic accuracy was the S:D ratio calculated from the first recorded tracing; a cutoff value of 3. 22 yielded sensitivity of 91 %, specificity of 100 %, and negative predictive value of 89 % for detection of neoplasia.

It has been found that the fracture load has a minimum value at a critical value of the notch root radius (ρ), using four criteria, namely, Mean Stress (MS), maximum tangent stress or Point Stress (PS), Critical Strain-Energy (CSE) and Averaged Strain-Energy Density (ASED). Using a characteristic length (lch), which is a function of material properties, the results showed that the dimensionless critical notch root radius (ρ/lch) cr depended on w/a ratio (the specimen width to the <b>notch</b> depth), Poisson <b>ratio,</b> and loading condition (tensile or bending loading) under Mode I loading. In other words, according to these criteria, a notch root radius different from zero exists, providing a minimum fracture load.

Stress in the trunk at breast height was calculated from strain measurements and each tree’s modulus of elasticity. Multiple regression was used to determine which independent variables (mass of piece, fall distance and fall <b>ratio,</b> <b>notch</b> angle and depth) best predicted forces. Tops and pieces exhibited different relationships with mass, which was the best predictor of force at the block and tension in the rope. Other variables were not as important and exhibited counter-intuitive relationships with forces. There were few differences in stress generated when removing tops and pieces, which appeared to be due to greater deflection higher in the trunk when tops were removed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the spider}} Cupiennius salei the mechanosensory organs {{of the legs}} are {{generated}} from epithelial sensory precursor groups which are specified by elevated levels of the achaete–scute homologues CsASH 1 and CsASH 2. Neural precursors delaminate from the groups and occupy positions basal and proximal to the accessory cells which remain in the epithelium. Here we analyse the role of Notch signalling and numb function {{in the development of}} the mechanosensory organs of the spider. We show that Notch signalling is required for several processes: the selection of the sensory precursor groups, the maintenance of undifferentiated sensory precursors, the binary cell fate decision between accessory and neural fate and the differentiation of sensory neurons. Our data suggest that Numb antagonises Notch signalling in the neural precursors, which results in activation of the neural cell fate determinant Prospero and delamination of the neural precursors from the epithelium. Prospero is expressed de novo in sensory neural precursors and we assume that the expression of the gene is regulated by the <b>Notch</b> to Numb <b>ratio</b> within the sensory precursors. Interestingly, the spider numb RNAi phenotype resembles the numb/numblike loss of function phenotypes in the mammalian nervous system, indicating that the interaction between Notch signalling and Numb might play a similar role in both systems...|$|R
