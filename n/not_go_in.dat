Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 February, Benfica {{played host to}} Boavista. They {{had several}} {{opportunities}} to beat William, but Boavista prevented them all. The match ended in a goalless draw, leaving Benfica one point away from the Estádio da Luz. Santos accepted the draw, saying, [...] "I {{do not like to}} speak about luck or misfortune. The ball just would <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> That is it." [...] Eight days later, Benfica travelled to Estádio do Varzim to play the sixth round of the Portuguese Cup against Segunda Liga-side Varzim. The hosts opened the score with an own goal from Nélson in the 13th minute, but Benfica equalizer with a goal from Simão at the half-hour mark. In the second half, Varzim pressed again and António Mendonça scored a match-winning 77th-minute goal. Benfica's elimination at the hands of Varzim was the third time in Santos' career he was knocked-out of the Portuguese Cup by a team from lower divisions, the other clubs being Porto and Sporting.|$|E

Dawson's reluctance to be enshrined as an Expo stemmed, in part, from the breakdown of his relationship with the team during MLB's collusion scandal of 1986–87, when he claims the team not only [...] "threw him out" [...] of Montreal, but tried to prevent other teams from signing him as a free agent.|$|E

2500|$|The Jerusalem Talmud found {{support in}} [...] for the {{proposition}} in a Baraita that one who dies before age 50 has died a death of karet, of {{being cut off}} from the Jewish people.

[...] And [...] enjoined that [...] "they shall <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> to see the holy things as they are being covered, lest they die." [...] And since [...] indicates that the Kohathites ceased working near the holy things at age 50, these deaths of karet would have to have occurred before the age of 50. The Babylonian Talmud reports that Rabbah said that deaths between the ages of 50 and 60 are also deaths by karet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opinions}} of Socrates {{in any given}} dialog not only often contradict conventional morality, they also contradict his own previous opinions. For example, in the Apology, Socrates praises [...] "the son of Thetis" [...] (Achilles) for making light of death {{because he was so}} obsessed with getting revenge on Hector for killing Patroclus. In this scene, Achilles does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> to fight, but agrees to his mother's command that he wait until she gets special battle gear made for him. Socrates invocation of Achilles as a model for his own fearlessness is misplaced because Achilles is a coward in the scene. [...] In the Republic Socrates has a different opinion of Achilles. [...] He calls him emotionally overwrought, and greedy (for taking bribes—which, according to Homer, he did not do). [...] Socrates famously argues that the Iliad needs to be rewritten.|$|E

Charles shone in theology and scraped through in the other subjects. He was also exhausted and depressed, writing to Fox [...] "I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable." [...] In later life he recalled Paley and Euclid being the only part of the course which was useful to him, and [...] "By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the οἱ πολλοί, or crowd of men who do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for honours." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tales {{from other}} parts of Germany make mine kobolds {{beneficial}} creatures, at least if they are treated respectfully. Nineteenth-century miners in Bohemia and Hungary reported hearing knocking in the mines. They interpreted such noises as warnings from the kobolds to <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> that direction. Other miners claimed that the knocks indicated where veins of metal could be found: the more knocks, the richer the vein. In 1884, spiritualist Emma Hardinge Britten reported a story from a Madame Kalodzy, who claimed to have heard mine kobolds while visiting a peasant named Michael Engelbrecht: [...] "On the three first days after our arrival, we only heard a few dull knocks, sounding in and about the mouth of the mine, as if produced by some vibrations or very distant blows..." [...] Kobolds are sometimes portrayed as being indifferent to human miners, so long as they are left alone. In these depictions, they are content to simply mine ore themselves, collect it, and haul it away by windlass.|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will <b>not</b> <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.
