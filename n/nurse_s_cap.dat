40|$|In 26 S proteasomes, '' 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap</b> complexes'' {{associate}} with either {{one or both}} ends of the barrel-shaped 20 S core complex. These regulatory complexes which comprise about 20 different subunits, including 6 ATPases of the AAA family, are thought to recognize ubiquitinated substrate proteins, to dissociate and unfold them before threading them into the 20 S core where they are degraded. Here, we examine the structure of 26 S proteasomes from Drosophila embryos and Xenopus oocytes by electron microscopy. Image analysis reveals a rather flexible linkage between the 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> and the 20 S core, with a peculiar wagging-type movement of the caps relative to the core. At this stage of the analysis, {{it is not clear whether}} this movement is relevant in terms of function.

40|$|AbstractThe final {{destination}} {{of the majority}} of proteins that have to be selectively degraded in eukaryotic cells is the proteasome, a highly sophisticated nanomachine essential for life. 26 S proteasomes select target proteins via their modification with polyubiquitin chains or, in rare cases, by the recognition of specific motifs. They are made up of different subcomplexes, a 20 S core proteasome harboring the proteolytic active sites hidden within its barrel-like structure and two 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> that execute regulatory functions. Similar complexes equipped with PA 28 regulators instead of 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> are a variation of this theme specialized for the production of antigenic peptides required in immune response. Structure analysis as well as extensive biochemical and genetic studies of the 26 S proteasome and the ubiquitin system led to a basic model of substrate recognition and degradation. Recent work raised new concepts. Additional factors involved in substrate acquisition and delivery to the proteasome have been discovered. Moreover, first insights in the tasks of individual subunits or subcomplexes of the 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> in substrate recognition and binding as well as release and recycling of polyubiquitin tags have been obtained...|$|R

40|$|Ubiquitin-dependent {{proteolysis}} is catalyzed by the 26 S proteasome, {{a dynamic}} complex of 32 different proteins whose mode of assembly and {{mechanism of action}} are poorly understood, {{in part due to}} the difficulties encountered in purifying the intact complex. Here we describe a one-step affinity method for purifying intact 26 S proteasomes, 19 <b>S</b> regulatory <b>caps,</b> and 20 <b>S</b> core particles from budding yeast cells. Affinity-purified 26 S proteasomes hydrolyze both model peptides and the ubiquitinated Cdk inhibitor Sic 1. Affinity purifications performed in the absence of ATP or presence of the poorly hydrolyzable analog ATP-gamma -S unexpectedly revealed {{that a large number of}} proteins, including subunits of the skp 1 -cullin-F-box protein ligase (SCF) and anaphase-promoting complex (APC) ubiquitin ligases, copurify with the 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap.</b> To identify these proteasome-interacting proteins, we used a recently developed method that enables the direct analysis of the composition of large protein complexes (DALPC) by mass spectrometry. Using DALPC, we identified more than 24 putative proteasome-interacting proteins, including Ylr 421 c (Daq 1), which we demonstrate to be a new subunit of the budding yeast 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap,</b> and Ygr 232 w (Nas 6), which is homologous to a subunit of the mammalian 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap</b> (PA 700 complex). Additional PIPs include the heat shock proteins Hsp 70 and Hsp 82, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp 6, and proteins involved in transcriptional control, mitosis, tubulin assembly, RNA metabolism, and signal transduction. Our data demonstrate that nucleotide hydrolysis modulates the association of many proteins with the 26 S proteasome, and validate DALPC as a powerful tool for rapidly identifying stoichiometric and substoichiometric components of large protein assemblies...|$|R

This protein shares significant sequence homology with the adenylyl cyclase-associated CAP protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CAP is a bifunctional protein; the N-terminal domain appears to be involved in cellular responsiveness to RAS, whereas loss of the C-terminal portion is associated with morphological and nutritional defects. <b>S.</b> pombe <b>cap</b> can suppress phenotypes associated with deletion of the C-terminal <b>CAP</b> domain in <b>S.</b> cerevisiae but does not suppress phenotypes associated with deletion of the N-terminal domain.

As ERAD was unaffected when cytoplasmic chaperone activity was compromised, we asked whether proteasomes on their own supported both export and degradation in this system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ubiquitin}} proteasome system classically selects its substrates for degradation by tagging {{them with}} ubiquitin.

This reversible modification of the proteasome inhibits the proteolysis of the transcription factor Sp 1 and a hydrophobic peptide through inhibition of the ATPase activity of 26 S proteasomes. The Rpt 2 ATPase in the mammalian proteasome 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap</b> is modified by O-GlcNAc in vitro and in vivo and as its modification increases, proteasome function decreases. This mechanism may couple proteasomes to the general metabolic state of the cell.

40|$|Proteasome {{activator}} PA 200 enhances proteasome-mediated cleavage after acidic residues in vitro; however, {{its role}} within cells is not known. Here, we show that, {{in response to}} ionizing radiation, PA 200 forms hybrid proteasomes with 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> and 20 <b>S</b> core proteasomes that accumulate on chromatin, leading {{to an increase in}} proteolytic activity. Unlike many other proteins that respond to DNA damage, the response of PA 200 appears to be independent of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated and p 53, but dependent on DNA-dependent protein kinase activity. Nonetheless, PA 200 is critical because PA 200 -knockdown cells show genomic instability and reduced survival after exposure to ionizing radiation. This phenotype is reproduced by specific inhibition of postglutamyl activity of proteasomes, but combined treatment with PA 200 siRNA and postglutamyl inhibitor does not show additive effects on survival. Together, these data suggest a unique role for PA 200 in genomic stability that is likely mediated through its ability to enhance postglutamyl cleavage by proteasomes...|$|R

40|$|Background: Historically, the {{ambulance}} services {{have been considered}} mainly to be a transport function. Demands from the society and progress in medicine have transformed the services into an advanced form of emergency medical care for ill or injured persons. Therefore, a discussion {{has been going on}} as to the kind of competence that is needed in these services. Two major aims of the present study have been to describe both the development and the present status of the ongoing quality improvement process in prehospital emergency care in Sweden. Two other aims have been to describe the <b>nurse</b> <b>s</b> practical role in disasters, as well as the views of the involved professionals of both the <b>nurse</b> <b>s</b> and {{the ambulance}}man s roles in the prehospital emergency care field in general. Methods: The study has included a questionnaire with open-ended questions for nursing students and semi-structured interviews along with questionnaires to ambulancemen, nurses and physicians, as well as a national questionnaire survey of all medical directors in Sweden. The data were processed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: The findings indicate that nurses have an increasingly important function in prehospital emergency care, both at minor and major accidents, {{as well as in the}} care of the acutely ill patient. Both ambulancemen and physicians appreciate the <b>nurse</b> <b>s</b> broad competence and emphasise the need of special education and training for optimal functioning. The medical directors consider that progress in the field makes it necessary to have more highly competent personnel in order to maintain and develop the quality of care. They view the roles of nurses and ambulancemen as complements to one another. Nursing students receive basic knowledge in disaster nursing and learn how to use systematic approaches, which is a good basis for their advanced education and training in prehospital emergency care. Nurses with experience and education or training in prehospital emergency care function better then other nurses at an actual disaster site. They also have less negative experience from their work at such sites. The national survey indicates that quality improvement processes initiated by the Swedish authorities have resulted in considerable improvement of prehospital emergency care during the last few years. The competence level of ambulancemen has increased and more nurses have been employed. A majority of the medical directors reported that they have adapted the services to be in accordance with the regulations of the National Board of Health and Welfare (SOSFS 1995 : 8). All directors are, however, not satisfied with the present competence level of personnel, and mention in particular the lack of nurses in their local organisations. Conclusion: The progress and demands of quality improvement measures within prehospital emergency care have increased the need of a higher competence level of personnel. This has focused on nurses, and in particular, on emergency nurses. The regulations of the National Board of Health and Welfare have been a driving force in this matter. The study indicates that the specially trained nurse has come to the prehospital field to stay and that he or she has an important role in the continuing progress of prehospital emergency care both in routine prehospital work as well as in disaster situations...|$|R
