5|$|In early 1989, {{operations}} in Horsham were reduced, following {{the loss of}} the tendered route to Barns Green. A <b>new</b> <b>service</b> to Billingshurst was briefly introduced in February 1989, but withdrawn after two months. In July, a <b>new</b> <b>service</b> between Guildford and the British Aerospace site at Dunsfold Aerodrome was introduced. Further expansion eastwards came in November 1989, when the operation of eleven tendered routes, requiring six buses, was won from the county council. These were operated under the Hobbit name. A <b>new</b> <b>service</b> linking Normandy and Christmaspie to Guildford two days a week was introduced in October 1989. A second route to the two villages was added in 1995. In January 1999 a new route from Farnham to Tongham via Normandy was launched, as was a direct service from the village to Guildford. In 1998 an outstation was opened in Aldershot following the award of contracted work in Reading to Tillingbourne.|$|E

5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to <b>new</b> <b>service</b> books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral.

5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, {{that ran}} along the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to the city center and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a <b>new</b> <b>service</b> linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E

5|$|Tillingbourne {{introduced}} a new tourist route {{in the summer of}} 1995. Operating on Sundays for six months of the year, it provided a circular service linking Guildford, Godalming and Cranleigh with a number of nearby rural locations not served by other routes. Although similar services were operated by London & Country and Nostalgiabus, the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> was designed to avoid any direct competition. The route was operated with a Bristol SU single-decker acquired from a bus preservationist.|$|E
5|$|A post-war {{review of}} rail {{transport}} in the London area produced {{a report in}} 1946 that proposed many new lines and identified the Morden branch as being the most overcrowded section of the London Underground, needing additional capacity. To relieve the congestion {{and to provide a}} <b>new</b> <b>service</b> south of Morden, the report recommended construction of a second pair of tunnels beneath the northern line's tunnels from Tooting Broadway to Kennington and an extension from Morden to North Cheam. Trains using the existing tunnels would start and end at Tooting Broadway with the service in the new tunnels joining the existing tunnels to Morden. The extension to North Cheam would run in tunnel. Designated as routes 10 and 11, these proposals were not developed by the London Passenger Transport Board or its successor organisations.|$|E
5|$|Frøen Station was rebuilt so {{only the}} trains on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while Nordberg Station was closed. All the stations, except Ullevål stadion, {{were built in}} the same {{architectural}} style. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed; Ullevål stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail from Majorstuen to Stortinget in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line.

50|$|The <b>New</b> City <b>News</b> <b>Service,</b> {{owned by}} the Tribune, opened soon thereafter, and soon {{changed its name to}} the City <b>News</b> <b>Service.</b> Though smaller, it was run by Paul Zimbrakos, a 40-plus year {{employee}} of the old CNB, and the bureau's last editor. Sun-Times management had thought {{they would be able to}} create a <b>new,</b> cheaper wire <b>service,</b> staffed with few people. When that venture—called Alliance News—failed, for a while the Sun-Times used the part-time help of Medill <b>News</b> <b>Service,</b> staffed by unpaid journalism students from the Medill School of Journalism. The Sun-Times, however, was barred from receiving the <b>New</b> City <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> wire because of its being in competition with the Tribune.|$|R

The United Methodist Reporter bought RNS in 1983, and in 1994, Newhouse <b>News</b> <b>Service,</b> a major publisher of daily newspapers and magazines, purchased it and {{changed its name to}} Religion <b>News</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|R
5|$|Further {{expansion}} came in April 1985, following {{over a year}} {{of consultation}} with county council members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by other operators. Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two new vehicles were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, {{the second of the}} new services, circular route 23/25, was reduced in frequency from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another <b>new</b> <b>service,</b> linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Finnair started {{flying to}} Helsinki, {{although}} direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east–west runway became the main runway. Along with the runway expansion, a <b>new</b> <b>service</b> building, with {{a capacity for}} 2million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located about half a kilometer (quarter of a mile) south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft. The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bodø.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the Nassau–Suffolk Regional Planning Board {{brought up}} plans to convert CR78 into a six-lane {{expressway}} with <b>new</b> <b>service</b> roads. A similar project was {{planned for the}} nearby four-lane NY347 through Islip. To aid this, ownership and maintenance of CR78 {{was transferred to the}} New York State Department of Transportation on March29, 1972, receiving the designation of NY454. The state immediately expanded NY454 to six lanes, with three in each direction from Holbrook to the terminus of NY347. In 1977, the state designated the portion of the highway in Hauppague as both NY454 and NY347 after {{it became clear that the}} Hauppauge Spur of the Long Island Expressway would not be constructed. The plans to expand NY454 and NY347 into full-blown freeways were discarded by the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to make an analysis on the reporting performance of what was originally named the National Catholic Welfare Council <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> {{and is now the}} United States Catholic Conference National Catholic <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> during the period between January 1923 and January 1930. The N. C. <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> was instituted by the Catholic Bishops of the United States of America in April 1920 to provide adequate and efficient news service to those Catholic periodicals which would be its subscribing members. The period between 1920 and 1923 is not included in this content analysis study since a critical study on the reporting performance of NC <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> for this period already exists. Because of many limitations this study attempts to analyze only the reporting performance of the <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> and that only according to certain categories that will be explained later in this study. It is hoped that this study will provide an objective evaluation on the reporting performance of NC <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> in regard to some of its specific and declared objectives. Critical study of the past when used with discretion will provide valuable information for the future...|$|R
