25|$|In 2005, Hughes {{started his}} {{season at the}} 12 Hours of Sebring, driving the TVR with Kane and Tomlinson, but now under the Team LNT banner, and {{competing}} under the new GT2 regulations. It would not prove a successful event; engine failure forced the team to retire both Hughes' car, and their other TVR, driven by Richard Dean, Patrick Pearce and Marc Hynes. He would remain with Team LNT {{for the remainder of}} the season. Following the Sebring race, Hughes, now partnered by Pearce, entered the Donington Park round of the British GT Championship, finishing second, a race which was followed by a class victory in the 1000 km of Spa, where Hughes was partnered by Kane. Hughes and Pearce then competed in the FIA GT Magny-Cours Supercar 500, finishing 18th overall, and seventh in class– fifth of the drivers who scored points for the British GT Championship. The duo remained together for the Knockhill and Thruxton rounds, with a second place in the first race held at Thruxton being the strongest result out of the four races. Hughes then returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time in three years, this time driving for the RML Group team, driving their MG-Lola EX264 alongside Tommy Erdos and Mike Newton. The race proved far more successful than his two previous events, and the trio won the LMP2 category. He returned to Team LNT for the rest of the season, and although the team had entered two cars in the Castle Combe round of the British GT Championship, neither actually competed in a race, following car No.42's exclusion for failing <b>noise</b> <b>limits,</b> and indeed the team withdrew from the remainder of the series for this reason. Following this withdrawal, the team returned to the Le Mans Series, (the 1000km of Spa, which they had previously entered, was part of this series) resulting in the team having competed in all five events. However, the class victory in Spa would remain their only success, as Hughes, partnered by Kane (and, for the final race, Tomlinson) failed to finish in any of the remaining events, following engine failure at the 1000km of Monza, throttle issues at both the 1000km of Silverstone and the 1000km of Istanbul, and suspension failure at the 1000km of Nürburgring. The solitary victory meant that Hughes and Kane finished 11th in class at the end of the season.|$|E

The application of a VCO pixel architecture in thin film technologies to large area imaging modalities will be examined and a small prototype a-Si array integrated with an overlying selenium X-ray converter will be demonstrated for the first time. A-Si and poly-Si transistor technologies are traditionally considered inferior in performance to crystalline silicon, the dominant semiconductor technology today. This work v aims to extend the reach of low cost, thin film transistor a-Si technology to high performance analog applications (i. e. very low input referred noise) previously considered only the domain of crystalline silicon type semiconductor.

40|$|Protein noise {{measurements}} are increasingly used to elucidate biophysical parameters. Unfortunately noise analyses are often {{at odds with}} directly measured parameters.

While growing evidence suggests that transcriptional bursting may set the low <b>noise</b> <b>limit,</b> variability in translational bursting has been largely ignored.

40|$|Abstract—A {{theory for}} the {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) of optical direct-detection receivers employing return-to-zero (RZ) coding (and possibly optical preamplification) is developed. The results are valid for both signal-independent <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> and signal-dependent <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> receivers, {{as well as}} for arbitrary optical pulse shapes and receive filter characteristics. Even if the same receiver bandwidth is used, RZ coding is seen to perform better than nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) coding. Asymptotic expressions for the SNR in case of very high and very low receiver bandwidths show that the full sensitivity enhancement potential of RZ coding is exhausted at fairly moderate duty cycles. A realistic example taking into account intersymbol interference (ISI) shows that a receiver sensitivity gain (compared to NRZ coding) of, e. g., 3. 2 dB can be obtained in a signal-independent <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> receiver with a bandwidth of 80 % of the data rate, using a duty cycle of three.
