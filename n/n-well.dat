This technique has proved to decrease the delay significantly and shown that these flip-flops can perform at high speed operations for near subthreshold voltages (300 mV). The ULV flip-flops proved to be faster, with a delay up to 20 times faster, than other flip-flop topologies presented in this thesis. The ULV flip-flops also proved to have very little setup and hold times. With regards to yield, the ULV flip-flops proved to be better at higher frequencies, above 1 MHz, than the other flip-flop topologies. One of the ULV flip-flops outperformed the others with a much better yield at all frequencies and supply voltages. In terms of EDP the ULV flip-flops revealed very good properties. Overall the ULV flips-flops had significantly better EDP, at all frequencies and all supply voltages, than the comparison flip-flop. One of the flip-flops has been selected for layout design.

50|$|For many years, NMOS {{circuits}} {{were much}} faster than comparable PMOS and CMOS circuits, which had to use much slower p-channel transistors. It was also easier to manufacture NMOS than CMOS, as the latter has to implement p-channel transistors in special <b>n-wells</b> on the p-substrate. The major drawback with NMOS (and most other logic families) is that a DC current must flow through a logic gate even when the output is in a steady state (low {{in the case of}} NMOS). This means static power dissipation, i.e. power drain even when the circuit is not switching. A similar situation arises in modern high speed, high density CMOS circuits (microprocessors etc.) which also has significant static current draw, although this is due to leakage, not bias. However, older and/or slower static CMOS circuits used for ASICs, SRAM etc., typically have very low static power consumption.|$|R

The CAM cell consisted of four conventional static RAM (SRAM) cells and a read/write circuit. Concurrent comparison of 64 stored strings with variable length was achieved in 50 ns for an input text stream of 10 million characters/s, permitting performance despite the presence of single character errors in the form of character codes.

50|$|Capacitance between {{power and}} ground {{distribution}} networks, {{referred to as}} decoupling capacitors or decaps, acts as local charge storage and is helpful in mitigating the voltage drop at supply points. Parasitic capacitance between metal wires of supply lines, device capacitance of the non-switching devices, and capacitance between <b>N-well</b> and substrate, occur as implicit decoupling capacitance in a power distribution network. Unfortunately, this implicit decoupling capacitance is sometimes not enough to constrain the voltage drop within safe bounds and designers often have to add intentional explicit decoupling capacitance structures on the die at strategic locations. These explicitly added decoupling capacitances are not free and increase the area and leakage power consumption of the chip. Parasitic interconnect resistance, decoupling capacitance and package/interconnect inductance form a complex RLC circuit {{which has its own}} resonance frequency.

Today, the standard CMOS technology has become a popular choice for realizing radio frequency (RF) applications. The focus of the thesis is on device compact modelling methodologies in RF CMOS. Compact models oriented to integrated circuit (ICs) computer automatic design (CAD) are the key component of a process design kit (PDK) and the bridge between design houses and foundries.

40|$|As CMOS scaling {{continues}} to sub- 32 nm regime, {{the effects of}} device variations become more prominent. This is very critical in SRAMs, which use very small transistor dimensions to achieve high memory density. The conventional 6 T SRAM bit-cell, which provides the smallest cell-area, fails to operate at lower supply voltages (Vdd). This {{is due to the}} significant degradation of functional margins as the supply voltage is scaled down. However, Vdd scaling is crucial in reducing the energy consumption of SRAMs, which is {{a significant portion of the}} overall energy consumption in modern micro-processors. Energy savings in SRAM is particularly important for batteryoperated applications, which run from a very constrained power-budget. This thesis focuses on energy-efficient 6 T SRAM design in a 28 nm FDSOI technology. Significant savings in energy/access of the SRAM is achieved using two techniques: Vdd scaling and data prediction. A 200 mV improvement in the minimum SRAM operating voltage (Vdd,min) is achieved by using dynamic forward body-biasing (FBB) on the NMOS devices of the bit-cell. The overhead of dynamic FBB is reduced by implementing it row-wise. Layout modifications are proposed to share the body terminals (<b>n-wells)</b> horizontally, along a row. Further savings in energy/access is achieved by incoporating data-prediction in the 6 T read path, which reduces bitline switching. The proposed techniques are implemented for a 128 Kb 6 T SRAM, designed in a 28 nm FDSOI technology. This thesis also presents a reconfigurable fully-integrated switched-capacitor based step-up DC-DC converter, which can be used to generate the body-bias voltage for a SRAM. 3 reconfigurable conversion ratios of 5 / 2, 2 / 1 and 3 / 2 are implemented in the converter. It provides a wide range of output voltage, 1. 2 V- 2. 4 V, from a fixed input of 1 V. The converter achieves a peak efficiency of 88 %, using only on-chip MOS and MOM capacitors, for a high density implementation. by Avishek Biswas. Thesis: S.
