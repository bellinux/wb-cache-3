[29] It {{is to be}} {{carefully}} noted that when rude execution is [...] evidently {{not the result of}} imperfect feeling and desire (as in [...] these men above named, it is) but of thought; either impatient, [...] which there was necessity to note swiftly, or impetuous, which it [...] was well to note in mighty manner, as pre-eminently and in both [...] kinds the case with Tintoret, and often with Michael Angelo, and in [...] lower and more degraded modes with Rubens, and generally in the [...] sketches and first thoughts of great masters; there is received a [...] very noble pleasure, connected both with ideas of power (compare [...] again Part I. Sect. ii. Chap. I.) and with certain actions of the [...] imagination of which we shall speak presently. But this pleasure is [...] not received from the beauty of the work, for nothing can be [...] perfectly beautiful unless complete, but from its simplicity and [...] sufficiency to its immediate purpose, where the purpose is not of [...] beauty at all, as often in things rough-hewn, pre-eminently for [...] instance in the stones of the foundations of the Pitti and Strozzi [...] palaces, whose noble rudeness is to be opposed both to the useless [...] polish, and the barbarous rustications of modern times, (although [...] indeed this instance is not without exception to be received, for [...] the majesty of these rocky buildings depends also in some measure [...] upon the real beauty and finish of the natural curvilinear [...] fractures, opposed to the coarseness of human chiselling,) and [...] again, as it respects works of higher art, the pleasure of their [...] hasty or imperfect execution is not indicative of their beauty, but [...] of their majesty and fulness of thought and vastness of power. Shade [...] is only beautiful when it magnifies and sets forth the forms of fair [...] things, so negligence is only noble when it is, as Fuseli hath it, [...] "the shadow of energy." [...] Which that it may be, secure the substance [...] and the shade will follow, but let the artist beware of stealing the [...] manner of giant intellects when he has not their intention, and of [...] assuming large modes of treatment when he has little thoughts to [...] treat. There is large difference between indolent impatience of [...] labor and intellectual impatience of delay, large difference between [...] leaving things unfinished because we have more to do, or because we [...] are satisfied with what we have done. Tintoret, who prayed hard, and [...] hardly obtained, that he might be permitted, the charge of his [...] colors only being borne, to paint a <b>new</b> <b>built</b> <b>house</b> from base to [...] battlement, was not one to shun labor, it is the pouring in upon him [...] of glorious thoughts in inexpressible multitude that his sweeping [...] hand follows so fast. It is as easy to know the slightness of [...] earnest haste from the slightness of blunt feeling, indolence, or [...] affectation, as it is to know the dust of a race, from the dust of [...] dissolution.|$|E

40|$|Climate change {{policies}} imply significant {{reductions of}} energy use in buildings. For this, prevailing energy performance standards fall short, notwithstanding {{the emergence of}} stricter national building regulations. Regulations cover <b>new</b> <b>built</b> and renovation projects. <b>New</b> <b>built</b> <b>houses</b> that miss the best energy performance are soon candidate for energy upgrading. We investigate the architectural and economic aspects of upgrading recently built detached massive brick houses in Flanders (Belgium). For representing actual building practices, consecutive upgrading steps from lower to higher energy performance levels are considered. Questions addressed are: What is technically feasible in upgrading such houses? Which construction works are easy, which difficult? What are the architectural and financial consequences of a thorough upgrading? The analysis shows that deep energy transformations are financially unacceptable, related to the irrevocable character of investments in energy efficiency attributes of massive brick houses. This confirms that energy performance endowment measures should be designed and implemented {{at the time of}} first construction of a building...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the REBUS project the German building industry has been investigated regarding their energy concepts. The intention was to evaluatethe establishment of renewable energy sources on the German market for <b>new</b> <b>built</b> <b>houses</b> and prefab houses in particular. For this purpose the products of 85 manufacturers of prefab houses have been analyzed. Of special interest was the applicationof heating and hot water systems driven by solar energy and biomass. The results show that both techniques are well accepted and established. Almost 90 % of themanufacturers offer solar systems on request and almost 70 % heating systems based on Pellets. 24 % offered solar and 7 % as standard options in their range. From theachieved figures the potential of the Swedish market can be worked out. Strategies to introduce renewable energy to a greater extent to Swedish house manufacturers and builders might also be found...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{regulatory}} {{pressure and}} rising public awareness {{on environmental issues}} will continue to influence the market demand for sustainable housing for years to come. Despite this potential, the voluntary uptake rate of sustainable practices is {{not as high as}} expected within the <b>new</b> <b>built</b> <b>housing</b> industry. This is in contrast to the influx of emerging building technologies, new materials and innovative designs as showcased in office buildings and exemplar homes worldwide. One of the possible reasons for this under-performance is that key stakeholders such as developers, builders and consumers do not fully understand and appreciate the related challenges, risks and opportunities of pursuing sustainability. Therefore, in their professional and business activities, {{they may not be able}} to see the tangible and mutual benefits that sustainable housing may bring. This research investigates the multiple challenges to achieving benefits (CABs) from sustainable housing development, and links these factors to the characteristics of key stakeholders in the housing supply chain.

40|$|There {{is clear}} {{evidence}} to show that climate change is happening. According to the UK Climate Projections (UKCP 09) we can expect warmer and wetter winters, hotter and drier summers, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events. These extreme weather events in the UK are likely to increase with rising temperatures, causing among others heavier rainfall events with increased risk of flooding. Flooding is currently identified {{as one of the greatest}} threats to the UK posed by the climate change. In the UK there is a continuous need for new housing. The UK government has set a goal of 1, 000, 000 new homes by 2020 in order to cover the country’s housing needs. This study examines the effect of building development on the risk of flooding under extreme rainfall, for an area that has a very low chance of flooding. Two different scenarios of building development were modelled using XP SWMM software. Results show that building development increases the maximum water depth and that the <b>new</b> <b>built</b> <b>houses</b> will flood under extreme rainfall...|$|R
