5000|$|Hawking and Page {{later found}} {{ambiguous}} results when {{they attempted to}} compute the probability of inflation in the Hartle-Hawking initial state. Other authors have argued that, since inflation is eternal, the probability doesn't matter {{as long as it}} is not precisely zero: once it starts, inflation perpetuates itself and quickly dominates the Universe. However, Albrecht and Lorenzo Sorbo argued that the probability of an inflationary cosmos, consistent with today's observations, emerging by a random fluctuation from some pre-existent state is much higher than that of a <b>non-inflationary</b> cosmos. This is because the [...] "seed" [...] amount of non-gravitational energy required for the inflationary cosmos is so much less than that for a <b>non-inflationary</b> alternative, which outweighs any entropic considerations.|$|E
5000|$|NAIRU is {{an acronym}} for non-accelerating {{inflation}} rate of unemployment, and refers {{to a level of}} unemployment below which inflation rises. It was first introduced as NIRU (<b>non-inflationary</b> rate of unemployment) by Franco Modigliani and Lucas Papademos in 1975, as an improvement over the [...] "natural rate of unemployment" [...] concept, which was proposed earlier by Milton Friedman.|$|E
5000|$|Credit Theory of Money. This {{approach}} was initiated by Joseph Schumpeter. Credit theory asserts {{the central role}} of banks as creators and allocators of money supply, and distinguishes between [...] "productive credit creation" [...] (allowing <b>non-inflationary</b> economic growth even at full employment, in the presence of technological progress) and [...] "unproductive credit creation" [...] (resulting in inflation of either the consumer- or asset-price variety).|$|E
50|$|The Planck epoch is {{an era in}} {{traditional}} (<b>non-inflationary)</b> big bang cosmology wherein the temperature was so high that the four fundamental forces—electromagnetism, gravitation, weak nuclear interaction, and strong nuclear interaction—were one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a gravitational singularity before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of general relativity, which is thought to break down for this epoch due to quantum effects.|$|E
5000|$|Inflation {{ended when}} the {{inflaton}} field decayed into ordinary particles {{in a process}} called [...] "reheating", at which point ordinary Big Bang expansion began. The time of reheating is usually quoted as a time [...] "after the Big Bang". This refers to the time that would have passed in traditional (<b>non-inflationary)</b> cosmology between the Big Bang singularity and the universe dropping to the same temperature that was produced by reheating, even though, in inflationary cosmology, the traditional Big Bang did not occur.|$|E

Both {{are issued}} by the [...] Russian Finance Ministry and trade on the Moscow Inter Bank Currency Exchange (MICEX), {{as well as on}} five other currency exchanges connected with the MICEX and located in large regional cities. GKOs were introduced in May 1993 as <b>non-inflationary</b> instruments for financing the budget deficit. OFZs were introduced in June 1995 to complement the GKO market as an instrument with medium and long-term standing.|$|E
50|$|In 1982 Norman G. Kurland (later {{president}} of CESJ) wrote a concept {{paper on the}} “Capital Homestead Act” {{at the request of}} Dr. Norman Bailey, then-Chief Economist for International Affairs of the National Security Council. Conceived as a “New Marshall Plan” for stimulating rapid, <b>non-inflationary</b> growth, the proposal contained Federal Reserve, tax and other expanded capital ownership reforms intended to enable each citizen to accumulate a “capital homestead” of income-generating assets sufficient to meet ordinary living expenses, and reduce over time the growing costs of unsustainable Federal entitlement spending.|$|E
5000|$|Of all the misascriptions of {{the word}} ‘conservative’ during the last four years, the most amusing, in an {{historical}} light, is surely the application of ‘conservative’ to the last-named. For in America throughout the twentieth century, and including four substantial wars abroad, conservatives had been steadfastly the voices of <b>non-inflationary</b> military budgets, and of an emphasis on trade in the world instead of American nationalism. In the two World Wars, in Korea, and in Viet Nam, the leaders of American entry into war were such renowned liberal-progressives as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy. In all four episodes conservatives, both in the national government and in the rank and file, were largely hostile to intervention; were isolationists indeed..|$|E
50|$|Reaching {{its peak}} in 1955, the bank had a slow decline from 1957 to 1966, with total {{deposits}} falling below the M$50 million mark to M$37.4 million. After Singapore's independence in 1965, the country went through a rapid industrialisation programme. To develop the infrastructure of the infant city-state, then Minister for Finance, Goh Keng Swee, set up a savings bank committee (was later reconstituted into a permanent advisory committee within the bank) to promote domestic savings through POSB to provide the government with a <b>non-inflationary</b> source of funds for national development. Following {{the recommendations of the}} savings bank committee, withdrawal limits of accounts were raised from S$200 once every seven days to S$500 once every three days, longer banking hours, exempting interest earned on POSB savings accounts from income tax, and accepting non-Romanised signatures for operating accounts. Savings competitions were also organised among all government and government-aided schools with the incentive of a POSB lucky draw to encourage students to open an account with the bank. From 1966 to 1969, the number of new accounts opened increased from 10,596 to 174,506 with deposits totalling S$57.7 million in 1969.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} his bachelor's degree in economics, Falae joined {{the civil service}} as {{the assistant secretary of}} the National Manpower Board, he later became a principal assistant secretary of the board. In 1971, he was transferred to the Central Planning office and by 1975, he was a director at the planning office. Falae was appointed permanent secretary (Economic dept), Cabinet office in 1977 before leaving the civil service to head the Nigerian Merchant Bank in 1979. However, in 1986, he returned to government service and was appointed as the Secretary to the Government. By then, he believed Nigeria needed economic re-structuring. In 1985, prior to his appointment, the military sought public opinion of an IMF economic structuring proposal as a condition for external credit from the fund, the popular opinion was to reject the proposal. The administration then came up with Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). SAP was a proposal to diversify export from a crude oil dependent regime, ensure fiscal and balance of payments equilibrium and <b>non-inflationary</b> growth. The mechanisms to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives were the devaluation of the naira, reduction of petroleum products subsidies and trade liberalization. During his time in office, Falae became a vocal defender of SAP even when it was becoming unpopular earning him the moniker, Mr. SAP.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{topic of}} the G8 summit was the European {{sovereign}} debt crisis, particularly following the fall of talks to form a Greek government following an election. President Obama told the press: [...] "There is now an emerging consensus that more {{must be done to}} promote growth and job creation right now in the context of these fiscal and structural reforms." [...] In its declaration the G8 agreed [...] "that all of our governments need to take actions to boost confidence and nurture recovery including reforms to raise productivity, growth and demand within a sustainable, credible and <b>non-inflationary</b> macroeconomic framework. We commit to fiscal responsibility and, in this context, we support sound and sustainable fiscal consolidation policies that take into account countries' evolving economic conditions and underpin confidence and economic recovery." [...] The G8 leaders also stated in the declaration that they agreed on the importance of a strong and cohesive eurozone for global stability and recovery, and affirmed their interest in Greece remaining in the eurozone while respecting its commitments. However disagreement over economic growth favored by France's President François Hollande and fiscal responsibility favored by Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel is also reflected in the G8 summit declaration where the G8 members stated [...] "The global economic recovery shows signs of promise, but significant headwinds persist. Against this background, we commit to take all necessary steps to strengthen and reinvigorate our economies and combat financial stresses, recognizing that the right measures are not the same for each of us." ...|$|E

40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. It {{has long been}} established that pay formulas containing an element of profit-sharing have <b>non-inflationary</b> employment promotion properties (Vanek, 1965), except in self-managed enterprises (e. g. Vanek, 1970). In recent literature economy-wide profit-sharing combined with workers' strict exclusion from employment decisions is being promoted as a scheme guaranteeing the achievement of a blissful state of <b>non-inflationary</b> excess demand for labour, absorbing {{all or part of}} possible deflationary shocks (Weitzman, 1983, 1984, 1985 a, 1985 b, 1986).

40|$|We {{discuss the}} entropy and the size/homogeneity/horizon {{problems}} in power-law expanding universes with one scale initial conditions. We set the minimal scale Λ = 10 ^ 25 GeV {{at which a}} <b>non-inflationary</b> solution is possible and show that the radiation dominated epoch alone technically {{is not able to}} explain the issue. An earlier paper on the subject, [1], attempts a multidimensional scenario. We review the scenario of the paper [1] in an effective four dimensional Einstein frame. We find that during contraction of extra dimensions, the residual bulk energy density is important and leads to a scaling solution. The existence of this scaling solution is a new result. We provide a numerical example which demonstrates the evolution of the scale factor and the extra dimensions. In the whole, the validity of the effective field theory calculations at the scale of Λ = 10 ^ 25 GeV is under question and, hence, the final conclusion regarding the possibility of a <b>non-inflationary</b> solution is preliminary.

40|$|Participants in the {{cognitive}} phenomenology debate have proceeded by (a) proposing a bifurcation of theoretical options into inflationary and <b>non-inflationary</b> theories, and then (b) providing arguments for/against {{one of these}} theories. I suggest that this method has failed to illuminate the commonalities and differences among conscious intentional states of different types, {{in the absence of}} a theory of the structure of these states. I propose such a theory. In perception, phenomenal-intentional properties combine with somatosensory properties to form P-I property clusters that serve as phenomenal modes of presentations of particulars. In imagination, somatosensory properties are replaced with phenomenal-intentional properties whose intentional objects are somatosensory properties, thus resulting in imaginative facsimiles of perceptual P-I property clusters. Such structures can then be used as phenomenal prototypes that pick out individuals and kinds. Sets of such prototypes constitute a subject’s conception of individuals and kinds. Combined with a few additional elements, these imaginative P-I property clusters serve as the building blocks of conscious cognitive states. Different ways of carving up theoretical space classify my theory either as inflationary or as <b>non-inflationary.</b> I conclude that the theory is anti-inflationary in the letter but inflationary in spirit...|$|E
