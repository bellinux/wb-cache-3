5000|$|The Aerodyne AMS {{provides}} real-time aerosol {{mass spectrometry}} analysis of size-resolved mass concentration of <b>non-refractory</b> components (Ex. organics, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium). The term <b>non-refractory</b> {{is assigned to}} species that evaporate rapidly at 600 °C under vacuum conditions (e.g. organic matter, NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4. [...] The schematic of a typical AMS {{is shown in the}} figure to the right. The Aerodyne AMS is made up of three sections; The aerosol inlet, the particle sizing chamber, and the particle detection chamber. The aerosol inlet has a flow limiting orifice entrance that is around 100 um in diameter. Once in the chamber the sample goes through aerodynamic focusing lens system, which consist of several orifice lenses that are mount in sequence of decreasing inner diameter. [...] The lens focuses the particles into a narrow particle beam.The beam now travels through the particle sizing chamber where the particle aerodynamic diameter is measured. The particle sizing chamber is made up of a flight tube maintained at (~ 10-5 torr). The entrance of the flight tube is a mechanical chopper that's used to modulate the particle beam, then using both the fixed length of the tube and the time-resolved detection at the end the particles velocity can be determined. Using the velocity and the particles diameter is obtained. [...] As the particle beam exit the flight tube, it enters the particle composition detection chamber. In this section the particles collide with a heated tungsten element (~600 °C). At this tungsten element <b>non-refractory</b> components of the particle beam are flash vaporized, and then ionized by EI. Once ionized the sample can be analyzed with either a quadruple (Q), time-of-flight (ToF), or high-resolution (HR)-ToF mass analyzer.|$|E

Only during in the alert period that is <b>non-refractory</b> and sensing is available, intermittent switching X-ray (300 msec/sec) was exposed in chest CT.

Comparisons of ambient PA and LII measurements from four different locations (suburban Toronto; a street canyon with diesel bus traffic in Ottawa; adjacent to a commuter highway in Ottawa and; regional background air in and around Windsor, Ontario), show that different impacts from emission sources and/or atmospheric processes result in different particle light absorption enhancements and hence variations in the SAC. The diversity of measurements obtained, including those with the thermodenuder, demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} identify measurements where the presence of externally-mixed <b>non-refractory</b> particles obscures direct observation of the effect of coating material on the SAC, thus allowing this effect to be measured with more confidence.

40|$|Reactive iodine species play an {{important}} role in the marine atmospheric chemistry. Recent studies show that iodine containing compounds (e. g. I 2 and ICl) are involved in the tropospheric ozone depletion, the enrichment of iodine in marine aerosols and the formation of new particles in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Various laboratory and field measurements report that molecular iodine (I 2) and organoiodine compounds (e. g. CH 3 I, CH 2 I 2) are the most important precursors for reactive iodine in the MBL[1],[2]. However, the identification and quantification of reactive iodine containing compounds are still analytical challenges. Here, we present a new application of the time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (ToF-AMS) for the quantification of gaseous I 2 and ICl in real-time. Time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry enables the real-time analysis of the particle size, the particle mass and the chemical composition of <b>non-refractory</b> aerosols[3]. The aerosol enters the ToF-AMS through a critical orifice of 100 µm inner diameter. An aerodynamic lens system focuses the particles in a size range of 50 - 600 nm as a narrow beam into the vacuum system. While most of the air is removed by a skimmer, the particle beam is transmitted into the particle-sizing chamber. After passing the particle-sizing chamber, the <b>non-refractory</b> particles are flash-vaporized on a heated tungsten surface (500 - 600 °C) and then ionized by electron impact. The generated ions are extracted by an orthogonal extractor into the time-of-flight mass spectrometer, where the time resolve...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{semantic}} degradation disorders, {{the mechanisms}} and the anatomical underpinnings of semantic access disorders are still unclear. We report {{the results of}} a case series study on the effects of temporal lobe gliomas on semantic access abilities of a group of 20 patients. Patients were tested 1 – 2 days before and 4 – 6 days after the removal of the tumour. Their semantic access skills were assessed with two spoken word-to-picture matching tasks, which aimed to separately control for rate of presentation, consistency and serial position effects (Experiment 1) and for word frequency and semantic distance effects (Experiment 2). These variables have been held to be critical in characterizing access in contrast to degraded-store semantic deficits, with access deficits characterized by inconsistency of response, better performance with slower presentation rates and with semantically distant stimuli, in the absence of frequency effects. Degradation deficits show the opposite pattern. Our results showed that low-grade slowly growing tumours tend not to produce signs of access problems. However, high-grade tumours especially within the left hemisphere consistently produce strong semantic deficits of a clear access type: response inconsistency and strong semantic distance effects in the absence of word frequency effects were detected. However, effects of presentation rate and serial position were very weak, suggesting <b>non-refractory</b> behaviour in the tumour patients tested. This evidence, together with the results of lesion overlapping, suggests the presence of a type of <b>non-refractory</b> semantic access deficit. We suggest tha...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Neutral {{hydrogen}} clouds {{with high}} column density detected towards distant quasars are unique probes of elemental nucleosynthesis and chemical {{evolution in the}} low metallicity regime. They provide measurements for several elements at very early times which are unfeasible in other astrophysical environments. Comparison between refractory and <b>non-refractory</b> elements provides evidence {{for the presence of}} dust, and the recently measured Ar probes photoionization. A prominent characteristic is the dominance of a solar abundance pattern, which is somewhat unexpected at low metallicities. It is argued that this property and Nitrogen observations can be used to constrain the age of the Damped Lyα systems and the epoch of star formation. ...|$|E
