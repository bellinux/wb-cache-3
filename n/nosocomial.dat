5|$|In the United States, the {{indications}} for linezolid use {{approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; <b>nosocomial</b> pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae; complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by S. pyogenes or S. aureus. The manufacturer advises {{against the use of}} linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA. In the United Kingdom, pneumonia and cSSSIs are the only indications noted in the product labeling.|$|E
25|$|Early {{prosthetic}} valve endocarditis {{is usually}} due to intraoperative contamination or a postoperative bacterial contamination {{which is usually}} <b>nosocomial</b> in nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} reports {{submitted by}} foreign experts which support {{the assumption of}} a <b>nosocomial</b> infection, lack epidemiological evidence and scientific proof.|$|E
25|$|In Chile, 70,000 <b>nosocomial</b> {{infections are}} {{reported}} each year, most commonly from common hospital-borne pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and A.baumanii.|$|E
25|$|The Texas Department of State Health Services has {{provided}} guidelines for hospitals {{to detect and}} {{prevent the spread of}} <b>nosocomial</b> infection due to legionella.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, around 300,000 {{patients}} contract <b>nosocomial</b> infections {{each year}} and at least 5,000 patients die of complications from infections contracted in hospitals.|$|E
25|$|An opportunistic, <b>nosocomial</b> {{pathogen}} of immunocompromised individuals, P. aeruginosa typically infects the airway, urinary tract, burns, and wounds, {{and also}} causes other blood infections.|$|E
25|$|In health-care environments, the {{prevention}} of <b>nosocomial</b> infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Microorganisms {{are known}} to survive on inanimate touch {{surfaces}} for extended periods of time. This can be especially troublesome in hospital environments where patients with immunodeficiencies are at enhanced risk for contracting <b>nosocomial</b> infections (hospital-acquired infection), often with fatal consequences.|$|E
25|$|Among {{people with}} staphylococcal {{bacteremia}} (SAB), {{one study found}} a 29% prevalence of endocarditis in community-acquired SAB versus 5% in <b>nosocomial</b> SAB. However, only 2% of strains were resistant to methicillin and so these numbers may be low in areas of higher resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{mortality}} rate (10.6%) of the infected children (to date) {{is high and}} indicates strong infections. The laboratory results of the infected children conducted following their arrival in Switzerland for treatment indicated high viremia. This type of infection does not correlate to <b>nosocomial</b> infections or non-deliberate negligence.|$|E
25|$|The El-Fatih {{epidemic}} {{is the largest}} documented incident of <b>nosocomial</b> (hospital-induced) infection of HIV in history. The Libyan public was enraged and many foreign medical workers were arrested; six were eventually charged. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi initially blamed the CIA or Mossad for plotting {{to carry out a}} deadly experiment on the Libyan children.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the success}} of these results, a 2-year {{clinical}} trial was conducted to monitor contamination levels of <b>nosocomial</b> bacteria in the dermatology ward and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Kitasato University Hospital. The antimicrobial efficiency of copper on floors, sinks, push plates, showerheads and doorknobs was evaluated by comparing bacterial loads on these surfaces and on their non-copper counterparts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nosocomial</b> {{infections are}} of {{variable}} importance. One {{of the most}} important is complicated sepsis, which was defined as sepsis with organ dysfunction. One variant of MC1R (MC1RR163Q, rs885479) was reported to be associated with lowered risk of developing complicated sepsis during hospitalization after trauma. Thus, if the association is confirmed, MC1R targeting may become a therapeutic option to prevent severe sepsis.|$|E
25|$|Infection of the incisions or of {{the inside}} of the abdomen (peritonitis, abscess) may occur due to release of {{bacteria}} from the bowel during the operation. <b>Nosocomial</b> infections, such as pneumonia, bladder or kidney infections, and sepsis (blood-borne infection) are also possible. Effective short-term use of antibiotics, diligent respiratory therapy, and encouragement of activity within a few hours after surgery can reduce the risks of infections.|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature of}} {{kangaroo}} care was early discharge in the kangaroo position despite prematurity. It has proven successful in improving survival rates of premature and {{low birth weight}} newborns and in lowering the risks of <b>nosocomial</b> infection, severe illness, and lower respiratory tract disease (Conde-Agudelo, Diaz-Rossello, & Belizan, 2003). It also increased exclusive breast feeding and for a longer duration and improved maternal satisfaction and confidence.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{endocarditis}} is healthcare-associated endocarditis {{when the}} infecting organism {{is believed to}} be transmitted in a health care setting like hospital, dialysis unit or a residential nursing home. <b>Nosocomial</b> endocarditis is a form of healthcare associated endocarditis in which the infective organism is acquired during stay in a hospital and it is usually secondary to presence of intravenous catheters, total parenteral nutrition lines, pacemakers, etc.|$|E
25|$|Copper and its alloys {{demonstrated}} antimicrobial activities against multiple-antibiotic-resistant <b>nosocomial</b> {{bacteria and}} C. albicans {{isolated from the}} hospital, whereas stainless steel and PVC did not. Copper and its alloys showed a marked inhibitory effect (88â€“98%) on MTB despite the strain's drug resistance. The researchers concluded that the minimum concentration of copper {{to be an effective}} antimicrobial agent is >55% for yeasts and bacteria. Higher concentrations of copper were found to be necessary to inhibit MTB.|$|E
25|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is {{generally}} interpreted to be a Biosafety Risk Group 1 fungus. It {{is considered an}} opportunistic fungal pathogen of immunocompromised individuals and {{has been reported in}} AIDS-related infections. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has been associated with nasal polyps, lymphadenitis, bone marrow involvement in AIDS patients, infected skin, pseudomeningitis and a case of endophthalmitis. S.salmonicolor is also considered a type 1 allergen and has been known to cause asthma, <b>nosocomial</b> allergic alveolitis, and rhinitis.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{examining}} the scientific attached papers, medical reports and defense memoranda: {{with respect to}} the scientific view and according to known scientific practices, the National Experts Committee deems the outbreak of AIDS in the Al-Fateh Children's Hospital as not having occurred {{as a result of a}} <b>nosocomial</b> infection and having not resulted because of the misuse and/or the reuse of medical instruments. Furthermore, the data available to us did not contradict the possibility of a deliberate transmission of HIV to the infected children.|$|E
25|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} worldwide industry for biomedical devices and tissue engineering related products is already at $180 billion per year, yet this industry continues {{to suffer from}} microbial colonization. No matter the sophistication, microbial infections can develop on all medical devices and tissue engineering constructs. 60-70% of <b>nosocomial</b> or hospital acquired infections {{are associated with the}} implantation of a biomedical device. This leads to 2 million cases annually in the U.S., costing the healthcare system over $5 billion in additional healthcare expenses.|$|E
25|$|Clostridium difficile, an {{anaerobic}} bacterium, is a {{major cause}} of potentially life-threatening disease, including <b>nosocomial</b> diarrheal infections, especially in developed countries. C. difficile endospores can survive for up to five months on surfaces. The pathogen is frequently transmitted by the hands of healthcare workers in hospital environments. C. difficile is currently a leading hospital-acquired infection in the UK, and rivals MRSA as the most common organism to cause hospital acquired infections in the US It is responsible for a series of intestinal health complications, often referred to collectively as Clostridium difficile Associated Disease (CDAD).|$|E
25|$|Biofilms of P. aeruginosa {{can cause}} chronic {{opportunistic}} infections, {{which are a}} serious problem for medical care in industrialized societies, especially for immunocompromised patients and the elderly. They often cannot be treated effectively with traditional antibiotic therapy. Biofilms seem to protect these bacteria from adverse environmental factors. P. aeruginosa can cause <b>nosocomial</b> infections and is considered a model organism {{for the study of}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers consider it important {{to learn more about the}} molecular mechanisms that cause the switch from planktonic growth to a biofilm phenotype and about the role of QS in treatment-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa. This should contribute to better clinical management of chronically infected patients, and should lead to the development of new drugs.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobial {{copper alloy}} touch {{surfaces}} are surfaces {{that are made}} from the metal copper or alloys of copper, such as brass and bronze. Copper and copper alloys have a natural ability to kill harmful microbes relatively rapidly - often within two hours or less (i.e. copper alloy surfaces are antimicrobial). Much of the antimicrobial efficacy work pertaining to copper has been or is currently being conducted at the University of Southampton and Northumbria University (United Kingdom), University of Stellenbosch (South Africa), Panjab University (India), University of Chile (Chile), Kitasato University (Japan), the Instituto do Mar and University of Coimbra (Portugal), and the University of Nebraska and Arizona State University (U.S.). Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of copper alloys to {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>nosocomial</b> infections are on-going at hospitals in the UK, Chile, Japan, South Africa, and the U.S.|$|E
25|$|L. jordanis is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It {{has been}} shown to cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans and is responsible for causing a type of pneumonia commonly referred to as Legionnaires' disease. Lung infection with L. jordanis is sometimes misdiagnosed as a Aspergillus mold infection. This mold also causes a fatal type of pneumonia which L. jordanis is able to mimic. Using human sera, indirect fluorescent antibody tests strongly indicated that unrecognized human infections with L. jordanis may be occurring. A study of patients from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, NY revealed a possible risk of <b>nosocomial</b> infections from shower heads found to contain L. jordanis. After this finding, monthly shower head disinfection procedures were instituted, but about 19% of shower heads remained positive for Legionella. Infections of individuals who are not immunocompromised are also possible.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (<b>nosocomial)</b> transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E
25|$|While {{the number}} of nurses {{providing}} patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of nursing care quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing {{is directly related to}} patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated that patient death, <b>nosocomial</b> infections, cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios. The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of pediatric nursing care quality are sensitive measures of nursing care. Professional nurses {{play a key role in}} successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain. Astute assessment skills are required to intervene successfully and relieve discomfort.33 Maintenance of a patientâ€™s intravenous access is a clear nursing responsibility. Pediatric patients are at increased risk for intravenous infiltration and for significant complications of infiltration, should it occur.|$|E
500|$|U.S. {{guidelines}} recommend either linezolid or vancomycin as the first-line {{treatment for}} hospital-acquired (<b>nosocomial)</b> MRSA pneumonia. Some {{studies have suggested}} that linezolid is better than vancomycin against <b>nosocomial</b> pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by MRSA, perhaps because the penetration of linezolid into bronchial fluids is much higher than that of vancomycin. Several issues in study design have been raised, however, calling into question results that suggest the superiority of linezolid. Regardless, linezolid's advantages include its high bioavailability [...] (because it allows easy switching to oral therapy), and the fact that poor kidney function is not an obstacle to use (whereas achieving the correct dosage of vancomycin in patients with renal insufficiency is very difficult).|$|E
500|$|Conteh {{spent his}} {{professional}} career working with patients suffering from Lassa fever, a {{viral haemorrhagic fever}} endemic to West Africa. [...] Lassa fever was first {{brought to the attention}} of the public in 1969 during an outbreak in Nigeria. Identified in 1972, the disease is known to spread through its host, the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), and infects an estimated 300,000 people and results in 5000 deaths annually in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. In 1976, a <b>nosocomial</b> outbreak in the Panguma Catholic Hospital attracted attention in the United States. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established research programs in Segbwema, Kenema, and Panguma to study the disease.|$|E
2500|$|... 1998: Unicomb et al. {{conduct a}} {{clinical}} study in Bangladesh and conclude astrovirus infections involving <b>nosocomial,</b> acute, and persistent diarrheal diseases ...|$|E
2500|$|Ethanol {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} topical sanitizer against MRSA. Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action. The prevention of <b>nosocomial</b> infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in [...] NAV-CO2 systems have an advantage, as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments, and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} 20 years, common {{bacteria}} including Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus, have developed resistance to various antibiotics such as vancomycin, {{as well as}} whole classes of antibiotics, such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (<b>nosocomial)</b> infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{carriage}} of S. aureus is {{an important}} source of hospital-acquired infection (also called <b>nosocomial)</b> and community-acquired MRSA. [...] Although S. aureus can be present on the skin of the host, a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears. The ability of the nasal passages to harbour [...] S. aureus results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacterium's ability to evade host innate immunity. Nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections.|$|E
2500|$|An {{empirical}} {{regimen of}} antimicrobials should be chosen {{based on the}} pattern of bacterial susceptibility and <b>nosocomial</b> infections in the affected area and medical center {{and the degree of}} neutropenia. Broad-spectrum empirical therapy (see below for choices) with high doses of one or more antibiotics should be initiated at the onset of fever. These antimicrobials should be directed at the eradication of Gram-negative aerobic bacilli ( [...] i.e., Enterobacteriace, Pseudomonas [...] ) that account for more than three quarters of the isolates causing sepsis. Because aerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacteria (mostly alpha-hemolytic streptococci) cause sepsis in {{about a quarter of the}} victims, coverage for these organisms may also be needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nosocomial</b> {{infections are}} {{estimated}} to make patients {{stay in the hospital}} four to five additional days. Around 2004-2005, about 9,000 people died each year with a <b>nosocomial</b> infection, of which about 4,200 would have survived without this infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nosocomial</b> myiasis is myiasis {{acquired}} {{in a hospital}} setting. It is quite frequent, as patients with open wounds or sores can be infested if flies are present. To prevent <b>nosocomial</b> myiasis, hospital rooms must be kept free of flies.|$|E
