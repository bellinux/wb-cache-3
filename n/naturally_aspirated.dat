5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E
5|$|The Chevrolet CobaltSS {{comprises}} three sport compact {{versions of}} the Chevrolet Cobalt that were built on the General Motors Delta platform at Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, United States. The three versions included two forced induction inline‑four Ecotec engines and a third <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine that was later called the CobaltSport. SS is an abbreviation of Super Sport, a moniker used by Chevrolet to denote high performance upgrades for the vehicle that meet certain criteria.|$|E
5|$|Three {{individual}} models, or grades, {{were available}} on the car's release in 2006; S, M, and G, in ascending order of price. They all shared the same five-door hatchback body style and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base S model was given the new <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> powerplant, and was positioned below the two new grades, L and LX, whose engine it shared.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) are <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> {{usually by}} the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|While driving, {{after the}} Volt battery {{has dropped to}} a {{predetermined}} threshold from full charge, a small <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> 1.4 L 4-cylinder gasoline fueled internal combustion engine (Opel's Family 0) with approximately , powers a 55kW generator to extend the Volt's range. The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E
5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} {{differentiate}} the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed automatic transmissions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E
25|$|The Series 4 (1985–1988) was {{available}} with a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> fuel-injected 13B-VDEI producing 146hp (108kW) in North American spec. An optional turbocharged model, (1985–1988) {{known as the}} Turbo II in the American market, had 182hp / 185PS (136kW). The Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher compression ratio, 9.7:1 for the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> Series5 FC made 160hp (119kW), while the Series5 Turbo made 200hp / 205PS (151kW).|$|E
25|$|The <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> came as {{standard}} {{issue with the}} W58 manual transmission. The turbo versions included the more robust R154 manual transmission. Both were available with the optional 4-speed A340E automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{range was}} {{available}} with 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0L petrol engines, with the 1.8-litre four available with an optional turbocharger. The VG20ET V6 was offered {{for the first}} time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed – as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.|$|E
25|$|For this generation, the Supra {{received}} a new six-speed Getrag/Toyota V160 gearbox on the turbo models while the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> models made {{do with a}} five-speed manual W58, revised from the previous version. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode. All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminium alloy wheels, the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> model had 16-inch wheels and the turbo models were 17-inch. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver spare tire on a steel rim to save both space and weight.|$|E
25|$|VW {{offers a}} choice of two engine options; a 1.6 litre <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> petrol engine mated to a {{five-speed}} manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox and a 1.6 litre diesel engine mated only to a five-speed manual gearbox (TDI).|$|E
25|$|Williams Advanced Engineering {{announced}} in August 2017 a collaboration with Singer Vehicle Design. The first fruit {{of this work}} is a modified, <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> air-cooled, flat-six Porsche 911 engine with a 4.0L capacity, four-valves per cylinder and four cam-shafts, rated at 500HP.|$|E
25|$|The Cruze also {{entered the}} British Touring Car Championship for 2010 and 2011. Jason Plato won the {{championship}} for Chevrolet in 2010 and finished 3rd in 2011. The BTCC Cruze used the 2.0-liter <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine {{found in the}} original variant of the WTCC Cruze.|$|E
25|$|Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, the XV40 {{made its}} North American sales debut in March 2006 as a 2007 model. For the first time, a gasoline/electric hybrid version of Camry was offered in {{addition}} to the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> four- and six-cylinder engines.|$|E
25|$|The Honda City Turbo was a sport compact / hot hatch {{produced}} by Japanese automaker Honda between September 1982 and 1986, {{based on the}} <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> Honda City AA. For a long time the City Turbo {{was one of the}} few non-kei car Hondas to be equipped with a turbocharged engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine is}} a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> 4-cylinder, 2.5-litre Millington Diamond Engine {{producing}} 350 BHP. Transmission is via a six-speed gearbox, manual or semi-automatic, and by mechanical {{front and rear}} differentials with the option of mechanical or active central differential. The car can be produced in either 2 or 4 wheel drive formats.|$|E
25|$|The GT500 {{version of}} the car has a {{completely}} different drivetrain compared to the production car. The race car is upgraded to a VK45DE 4.5-litre <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> V8 instead of the twinturbo V6 VR38DETT. It uses a 6 speed sequential manual gearbox and a RWD layout from its predecessor, the 350Z race car.|$|E
25|$|Toleman's {{entry to}} Formula One was {{announced}} in November 1980. Discussions took place with Lancia over the supply of a turbocharged engine, but the team decided to use a turbocharged version of the Hart F2 engine. By that time, Formula One was beginning {{to be dominated by}} turbo-powered cars, leaving the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engines lagging behind.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> and {{turbocharged}} versions were built, but the all-alloy engine blocks failed {{under the}} much greater pressures involved in diesel operation. The project was, therefore, abandoned. The effort {{to strengthen the}} Rover V8 for diesel operation was not, however, completely wasted; the 4.2-litre petrol variant of the engine used crankshaft castings developed in the Iceberg project.|$|E
25|$|First fuel {{consumption}} and then turbocharger boost were restricted to 4-bar in 1987 and 1.5-bar in 1988. By 1988, the turbos were {{only slightly more}} powerful than the lighter 3.5-litre <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> cars that had been introduced the previous year. The thirsty turbo engines briefly saw refuelling introduced into the sport, but this was banned for 1984.|$|E
25|$|The long-awaited {{turbocharged}} inline-four {{petrol engine}} from Proton was revealed at the 2010 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show. Officially {{known as the}} 1.6L CamPro CFE, {{it is capable of}} producing power and torque figures of 138bhp (103kW) at 5,000 rpm and 205 N·m at 2,000–4,000 rpm respectively, comparable to a 2.0L <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine, while achieving better fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{the members}} of the J-6 Whirlwind family, the R-760 had larger {{cylinders}} than the R-790. The piston stroke of 5.5in (14.0cm) was unchanged, but the cylinder bore was expanded to 5.0in (12.7cm) from the R-790's bore of 4.5in (11.4cm). While the R-790 was <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> the R-760, like the other J-6 engines, had a gear-driven supercharger to boost its power output.|$|E
25|$|The company later {{switched}} to the large-displacement <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> formula for the 275, 340, and 375 F1 cars. The Alfa Romeo team dominated the 1950 Formula One season, winning all eleven events it entered (six World Championship events and five non-Championship races), but Ferrari broke their streak in 1951 when rotund driver José Froilán González took first place at the 1951 British Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced {{induction}} {{device that}} increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra {{air into the}} combustion chamber. This improvement over a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine's power output {{is due to the}} fact that the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone.|$|E
25|$|Today, most general {{aviation}} piston engine powered aircraft are <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated.</b> Modern aviation piston engines designed {{to run at}} high altitudes typically include a turbocharger (either high pressure or turbonormalized) rather than a supercharger. The change in thinking {{is largely due to}} economics. Aviation gasoline was once plentiful and cheap, favoring the simple, but fuel-hungry supercharger. As the cost of fuel has increased, the supercharger has fallen out of favor.|$|E
25|$|The Jim Clark Trophy was {{introduced}} in the 1987 Formula One season for drivers of cars with <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engines but was discontinued after turbo-charged engines were restricted in 1988 and dropped for 1989. The Jim Clark Memorial Award is an annual award given by the Association of Scottish Motoring Writers to Scots who have contributed significantly to transport and motor sport. The Jim Clark Rally is an annual event held in Berwickshire.|$|E
25|$|Designed and {{produced}} specifically {{to compete in}} the FIA GT1 World Championship, the GT-R NISMO GT1 is based on the road-going version of the Nissan GT-R and was the only car to have ever been constructed implicitly to the GT1 technical regulations. The GT-R NISMO GT1 is powered by a NISMO race-prepped VK56DE, a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> V8 engine that displaces 5,552 cc. It measures 80.3 inches in width, 186.2 inches in length, and has a wheelbase of 109.4 inches.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Rowledge, one of Napier's chief {{engineers}} and the {{designer of the}} Napier Lion engine, became fed up with management and left for Rolls. In this one move any Napier design effort ended while Rolls' received a boost. Applying every known advance since the D-12 was introduced, Rowledge designed the new engine to use supercharging at all altitudes, allowing it to outperform <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engines {{by as much as}} they were willing to increase the boost pressure.|$|E
25|$|The H.W.A Mercedes-AMG M271 {{was based}} on a 1.8 litre 4-cylinder from the C-Klasse, bored out to the {{regulation}} 2.0 litre capacity. Formula Three engine regulations demand a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated,</b> 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, production-based specification, with a capacity of not more than 2000cc. The M271 made its competitive debut in the 2002 German Formula 3 Championship in two of Mücke Motorsport's three Dallara F302 chassis, driven by Markus Winkelhock and Marcel Lasse. Winkelhock achieved Mercedes' first F3 win at the Nürburgring in August 2002.|$|E
25|$|There were {{a number}} of driver changes prior to the event, Darryl O'Young left Special Tuning Racing and later {{returned}} to bamboo-engineering. His replacement at STR was German racing driver and former FIA GT1 World Championship team owner René Münnich. Masaki Kano joined Liqui Moly Team Engstler for his home event, driving a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> BMW 320si. Fellow Japanese racer Hiroki Yoshimoto joined Tuenti Racing Team for the event, driving the SUNRED SR León 1.6T raced up until the last event by Tiago Monteiro.|$|E
25|$|This {{hybrid system}} was {{present on the}} GM H-body cars in 94–95, W-body cars (Buick Regal, Chevrolet Lumina ('95 only), Chevrolet Monte Carlo ('95 only), Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme) in 94–95, L-body (Chevrolet Beretta/Corsica) in 94–95, Y-body (Chevrolet Corvette) in 94–95, on the F-body (Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird) in 95 and on the J-Body (Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire) and N-Body (Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Achieva, Pontiac Grand Am) in 95 and 96 and also on '94–'95 Saab {{vehicles}} with the <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> 2.3.|$|E
25|$|The Chevrolet Cruze {{first entered}} the World Touring Car Championship in 2009 with a 2.0-litre <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine, taking six wins in its debut season. The car has proved {{successful}} since its entry, with Yvan Muller winning the championship in 2010 {{and again in}} 2011 using the new 1.6-litre turbocharged engine. Chevrolet placed first, second and third in 2011, with Muller finishing ahead of teammates Rob Huff and Alain Menu. Chevrolet finished 1–2–3 again in 2012, this time, Huff becoming champion ahead of Menu and Muller.|$|E
25|$|Turbocharger lag (turbo lag) is {{the time}} {{required}} to change power output in response to a throttle change, noticed as a hesitation or slowed throttle response when accelerating as compared to a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> engine. This is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbocharger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as spooling. Inertia, friction, and compressor load are the primary contributors to turbocharger lag. Superchargers do not suffer this problem, because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true turbocharging. This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite a win in Detroit, {{registered}} {{as the last}} victory for a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> car {{until the end of}} the turbo-era in 1989, after Nelson Piquet's leading Brabham suffered a rear tyre deflation in the closing stages, Alboreto failed to finish in the points consistently and, with only one further points finish at Zandvoort, the Italian finished the season with ten points and down in twelfth position. However, it was announced that the Italian would partner René Arnoux at Ferrari. Replacing Patrick Tambay, he became the first Italian driver to race for the marque in over a decade.|$|E
