5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the <b>nutrient</b> <b>load,</b> especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
25|$|Anthropogenic actions {{also can}} cause eutrophication, or {{increase}} the <b>nutrient</b> <b>load,</b> of marine ecosystems, through runoff {{into the system}} containing fertilizer, sewage, dishwasher soap, and other nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich substances. Eutrophication is pervasive in coastal marine ecosystems (Lotze et al. 2006) and can indirectly initiate trophic cascades and increase consumer control of plants. For example, insect herbivory in marshes has been positively correlated with nutrient availability in Atlantic salt marshes (Bertness et al. 2008). In Narragansett Bay, insect herbivory suppresses primary production of human disturbed salt marshes by almost 40%. Nitrogen additions through human activity can increase insect herbivory so much that primary production is suppressed by nearly 60%, while marshes without human shoreline development remain solely under bottom-up control (Bertness et al. 2008). Increased nutrient supply can lead to runaway herbivory in other systems as well (Gough and Grace 1998, Silliman and Zieman 2001).|$|E
2500|$|Nutrient source {{apportionment}} is used {{to estimate}} the <b>nutrient</b> <b>load</b> from various sectors entering water bodies, following attenuation or treatment. Agriculture is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries {{tend to be the}} dominant contributors of phosphorus. Where water quality is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources. There are two broad approaches to load apportionment modelling, (i) load-orientated approaches which apportion origin based on in-stream monitoring data and (ii) source-orientated approaches where amounts of diffuse, or nonpoint source pollution, emissions are calculated using models typically based on export coefficients from catchments with similar characteristics. For example, the Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) takes the latter approach, estimating the relative contribution of sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in Irish catchments without in-stream monitoring data by integrating information on point discharges (urban wastewater, industry and septic tank systems), diffuse sources (pasture, arable, forestry, etc.), and catchment data, including hydrogeological characteristics.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> is {{a leading}} cause of global {{seagrass}} decline, triggering shifts from seagrass-to macroalgal-dominance. Within seagrass meadows of Xincun Bay (South China Sea), we found that <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> (due to fish farming) increased sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity associated with carbon cyding (polyphenol oxidase, invertase and cellulase), with a corresponding decrease in percent sediment organic carbon (SOC), suggesting that nutrients primed microorganism and stimulated SOC remineralization. Surpisingly, however, the relative contribution of seagrass-derived carbon to bacteria (delta C- 13 (bacteria)) increased with <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading,</b> despite popular theory being that microbes switch to consuming macroalgae which are assumed to provide a more labile carbon source. Organic carbon sources of fungi were unaffected by <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading.</b> Overall, this study suggests that <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> changes the relative contribution of seagrass and algal sources to SOC pools, boosting sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, thereby possibly changing seagrass blue carbon.

50|$|The 2001 Action Plan is a {{national}} strategy to reduce Gulf hypoxia {{with a focus on}} reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient loads to the northern Gulf coming from the Mississippi River. The Action Plan proposes three goals: a Coastal Goal, a Within Basin Goal, and a Quality of Life Goal. The Coastal Goal intends to reduce the square mileage of hypoxia in the Gulf to 5,000 square kilometers by the implementation of actions to reduce the discharge of nutrients into the Gulf. The Within Basin Goal is to restore and protect the waters of the Mississippi River Basin by implementing nutrient and sedimentation reduction actions that will protect human health and aquatic organisms and reduce the <b>nutrient</b> <b>load</b> released into the Gulf. Lastly, the Quality of Life Goal is to improve communities across the Mississippi River Basin through land management and an incentive based approach. The Action Plan states that by December 2005, and every five years thereafter, the Task Force will review the reductions in <b>nutrient</b> <b>load</b> discharge and the response of the dead zone in the Gulf.

40|$|A large, {{annually}} recurring {{region of}} hypoxia {{in the northern}} Gulf of Mexico {{has been attributed to}} water stratification and <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> of nitrogen and phosphorus delivered by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. This <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> increased nearly 300 % since 1950, primarily due to increased use of agricultural fertilizers. Over this same time period, the red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) population in the Gulf of Mexico has shifted strongly from being dominated by the eastern Gulf of Mexico to being dominated by the northern and western Gulf of Mexico, with the bulk of the current population in the same regions with significant <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in or near areas with development of mid-summer hypoxic zones. The population decline of red snapper in the eastern Gulf is almost certainly attributable to overfishing, but the cause of the population increase in the northern and western Gulf is subject to broad debate, with the impact of artificial reefs (primarily oil platforms which have incr eased greatly since the 1960 s) being the most contentious point. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> has been shown to positively impact secondary production of fish in many marine systems. The present paper offers the hypothesis that increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> has contributed significantly to increased red snapper population in the northern and western Gulf of Mexico. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> may be working in synergy with the abundant oil platforms both increasing primary production and providing structure encouraging red snapper to feed throughout the water column...|$|R

Estimations of <b>nutrient</b> <b>loads</b> into the lakeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s brackish water, from agriculture and fish ponds, were assessed.

40|$|Quantitative {{evidence}} of sudden shifts in ecological {{structure and function}} in large shallow lakes is rare, even though they provide essential benefits to society. Such ‘regime shifts’ can be driven by human activities which degrade ecological stability including water level control (WLC) and <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading.</b> Interactions between WLC and <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> on the long-term dynamics of shallow lake ecosystems are, however, often overlooked and largely underestimated, which has hampered the effectiveness of lake management. Here, we focus on a large shallow lake (Lake Chaohu) located {{in one of the}} most densely populated areas in China, the lower Yangtze River floodplain, which has undergone both WLC and increasing <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> over the last several decades. We applied a novel methodology that combines consistent evidence from both paleolimnological records and ecosystem modeling to overcome the hurdle of data insufficiency and to unravel the drivers and underlying mechanisms in ecosystem dynamics. We identified the occurrence of two regime shifts: one in 1963, characterized by the abrupt disappearance of submerged vegetation, and another around 1980, with strong algal blooms being observed thereafter. Using model scenarios, we further disentangled the roles of WLC and <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading,</b> showing that the 1963 shift was predominantly triggered by WLC, whereas the shift ca. 1980 was attributed to aggravated <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading.</b> Our analysis also shows interactions between these two stressors. Compared to the dynamics driven by <b>nutrient</b> <b>loading</b> alone, WLC reduced the critical P loading and resulted in earlier disappearance of submerged vegetation and emergence of algal blooms by approximately 26 and 10 years, respectively.

These plants were all promoted at the time as having the virtues of [...] "herculean proportions" [...] and [...] "splendid invasiveness" [...] which meant that ordinary people could buy them for the cost of a packet of seeds to rival the expensive orchids grown in the greenhouses of the rich. Within ten years, however, Himalayan balsam had escaped from the confines of cultivation and begun to spread along the river systems of England. Today it has spread across most of the UK and some local wildlife trusts organise [...] "balsam bashing" [...] events to help control the plant. However, a recent study (Hejda & Pyšek, 2006) concludes that in some circumstances, such efforts may cause more harm than good. Destroying riparian stands of Himalayan Balsam can open up the habitat for more aggressive invasive plants such as Japanese knotweed and aid in seed dispersal (by dropped seeds sticking to shoes). Riparian habitat is suboptimal for I. glandulifera, and spring or autumn flooding destroys seeds and plants. The research suggests that the optimal way to control the spread of riparian Himalayan Balsam is to decrease eutrophication, thereby permitting the better-adapted local vegetation that gets outgrown by the balsam on watercourses with high <b>nutrient</b> <b>load</b> to rebound naturally. They caution that these conclusions do probably not hold true for stands of the plant at forest edges and meadow habitats, where manual destruction is still the best approach.|$|E

For example, eutrophication initiates top-down control via the impact of snow geese on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to oxygenate the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable environment for marsh plants disallows sexual recruitment to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by clonal runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).|$|E

Lake Tarpon can be visited at Anderson Park, Chesnut Park, or several other public access points.The lake is a regional recreational destination and is renowned for its largemouth bass fishing.Although Lake Tarpon is designated as a fishing and swimming lake, it fails to meet the EPA's standards, and is therefore listed as an impaired lake because it is over polluted. Lake Tarpon is not in attainment because the waters exceed its Total Maximum Daily Load (or TMDL) for Nutrients {{and as a result}} of excessive nutrients, low Dissolved Oxygen. Part of the pollution that enters Lake Tarpon is caused by fertilizers that have caused algae and unwanted weeds to grow. Some have suggested using liquid fertilizer to stop this. The logic being that liquid fertilizers are taken up by the plants while granular fertilizers are more likely to run off in rain water. [...] Another problem Lake Tarpon faces is having low dissolved oxygen. As the <b>nutrient</b> <b>load</b> in the water increases, so do bacteria and other micro-organisms that consume the excess nutrients. These micro-organisms are largely aerobic (require oxygen to live). The micro-organisms consume the oxygen in the water, thus lowering the Dissolved Oxygen. The resultant decreased Dissolved Oxygen lowers biodiversity in the ecosystem. Increased nutrients in the water also increase the turbidity (murkiness) that recent samples show), and as a result can cause hypoxia (low oxygen) or a dead zone where life is unsustainable, as exemplified in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
