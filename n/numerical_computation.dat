5|$|Theoretical {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of <b>numerical</b> <b>computation</b> of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E

25|$|A full {{solution}} of QCD should give a full {{description of the}} vacuum, confinement and the hadron spectrum. Lattice QCD is making rapid progress towards providing the solution as a systematically improvable <b>numerical</b> <b>computation.</b> However, approximate models of the QCD vacuum remain useful in more restricted domains.

25|$|Computer algebra, {{also called}} {{symbolic}} computation or algebraic computation is a scientific area {{that refers to}} the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects. Although, properly speaking, computer algebra should be a subfield of scientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on <b>numerical</b> <b>computation</b> with approximate floating point numbers, while symbolic computation emphasizes exact computation with expressions containing variables that have not any given value and are thus manipulated as symbols (therefore the name of symbolic computation).|$|E

He calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat eccentrically, to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd.|$|E

In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to termination analysis of <b>numerical</b> <b>computations</b> in logic programs. Traditional approaches fail to analyse them due to non well-foundedness of the integers. We present a technique that allows to overcome these difficulties. Our approach is based on transforming a program in way that allows integrating and extending techniques originally developed for analysis of <b>numerical</b> <b>computations</b> in the framework of query-mapping pairs with the well-known framework of acceptability. Such an integration not only contributes to the understanding of termination behaviour of <b>numerical</b> <b>computations,</b> but also allows to perform a correct analysis of such computations automatically, thus, extending previous work on a constraints-based approach to termination. In the last section of the paper we discuss possible extensions of the technique, including incorporating general term orderings. ...|$|R
