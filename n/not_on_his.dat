5|$|In {{the initial}} oil {{study for the}} {{defeated}} warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Music took on {{a pivotal}} and {{permanent}} role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become {{a regular part of}} his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.|$|E

Canberra sailed to Southampton, Hampshire where she was quickly refitted, sailing on 9 April for the South Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|In {{all these}} cases, the father might dower her. If he did <b>not,</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> death the {{brothers}} were obligated to do so, {{giving her a}} full child's share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share {{if she were a}} hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if they had any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.|$|E
25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal would have been better off if he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership of the Christian coalition was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{preparation}} involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for old books, in which priests, teachers, professors {{and others who}} owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal {{was accompanied by a}} list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania. His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years. In his turn, Moldovan {{sent a letter to the}} province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> initial list.|$|E

500|$|For centuries, hagiographers {{and historians}} have {{emphasized}} Ladislaus's {{prominent role in}} the consolidation of the Christian monarchy.

500|$|As a {{reminder}} of Morrell's brief Antarctic exploits, Morrell Island, at 59°27'S, 27°19'W, is an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands. During his Pacific travels Morrell encountered groups of islands that were <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> charts, treated them as new discoveries and named them after various New York acquaintances – Westervelt, Bergh, Livingstone, Skiddy. One was named [...] "Young William Group" [...] after Morrell's infant son. None of these names appear in modern maps, although the [...] "Livingstone Group" [...] has been identified with Namonuito Atoll, and [...] "Bergh's Group" [...] with the Chuuk Islands.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some in the}} Conservative party {{agreed with}} Wilson (and Jo Grimond, the Liberal leader) that the Conservatives would have won the 1964 {{election}} if Butler had been Prime Minister, The Times observed, [...] "it should not be overlooked that in October 1963 Home took over a Government whose morale was shattered and whose standing in the opinion polls was abysmal. A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [...] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement." [...] However, looking back across Home's career, The Times considered that his reputation rested <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: [...] "He brought to the office... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted {{as a lack of}} sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect." ...|$|E

500|$|Flixton House, a late 18th-century Grade II listed {{building}} set in Flixton Park and Gardens, {{was the focus}} of one of the first footpath battles in England after its owner, Ralph Wright, in 1824 closed several footpaths crossing his estate. [...] Local residents accepted the closures, but Wright also attempted to change the route of footpaths <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> land, ploughing the entrance to one and sowing it with oats. [...] A local farmer, Samuel Wood, objected to Wright's tactics and removed each obstruction, restoring the footpath. [...] Wright successfully gained an order supporting his changes at his third attempt, but by then the case had attracted considerable interest and in 1826 the Manchester Society for the Preservation of Ancient Footpaths was formed. [...] After several years of expensive legal wrangling, Wright's order was quashed and in June 1827 the footpaths affected were reopened. [...] Wright obtained further orders and again closed the footpaths, before the matter was finally resolved at the Quarter Session on 29October that year, to Wright's cost. His loss proved to be an important event in the movement for footpath preservation in England.|$|E
