We proposed the notions of entropy- and conductance-community structures. It was shown that the two definitions of the entropy- and conductance-community structures {{and the notion of}} modularity proposed by physicists are all equivalent in defining community structures of <b>networks,</b> <b>that</b> neither randomness in the ER model nor preferential attachment in the PA model is the mechanism of community structures of <b>networks,</b> and <b>that</b> the existence of community structures is a universal phenomenon in real networks. This poses a fundamental question: What are the mechanisms of community structures of real networks? To answer this question, we proposed a homophyly model of networks. It was shown <b>that</b> <b>networks</b> of our model satisfy a series of new topological, probabilistic and combinatorial principles, including a fundamental principle, a community structure principle, a degree priority principle, a widths principle, an inclusion and infection principle, a king node principle and a predicting principle etc. The new principles provide a firm foundation for a structural theory of networks. Our homophyly model demonstrates that homophyly is the underlying mechanism of community structures of <b>networks,</b> <b>that</b> nodes of the same community share common features, that power law and small world property are never obstacles of the existence of community structures in <b>networks,</b> <b>that</b> community structures are definable in <b>networks,</b> and <b>that</b> (natural) communities are interpretable...|$|R

This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
