5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, {{and that it would}} not be used for shading.|$|E
5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Game 1 {{was held}} in Washington, where Capitals owner Ted Leonsis took steps to prevent Penguins' fans from {{purchasing}} tickets, such as <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> tickets to customers whose 724 or 412 area code indicated they were from Western Pennsylvania. Crosby scored to give the Penguins a first period lead, but Washington scored two goals before {{the conclusion of the}} period. Mark Eaton tied the game in the second period, but Washington's Semyon Varlamov held the Penguins scoreless {{for the remainder of the}} game as the Capitals took a 1–0 lead in the series. The game had 40%more viewers than playoff games the previous season. In Game 2, Ovechkin and Crosby scored three goals each, though Dave Steckel's second period goal was the difference as Washington won 4–3.|$|E

25|$|In 1746, Gainsborough married Margaret Burr, {{an illegitimate}} {{daughter}} of the Duke of Beaufort, who settled a £200 annuity on them.

25|$|In 1951, Jordan {{assembled}} a short-lived big band that included Pee Wee Moore and others, {{at a time}} when big bands were declining in popularity.

By the mid-1950s, Jordan's records were <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> as well as before, and he left Decca Records.|$|E

25|$|As {{electrification}} progressed, the old {{rolling stock}} was advertised for sale. An attempt {{to sell the}} 18 locomotives and 96 carriages by auction in June 1903 proved completely unsuccessful – the auctioneer had to remind the bidders that he was <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> scrap. It was September before the first locomotive was sold; it would take another two years to sell all-bar-one of the locomotives. The last locomotive — which had been retained for working permanent way trains — was sold in January 1908.|$|E
25|$|The founders {{original}} {{plan was to}} sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels.

In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.|$|E

25|$|By 1959, BMW was in {{debt and}} losing money. The Isetta was selling well but with small profit margins. Their 501-based luxury sedans were <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> well enough to be {{profitable}} and were becoming increasingly outdated. Their 503 coupé and 507 roadster were too expensive to be profitable. Their 600, a four-seater based on the Isetta, was selling poorly. The motorcycle market imploded in the mid-1950s with increased affluence turning Germans away from motorcycles and toward cars. BMW had sold their Allach plant to MAN in 1954. American Motors and the Rootes Group had both tried to acquire BMW.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} resolve its {{problems}} the studio stopped production for two months. Collins then refocused {{the company on}} producing niche-themed pornography, and discontinued some series that had more ambiguous themes and were <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> well. The firms logo and box-cover art was also redesigned and simplified. It hired a new DVD authoring contractor, and launched a new PR campaign. The company {{then went back to}} producing as many as eight new titles a month. Production was also halted for a month in early 2004 when the studio joined the moratorium on filming caused by Darren James's HIV infection.|$|E
25|$|Sony {{announced}} on February 3, 2005, that the PSP {{would go on}} sale in North America on , 2005, in one configuration for a MSRP of US$249/CA$299. Some expressed concern over the high price, which was almost US$20 higher than the system's price in Japan and more than $100 higher than the recently launched Nintendo DS. Despite the concerns, the PSP's North American launch was a success, although reports two weeks later indicated that the system was <b>not</b> <b>selling</b> as well as expected despite Sony's claim that 500,000 units had been sold {{in the first two}} days.|$|E
