5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a <b>naval</b> <b>court</b> martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} made nine official inquiries into the attack between 1941 and 1946, and a tenth in 1995. They included an inquiry by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox (1941); the Roberts Commission (1941–42); the Hart Inquiry (1944); the Army Pearl Harbor Board (1944); the <b>Naval</b> <b>Court</b> of Inquiry (1944); the Hewitt investigation; the Clarke investigation; the Congressional Inquiry (Pearl Harbor Committee; 1945–46); a top-secret inquiry by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, authorized by Congress {{and carried out}} by Henry Clausen (the Clausen Inquiry; 1946); and the Thurmond-Spence hearing, in April 1995, which produced the Dorn Report. The inquiries reported incompetence, underestimation, and misapprehension of Japanese capabilities and intentions; problems resulting from excessive secrecy about cryptography; division of responsibility between Army and Navy (and lack of consultation between them); and lack of adequate manpower for intelligence (analysis, collection, processing).|$|E

25|$|In 1844, Cooper's Proceedings of the <b>naval</b> <b>court</b> martial in {{the case}} of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, a {{commander}} in the navy of the United States, , was first published in Graham's Magazine of 1843–44. It was a review of the court martial of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie who had hanged three crew members of the brig USS Sommers for mutiny while at sea. One of the hanged men, 19-year-old Philip Spencer, was the son of U.S. Secretary of War John C. Spencer. He was executed without court-martial along with two other sailors aboard the Somers for allegedly attempting mutiny. Prior to this affair, Cooper {{was in the process of}} giving harsh review to Mackenzie's version of the Battle of Lake Erie. Mackenzie had previously given harsh criticism to Cooper's interpretation of the Battle of Lake Erie contained in Cooper's History of the Navy of the United States, 1839. However, he still felt sympathetic to Mackenzie over his pending court martial.|$|E

2500|$|The battle {{marked the}} {{culmination}} of [...] the Cuban Wars for Independence that had been waged by Cuban revolutionaries against Spanish imperial power for several decades.

2500|$|Although Spain apologized, on February 13, 1898, the Maine {{exploded}} {{and sank}} in Havana Harbor, Cuba, two days later, killing 266 American sailors. After a hasty <b>naval</b> <b>court</b> of inquiry, the American press blamed Spain and {{accused them of}} planting a mine that sank the battleship. The war with Spain {{became known as the}} “Correspondents’ War”. Journalists not only wrote stories about the conflict, but took part in the fight. In 1898, the prestige of the press ran high. American society was changing as literacy rates increased. There was a new revolution of readers. As war zones became more open to the press, journalists wrote eyewitness accounts of what was happening. In an era before radio and television, newspapers were the main source of information, opinion, and entertainment for the American public. [...] "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war", newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst declared. In New York City, where the population was about 2,800,000, the combined circulation of daily papers was about 2,000,000.|$|E
2500|$|In early July 1839 a {{group of}} British {{merchant}} sailors in Kowloon became intoxicated after consuming rice liqueur. Two of the sailors became agitated with and beat to death Lin Weixi, a villager from nearby Tsim Sha Tsui. Superintendent Elliot ordered the arrest of the two men, and paid compensation to Lin's family and village. However, he refused a request to turn the sailors over to Chinese authorities. Commissioner Lin saw this as an obstruction of justice, and ordered the sailors to be handed over. Elliot instead held a trial for the accused men aboard a warship at sea, with himself serving as the judge and merchant captains serving as jurors. He invited the Qing authorities to observe and comment on the proceedings, but the offer was declined. The <b>naval</b> <b>court</b> convicted 5 sailors of assault and rioting, and sentenced them to a fines along with hard labor in Britain (this verdict would later be overturned in British courts.) ...|$|E

Three weeks later, at 21:40, on 15 February, an explosion on board Maine {{occurred in the}} Havana Harbor (coordinates: 23°08′07″N 82°20′38″W). Later investigations revealed that more than [...] of powder charges for the vessel's six- and ten-inch guns had detonated, obliterating the forward third of the ship. The remaining wreckage rapidly settled {{to the bottom of}} the harbor. Most of Maines crew were sleeping or resting in the enlisted quarters, in the forward part of the ship, when the explosion occurred. In total, 260 men lost their lives as a result of the explosion or shortly thereafter, and six more died later from injuries. Captain Sigsbee and most of the officers survived, because their quarters were in the aft portion of the ship. Altogether there were 89 survivors, 18 of whom were officers. On 21 March, the U.S. <b>Naval</b> <b>Court</b> of Inquiry, in Key West, declared that a naval mine caused the explosion.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the inquiry commissioned by the Spanish government to naval officers Del Peral and De Salas, two <b>Naval</b> <b>Courts</b> of Inquiry were ordered: The Sampson Board in 1898 and the Vreeland board in 1911.

All investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused {{the destruction of the}} ship, but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded.|$|R

On July 24, 1824, Boarman temporarily took command of the schooner USS Weazel from Commodore David Porter during which time he was on convoy duty and patrolled for pirates. That summer, Boarman captured a pirate ship off the coast of Crab Island but its crew managed to escape to shore. In September, he escorted three American merchant ships from Havana, Cuba to Campeachy, and then carried $65,000 from Tampico which was to be shipped to New York.
