25|$|The 2014 Gwar-B-Q went on {{as planned}} at Hadad's Lake on August 16, preceded by a public {{memorial}} service the day before. On August 20, 2014, only days after the band's first performance without Brockie, Gwar officially released tour dates for the Gwar Eternal Tour 2014. Also featuring American Sharks, Decapitated, and Corrosion of Conformity, the tour will span the United States and Canada from October through December. Gwar later played the 2014 Riot Fest in Chicago on September 12 through the 14th, confirming that the Gwar-B-Q was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one</b> off performance for the band. Gwar debuted their new character Vulvatron at Riot Fest in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|This {{match was}} {{scheduled}} in the England tour programme {{to be played}} between the touring team and {{the winner of the}} Australian Domestic One-Day Cricket Final. In those days New Zealand cricket team played alongside the Australian states and won in 1969-70, 1972–73 and 1974–75, however as they were playing as a domestic side the match was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>One</b> Day International. Denness won the toss and fielded, but saw New Zealand make 262/8 off their 40 overs with most batsmen chipping in and John Morrison top-scoring with 49 and the wicketkeeper Ken Wadsworth making 44. Tony Greig was the best bowler with 2/46 and top-scored in the MCC innings, thrashing 79 of 75 balls after coming in a 47/4 when Hedley Howarth took three top order wickets with his 3/24. Greig added 92 with Keith Fletcher (44), but wickets fell regularly thereafter and when he was out at 192/9 the match was all but over. New Zealand won by 66 runs, but Greig had the consolation of being the man of the match.|$|E
25|$|The {{culminating}} {{event of}} the Mexican–American War for Santa Barbara was Frémont's return, over the surprise route of San Marcos Pass, {{which at the time}} {{was little more than a}} trail. On the night of December 24, 1846, during a torrential rainstorm, he led his California Battalion over the mountains. In spite of losing many of his horses, mules, and cannon to the treacherous and muddy slopes – and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one</b> to enemy fire – he reached the foothills on the other side in the vicinity of present-day Tucker's Grove, spent the next several days regrouping, and then marched into Santa Barbara to capture the Presidio. He encountered no resistance: all men interested in fighting had left for Los Angeles to join the forces headed by Flores and Andrés Pico which had assembled to defend that city. On January 3 Frémont headed south, skirting the cliffs of the Rincon at low tide (no road existed then), arriving in Los Angeles ten days later. The Treaty of Cahuenga, signed on January 13, 1847, ended the war in California. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed a year later, Santa Barbara formally became part of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|It is Shiva's {{relationship}} with Ganga {{that is the}} best-known in Ganga theology. Her descent, the avatarana, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one</b> time event, but a continuously occurring one in which she is forever falling from heaven into his locks and being forever tamed. Shiva is depicted in Hindu iconography as Gangadhara, the [...] "Bearer of the Ganga," [...] with Ganga, shown as spout of water, rising from his hair. The Shiva-Ganga relationship is both perpetual and intimate. Shiva is sometimes called Uma-Ganga-Patiswara ("Husband and Lord of Uma (Parvati) and Ganga"), and Ganga often arouses the jealousy of Shiva's better-known consort Parvati.|$|E

2500|$|The Michigan Alumnus {{summarized}} the game thus: [...] "Never surely {{was a game}} more lacking in spectacular features and [...] thrills. For {{a good part of}} the time it gave one the same sort of feeling which was so common during the Great War, when a gain of a few yards was a matter for rejoicing, and it was hard to believe that even the most dashing attack could accomplish any lasting results." [...] The game featured few penalties, no injuries, and few substitutions. [...] Michigan made only three substitutions, and Vanderbilt <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one.</b> Michigan completed 5 out of 16 passes for 90 yards. Vanderbilt completed just 1 of 5 for a 9-yard gain. A diagram of the game says this one pass was from Kuhn to Bomar.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{noting the}} {{perception}} that the status debate was not advancing within the PPD, he proposed {{the creation of a new}} party, Partido por la Libre Asociación (lit. [...] "Party for Free Association"), to directly promote free association. The initiative turned into the Partido Acción Civil (lit. [...] "Civil Action Party"), which dropped the status from its platform, aborting the initiative. Ricardo Alegría, a fervent supporter of independence and culture, noted that he would be willing to temporarily support free association in this meant abolishing the territorial clause. Juan Mari Brás, expressed a similar position, claiming that while it is not independence, free association is flexible and [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one</b> way street like statehood". In 2002, Julio Muriente of the Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano (MINH) a moderate pro-independence group, argued that if the free association movement gained prominence within the PPD, it was only a matter of time until the inmovilism surrounding the status debate was vanquished.|$|E
2500|$|Unger's call {{is for a}} {{revolution}} in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change {{in the life of}} the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one</b> time event but a continuing process. This is the program of empowered democracy that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. [...] "The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity." [...] It is [...] "to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemi Filani {{commented on}} the {{positive}} portrayal {{of women in the}} film: [...] "I love the way women were portrayed. For a change, Nigerian women were strong, smart and beautiful. Although the women in this film are flawed, like every other human being, they were also shown to be inherently good and beautiful." [...] Dami Elebe commended the acting skills of the two lead actors in the film: [...] "Nse Ikpe-Etim executed her role in this movie with precision, perfect pronunciation and class. Wale Ojo is not the typical Nollywood leading man. He is not the hot young boy we always want to just stare at, but the mature fine man we also want to hear. He blended in his role perfectly and showed that he is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>one</b> movie wonder but an actor who will last a lifetime in Nollywood". Caitlin Pearson commented on Wale Ojo's acting skills by stating: [...] "Ojo definitely impresses with his versatility as an actor in taking up this role, and manages to balance the austere qualities of Akin’s character with a sense of compassion". She also commended Hafiz Oyetoro's character [...] by stating [...] "the most funny and entertaining performance is by Hafiz Oyetoro who plays Akin’s assistant Alex. Alex’s character exists in a fine balance between subservient and sneaky that is pure pleasure to watch." ...|$|E
