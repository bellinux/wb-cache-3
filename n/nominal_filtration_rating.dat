40|$|Background and objectives: The {{level of}} glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> at which {{hemoglobin}} declines in {{chronic kidney disease}} is poorly described in the pediatric population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This cross-sectional study of North American children with chronic kidney disease examined the association of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> determined by the plasma disappearance of iohexol, and hemoglobin concentration. Results: Of the 340 patients studied, the mean age was 11 4 yr, the mean glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was 42 14 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, and the mean hemoglobin was 12. 5 1. 5.

Material and Method: Serum cystatin C, creatinine and 99 Tc-diethylenetriamene penta acetate (DTPA) clearance (GFRDTPA) were measured in 100 children (53 girls, 47 boys; mean age 8. 4 ± 5. 1). Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated by the Schwartz formula. Patients with DTPA clearance, accepted as the a gold standart, above 80 mL/dk/ 1. 73 m 2 were included in group 1 (n= 64) and below 80 mL/dk/ 1. 73 m 2 in group 2 (n= 36). Receiver-operating characteristics analysis was performed to assess their diagnostic accuracy. Signed informed consents of the parents were obtained in all cases. Results: Serum cystatin C and creatinine were correlated with glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in group 1 and 2. Diethylen etriamene penta acetate (DTPA) clearance was correlated with glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in both groups, and with cystatin C in group 2.

40|$|<b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of {{the zebra}} mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) on natural seston from two {{different}} regions in Saginaw Bay were determined {{on a monthly basis}} from April to October in 1992 and 1993. The two regions represent contrasting trophic conditions, with the inner bay more eutrophic than the outer bay. Mean <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was 16. 2 mL/mg/h (range 4. 0 to 40. 7 mL/mg/h) over the entire 2 -year period. <b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on seston from the inner bay were significantly lower than rates on seston from the outer bay in 1992, but no differences were apparent in 1993. Lower rates were attributed to higher concentrations of seston (chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon, and total suspended solids) found in the inner bay in 1992. In 1992, overall <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> were related to seston concentrations as described by a negative exponential function.

40|$|Downward and upward {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) {{was performed}} using the suspensions of nanosized colloidal silica with different particle diameters and their <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> were compared. In downward UF, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> decreases as the particle diameter decreases because the specific filtration {{resistance of the}} filter cake becomes significantly higher. In contrast, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in upward UF increases with the decrease in the particle diameter because the filter cake consisting of small particles is exfoliated much more easily {{under the influence of}} gravity than that of large ones. In order to evaluate the characteristics of the filter cake exfoliation, the steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in the upward mode was measured. The steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> has a tendency to decrease with particle concentration as well as mean particle diameter. Therefore, when the small particles are added into a given concentration of large particle suspension, the mean particle diameter decreases and the total particle concentration increases due to the dosage of small particles. This results in a maximum of the steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> at a certain dosage of small particles. Moreover, an estimation equation was proposed for predicting the steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in upward UF of colloidal silica suspensions with various mean particle diameters and total particle concentrations...|$|R

The objective was to study the natural history and the predictive value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and hemoglobin Alc for diabetic nephropathy. A cohort of 75 type- 1 diabetic adolescents with a diabetes duration of 8 years was studied. Thirty-one females, 33 males, mean age 16. 9 ± 0. 3 (SEM) participated in the follow-up study. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and hemoglobin Alc were measured every second year during 8 years to determine the predictive value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> for future nephropathy. Initial differences and patterns of changes in glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> albumin excretion rate, and hemoglobin Alc were examined in patients who did (group 1) and did not (group 2) develop incipient or overt nephropathy. Five of 64 patients developed overt nephropathy. They had an initial glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> of > 125 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Fifteen of 53 initially normoalbuminuric patients developed incipient and three of 53 overt nephropathy. Age, age at onset, diabetes duration, initial albumin excretion rate, initial blood pressure, and hemoglobin Alc were similar in groups 1 and 2. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was initially higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P = 0. 01). The positive predictive value for combined incipient and overt nephropathy of an initial glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> > 125 ml/min was 53 %. The negative predictive value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> < 125 ml/min was 95 %. In initially normoalbuminuric patients multiple regression revealed initial glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> as the only significant independent predictor for nephropathy when also corrected for hemoglobin Alc (P = 0. 04). Albumin excretion rate increased after 6 years (mean diabetes duration 18 years) in group 1 as compared to initial levels (P = 0. 004). Only systolic blood pressure tended to increase after 8 years. Until then it was the same in groups 1 and 2 (P = 0. 04). We conclude that increased glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> predicts nephropathy independently of metabolic control also in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients. Increased albumin excretion rate precedes the rise in blood pressure in the development of nephropathy...|$|R

Objective : {{to determine the}} prognostic value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in hospitalized diabetic patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Methods : a case-series {{study was conducted in}} 68 diabetic patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction admitted to the Camilo Cienfuegos Hospital in Sancti Spiritus from January 2012 to December 2013. The glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> on admission was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Cardiovascular risk factors, clinical and laboratory variables, the ejection fraction and hospital mortality were analyzed. Results : low glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was associated with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 45 % at discharge (p = 0. 0060) and cardiac complications including arrhythmias, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, reinfarction, postinfarction angina and Killip class ≥ III (p = 0. 0000). It was also associated with increased mortality and lower reperfusion rates. Conclusions : estimating the glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome at the time of admission provides significant information for prognosis in the acute phase, even in those with normal creatinine values. A glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> less than 53 mL/min increases the risk of suffering an adverse event during hospitalization eight times. </p...|$|R
40|$|Flow of tubule fluid to the macula densa {{is part of}} a {{proposed}} feedback loop for auto-regulation of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate.</b> In the present study, autoregulation of single nephron <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was tested in the presence and the absence of flow to the macula densa in the rat. <b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> were measured at elevated arterial blood pressures caused by carotid occlusion and vagal section and at reduced renal perfusion pressures caused by partial aortic constriction. Measurements of single nephron <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in the presence and the absence of flow to the macula densa were obtained by complete volume collections from the distal nephron beyond the macula densa and from the proximal tu-bule, respectively. Mean blood pressure was 130 ± 4 (SE) mm Hg for the initial collections, and renal perfusion pressure was 100 ± 1 mm Hg for the repeat collections (nine rats). Distal single nephron <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was 42 ± 1 nliters/min at elevated perfusion pres-sure and 41 ± 1 nliters/min at reduced perfusion pressure; proximal single nephron filtra-tion rate was 41 ± 1 nliters/min at elevated perfusion pressure and 41 ± 1 nliters/min at reduced perfusion pressure.

40|$|Crassostrea virginica, {{the eastern}} oyster, is a filter-feeding, {{particle}} clearing bivalve currently at low numbers in Chesapeake Bay. Accurately describing the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> of these bivalves {{is essential to}} estuarine management and associated efforts to understand the impact of oyster populations on water quality. Here, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> equations for three existing models (Cerco and Noel (2005), Fulford et al. (2007), and Powell et al. (1992)) are assessed. I examine how each of the models define the maximum <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> and explore the various limitation factors that modify these maximum rates via environmental conditions that include salinity, temperature, total suspended solids, and dissolved oxygen. Based on the individual model strengths found in the model comparison and a literature review, I determine a maximum <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 17 m 3 g - 1 DW day - 1 for a 1 g DW oyster {{to be a better}} <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> which is then modified by a combination of limitation factors taken from a variety of sources.

40|$|It {{has always}} been {{desirable}} for clinicians to ascertain whether glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> has recovered or still depressed at the bedside as increase in serum creatinine often indicates acute kidney injury to a clinician. In recent years, several clinical studies have developed mathematical models to simulate the creatinine response to changes in glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> which includes the estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, the Chen-kinetic estimated GFR model and the modified Chen-Pianta-Endre-Pickering-Bukley-Pecke kinetic estimated GFR model. Another study also showed that the ratio of creatinine excretion rates to creatinine production rates may predict changes in plasma concentration. The {{aim of this study}} is to allow clinicians to gauge the performance of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> estimation using the aforementioned equations and models to predict worsening of renal function, indicated by a low kinetic estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> or creatinine production rates less than unity, or recovery of kidney function, indicated by high kinetic estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate.</b> In order to achieve this a mobile software is developed to aid data collection and calculation for the clinical study based on the aforementioned models.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} intrarenal arterial stiffness by Doppler ultrasound {{and examine}} the correlation between renal Doppler indices, glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> and digital microvascular damage in systemic sclerosis patients. Methods: Thirty systemic sclerosis patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Doppler indices of intrarenal arterial stiffness, peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic flow velocity, resistive index, pulsative index, and systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio were measured on the interlobar artery of both kidneys. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was measured using Tc- 99 m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Equation 7 from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease was used to estimate glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate.</b> Nailfold videocapillaroscopy findings were classified as early, active, and late patterns. Results: The intrarenal arterial stiffness, evaluated by Doppler indices, was higher in systemic sclerosis patients than healthy controls. In systemic sclerosis patients pulsative index (r = - 0. 69), resistive index (r = - 0. 75), and S/D ratio (r = - 0. 74) showed a negative correlation with measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (P < 0001). High correlation (P = 0008) was observed between measured and estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (r = 0. 55). Pulsative index, resistive index, and S/D ratio significantly increased with progression of capillaroscopic damage. Conversely, measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> significantly decreased with capillaroscopic damage progression. Conclusions: Doppler indices of intrarenal arterial stiffness are noninvasive diagnostic tests to evaluate renal damage in SSc patients. Intrarenal arterial stiffness and glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> correlate with capillaroscopic microvascular damage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Background: plasma {{creatinine}} {{alone is}} not useful for assessing renal function; patients with normal creatinine values can experience a significant decline in the glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> hindering early detection of renal function impairment. Objective: to assess renal function by determining the plasma creatinine compared to the glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> estimated through the Cockcroft -Gault, MDRD - 4 and CKD- Epi formulas. Methods: the database of a population-based epidemiological study conducted in the Isle of Youth since November 2004 was used. It involved 897 patients, 342 women and 555 men. Plasma creatinine and glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> were estimated by means of 3 formulas. Renal function was considered normal when serum creatinine values were 60 ml/min. Results: plasma creatinine was stable in the four age groups, {{with a mean of}} 100. 68 ± 38. 01, glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> decreased with increasing age in the three formulas. Correlation coefficient between plasma creatinine values and glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> for each formula expressed a linear relationship with r [CG formula 0. 639 (p = 0. 000) ], [0. 672 MDRD - 4 (p = 0. 000) ] and [0. 939 CKD – Epi formula (p = 0. 000) ]. Conclusions: the utility of the methods for estimating the glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was demonstrated, leading to the detection of the renal function impairment before the serum creatinine level increases...|$|R

40|$|The beta 2 -microglobulin {{plasma level}} is often high in {{patients}} suffering from cirrhosis. Many authors believe {{this to be}} due to an increased production, provided that the creatinine level is in the normal range. In the present study, alterations in the plasma level and production of beta 2 -microglobulin were investigated in patients with liver cirrhosis without overt renal failure. 62 patients, 48 men and 14 women, suffering from liver cirrhosis were examined. The glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (GFR) and plasma beta 2 -microglobulin were measured in all patients and in 16 controls. As beta 2 -microglobulin is freely filtered by glomeruli and its extrarenal catabolism is negligible, the beta 2 -microglobulin <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated as the product of the beta 2 -microglobulin plasma level times the GFR. In steady state conditions, the beta 2 -microglobulin <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> may be used as an indirect index of beta 2 -microglobulin production. The beta 2 -microglobulin plasma level was high in 26 patients; however, only 12 of them showed a definite rise in beta 2 -microglobulin production, as shown by an increased beta 2 -microglobulin <b>filtration</b> <b>rate.</b> The 14 patients with high beta 2 -microglobulin plasma levels without high beta 2 -microglobulin <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> obviously showed a decreased GFR; however, creatinine was not increased because of its small sensitivity as an index of renal function. A linear correlation was found between IgG and the beta 2 -microglobulin <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (r = 052; p less than 0. 02), not between IgG and the beta 2 -microglobulin plasma level.
