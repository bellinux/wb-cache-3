25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of computer networks, {{there has been a}} persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate configuration parameters, both retrieved at boot time from one or more <b>network</b> <b>servers.</b> This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the network boot process system interoperability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Design {{patterns}} are generic solutions to recurring software design problems. The Correct Object-Oriented Patternbased Parallel Programming System (CO 2 P 3 S) uses design pattern templates to generate code for design patterns. CO 2 P 3 S {{has been used}} to generate small parallel and sequential applications. This research evaluates the utility and performance of CO 2 P 3 S on larger <b>network</b> <b>server</b> applications. The <b>Network</b> <b>Server</b> design pattern template is introduced, which significantly eases the complexities involved in <b>network</b> <b>server</b> application development. The <b>Network</b> <b>Server</b> is highly configurable and suitable {{for the construction of a}} large variety of <b>network</b> <b>server</b> applications, with a diverse range of functionality and performance requirements. In this paper we highlight a generated Web server with performance comparable to Apache. Index Terms—network servers, parallel programming, programming environments...|$|R

Ubuntu runs on the most popular architectures, including Intel, AMD, and ARM-based machines. Ubuntu is also available for tablets and smartphones, with the Ubuntu Touch edition.|$|E
2500|$|While {{originally}} {{used primarily}} for encrypting {{the contents of}} e-mail messages and attachments from a desktop client, PGP products have been diversified since 2002 into a set of encryption applications which can be managed by an optional central policy server. [...] PGP encryption applications include e-mail and attachments, digital signatures, laptop full disk encryption, file and folder security, protection for IM sessions, batch file transfer encryption, and protection for files and folders stored on <b>network</b> <b>servers</b> and, more recently, encrypted or signed HTTP request/responses {{by means of a}} client-side (Enigform) and a server-side (mod openpgp) module. There is also a Wordpress plugin available, called wp-enigform-authentication, that takes advantage of the session management features of Enigform with mod_openpgp.|$|E

2500|$|Ubuntu's {{goal is to}} {{be secure}} [...] "out-of-the box". By default, the user's {{programs}} run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other users' files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes. PolicyKit is also being widely implemented into the desktop. Most network ports are closed by default to prevent hacking. A built-in firewall allows end-users who install <b>network</b> <b>servers</b> to control access. A GUI (GUI for Uncomplicated Firewall) is available to configure it. Ubuntu compiles its packages using GCC features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection to harden its software. These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of 1% in 32-bit and 0.01% in 64-bit.|$|E

It was codenamed [...] "Shiner" [...] and originally consisted of two models, the <b>Network</b> <b>Server</b> 500/132 ("Shiner LE", i.e., [...] "low-end") and the <b>Network</b> <b>Server</b> 700/150 ("Shiner HE", i.e., [...] "high-end"), which got a companion model, the <b>Network</b> <b>Server</b> 700/200 (also [...] "Shiner HE") with a faster CPU in November 1996. They are {{not a part of}} the Apple Macintosh line of computers; they were designed to run IBM's AIX operating system and their ROM specifically prevented booting the classic Mac OS. This makes them the last non-Macintosh desktop computers made by Apple to date. The 500/132, 700/150, and 700/200 sold in the U.S. market for $11,000, $15,000 and $19,000, respectively.|$|R
