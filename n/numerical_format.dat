40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental framework {{for assessing the}} biases associated with the interpretation of numbers. This framework consists of having participants convert between different representations of quantities. These representations should include both variations in numerical labels that symbolize quantities and variations in displays in which quantity is inherent. Five experiments assessed how people convert between relative frequencies, decimals, and displays of dots that denote very low proportions (i. e., proportions below 1 %). The participants demonstrated perceptual, response, and numerical transformation biases. Furthermore, the data suggest that relative frequencies and decimals are associated with different abstract representations of amount. Scientists and lay people use several <b>numerical</b> <b>formats</b> (i. e., any symbol system used to represent quantities) to symbolize propor-tions. For example, the decimal “ 0. 5 ” and relative frequency “ 1 in 2 ” symbolize the same proportion. Although relative frequencies and decimals denote proportions equally well, people may inter-pret these <b>numerical</b> <b>formats</b> differently. Nevertheless, researchers often make an implicit assumption that people interpret these <b>numerical</b> <b>formats</b> equivalently (termed the assumption of numer-ical equivalence).

Nevertheless, the existing most reduced-order models (see, e.g., [9 – 30]) they are formed with the POD basis produced from the classical numerical solutions at all nodes of time, before repetitively calculating the optimized solutions at the same nodes of time, which are actually some repetitive computations.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding risks is {{considered}} to be crucial for informed decision-making. Inaccurate risk perception is a common finding in women with a family history of breast cancer attending genetic counseling. As yet, it is unclear how risks should best be communicated in clinical practice. This study protocol describes the design and methods of the BRISC (Breast cancer RISk Communication) study evaluating the effect of different formats of risk communication on the counsellee's risk perception, psychological well-being and decision-making regarding preventive options for breast cancer. Methods and design The BRISC study is designed as a pre-post-test controlled group intervention trial with repeated measurements using questionnaires. The intervention-an additional risk consultation-consists of one of 5 conditions that differ in the way counsellee's breast cancer risk is communicated: 1) lifetime risk in <b>numerical</b> <b>format</b> (natural frequencies, i. e. X out of 100), 2) lifetime risk in both <b>numerical</b> <b>format</b> and graphical format (population figures), 3) lifetime risk and age-related risk in <b>numerical</b> <b>format,</b> 4) lifetime risk and age-related risk in both <b>numerical</b> <b>format</b> and graphical format, and 5) lifetime risk in percentages. Condition 6 is the control condition in which no intervention is given (usual care). Participants are unaffected women with a family history of breast cancer attending one of three participating clinical genetic centres in the Netherlands. Discussion The BRISC study allows for an evaluation of the effects of different formats of communicating breast cancer risks to counsellees. The results can be used to optimize risk communication in order to improve informed decision-making among women with a family history of breast cancer. They may also be useful for risk communication in other health-related services. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 14566836. </p...|$|E

Different <b>numerical</b> <b>formats</b> can be used in risk communication but It remains unclear how the different formats affect decisions made by real-life patients. Aim: To compare the impact of using Prolongation Of Life (POL) and Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) information formats to express effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapy on patients’ redemptions of statin prescriptions, and on patients’ confidence in their decision and satisfaction with the risk communication. Design and setting: Cluster-randomised clinical trial in general practices. Thirty-four Danish GPs from 23 practices participated in a primary care-based clinical trial concerning use of quantitative effectiveness formats for risk communication in health prevention consultations. Method: GPs were cluster-randomised (treating practices as clusters) to inform patients about cardiovascular mortality risk and the effectiveness of statin treatment using either POL or ARR formats. Patients’ redemptions of statin prescriptions were obtained from a regional prescription database. The COMRADE questionnaire was used to measure patients’ confidence in their decision and satisfaction with the risk communication.
