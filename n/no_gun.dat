5|$|In 1994, Seoul {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a book Chung published about the events of 1950, raising awareness of the allegations inside South Korea. In that same year, the U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service in Korea dismissed one <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri petition by asserting that any killings took place during combat. The survivors' committee retorted {{that there was no}} battle at <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri, but U.S. officials refused to reconsider.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the South Korean government's Committee for the Review and Restoration of Honor for the <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri Victims, after {{a yearlong}} process of verifying claims through family registers, medical reports and other {{documents}} and testimony, certified the names of 150 <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri dead, 13 missing, and 55 wounded, including some who later died of their wounds. It said that reports were not filed on many other victims because of {{the passage of time}} and other factors. Of the certified victims, 41 percent were children under 15, and 70 percent were women, children or men over age 61.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, the <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri story {{inspired}} {{works of}} nonfiction, fiction, theater, and other arts. In 2010, a major Korean studio, Myung Films, released a <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri feature film, A Little Pond, {{written and directed}} by Lee Saang-woo and featuring Song Kang-ho, Moon So-ri and other Korean stars who donated their work. Besides commercial release in South Korea, the movie was screened at international film festivals, including in New York and London.|$|E

5|$|In their report, South Korean {{investigators}} {{acknowledged that}} no documents showed specific orders at <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri to shoot refugees. But they pointed to {{gaps in the}} U.S.-supplied documents dealing with 7th Cavalry and U.S. Air Force operations. Missing documents included the 7th Cavalry's journal, or communications log, for July 1950, the record that would have carried <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri orders. It was missing without explanation from its place at the National Archives.|$|E
5|$|The Korean {{investigators}} {{cast doubt}} on the U.S. report's suggestion of possible gunfire from among the refugees. Surviving documents said nothing about infiltrators at <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri, even though they would have been the 7th Cavalry's first enemy killed-in-action in Korea. The <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri survivors denied it emphatically, and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire, and then inconsistently.|$|E

5|$|In the {{earliest}} published {{accounts of the}} killings, in August and September 1950, two North Korean journalists with the advancing northern troops reported finding an estimated 400 bodies in the <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri area, and seeing some 200 bodies in one tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the predawn}} hours of July 29, the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew from <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri. That afternoon, North Korean {{soldiers}} arrived outside the tunnels and helped those still alive, about two dozen, mostly children, feeding them and sending them back toward their villages.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the {{exposure}} of <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri, survivors of similar alleged incidents from 1950–51 filed reports with the Seoul government. In 2008, an investigative commission said more than 200 cases of alleged large-scale killings by the U.S. military had been registered, mostly air attacks.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the {{survivors}} filed a claim with a South Korean compensation committee under the binational Status of Forces Agreement. This time, the U.S. claims service responded by again citing what it claimed was a combat situation, and by asserting {{that there was}} no evidence the 1st Cavalry Division was in the <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri area, as {{the survivors}}' research and the 1961 official Army history of the war indicated.|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri villagers {{said that}} in later decades, two mass graves holding some victims' remains were disturbed, and bones were removed during a {{reforestation}} project, and by farming activity. In 2007, excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little. The forensics team said that it hadn't found more, because so much time had passed, and any remains {{had been exposed to}} the elements and soil erosion, railway work, cultivation, and highly acidic soil.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, American {{historian}} Sahr Conway-Lanz reported {{his discovery}} of a declassified document at the National Archives, in which the United States Ambassador to Korea in 1950, John J. Muccio, notified the State Department, {{on the day the}} <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri killings began, that the U.S. military, fearing infiltrators, had adopted a policy of shooting South Korean refugee groups that approached U.S. lines, after firing warning shots. Pressed by the South Korean government, the Pentagon eventually acknowledged that it deliberately omitted the Muccio letter from its 2001 report.|$|E
5|$|In 2006–2010, artist Park Kun-woong and Chung Eun-yong {{published}} Nogunri Story, a two-volume graphic {{narrative that}} {{told the story}} of the massacre, and the half-century struggle for the truth, through thousands of drawings, based on Chung's 1994 book. The Korean-language work was also published in translation in Europe. In the United States and Britain, <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri was a central or secondary theme in five English-language novels, including the U.S. National Book Award finalist Lark & Termite of 2009, by Jayne Anne Phillips, and the James Bond thriller Trigger Mortis of 2015, by British author Anthony Horowitz.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E

5|$|UN troops, {{particularly}} South Korean, {{were also}} {{accused of killing}} or attempting to kill captured North Korean soldiers. South Korean civilians, {{some of whom were}} leftist or communist sympathizers, were known to have been systematically imprisoned or killed in the Bodo League massacres, some of which have taken place during the battle. In the years since the fight, evidence has also surfaced indicating that the US military killed South Korean civilians shortly before the fight along the Pusan Perimeter began, fearing them North Korean infiltrators, in the <b>No</b> <b>Gun</b> Ri massacre. The evidence is debated but several books have been published on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Beginning to {{appreciate}} the fact that Bapaume may have to be directly attacked, Russell, encouraged by Harper, the commander of IV Corps, began drawing up plans to do so on 29 August, using the 1st Wellington Battalion, of 1st Infantry Brigade. However, it was still hoped that the Germans would withdraw on their own initiative. The bombardment on Bapaume continued into 28 August while 1st Infantry Brigade moved in close to the town on its southern frontage. Particularly heavy barrages were made during the evening and it was noted that the German response was relatively muted and by early in the morning of 29 August, there was <b>no</b> <b>gun</b> fire coming from Bapaume. Overnight, Bapaume had been abandoned, a state of affairs confirmed by patrols of the 3rd Rifle Battalion entering the town from the north. They observed retreating Germans making for Bancourt, to the east. Meanwhile, 2nd Auckland Battalion entered Bapaume from the south. Likewise, the Germans had retreated from Thilloy and the 5th Manchester Battalion, of 42nd Division, moved through the village and secured it.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew of the}} 12-pounder, with <b>no</b> <b>gun</b> to fire, {{took charge}} of burning the village and over 115 huts were destroyed.

In all fourteen warriors, including the two chiefs, were counted dead after a fierce half an hour battle. At least 36 others were wounded. Two marines were wounded by musketry but survived, two sailors were hurt badly by rocks, one other marine {{was hit in the}} leg with an arrow and a sailor from Wild Wave was hurt as well.|$|E
