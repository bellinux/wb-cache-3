40|$|Results from a {{study of}} {{surfactants}} (SAS) in the sea surface microlayer (SML) and underlying water (ULW) at different locations in the Baltic Sea. The total SAS concentrations were measured using phase-sensitive alternative current voltammetry with hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) in unfiltered samples. The concentrations of SAS were expressed as the equivalent concentration of <b>nonanionic</b> surfactants Triton-X- 100. The enrichment factors (EF) of SAS were calculated as the ratio of concentration in SML to the corresponding ULW samples...|$|E
40|$|The electroactive ß-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) can be {{nucleated}} {{by introducing}} CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles within the polymer matrix, leading to electroactive materials with large potential for sensor and actuator applications. The {{effects of the}} CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticle electrostatic charge on the phase crystallization of PVDF polymer is reported. For this purpose, CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were coated with anionic (SDS), <b>nonanionic</b> (Triton X- 100), and cationic (CTAB) surfactants, and the obtained coated nanoparticles were used as fillers. It is found that the piezoelectric ß-form of the polymer increases when CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles with higher negative electrostatic charge are added. This behavior is attributed to {{the interaction between the}} negatively charged magnetic particles and the polymer CH 2 groups, having a positive charge density. Further the relationship between the ß-phase content and the piezoelectric response has been demonstrated. The magnetostriction of the ferrite nanoparticles and the proven piezoelectricity of the polymer allows the use of the material in piezoelectric and magnetoelectric sensors or/and actuators.

40|$|Phosphate {{groups are}} found and used widely in {{biological}} chemistry. We have asked whether phosphate groups {{are likely to}} be important to the functioning of genetic molecules, including DNA and RNA. From observations made on synthetic analogs of DNA and RNA where the phosphates are replaced by <b>nonanionic</b> linking groups, we infer a set of rules that highlight the importance of the phosphodiester backbone for the proper functioning of DNA as a genetic molecule. The polyanionic backbone appears to give DNA the capability of replication following simple rules, and evolving. The polyanionic nature of the backbone appears to be critical to prevent the single strands from folding, permitting them to act as templates, guiding the interaction between two strands to form a duplex in a way that permits simple rules to guide the molecular recognition event, and buffering the sensitivity of its physicochemical properties to changes in sequence. We argue that the feature of a polyelectrolyte (polyanion or polycation) may be required for a “self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. ” The polyelectrolyte structure therefore may be a universal signature of life, regardless of its genesis...|$|E
