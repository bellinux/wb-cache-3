5|$|This {{is a third}} order <b>non-linear</b> {{ordinary}} {{differential equation}} which can be solved numerically, e.g. with the shooting method.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{similarity}} solutions to this equation {{have been found}} for various types of flow, including flat plate boundary layers. The term similarity refers to the property that the velocity profiles at different positions in the flow are the same apart from a scaling factor. These solutions are often presented {{in the form of}} <b>non-linear</b> ordinary differential equations.|$|E
5|$|After {{producing}} several interactive games {{aimed at}} children, the Miller brothers {{decided to create}} an adult-targeted game with a <b>non-linear</b> story, believable characters, and an ethical dilemma. Initially turned down by Activision, Cyan was later approached by Sunsoft, who helped fund Myst. The game took two years to develop and was Cyan's largest project.|$|E
5|$|Beveridge {{cautioned that}} because the anime was {{designed}} around the <b>non-linear</b> format of the manga, its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer, but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.|$|E
5|$|Spurious {{products}} {{are the result}} of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion {{in the creation of the}} output waveform due to <b>non-linear</b> numerical effects in the signal processing chain. Only numerical errors are covered here. For other distortion mechanisms created in the digital-to-analog converter see the corresponding section in the direct-digital synthesizer article.|$|E
5|$|The PC game {{featured}} a <b>non-linear</b> plot, non-player characters that each ran {{in their own}} independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements) that did not {{require the use of}} a 3D accelerator card to play the game.|$|E
5|$|The high {{non-linearity}} of {{lithium niobate}} {{also makes it}} useful in <b>non-linear</b> optics applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural laureates, Vladimir Arnold and Louis Nirenberg, {{were cited}} by the Academy for their {{work in the field}} of <b>non-linear</b> {{differential}} equations. The first woman to be awarded the prize was astronomer Andrea Ghez in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{algorithms}} for sequence alignment {{and structure}} alignment {{are not able}} to detect circular permutations between proteins. New <b>non-linear</b> approaches have been developed that overcome this and are able to detect topology-independent similarities.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing <b>non-linear</b> half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other <b>non-linear</b> load compared to total load or of <b>non-linear</b> load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
25|$|In his 1971 paper, Chua {{extrapolated}} {{a conceptual}} symmetry between the <b>non-linear</b> resistor (voltage vs. current), <b>non-linear</b> capacitor (voltage vs. charge) and <b>non-linear</b> inductor (magnetic flux linkage vs. current). He then inferred {{the possibility of}} a memristor as another fundamental <b>non-linear</b> circuit element linking magnetic flux and charge. In contrast to a linear (or <b>non-linear)</b> resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents. Other scientists had proposed dynamic memory resistors such as the memistor of Bernard Widrow, but Chua attempted to introduce mathematical generality.|$|E
25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect is}} {{an effect of}} finite {{deformation}} of <b>non-linear</b> elastic materials. A modern comprehensive account {{of this can be}} found in. This book treats the application of the <b>non-linear</b> elasticity theory and the analysis of the mechanical properties of solid materials capable of large elastic deformations. The special case of the acoustoelastic theory for a compressible isotropic hyperelastic material, like polycrystalline steel, is reproduced and shown in this text from the <b>non-linear</b> elasticity theory as presented by Ogden.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-linear</b> loads {{change the}} shape of the current {{waveform}} from a sine wave to some other form. <b>Non-linear</b> loads create harmonic currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain <b>non-linear</b> loads such as rectifiers, some forms of electric lighting, electric arc furnaces, welding equipment, switched-mode power supplies, variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.|$|E
25|$|Solving {{a system}} of <b>non-linear</b> modular {{arithmetic}} equations is NP-complete.|$|E
25|$|Some exact {{solutions}} to the Navier–Stokes equations exist. Examples of degenerate cases — with the <b>non-linear</b> terms in the Navier–Stokes equations equal to zero — are Poiseuille flow, Couette flow and the oscillatory Stokes boundary layer. But also more interesting examples, {{solutions to}} the full <b>non-linear</b> equations, exist; for example the Taylor–Green vortex.|$|E

25|$|An exact {{solution}} for <b>non-linear</b> pure capillary waves of permanent form, and for infinite fluid depth, {{was obtained by}} Crapper in 1957. Note that these capillary waves – being short waves forced by surface tension, if gravity effects are negligible – have sharp troughs and flat crests. This contrasts with <b>non-linear</b> surface gravity waves, which have sharp crests and flat troughs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{property}} of <b>non-linear</b> waves {{is that the}} phase speed of <b>non-linear</b> waves depends on the wave height. In a perturbation-series approach, this easily {{gives rise to a}} spurious secular variation of the solution, in contradiction with the periodic behaviour of the waves. Stokes solved this problem by also expanding the dispersion relationship into a perturbation series, by a method now known as the Lindstedt–Poincaré method.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} first converts the AC mains to a DC bus {{by means of a}} bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the rectifier is a <b>non-linear</b> device, so the input current is highly <b>non-linear.</b> That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|For <b>non-linear</b> {{least squares}} systems a similar {{argument}} {{shows that the}} normal equations should be modified as follows.|$|E
25|$|For <b>non-linear</b> media, E and D are not proportional. Materials {{can have}} varying extents of linearity, {{homogeneity}} and isotropy.|$|E

25|$|The {{algebraic}} equations to {{be solved}} are simple to set up, but of course are <b>non-linear,</b> requiring iteration of the linearized equations.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, a Stokes wave is a <b>non-linear</b> and {{periodic}} {{surface wave}} on an inviscid fluid layer of constant mean depth.|$|E
25|$|Below, Luke's variational {{principle}} {{is used to}} arrive at the flow equations for <b>non-linear</b> surface gravity waves on a potential flow.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{support for}} <b>non-linear</b> development: Git {{supports}} rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a <b>non-linear</b> development history. In Git, a core {{assumption is that}} a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.|$|E
