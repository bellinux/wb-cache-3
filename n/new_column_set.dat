40|$|The chiral {{separation}} of amino acids (AA) derivatised with ethyl chloroformate by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography is reported. A commercially available enantioselective capillary column (Chirasil-L-Val) {{has been tested}} as first-dimension column. Two nonenantioselective stationary phases (BPX 50 and BP 1) with different column lengths were combined with the enantioselective column, which represent chiral/polar and chiral/low-polarity <b>column</b> <b>sets,</b> respectively. These <b>column</b> <b>sets</b> were evaluated to determine the most useful column combination to provide improved separation efficiency of enantioselective AA analysis. Separations of AA mixtures derivatised either as their N-trifluoroacetyl methyl esters or with methyl chloroformate, performed on a chiral/low-polarity <b>column</b> <b>set,</b> are also shown. The method was demonstrated for chiral analysis of AAs in different beer samples. The major AA in the beer samples was proline with amounts ranging from around 65 - 95 % with minor contents of glycine and the L-enantiomers of alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Small amounts of D-alanine, at about 1, 1. 5, and 15 % were detected in the three samples...|$|R

40|$|Two {{approaches}} are described and compared {{for the analysis}} of suspected allergens (SAs) in fragrance products, which are defined by the Scientific Committee of Cosmetics and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP). The first consists of a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) experiment using both a &# 039;conventional&# 039; non-polar/polar column combination and an &# 039;inverse&# 039; polar/non-polar <b>column</b> <b>set.</b> The second approach uses a targeted multidimensional gas chromatography (MDGC) system employing a Deans type pneumatic switch and a longitudinally modulated cryogenic system (LMCS). It was found that the conventional and inverse <b>column</b> <b>sets</b> complement each other well, providing identification of SAs present. Compounds well retained on the second dimension of one <b>column</b> <b>set</b> were the first to be eluted from the other. In some instances SAs co-eluting with matrix components on the second dimension for a given <b>column</b> <b>set</b> were clearly resolved on the other, although this has the disadvantage of requiring two analytical runs. Targeted MDGC with a non-polar/polar <b>column</b> <b>set,</b> successfully separated all SAs identified within a fragrance product. The instrument is set up in a similar fashion to a GC × GC system though with longer second dimension (2 D) column, a cryogenic trap {{at the beginning of the}} second column, and a pneumatic switch coupling both columns. The data are easier to process than for a GC × GC experiment. The targeted MDGC method has the capacity to deliver far greater efficiency to targeted regions of a primary separation than a GC × GC experiment, whilst still maintaining overall run times similar to those of a conventional one-dimensional (1 D) GC experiment. Cryogenic focussing at the beginning of the 2 D column delivers enhanced sensitivity, accurate 2 D retention times and narrow peak widths; these are responsible for an increased resolution obtained from the fast, relatively short (5 m) 2 D column. The two <b>column</b> <b>set</b> GC × GC analysis provided a quick and effective means to qualitatively determine the presence of six SAs in a commercially available air freshener, however all were not adequately resolved from matrix components. In contrast, quantitation was straightforward using the targeted MDGC method...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding the <b>set</b> of <b>columns,</b> can be {{combined}} in various types. The Original <b>column</b> <b>sets</b> in the beginning were mainly poly(dimethylsiloxane) in the first dimension and poly(ethyleneglycol) in the second dimension. These so-called straight phase <b>column</b> <b>sets</b> are very suitable for Hydrocarbon analysis. Therefore, these are still used most frequent in Oil and Gas industry. If the application is to determine more polar compounds in a non-polar matrix. The reverse phase <b>column</b> <b>set</b> gives more resolution for the polar compounds. The first dimension column in this situation is a polar column, followed by a mid-polar second dimension column.For each application there can be an optimal <b>column</b> <b>set.</b> In this respective you can use also chiral columns for optical isomer separation or for example PLOT columns for volatiles and gas samples.To optimize the application {{is a bit more}} complex compared to 1D separations, as there are more parameters involved. Flow and oven temperature program are still very important but also hot jet pulse duration, length of the second dimension column and modulation time have a big influence on the final results. The outcome is also different. No longer a traditional chromatogram is produced, but now a 3 dimensional plot is produced by specially designed software [...] packages. It is a different way of evaluate data, but you get much more information. With modern software, you can perform group-type separation as well as automated peak identification (with Mass Spectrometry).|$|R
