40|$|An {{alignment}} positioning {{mechanism for}} correcting and compensating for misalignment of structures to be coupled is disclosed. The mechanism comprises a power screw with {{a base portion}} and a threaded shank portion. A mounting fixture is provided for rigidly coupling said base portion to the mounting interface of a supporting structure with the axis of the screw perpendicular thereto. A traveling ball nut threaded on the power screw is formed with an external annular arcuate surface configured {{in the form of}} a spherical segment and enclosed by a ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing</b> with a conforming arcuate surface for permitting gimballed motion thereon. The ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing</b> is provided with a mounting surface which is positionable in cooperable engagement with the mounting interface of a primary structure to be coupled to the supporting structure. Cooperative means are provided on the ball nut and ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing,</b> respectively, for positioning the ball nut and ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing</b> in relative gimballed position within a predetermined range of relative angular relationship whereby severe structural stresses due to unequal loadings and undesirable bending moments on the mechanism are avoided...|$|E

50|$|Distributors {{typically}} {{enter into}} one of the two types of film booking contracts. The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the sliding scale deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run. The sliding scale actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep—often called “the house nut”—after which the sliding scale kicks in for revenue generated above the <b>house</b> <b>nut.</b> However, this sliding scale method is falling out of use.
