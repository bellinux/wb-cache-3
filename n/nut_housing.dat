The mechanism comprises a power screw with {{a base portion}} and a threaded shank portion. A mounting fixture is provided for rigidly coupling said base portion to the mounting interface of a supporting structure with the axis of the screw perpendicular thereto. A traveling ball nut threaded on the power screw is formed with an external annular arcuate surface configured {{in the form of}} a spherical segment and enclosed by a ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing</b> with a conforming arcuate surface for permitting gimballed motion thereon. The ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing</b> is provided with a mounting surface which is positionable in cooperable engagement with the mounting interface of a primary structure to be coupled to the supporting structure. Cooperative means are provided on the ball nut and ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing,</b> respectively, for positioning the ball nut and ball <b>nut</b> <b>housing</b> in relative gimballed position within a predetermined range of relative angular relationship whereby severe structural stresses due to unequal loadings and undesirable bending moments on the mechanism are avoided...|$|E
