MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following ethical board approval and informed consent, the L 2 - 3 to L 5 -S 1 disks {{were examined in}} 10 asymptomatic volunteers (nine men, one woman; mean age, 30 years; range, 23 - 43 years). At 7 T, <b>normalized</b> sodium <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated, by using region-of-interest analysis.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the maximum ratio combining method for the combining of antenna-diversity signals in correlated Rician-fading channels is rigorously studied.

This power series can easily take into account the signal correlations and antenna gains and can be applied to any number of receiving antennas. An application of the method to dual-antenna diversity systems produces useful distribution curves for the normalized SNR which can be used to find the diversity gain. It is revealed that signal correlation in Rician-fading channels helps to increase the diversity gain rather than to decrease it as in the Rayleigh fading channels. It is also shown that with a relative strong direct signal component, the diversity gain can be much higher than that without a direct signal component...|$|E

40|$|Calibration of {{the spatial}} {{sensitivity}} functions of coil arrays {{is a crucial}} element in parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI). The self-calibrating technique for sensitivity extraction has complemented the common calibration technique that uses a separate pre-scan. In order to improve the accuracy of sensitivity estimate from small number of self-calibrating data, which is extracted from a fully sampled central region of a variable-density k-space acquisition in self-calibrating parallel images, a novel scheme for estimating the sensitivity profiles is proposed in the paper. On consideration of truncation error and measurement errors in self-calibrating data, the issue of calculating sensitivity would be formulated as a regularized least squares estimation problem, which is solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm. When applying the estimated coil sensitivity to reconstruct full field-of-view(FOV) image from the under-sampling simulated and in vivo data, the <b>normalized</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (NSNR) of reconstruction image is evidently improved, and meanwhile the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) is remarkably reduced, especially when a rather large accelerate factor is used...|$|E

This paper reviews transconductor design {{by focusing on the}} V-I kernel that determines the key transconductor properties. Based on bandwidth considerations, simple V-I kernels with few or no internal nodes are preferred. In a systematic way, virtually all simple kernels published in literature are generated.

In order to compare transconductors in a fair way, a <b>normalized</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (NSNR) is defined. The basic V-I kernels and the five classes of composite V-I kernels are then compared, leading to insight in the key mechanisms that affect NSNR.

Compared to film- based radiography, digitally radiographed images can be acquired with less time and fewer exposures. However, noises can simply occur on the digital image resulting in a low-quality result.

This tool was written by using image processing and the graphical user interface development environment and compiler (GUIDE) toolbox available in Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) R 2008 a.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the mentioned papers, {{there are a number}} of schemes developed for fairness in limited-feedback multiuser systems. For instance,[34] proposed a threshold-based scheduling approach to tackle the capacity and fairness tradeoff in multiuser systems. Here, the users are divided into two groups. In the first group, the users whose <b>normalized</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) exceeds a threshold send feedback. In the second group, a number of the best remaining users whose absolute SNR passes the threshold send one-bit feedback. The results of[34] were extended in[17], where cases in which none of the users’ channel quality exceeds the threshold were specially considered. Furthermore,[35, 36] studied the capacity and fairness in multiuser diversity systems under a specific feedback scheme. Here, the users share a common feedback channel period which is divided into some subperiods. In each subperiod, if a user channel quality passes threshold(s), it sends some feedback and, if it is the only user sending feedback, the feedback process ends. If two or more users send feedback simultaneously, the feedback signal is irrecoverable and lost. Finally, considering uniform power allocation,[37] used quantized CSI to maximize the outage capacity under a long-term fairness constraint. The fairness is obtained by (1) clustering the users and (2) determining the quantization regions (QRs) in each cluster, such that the probability that equal number of users fall into a region is the same.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpectral {{efficiency}} for asynchronous {{code division}} multiple access (CDMA) with random spreading is calculated in the large system limit. We allow for arbitrary chip waveforms and frequency-flat fading. Signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs) for suboptimal receivers, such as the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) detectors, are derived. The approach is general and optionally allows even for statistics obtained by under-sampling the received signal. All performance measures are given {{as a function of the}} chip waveform and the delay distribution of the users in the large system limit. It turns out that synchronizing users on a chip level impairs performance for all chip waveforms with bandwidth greater than the Nyquist bandwidth, e. g. positive roll-off factors. For example, with the pulse shaping demanded in the UMTS standard, user synchronization reduces spectral efficiency up to 12 % at 10 dB <b>normalized</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio.</b> The benefits of asynchronism stem from the finding that the excess bandwidth of chip waveforms actually spans additional dimensions in signal space, if the users are de-synchronized on the chip-level. The analysis of linear MMSE detectors shows that the limiting interference effects can be decoupled both in the user domain and in the frequency domain such that the concept of the effective interference spectral density arises. This generalizes and refines Tse and Hanly's concept of effective interference. In Part II, the analysis is extended to any linear detector that admits a representation as multistage detector and guidelines for the design of low complexity multistage detectors with universal weights are provided...|$|E

In particular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive information, while the remaining users opportunistically harvest the ambient radio frequency (RF) energy. We devise novel scheduling schemes in which the tradeoff between the users' ergodic capacities and their average amount of harvested energy can be controlled. To this end, we modify two fair scheduling schemes used in information-only transfer systems. First, proportionally fair maximum <b>normalized</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (N-SNR) scheduling is modified by scheduling the user having the jth ascendingly ordered (rather than the maximum) N-SNR. We refer to this scheme as order-based N-SNR scheduling. Second, conventional equal-throughput (ET) fair scheduling is modified by scheduling the user having the minimum moving average throughput among the set of users whose N-SNR orders fall into a certain set of allowed orders Sa (rather than the set of all users). We refer to this scheme as order-based ET scheduling. The feasibility conditions required for the users to achieve ET with this scheme are also derived. We show that the smaller the selection order j for the order-based N-SNR scheme, and the lower the orders in Sa for the order-based ET scheme, the higher the average amount of energy harvested by the users {{at the expense of}} a reduction in their ergodic capacities. We analyze the performance of the considered scheduling schemes for independent and non-identically distributed (i. n. d.)
