Examples of retrofitted fixtures for metal halide use include the Thomas & Betts Model 25 and Model 327, as well as full-cutoff versions of GE's M400. MH lamps suffer color shift as they age though this has been improving. Actual life expectancy is about 10,000 to 12,000 hours on average.

Metal Halide light bulbs also tend to dim and/or flicker {{at the end of their}} life cycles, and on occasion, cycle. Sometimes, they emit a pinkish glow at or near the end of their life cycle which in this case, the bulb just burns out. High cost and low life hours has kept them from becoming popular municipal lighting sources even though they have a much improved CRI around 85. Therefore, the use of metal halide is limited mainly to city and high end street lighting. They are available in clear or coated bulbs.

40|$|RATIONALE : Transmission {{is driving}} the global {{tuberculosis}} epidemic, especially in congregate settings. Worldwide, natural ventilation {{is the most common}} means of air disinfection, but it is inherently unreliable and of limited use in cold climates. Upper room germicidal ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection with air mixing {{has been shown to be}} highly effective, but improved evidence-based dosing guidelines are needed. OBJECTIVES : To test the efficacy of upper room germicidal air disinfection with air mixing to reduce tuberculosis transmission under real hospital conditions, and to define the application parameters responsible as a basis for proposed new dosing guidelines. METHODS : Over an exposure period of 7 months, 90 guinea pigs breathed only untreated exhaust ward air, and another 90 guinea pigs breathed only air from the same six-bed tuberculosis ward on alternate days when upper room germicidal air disinfection was turned on throughout the ward. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The tuberculin skin test conversion rates (. 6 mm) of the two chambers were compared. The hazard ratio for guinea pigs in the control chamber converting their skin test to positive was 4. 9 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 8 – 8. 6), with an efficacy of approximately 80 %. CONCLUSIONS : Upper room germicidal UV air disinfection with air mixing was highly effective in reducing tuberculosis transmission under hospital conditions. These data support using either a total fixture output (rather than electrical or UV <b>lamp</b> <b>wattage)</b> of 15 – 20 mW/m 3 total room volume, or an average whole-room UV irradiance (fluence rate) of 5 – 7 mW/cm 2, calculated by a lighting computer-assisted design program modified for UV use.

40|$|AbstractIn {{building}} retrofit projects, numerous {{sources of}} uncertainty about building performance {{need to be}} addressed. Deterministic simulations are usually used to estimate the potential performance difference from a baseline building. This approach needs building model calibration. Varying uncertain building parameters could lead to orders of magnitude simulation times. For example, in a lighting retrofit project, uncertainty (e. g., <b>lamp</b> input <b>wattage,</b> and varying weather conditions may negatively affect model calibration and lighting energy savings, which increases the chance of default on performance contract. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} paper is to develop a method that can conduct risk analysis based on building model (e. g., building information modelling). A stochastic occupancy model is used to simulate the occupancy pattern. Two lighting control strategies (occupancy and daylight controls) and two luminaire types (LED and fluorescent) are considered. Historical weather data is analyzed using statistical analysis, and the extreme weather conditions are generated to evaluate the impact of weather conditions on the lighting and HVAC energy usage. Then, EnergyPlus is used to simulate the energy usage based on different lamp types, control strategies, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. A surrogate model is developed by using a small sample size of simulation data to construct an approximation surface to enable fast computing time. This method can evaluate impact of uncertainty of risk factors (e. g., occupancy level, luminaire type, weather) on lighting and HVAC energy usage and lighting electricity demand. This method can also prioritize risk factors based on sensitivity analysis on building performance and help users to choose different lamp types to minimize risks...|$|R

However, unlike incandescence lamps, compact fluorescent lamps do not draw sinusoidal currents at almost unity power factor.

Experimental results are presented to show a comparison of the actual energy consumption, power factor, costs, Lumen levels and current harmonics of compact fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps.

Simulation results are presented using the experimental data to determine the impact of large influx of compact fluorescent lamps on the third harmonic component present neutral current.

Due to the cost of these sterilisation chambers, most barbering shops resort to buying “Home used ” UV sterilisation chambers. In this study, the effectiveness of these sterilisation chambers against microbes that cause skin infections was assessed. A random sample of 50 barbering shops using these boxes were analysed for microbial colonies or counts, type of UV lamps used, ages of sterilisation chambers and general condition of the sterilisation chambers in the North Kaneshie Municipality, a suburb of Accra, Ghana.

40|$|Photocatalysis appears one of {{the most}} viable {{solutions}} to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. One of the limitations of commercial application of photocatalysis is the low photoreactivity. It has been reported that ZnO has better photocatalytic activity compared to TiO 2; however, due to the value of its band-gap energy, about 3. 4 eV, it is effective only under irradiation of UV light. In order to increase the photocatalytic performances of ZnO, the doping of its crystalline structure with nitrogen could make possible the exploiting of the visible light. Moving from our finding that N-doped TiO 2 coupled with another semiconductor, like ZnS based phosphors (ZSP), leads to enhanced photocatalytic activity, the aim of this work was to verify the effect of coupling N-doped ZnO (N-ZnO) with ZnS-based phosphors (ZSP) in the photocatalytic removal of eriochrome black-T (EBT), used as model dye, since the latter represents more than a half of the global dye production. To get ZSP supported N-ZnO nanoparticles (N-ZnO/ZSP), a modified sol-gel method was used. The nominal content of N-doped ZnO was varied from 15 to 70 wt%. The photocatalytic tests were carried out with a pyrex cylindrical photoreactor equipped with an air distributor device, a magnetic stirrer to maintain the photocatalyst suspended in the aqueous solution, and four UV <b>lamps</b> (<b>nominal</b> power: 32 W) with wavelength emission centred at 365 nm.
