5|$|In the case, it transpires that {{victims of}} attacks similar to Miranda Green’s have been {{connected}} to the Cortexiphan trials in Jacksonville, Florida. Olivia visits Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) at Massive Dynamic's headquarters and demands a full list of the subjects, one of which she knows herself to be. Nina claims <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> such list. They also discuss Peter, and Nina guesses that Olivia {{is looking for a}} reason not to tell him.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} egress system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, {{which would have}} left an unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom was found <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of}} his October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E
5|$|Sections 301 to 303 {{establish}} a Joint Commission on the Coinage in the Executive Branch, chaired by the Treasury Secretary.

5|$|The 1972 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{is one of}} five Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> major hurricanes, the others being 1968, 1986, 1994, and 2013. Although Subtropical Storm Alpha formed on May23, the season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's final storm, Subtropical Storm Delta, dissipated on November7.|$|E
5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E

25|$|This cycle {{seems to}} be a coincidence. The periods of the Moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun are {{believed}} to be independent, and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> known physical resonance. An example of a non-coincidental cycle is the orbit of Mercury, with its 3:2 spin-orbit resonance.|$|E

25|$|An {{object with}} {{relatively}} high entropy is microscopically random, {{like a hot}} gas. A known configuration of classical fields has zero entropy: there is nothing random about electric and magnetic fields, or gravitational waves.

25|$|The K39 {{dipstick}} test {{is easy to}} perform, {{and village}} health workers can be easily trained to use it. The kit may be stored at ambient temperature and no additional equipment needs to be carried to remote areas.

25|$|In May and June 1965, Blackpool and Sheffield United {{were invited}} to tour New Zealand as a {{pre-season}} warm-up.

Consequently, the only matches played were between the two visiting clubs. Sheffield United won the ten-game series 6–4.|$|E
25|$|Prokaryotes {{are not as}} {{structurally}} {{complex as}} eukaryotes, and were once thought <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> internal structures enclosed by lipid membranes. In the past, they were often viewed as having little internal organization, but slowly, details are emerging about prokaryotic internal structures. An early false turn was the idea developed in the 1970s that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy.|$|E
25|$|Veteran {{republicans}} were {{critical of the}} IRA's Dublin leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action {{in advance of the}} violence. On 24 August Joe Cahill, Seamus Twomey, Dáithí Ó Conaill, Billy McKee and several other future Provisional leaders came together in Belfast intending to remove the Belfast leadership and turn back to traditional militant republicanism. Although the pro-Goulding commander Billy McMillen stayed in command, he was told it was only for three months and he was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> communication with the IRA's Dublin based leadership.|$|E

This person must have gained this knowledge in a prior life, and is now merely recalling it from memory. Since the person in Socrates' story is able to provide correct answers to his interrogator, it must be the case that his answers arose from recollections of knowledge gained during a previous life.|$|E

The eventual title came about by accident: one of the potential titles was Tomorrow Never Lies (referring to the Tomorrow newspaper in the plot) and this was faxed to MGM. But through an error this became Tomorrow Never Dies, a title which MGM found so attractive that they insisted on using it. The title was the first <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> relation to Fleming's life or work.|$|E

[...] Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives and finds himself [...] "totally blocked".

[...] Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, [...] "maybe it's better <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> more stories". [...] Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett: [...] "Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness", but then realizes, [...] "on the other hand, he said it".|$|E
