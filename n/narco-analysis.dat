50|$|A <b>narco-analysis</b> {{test was}} {{conducted}} on SIMI's leaders Safdar Nagori, Kamruddin Nagori and Amil Parvez who had stated about Abdul Razzaq's involvement in the blasts and him informing Safdar about it. Times Now had broadcast a video of the test in 2017. The later statements of Swami Aseemanand of Sunil Joshi telling him of involvement of his men in the blast had caused confusion for the investigators. One of the investigating officers stated in 2016 that they had investigated the Islamists including Safdar but didn't find them involved. Razzaq {{who had been in}} prison since 2005 had been interrogated and had brought Qasmani to the notice of Intelligence Bureau as a key Lashkar financier. He was questioned regarding the case, but no evidence of his involvement were found. Some officers had also questioned the reliability of <b>narco-analysis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Constitution of India {{guarantees}} {{every person}} right against self incrimination under Article 20 (3): [...] "No person accused of any offence shall {{be compelled to}} be a witness against himself".It is well established that the Right to Silence has been granted to the accused {{by virtue of the}} pronouncement in the case of Nandini Sathpathy vs P.L.Dani, no one can forcibly extract statements from the accused, who has the right to keep silent, but only in the court of law. It is not clear if the accused can exercise his right to silence during interrogation by public servants. Interrogation techniques like <b>narco-analysis,</b> brain mapping and lie detection nullify the validity and legitimacy of the Right to Silence.But in 2010 The Supreme court found that <b>narco-analysis,</b> brain mapping and lie detector tests violate of Article 20(3).|$|E

On 31 July, the TV channel Aaj Tak alleged that Vijay Mandal had been drilled with leading information, prior to his <b>narco-analysis</b> tests. It also alleged that his apparent confessions during the tests had many gaps.|$|E

50|$|On 30 June 2008, Vijay Mandal (aka Shambhu), {{another friend}} of Krishna, was {{reported}} {{as a suspect}} in the media. Vijay was a driver and domestic help for Talwars' neighbour Puneesh Tandon. Hemraj, Krishna and Rajkumar were all of Nepali origin, and had been recruited through Vishnu, the ex-servant of the Talwars. On 9 July, Rajkumar was subjected to a second <b>narco-analysis</b> test at FSL Bangalore, and the next day, the media reported that he had confessed to the murders. Vijay Mandal, already being investigated, was also arrested on 11 July.|$|E
50|$|The door to Aarushi's room (and {{the main}} door of the house) would lock {{automatically}} when shut. Aarushi's door could either be opened from inside, or from outside with a key. Usually, her room would be locked at the night, and its keys would be at Nupur's bedside. There {{was no sign of}} forced entry in Aarushi's room. On the morning of 16 May, the key was found in its shoe-shaped key ring, on top of a framed wall sculpture near the house entrance, in the living room. Nupur later told police that she was not sure whether she closed Aarushi's door the last time she entered the room at 11:00 pm, and if she did, she might have let the keys hanging in the key slot. She claims to have stated this in several lie detector, brain mapping and <b>narco-analysis</b> tests that she cleared. In 2013, the SP Mahesh Kumar Mishra told the court that, on 16 May 2008, Rajesh Talwar claimed that he had locked Aarushi's room from outside at 11:30 pm on the previous night. Rajesh also told him that he had forgotten to lock his own bedroom door from inside, and someone could have stolen the key to Aarushi's room from his room.|$|E
50|$|The formal {{trial began}} from 11 May 2013. CBI was {{represented}} by senior advocate Siddharth Luthra. The Talwars were defended by the former solicitor-general Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Rebecca John, all of whom worked pro bono. The defence lawyers focused on opposing the clean chit given to the Krishna, Rajkumar and Vijay; providing counter-arguments to the points that raised suspicions on their clients; and pointing out lapses in the investigation. The Talwars were given access to the witness statements and the photographs on which CBI was relying for prosecution. However, they were not given access to the polygraph, <b>narco-analysis</b> and brain-mapping test reports of Krishna, Rajkumar and Vijay. The Talwars also objected to CBI's claim that the narco tests on the three men were unreliable. They moved to the Supreme Court to seek these reports, but in October 2013, the Court rejected their plea {{on the grounds that}} such reports are inadmissible in evidence. The Court also stated that the Talwars were adopting delaying tactics, citing the several applications filed by them at every stage. The CBI court also rejected the Talwars' plea to summon Anuj Arya and Nalini Singh to prove that the three men were present in Hemraj's room on the night.|$|E
50|$|The Hindustan Times {{carried a}} report in September 2008 of {{statements}} from the <b>narco-analysis</b> test conducted on SIMI's extremist wing chief Safdar Nagori {{as well as other}} leaders who were Kamruddin Nagori and Amil Parvez. Safdar at the time was of the blast was in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh due to a fractured hand. Per reports of the test, he stated that Abdul Razzaq was involved in the blast and had informed him the blasts would be carried out {{with the help of a}} few Pakistani nationals. Kamruddin and Amil Parvez had stated that Razzak was close to Nagori, had informed him and discussed about the blasts. Safdar however denied any meeting was held to plot the blast. A video of Safdar's test was broadcast by Times Now in July 2017. Rediff carried {{a report in}} 2011 that the later statements by Aseemanand on Sunil Joshi telling him of his role in the blasts had caused confusion among NIA and both the testimonies were contrary to each other. Vikash Narain Rai, the former Haryana police officer who headed the SIT from 2007 to early 2010, told The Wire in June 2016 mentioned that the SIT's first suspect were Pakistan-based terror groups or organisations like SIMI, stating that they had investigated many Islamists including Nagori. He stated that it became clear they were not involved as investigations progressed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Narco-analysis</b> {{was started}} almost seven years back in India, {{and was also}} {{accompanied}} by {{the increased use of}} lie-detection testing used on criminals. It was not taken up by human-rights organisations until 2007 when radical activists were arrested and subjected to <b>narco-analysis.</b> There are four components in the human right or legal definition of torture: the first that torture produces physical/mental suffering and is a degrading treatment. The second that it is always intentionally inflicted; the third that it is inflicted for certain purposes such as getting information, confession, etc., and the fourth that it is inflicted by an official actor oran actor acting on behalf of an official. In arco-analysis, all those four components are satisfied. <b>Narco-analysis</b> produces torture as clearly as the lethal injection produces death. <b>Narco-analysis</b> is eroding the very ethical core of the medical profession.
