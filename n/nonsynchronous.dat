This study aimed to evaluate the association between radioiodine therapy and risk of <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy and to examine whether the risk of <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy in differentiated thyroid {{cancer survivors}} treated with radioiodine therapy is increased relative to the general population. Methods: Among 895 radiation-naïve patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, 643 (71. 8 %) received ≥ 1 course of radioiodine therapy (radioiodine therapy-positive group) and 252 (28. 2 %) received no radioiodine therapy (radioiodine therapy-negative group). After a median follow-up of 93. 5 months (range, 23. 4 - 570. 8), 64 (7. 2 %) patients developed ≥ 1 <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy. Potential risk factors for <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy were entered into a multivariable regression model and cancer incidence in the radioiodine therapy-positive and -negative groups were compared to that of the general population by estimating the standardized incidence ratios. Results: The 20 -year cumulative <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy risk in radioiodine therapy-positive group was significantly higher than radioiodine therapy-negative group (13. 5 % vs 3. 1 %; P =. 015). Cumulative radioiodine therapy activity of 3. 0 to 8. 9 GBq (relative risk, 2. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 079 - 7. 154; P =. 034) was the only independent risk factor for <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy after adjusting for age, sex, period of differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosis, and stage of differentiated thyroid cancer. For females, the standardized incidence ratio in the radioiodine therapy-positive group was 1. 54 (95 % CI, 1. 11 - 2. 08) and in the radioiodine therapy-negative group it was 0. 92 (95 % CI, 0. 37 - 1. 90). Conclusion: Differentiated thyroid cancer female survivors treated by radioiodine therapy appeared to be at elevated risk of <b>nonsynchronous</b> second primary malignancy when compared to the general population and this risk was not apparent in those not previously treated by radioiodine therapy. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

This investigation therefore set out to control for <b>nonsynchronous</b> trading and non-trading effects and volatility clustering in the Norwegian equity market. The problem is approached by applying a linear ARMA-GARCH-in-mean lag specification. The ARMA lag specification controls for <b>nonsynchronous</b> trading and non-trading effects in the mean equation. The GARCH lag specification controls for conditional heteroscedasticity and volatility clustering in the latent conditional volatility equation. All lags are Schwarz efficient.

If based on formal methods, they can also serve for enabling the early verification of various properties such as component coordination and for guiding the synthesis of code cor-rect by construction. This is the case with process algebraic architectural description languages, which are process calculi enhanced with the main ar-chitectural concepts. However, the techniques with which those languages have been equipped are mainly conceived to work with synchronous commu-nications only. The objective of this paper is threefold. On the modeling side, we show how to enhance the expressiveness of a typical process alge-braic architectural description language by including the capability of rep-resenting <b>nonsynchronous</b> communications {{in such a way that}} the usability of the original language is preserved.
