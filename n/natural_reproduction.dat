5|$|For several decades, no <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> of pallid {{sturgeon}} was observed, {{since all}} the fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|The species' modern {{range in}} North America is mostly {{confined}} to Alaska and Canada, with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and small portions of Washington, Idaho, northern Oregon, and Montana. A functional wolf population should exist in California by 2024 {{according to estimates}} by state wildlife officials. Canadian wolves began to naturally re-colonize northern Montana around Glacier National Park in 1979, and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986. The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew {{as a result of}} <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994. From 1995–1996, wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho. In addition, the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. The gray wolf is found in approximately 80% of its historical range in Canada, thus making it an important stronghold for the species.|$|E

25|$|The {{stocking}} of Atlantic salmon resumed in the Salmon River in 1995. Small returns {{several years}} later established a limited summer fishery. However, {{it was not until}} 2009 that successful <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> of Atlantic salmon was observed. This marked the first time naturally reproduced Atlantic salmon were found in the Salmon River in over a century.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additional}} {{attempts to}} establish spawning populations of Chinook, coho and Atlantic {{salmon in the}} river took place between 1939 and 1959. In each instance, failure to document subsequent <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> led to each program being discontinued. Poor river conditions, pollution, and the impacts of parasitic sea lampreys contributed {{to the failure of}} these stocking programs.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{occurs when}} more fish are caught than the {{population}} can replace through <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Gathering as many fish as possible {{may seem like}} a profitable practice, but overfishing has serious consequences. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities who depend on fish for their way of life.|$|E

50|$|RBC Director Steven Stice {{and animal}} and dairy science {{assistant}} professor Franklin West thought of saving the endangered cat species {{that made it}} into a reality. Artificial insemination provides a remedy for animals who, due to anatomical or physiological reasons, are unable to reproduce in the <b>natural</b> way. <b>Reproduction</b> of stored genetic material also allows for the fostering of genetic improvements, and the prevention of inbreeding.|$|R
25|$|For many years, {{flow rates}} in the river's main stem below the Lighthouse Hill Dam changed {{frequently}} and dramatically as water was released in response to variable demands for electricity. The 1996 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's re-licensing agreement for hydroelectric power generation on the river regulated river flows, {{with the goal of}} improving the river's natural habitat. Managed flows led to significant increases in <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> of Chinook salmon within the river, and enhanced the recreational appeal of the river through planned high-water releases that provide opportunities for white-water rafting throughout the summer.|$|E
25|$|Salmon River Atlantic salmon populations {{declined}} {{rapidly in}} the mid-19th century due to overfishing, pollution, {{and the construction of}} numerous dams preventing access to spawning grounds. By 1872, these native salmon were extirpated from the river. Between 1873 and 1898, approximately 1.1 million Chinook salmon were stocked in the Salmon River; however stocking ceased once it was demonstrated that no <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> of these salmon was taking place. This same period of time saw the stocking of 144,000 Atlantic salmon fry, however poor survival of these fish led to this program being discontinued as well. By 1898, all salmon in Lake Ontario were apparently extirpated.|$|E
25|$|Lake Michigan {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of fish species and other organisms. It was {{originally}} home to lake whitefish, lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the alewife. As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and quagga mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan's ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.|$|E
50|$|Some plants {{normally}} develop adventitious buds {{on their}} roots, which can extend quite {{a distance from}} the plant. Shoots that develop from adventitious buds on roots are termed suckers. They are a type of <b>natural</b> vegetative <b>reproduction</b> in many species, e.g. many grasses, quaking aspen and Canada thistle. The Pando quaking aspen grew from one trunk to 47,000 trunks via adventitious bud formation on a single root system.|$|R

500|$|American {{paddlefish}} are {{endemic to}} the Mississippi River Basin, historically occurring from the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers {{in the northwest}} to the Ohio and Allegheny rivers of the northeast; {{the headwaters of the}} Mississippi River south to its mouth, from the San Jacinto River in the southwest to the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers of the southeast. They were extirpated from New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as from much of their peripheral range in the Great Lakes region, including Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada. In 1991, Pennsylvania implemented a reintroduction program utilizing hatchery-reared American paddlefish in an effort to establish self-sustaining populations in the upper Ohio and lower Allegheny rivers. In 1998, New York initiated a stocking program upstream in the Allegheny Reservoir above Kinzua Dam, and a second stocking in 2006 in Conewango Creek, a relatively unaltered section of their historic range. Reports of free ranging adults captured by gill nets have since been documented in Pennsylvania and New York, but {{there is no evidence of}} <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction.</b> [...] They are currently found in 22 states in the US, and are protected under state and federal laws. [...] There are 13 states that allow commercial or sport fishing for American paddlefish.|$|E
500|$|Spawning {{sites are}} usually {{a bed of}} fine gravel in a riffle above a pool. A female trout clears a redd in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 [...] eggs per {{kilogram}} of weight. During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel. [...] As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or alevin. In approximately two weeks, the yolk sac is completely consumed and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton. The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area, habitat, life history and {{quality and quantity of}} food. As fry grow, they begin to develop [...] "parr" [...] marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called [...] "parr" [...] because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger. [...] In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or [...] "carryover" [...] for several seasons before they are caught or perish.|$|E
500|$|Six {{areas were}} studied for wild pallid {{sturgeon}} population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS {{has referred to}} these six areas of wild population studies as [...] "recovery priority management areas" [...] (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the Marias River in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of Lake Sakakawea, and the lower Yellowstone River up to {{the confluence of the}} Tongue River, Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the Niobrara River to Lewis and Clark Lake along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during the study period. Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.|$|E

2500|$|The splake is an {{intrageneric}} hybrid {{between the}} brook trout and lake trout (S. namaycush). Although uncommon in nature, they are artificially propagated in substantial numbers for stocking into brook trout or lake trout habitats.

2500|$|Striped bass spawn {{in fresh}} water, and {{although}} they have been successfully adapted to freshwater habitat, they naturally spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., they are anadromous). Four important bodies of water with breeding stocks of striped bass are: Chesapeake Bay, Massachusetts Bay/Cape Cod, Hudson River, and Delaware River. Many of the rivers and tributaries that emptied into the Atlantic, had at one time, bred stock of striped bass. This occurred until the 1860s. [...] One of the largest breeding areas is the Chesapeake Bay, where populations from Chesapeake and Delaware bays have intermingled. [...] The very few successful spawning populations of freshwater striped bass include Lake Texoma, Lake Weiss (Coosa River), the Colorado River and its reservoirs downstream from and including Lake Powell, and the Arkansas River, as well as Lake Marion (South Carolina) that retained a landlocked breeding population when the dam was built; other freshwater fisheries must be restocked with hatchery-produced fish annually. Stocking of striped bass was discontinued at Lake Mead in 1973 once <b>natural</b> <b>reproduction</b> was verified.|$|E
