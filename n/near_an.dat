5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is <b>near</b> <b>an</b> ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E

Ten Marines from 3rd Battalion were killed during the operation (out of 183 total US fatalities), and American forces captured numerous quantities of PAVN supplies. One Marine, Lance Corporal (LCPL) William R. Prom, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry during Taylor Common.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution <b>near</b> <b>an</b> attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935.

Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} future, in the year 2039, where humans have begun deep space exploration.

Upon boarding the ship, the soldier discovers it has been overrun by hostile aliens. The aliens have captured the human crew for an unknown purpose.

The protagonist's overall goal is to rescue as many human hostages as possible, eliminate the alien threat, and escape the space craft.|$|E
5|$|All of SR 607 {{is located}} in central Morgan County, Ohio. The state route starts at the {{intersection}} of SR60 near McConnelsville. SR607 travels north {{for the majority of the}} length. SR 607 passes <b>near</b> <b>an</b> Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) county garage near the beginning of the road. Halfway through the route, SR607 meets Township Road 696 in a T-intersection, where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard training site at Hawk Drive. The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR78 at another T-intersection. The route goes through mostly forests and small hills. In 2012, ODOT calculated 1,975 vehicles traveling south of McGovern Lane. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. No part of SR607 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed most important for the economy, defense and mobility of the country.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Daniel {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July2. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection, and on July12, it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection increased on July13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of Mexico. It tracked westward at about 15mph (25km/h), and on July16, the disturbance became better organized. With convective rainbands <b>near</b> <b>an</b> associated low-level circulation, it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July16. At the time, it was located about 525miles (845km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E

Farther west, I-190 meets NY354 (exit2), NY16 (exit3), and several local streets before entering downtown Buffalo. Within the downtown area, I-190 passes between KeyBank Center and Coca-Cola Field <b>near</b> <b>an</b> interchange with NY5 (exit7) on the shores of Lake Erie.

5|$|In 1960 Sihanouk built a {{personal}} residence at Chamkarmon District {{where he lived}} {{over the next ten}} years as the Head of State. Following his overthrow in 1970, Sihanouk took up residence in Beijing, where he lived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the first year of his stay. In 1971 Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs to cook his meals. In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il-sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built <b>near</b> <b>an</b> artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008 Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a small house in Siem Reap and 30,000 Euros of cash savings stored in a French bank. He also stated that his residences in Beijing and Pyongyang were guesthouses owned by the governments of China and North Korea, respectively, and that they did not belong to him.|$|E
