Amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C : H) and nickel-incorporated hydrogenated carbon (Ni/a-C : H) thin films were deposited onto the Si substrates by using reactive biased target ion beam deposition technique. The films' chemical composition, surface roughness, microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated by using XPS, AFM, TEM, nanoindentation and nanoscratch test, respectively. XPS results {{have shown that the}} film surface is mainly composed of <b>nickel,</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> whereas at the core is nickel carbide (Ni 3 C) only. The presence of Ni 3 C has increased the sp(2) carbon content and as a result, the mechanical hardness of the film was decreased. However, Ni/a-C : H films shows very low friction coefficient with higher scratch-resistance behavior than that of pure a-C : H film. In addition, in vitro bioactivity study has confirmed {{that it is possible to}} grow dense bone-like apatite layer on Ni/a-C : H films.

40|$|Most nickel is {{produced}} as Ferro-Nickel through a smelting process from Ni-bearing ore. However, these days, {{there have been}} some problems in nickel production due to exhaustion and the low-grade of Ni-bearing ore. Moreover, the smelting process results in a large amount of wastewater, slag and environmental risk. Therefore, in this research, spent Ni-Cd batteries were used as a base material instead of Ni-bearing ore for the recovery of Fe-Ni alloy through a direct reduction process. Spent Ni-Cd batteries contain 24 wt% Ni, 18. 5 wt% Cd, 12. 1 % C and 27. 5 wt% polymers such as KOH. For pre-treatment, Cd was vaporized at 1024 K.

It is found that nickel is fairly uniformly distributed in the pores of the carbon support. Addition of promoters produces a more homogeneous distribution of nickel ion in carbon. However, distributions of promoters in the pores are varying. Addition of promoters increases the dispersion of nickel in carbon. Promoters also change the interaction between the carbon and Ni, resulting in significantly different behaviors of catalysts under various environments.

They exhibit diverse crystal structures, properties and phenomena {{by virtue of}} which they find {{a wide range of}} scientific and technological applications. Controlled growth and manipulation of the specific structure and electronic behavior to meet the requirements of a given application is a challenging problem in view of many possible phases and composition of the resulting materials. The preparation method and experimental conditions will, therefore, significantly affect the properties and performance of Fe <b>oxides</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydroxides.</b> The goal of the project is to obtain Fe-based oxide/hydroxide catalytic materials and to derive a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and electronic properties. The obvious relevance of the work it to optimize conditions to produce high quality Fe- based nanomaterials capable of dissociating the water molecules and produce hydrogen. The present approach to synthesize Fe <b>oxides</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydroxides</b> is based on a chemical route involving Fe-containing compounds. First step involved is the precipitation of Fe hydroxide/oxide particles from iron salts in an aqueous and non-aqueous media. The resultant precipitates consist of agglomerated nanoparticles. The size of the resulting Fe <b>oxide</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydroxide</b> nanoparticle depends on the concentration of the original solutions. After precipitation, a weak organic acid is added to obtain different concentrations. The samples were obtained at different intervals of time. Structure modification and dispersion of nanoparticles have been achieved and correlated with the concentration of the organic acid. It is demonstrated that the microstructure can be controlled in order to tune the materials 2 ̆ 7 electronic behavior. In addition, the incorporation of various metal ions into the host matrix is explored in order to control the structure and electronic properties. The results are presented and discussed in detail in this dissertation. ...|$|R
