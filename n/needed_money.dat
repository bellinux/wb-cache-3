5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went hand in hand. Artists {{depended}} entirely on patrons while the patrons <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> to foster artistic talent. Wealth {{was brought to}} Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tyrol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.|$|E
5|$|The statue was {{dedicated}} by Lieutenant General John Mulholland, Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the dedication ceremony. The {{land on which}} the monument stands was donated by a private Wall Street firm. The statue cost over $750,000 to make, but all the <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> was donated by hundreds of private citizens, including some survivors of the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Escape is {{the second}} studio album by the hip-hop group Whodini. The album was {{recorded}} at Battery Studios in London, where the group worked with producer Larry Smith after their management could not find them a producer. Whodini member Jalil Hutchins convinced Smith, his friend, to produce the album when Smith <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> after a friend's hospitalisation. Although the group originally intended to record more rock-oriented material for the album, its music has a predominantly synthesizer-based backing, with a rhythm and blues influence.|$|E

We <b>need</b> <b>money</b> for schools, not the war. We <b>need</b> <b>money</b> for health care, not the war". Several speakers at the protest (originally held {{to mark the}} eighth anniversary of the Iraq War) condemned military action against Libya.

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Grant {{acquired}} a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones. In March 1859, Grant freed William, worth about $1,500, instead of selling {{him at a}} time when he desperately <b>needed</b> <b>money.</b> Grant moved to St. Louis, taking on a partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in real estate business as a bill collector, again without success, and at Julia's recommendation dissolved his partnership. In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. His application came with thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant correctly assumed the position would be given on the basis of political affiliation and was passed over as he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments. In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Ulysses paid off the debts he acquired in Missouri. Ulysses and family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.|$|E

He then seized their property and freed their slaves who were fit for military service. In this manner he gathered a large amount of wealth.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{underlay}} {{the termination}} of the longest period of peace the Eastern Roman and the Sassanid Empire ever enjoyed. The Persian king Kavadh I <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> to pay his debts to the Hephthalites who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499.

The ferries were free for Mormon settlers while all others were charged a toll of from $3 to $8.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Stout {{tired of}} writing a story {{whenever}} he <b>needed</b> <b>money.</b> He decided to stop writing until he had made enough money to support himself through other means, {{so that he would}} be able to write when and as he pleased. He wrote no fiction for more than a decade, until the late 1920s, when he had saved substantial money through his school banking system. Ironically, just as Stout was starting to write fiction again, he lost most of the money that he had made as a businessman in the Depression of 1929.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, the Utah Transportation Commission added {{a portion}} of the {{proposed}} West Valley Highway to the state highway system as State Route 154. A newly proposed corridor ran west from I-15 near 13400 South to near 3200 West, where it joined the older proposal and headed north to I-80. With the help of Governor Norman H. Bangerter, longtime resident of West Valley City, the project received <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> from the state's general fund, and was opened between SR-201 (2100 South) and SR-171 (3500 South) on November 26, 1991. The Transportation Commission renamed the highway after Bangerter in May 1993. It was finally completed to I-15 on 17 November 1998.|$|E
25|$|In August 1977, a clue {{emerged to}} the {{disappearance}} of John Szyc: Michael Rossi, who had bought Szyc's car from Gacy, was arrested for stealing gasoline from a service station while driving the car. The attendant noted the license plate number and police traced the car to Gacy's house. (Rossi had lived with Gacy until April 1977 and had worked for PDM Contractors since May 1976.) When questioned, Gacy told officers that Szyc had sold the car to him in February with the explanation that he <b>needed</b> <b>money</b> to leave town. The police did not pursue the matter further, although they did inform Szyc's mother that her son had sold his car to Gacy.|$|E
