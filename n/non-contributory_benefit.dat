30|$|The largest cross-national {{variation}} in {{the values of the}} progressivity index is found in the case of contributory and <b>non-contributory</b> non-means-tested <b>benefits.</b> For example, in the case of contributory benefits, progressivity ranges from 0.84 in Netherlands and 0.78 in Denmark to 0.23 In Lithuania and 0.29 in Latvia. This suggests that despite being generally related to previous earnings, the impact of contributory benefits on the income distribution may vary a lot depending on their actual design as well as the features of the wider tax-benefit system they are embedded in. Similarly, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> range in progressivity from 0.63 in Hungary and 0.59 in Sweden to 0.11 in Lithuania and 0.18 in Portugal and Bulgaria. Given that by design they are not related to market incomes, we would expect this category of tax-benefits instruments to be generally progressive. However, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> are usually categorical benefits. Depending on the ranking in the income distribution of the groups they target, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> may have a larger or smaller effect on inequality.|$|R

30|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of direct}} taxation into schedules, {{tax credits and}} a part attributable to tax allowances showed that redistribution is effected mainly via the schedules. The redistributive effect of tax schedules {{is largely due to}} their size {{and to a lesser extent}} to their progressivity. Neither tax allowances nor tax credits influence inequality levels to any great extent. However, it should be kept in mind that the effect of tax allowances and tax credits is critically linked to the design of tax schedules. In particular, tax allowances and tax credits cannot, by design, have a significant impact in the context of low taxation levels. Tax allowances are progressive in a context of flat rate taxation but regressive in a progressive regime. Both tax allowances and tax credits affect inequality much less than means-tested and even <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits.</b> This reinforces the idea that the inequality-reducing capacity of fiscal benefits is limited.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Brazil has {{developed}} a series {{of economic and social}} policies designed to overcome social exclusion, hunger, inequality and poverty.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} allocate income opportunities and time resources among similar qualified workers {{with the help of}} an internet and smart-phone application called “Job Sharing Doodle”. It builds on the assumption that tools of this kind might reduce transaction costs and therewith help to overcome typical Common Goods dilemmas which seem to impede the emergence of non-contributory income maintenance systems. European income maintenance systems can be distinguished in respect to the share of noncontributory benefits they foresee in the case of unemployment. (Titmuss 1968, Walker 2004, Millar 2009) Whereas in countries like France or Germany premium-based insurance systems prevail over <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits,</b> Scandinavian countries rather tend towards tax-based redistribution systems with less emphasis on insurance. Theoretically, insurances can be conceived as distributing labor incomes individually on a timeline- that is, from a period in ones private life with employment to another period without employment-, whereas noncontributory transfer systems distribute labor incomes socially among society members- that is, from people with employment to people without.

40|$|Welfare {{states have}} {{developed}} within nation-states and were initially aimed {{at their own}} citizens. Migrants, however, are also included in Bismarckian insurances due to the link between work contract and insurances. With this in mind, then, what happens with <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> such as social assistance? In this paper we tackle Luxembourg?s social assistance, the Revenu Minimum Garanti (RMG). The legal framework of this benefit contains a residence condition which excluded all migrants and still excludes non-EU migrants. By differentiating immigrants via their educational level and migration status (EU or non-EU) and nationals via their educational level (for both groups being {{more or less than}} a BA/BSc), we can demonstrate in a more contrastive way the ?eligibility? and the ?take-up? versus ?non-take-up? of the RMG by the different groups. Given Luxembourg?s strong highly qualified immigration, comparing just ?immigrants? with ?nationals?, presupposing hence two homogeneous groups, would not have been appropriate. We used one wave of the PSELL 3 /EU-SILC household panel and discovered a relationship between eligibility and migration status only for the less qualified immigrants and nationals with a very high eligibility for non-EU migrants, but an extremely small eligibility for highly qualified nationals and migrants. According to the regression analysis of take-up, there is no significant difference between nationals and immigrants for the less qualified. Hence we conclude that there is little consumption by the most vulnerable. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the decline of}} National Insurance in Britain, as witnessed by its declining share of all social security spending and the steady dilution of the "contributory principle" on which it was originally based. It argues that this decline is not an accident: under governments of the Left, arguments in favour of inclusion have been predominant, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> expanded and contribution conditions softened; under those of the Right, the emphasis has been on focussing limited resources on the poorest through means-testing. Given where we are now, the strong arguments in principle for social insurance look much weaker. However, there are also reasons why the system has not been swept away, notably {{the way in which}} the bulk of the system is concerned with state pension rights which have already accrued. The paper explores current plans for the future development of state pensions, arguing that their combined effect is to restore something like a flat rate state pension, but with significant complexity. This could be developed into a more transparent system guaranteeing a total state pension at a fixed percentage of average earnings for those meeting a participation test, rather than being based on contribution records. This leaves a choice for the remaining sixth of National Insurance benefits: to separate out state pensions and absorb the other insurance benefits within the rest of working age social security, or to maintain the scope of National Insurance, but also based on participation, not past contributions. social insurance, social security, pensions, direct taxation...|$|R

Results point to substantial heterogeneity in welfare dependence between countries when not controlling for observed characteristics {{of immigrants and}} natives. This is primarily due to different selection into benefits between immigrants and natives and differences in their characteristics (mainly income, personal, and household characteristics). Once this is controlled for, immigrants participate at most equally often in both types of benefits as natives and usually also receive lower or comparable benefit levels...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} redistributive effects of taxes and {{benefits}} in the 27 countries that form the European Union. We rely on various Gini class measures to assess the redistributive effect, {{as well as the}} contribution to overall inequality of eight different tax-benefit instruments, i.e. public pensions, means-tested <b>benefits,</b> contributory <b>benefits,</b> <b>non-contributory</b> non means-tested <b>benefits,</b> direct taxes, tax allowances, tax credits and worker insurance contributions. In line with previous research, we find that, overall, tax benefit systems do succeed in redistributing significant portions of market income and in doing so they reduce inequality considerably. However, the extent of the redistribution varies markedly across countries. Although precise country rankings vary somewhat depending on the Gini measure used, all indicators suggest that Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, France, Germany and the Czech Republic reduce inequality significantly via their taxes and benefits. In contrast, tax-benefit systems reduce inequality least in Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria, Latvia and Lithuania. According to the widest used Gini measure (v = 2.0), inequality reduction is more than twice as large in the former group of countries compared to the latter.|$|R
30|$|To summarize, {{our results}} confirm {{previous}} findings {{related to the}} substantial redistribution achieved via taxes and benefits, {{as well as to}} the large variation existent across EU countries. The largest elements of the tax-benefit system (pensions and direct taxes) are also the ones impacting strongest on redistribution despite occasionally having low progressivity. This result is consistent with previous scholarly work on the ‘paradox of redistribution’ suggesting that extensive, non-targeted social programs are able to redistribute more due to their increased resources (Korpi and Palme 1998; Nelson 2004). Finally, direct transfers, even when not targeted (contributory and <b>non-contributory</b> non-means-tested <b>benefits)</b> are more likely to reduce inequality compared to tax concessions (allowances and credits). Thus, fiscal ‘spending’ is much less likely to be redistributive compared to traditional ‘social’ spending.|$|R
