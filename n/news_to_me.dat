500|$|Turley made an {{appearance}} on It's <b>News</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> a current events-based game show hosted by Walter Cronkite. He was mentioned in a song called [...] "St. Louis Browns" [...] by Skip Battin, who was the bass guitarist of The Byrds and the New Riders of the Purple Sage. In the lyrics, Battin describes Turley as a [...] "no-hit pitcher" [...] who [...] "got too surly" [...] and who was [...] "traded...too early".|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then, we {{will say}} ten o'clock," [...] Monsieur Flambard said. [...] "I will keep Monsieur Porson, {{as he has}} <b>news</b> <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> {{concerning}} the friend who recommended him to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{that is good}} <b>news,</b> Prince, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> who am {{charged with}} your welfare, for be sure, if I can prevent you, you shall never mix your life with that of this heathen sorceress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} you persuaded <b>me</b> <b>to</b> listen {{to you on the}} pretence that you had <b>news</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> of the doings at Waterloo--news on which my {{happiness}} depended. You have not told me a single fact that concerns me in the least." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Reuters, Rowling was {{surprised}} over the fuss and {{declined to say}} whether her [...] "outing" [...] of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality. [...] "It has certainly never been <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He {{is what he is}} and I have the right to say what I say about him," [...] she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet.|$|E
2500|$|From 1953 to 1957, Cronkite {{hosted the}} CBS program You Are There, which reenacted {{historical}} events, using {{the format of}} a news report. His famous last line for these programs was: [...] "What sort of day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times ... and you were there." [...] In 1971, the show was revived and redesigned to attract an audience of teenagers and young adults on Saturday mornings. He also hosted The Twentieth Century, a documentary series about important historical events of the century composed almost exclusively of newsreel footage and interviews. It became a long-running hit (it was renamed The 20th Century in 1967). Cronkite also hosted It's <b>News</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> a game show based on news events.|$|E
60|$|This was <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and glancing {{sideways}} at Poirot, I fancied {{that it was}} news to him as well.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the night Mother's spirit came and spoke <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] Looking weariful and white - As 'twere {{untimely}} <b>news</b> she broke <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'd {{been holding}} a napkin over my arm at Chubb's about long enough then, so I wired High Jack 'Yes'; {{and he sent}} me a ticket, and I met him in Washington, {{and he had a}} lot of <b>news</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>me.</b> First of all, was that Florence Blue Feather had {{suddenly}} disappeared from her home and environments.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is indeed, Patsey; and yet, {{even when}} the <b>news</b> came <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I could {{scarcely}} grieve that it was so. I had seen how he was fading when I went away, and was not surprised when I heard that he had gone. For me it is one care, one anxiety, the less, in future.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{this is very}} {{surprising}} <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{am sorry}} and disappointed to hear it. I {{thought he was a}} very manly fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|His tone {{surprised}} her; {{but she was}} in {{a humble}} mood, and answered, without being offended: [...] "It is sweet <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> How could you think otherwise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very happy}} to hear that I have,' said Tom, 'but it's <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I never knew it. They must be capital people to keep a secret, John.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is afraid}} <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> that the optimistic speculations {{with which he}} tried to soothe my mind arose entirely from his own imagination. The whole thing is exactly what I expected, and he hasn't the courage to come and say so. Now, really, don't {{you think this is}} the state of the case, and that if he had {{anything}} but the worst <b>news</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>me</b> he would have been here long ago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] responded Andrew, {{holding her}} hand; [...] "things have gone well with us, but {{except for the}} mineral {{recorder}} you are the first person I've told the good <b>news</b> <b>to.</b> That strikes <b>me</b> as particularly appropriate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So thou hast {{no better}} <b>news</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>me</b> from without, Sir Thomas!" [...] said the King, {{after a long}} and perturbed silence, spent in the feverish {{agitation}} which we have endeavoured to describe. [...] "All our knights turned women, and our ladies become devotees, and neither a spark of valour nor of gallantry to enlighten a camp which contains the choicest of Europe's chivalry--ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Peter, and I am {{surprised}} to hear it. I did think that even the great Tecumthe was scarcely as big a chief as you are yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mouse dear, {{all this}} isn't <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Surely you, who've gipsied with me, aren't {{going to be}} so obvious, so banal, as to blame me because you've cared for me, are you, child?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wrote the}} same {{afternoon}} to Ada, {{telling her that}} Polly had come down to break the <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and congratulating her on the happiness which she, as well as myself, must be feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guessed that}} much," [...] muttered d'Alcacer to himself. [...] "But that, you know, Mrs. Travers, that isn't good <b>news</b> at all <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> World of dreams, eh? That's very bad, very dangerous. It's almost fatal, Mrs. Travers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} away from home, too," [...] she said. [...] "Do I see in this serious face some {{astonishing}} <b>news</b> waiting <b>to</b> overpower <b>me?</b> Have you found a sweetheart? Are you engaged to be married?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} {{well how}} the <b>news</b> came <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I was lying {{at the time}} off Selsey Bill when I saw a small war-vessel coming down Channel. It had never been my policy to attack any vessel coming down. My torpedoes and even my shells were too precious for that. I could not help being attracted, however, by the movements of this ship, which came slowly zigzagging in my direction.|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} miracle happened. The sailorman remembered Billy Harper. Perhaps {{there was a}} Billy Harper, and perhaps {{he had been in}} Shanghai for forty years and was still there; but it was <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I have," [...] she answered. [...] "That {{they love}} each other is no <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That they intend to wed does not {{surprise}} me. But that they should contemplate a secret marriage passes my comprehension." ...|$|E
60|$|This was no {{agreeable}} <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I {{was sick}} at heart with the dismal story I had heard. I was harassed and fatigued, {{and the sight}} of the banditti began to grow insupportable to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you refer}} to that last year's project of yours for making your fortune among the sculptors. I should like to hear how it was you failed with the wealthy young amateur. Remember that I fell ill before you had any <b>news</b> <b>to</b> give <b>me.</b> Your absence when I {{returned}} from Lucca, and, almost immediately afterward, the marriage of your intended conquest to the sculptor's daughter, proved <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> of course, that you must have failed. But I never heard how. I know nothing at this moment but the bare fact that Maddalena Lomi won the prize." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That you {{are going}} to my dear native country, and will not [...] pass my Father without seeing him, was most welcome <b>news</b> <b>to</b> [...] <b>me.</b> The Swabians are a good people; this I more and more [...] discover, the more I grow acquainted with the other [...] provinces of Germany. To my family you will be cordially [...] welcome. Will you take a pack of {{compliments}} from <b>me</b> <b>to</b> [...] them? Salute my Father in my name; to my Mother and my [...] Sisters your daughter will take my kiss.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{happened}} {{that on the}} day this <b>news</b> came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> one of my Chicago friends sent their beautiful motor car to fetch Zulime and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the opera, and as the children saw us in our evening dress, they cried out, [...] "Oh papa, mama is a queen and {{you look like a}} king!" [...] Thus it {{happened that}} I rode away in a luxury which I had not earned at the very moment when my faithful trail-mate, after toiling all his life, was passing to his grave wifeless, childless and unknown.|$|R
6000|$|GARDINER. [...] <b>News</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> It then {{remains for}} your poor Gardiner, So you still care {{to trust him}} {{somewhat}} less Than Simon Renard, to compose the event In some such form as least may harm your Grace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, by golly, thet's <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me....</b> Bostil, there's been strange doin's lately." [...] Brackton {{seemed at}} a loss for words. [...] "Mebbe Slone got out because of somethin' thet come off last night.... Now, Joel Creech an'--an'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't for {{a moment}} suppose I am not {{perfectly}} aware {{that it is only}} Alice you think of. You were particularly anxious about my feelings, weren't you? You broke the <b>news</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with the tenderest solicitude. I am glad our--our daughter shares my husband's love.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But, Madame, I am {{engaged in}} this affair with Doña Rita, even if I had any {{interests}} elsewhere. I won’t {{tell you about the}} importance of my work. I didn’t suspect it but you brought the <b>news</b> of it <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and so I needn’t point it out to you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have some}} stupid <b>news.</b> It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{incredibly}} stupid. Let me {{pass it on}} to you quickly. You knew, didn't you, that I was married in America? Well, my wife has divorced me there. We married in a State where such things are possible." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell Andrea, and bid him warn her. But {{then she}} would guess that I had prompted him. Naught remained but to lay the matter before the Chevalier de Canaples. Already I had informed him of my fracas with St. Auban, and of the duel {{that was to be}} fought that night, and he, in his turn, had given me the details of his stormy interview with the Marquis, which had culminated in St. Auban's dismissal from Canaples. I had not hitherto deemed it necessary to alarm him with the <b>news</b> imparted <b>to</b> <b>me</b> by Malpertuis, imagining that did I inform Mademoiselle that would suffice.|$|R
