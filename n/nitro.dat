5|$|At Judgment Day on May 21, 2006, MNM {{lost their}} titles to Paul London and Brian Kendrick. After the match, Melina and <b>Nitro,</b> {{as part of}} the storyline, {{attacked}} Mercury, blaming him for the loss. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall, and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and <b>Nitro</b> were fired from the SmackDown! brand. The team then broke up because off-screen, <b>Nitro</b> and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to send <b>Nitro</b> and Melina to the Raw brand. Melina and <b>Nitro</b> debuted on Raw on May 29, with <b>Nitro</b> losing to WWE Champion John Cena. Melina continued to manage <b>Nitro</b> during his successful hunt for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, and in another storyline with Trish Stratus. The storyline turned into a tag team feud when Carlito teamed with Stratus after he saved her from the attacks of Melina and <b>Nitro.</b> At Saturday Night's Main Event on July 15, Melina and <b>Nitro</b> lost to Carlito and Stratus in a mixed tag team match.|$|E

After the 1946 season the Yankees ended their affiliation and were replaced by the Boston Red Sox and the team was renamed the Wellsville <b>Nitros.</b> The <b>Nitros</b> were kept their affiliation with Boston until 1949.

Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny <b>Nitro.</b> The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled <b>Nitro</b> from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but <b>Nitro</b> put his foot on the bottom rope. <b>Nitro</b> then made it over the cage, but just as <b>Nitro</b> was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and <b>Nitro</b> fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As <b>Nitro</b> was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event was between Johnny <b>Nitro</b> and Jeff Hardy. In September 2006, Hardy {{challenged}} <b>Nitro</b> numerous times for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, but failed to win it due to repeated interference by Melina (Melina Perez) (Nitro's then-girlfriend). Hardy finally defeated <b>Nitro</b> to win the title on the October 2 edition of Raw. On the November 6 edition of Raw, Eric Bischoff, the Raw authority figure for the night, scheduled a match between Hardy and <b>Nitro</b> for the title. In the match, Melina interfered and caused <b>Nitro</b> to get disqualified. Due to WWE rules, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission, as a result, Hardy retained his title. Bischoff then scheduled a No Disqualification match, which <b>Nitro</b> won after interference from Melina. The following week, Hardy and <b>Nitro</b> were scheduled in a Ladder match, a match where the contestant that climbs a ladder and retrieves an item (usually a title belt) hung above the ring is the winner. Hardy won the match and the title. On the November 27 episode of Raw, <b>Nitro</b> and his former tag team partner Joey Mercury, as MNM, accepted The Hardys open challenge for WWE's December pay-per-view, December to Dismember, which the Hardys came out victorious. The Hardys won the match. At Armageddon another one of WWE's December pay-per-views, MNM and The Hardys competed in a Four team Ladder match also involving Dave Taylor and William Regal and WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. London and Kendrick won the match and retained their titles. During the match, Mercury legitimately broke his nose when he was struck in the face with a ladder, when Jeff jumped off the top rope. On the December 18 edition of Raw, <b>Nitro</b> challenged Hardy to a Steel Cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against the edges of the wrestling ring, for the Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy accepted. The match then was scheduled for New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5|$|At Vengeance, Carlito {{fought in}} a Triple Threat match against Shelton Benjamin and Johnny <b>Nitro</b> for Benjamin's Intercontinental title. <b>Nitro</b> won the match after pulling Carlito {{outside of the}} ring and pinning him. Following Vengeance, Carlito began an {{on-screen}} relationship with Trish Stratus, turning face as a result. He also engaged in a short feud with Johnny <b>Nitro</b> and Melina, which ended after Carlito and Stratus defeated <b>Nitro</b> and Melina in a mixed tag team match at Saturday Night's Main Event. Carlito next feuded with Randy Orton, following a spot where Orton attempted to attack Stratus during a backstage segment. The two wrestlers were booked for a match at Unforgiven and a rematch on Raw; Orton won both matches. The feud concluded in a match at WWEâ€™s annual Tribute to the Troops event, where Carlito won by pinfall. The angle involving Carlito's relationship with Trish Stratus lasted until Stratus' retirement from wrestling following Unforgiven.|$|E

However, in November 2006, the team reunited for a brief period, before Mercury was let go from his contract in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, MNM {{were placed}} in an angle in which they found {{themselves}} in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a six-man tag match, London and Kendrick defeated the duo every time. At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, <b>Nitro</b> and Mercury started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and <b>Nitro</b> were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline.
