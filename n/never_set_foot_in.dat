However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father. He might have been willing to trade his claim away, but the offer was never put down in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|At dinner, Randyll insults Sam's bookishness, weight, {{and lack}} of {{fighting}} prowess. Gilly defends Sam, mentioning that Sam killed a Thenn and a White Walker. When Sam's brother Dickon insists that White Walkers don't exist, Gilly declares that she saw the act herself, but in doing so reveals her Wildling heritage. Disgusted, Randyll further insults Sam and Gilly, prompting Melessa and Talla {{to leave the room}} with Gilly in anger. Randyll tells Sam that Gilly and Little Sam can remain at Horn Hill, but that he must <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Horn Hill again. Sam bids farewell to Gilly, but then changes his mind and decides to bring her and Little Sam with him to the Citadel. As they leave, Sam takes House Tarly's ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, as well.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the reign}} of King George II, no monarch has ever resided at Hampton Court. In fact, George III, {{from the moment of}} his accession, <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the palace: he {{associated}} the state apartments with a humiliating scene when his grandfather had once struck him following an innocent remark.|$|E

After studying briefly under Andrea Gastaldi at the Accademia Albertina in Turin, Giacomo Gandi continued his formation independently by making trips to Florence, Rome - where he settled around 1869 - and Parma. He appears to have prided himself <b>in</b> <b>never</b> <b>setting</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, instead training with a painter by the surname Gigi.|$|R

50|$|Four years on, and Startsev {{is now a}} {{respected}} medical man, who owns a troika. Ekaterina returns to the town. She looks better than ever, and her groundless musical ambitions are left behind. Still, the naivety and freshness are gone. As the two meet, she eagerly tries to re-awaken his interest in her, but Startsev remains unresponsive. Now everything about the family irritates him and he is very glad he'd not married. Ignoring her insistent attempts at making him again regular visitor, he <b>never</b> <b>sets</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the Turkin's house again.|$|R
25|$|Umberto II {{lived for}} 37 years in exile, in Cascais, Portugal. He <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> his native land again; the 1948 {{constitution}} of the Italian Republic not only forbade amending the constitution to restore the monarchy, but until 2002 barred all male heirs to the defunct Italian throne from ever returning to Italian soil. Female members of the Savoy family were not barred, except queens consort.|$|E
25|$|Forcade and Ko {{were picked}} up {{to be used as}} translators in Japan, and father Leturdu was left in Tomari, soon joined by Father Mathieu Adnet. On July 24, 1846, Admiral Cécille arrived in Nagasaki, but failed in his {{negotiations}} and was denied landing, and Bishop Forcade <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> mainland Japan. The Ryu-Kyu court in Naha complained in early 1847 about the presence of the French missionaries, who had to be removed in 1848.|$|E
25|$|Macleod was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> any of Britain’s colonies, but the Hola massacre had helped focus his {{thinking on the}} inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department {{that he intended to}} be the last Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he “telescoped events rather than creating new ones”. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often find himself in conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod’s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always come down on his side in political disputes.|$|E

5|$|Flick {{was one of}} many star NL {{players who}} jumped to the fledgling American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics, before the Phillies {{obtained}} an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. Though this injunction named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, it still applied to Flick as well. As a recourse, Flick and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania injunction could not be enforced in Ohio. The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year, <b>never</b> <b>setting</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena. Flick spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement.|$|R
5000|$|Boettger had {{agoraphobia}} {{and rarely}} left home, <b>never</b> <b>setting</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> a museum from 1876 to 1894. Thus he relied on assistants to bring specimens he needed for his research. He was editor of [...] "Katalog der batrachier- Sammlung im Museum der Senckenbergischen naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Frankfurt am Main" [...] {{as well as}} [...] "Katalog der Reptilien- Sammlung im Museum der Senckenbergischen naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Frankfurt am Main", both catalogs being issued by the Senckenberg Museum. Also, he was co-author of the herpetology volume for the third edition of Alfred Brehm's Tierleben. During the latter stages of his career he taught classes at the Wöhler-Realgymnasium in Frankfurt and also engaged in some foreign travel.|$|R
25|$|Dr. Lobsang Sangay, a Fulbright {{scholar and}} {{graduate}} of Harvard Law School {{who was born}} in a refugee camp in India in 1968 and who has <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Tibet, was named Prime Minister of the CTA on April 27, 2011. He announced that he would spend his first five-year tenure in Dharamsala, India, the seat of the CTA. There he will not only assume the administrative responsibilities held by the previous PM, but will succeed the Dalai Lama as the political leader of the Tibetan cause, thus ignoring the PRC insistence that the Dalai Lama be succeeded by means of reincarnation, not another method of selection. Sangay, who once was a militant of the Tibetan Youth Congress, a group that unequivocally supports Tibetan independence, says he has matured and now supports the Middle Way Approach. Only about 80,000 Tibetans, half of the registered exile population, were eligible to vote because those living in Nepal were prevented by their host country from participating. The 6 million Tibetans inside Tibet and China did not participate. It is unknown if an exile government not led by the Dalai Lama, who was legitimated by religious tradition, will be viable.|$|E
25|$|Quickly, Alexandra and Peter II fell in {{love and}} planned to marry. Opposition from both Peter's mother, Maria, and the Yugoslav {{government}} in exile forced the couple to delay their marriage plans until 1944, when they finally celebrated their wedding. A year later, Alexandra {{gave birth to her}} only son, Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. However, the happiness of the family was short-lived: on 29 November 1945, Marshal Tito proclaimed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Alexandra, who had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> her adopted country, was left without a crown. The abolition of the Yugoslav monarchy had very serious consequences for the royal couple. Penniless and unable to adapt to the role of citizen, Peter II turned to alcoholism and multiple affairs with other women. Depressed by the behaviour of her husband, Alexandra neglected her son and made several suicide attempts. After the death of Peter II in 1970, Alexandra's health continued to deteriorate. She died of cancer in 1993 and her remains were buried in the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi in Greece, before being transferred to the Royal Mausoleum of Oplenac in 2013.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the redrawn 17th {{appeared}} to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% {{of his former}} territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% {{of the vote in}} 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{follows a}} {{seemingly}} relativistic plot, where {{time and space}} disappear as absolutes. The first part concerns Marc, {{the son of a}} small-town prostitute who becomes the boatman, ferrying tourists from the mainland to Davenhall, the small island in the river where he grew up. Marc leaves town the night he sees a strange man die at his mother's feet, and spends fifteen years on the boat, <b>never</b> <b>setting</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> town, until one day, when he meets a girl in a blue dress, who never returns with the other tourists. Marc goes onto the island to look for her, and sees his mother. Their meeting conjures up the ghost of the man who died fifteen years before, and his story takes over the novel.|$|R
500|$|In 1576, Catherine {{decided to}} enlarge her château of Chenonceau, near Blois. On Henry II's death, she had demanded this {{property}} from Henry's mistress Diane de Poitiers. She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane {{instead of to}} her. In return, she gave Diane the less prized Chaumont. [...] When Diane arrived at Chaumont, she found signs of the occult, such as pentangles drawn on the floor. She quickly withdrew to her château of Anet and <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Chaumont again.|$|E
500|$|Dutton {{felt that}} the Rangers were {{responsible}} for the league's refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, swore that the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup in his lifetime. His vow became known as [...] "Dutton's Curse". Additionally, he <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> an NHL arena again until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he was asked to drop the puck for the ceremonial faceoff prior to the first game in Calgary Flames' history. Dutton's 34-year separation from the NHL was attributed to the betrayal of the league's owners, but also because Dutton himself found the lure of the game too strong, and knew he had to step away in order to effectively manage his businesses.|$|E

As the initial salvage closed, for concern about oncoming war, Wainwright remained. On the day that the last salvage team was ordered home, the Spanish naval commander in Havana, Admiral Vincente Manterola, ordered the American flag, which was still flying from the rigging of the wrecked Maine, struck. Wainwright heard of the order and, calling an interpreter, issued an order that immediately made him famous, ...|$|R

50|$|The final ruling Nawab of Savanur, Abdul Majid Khan II, succeeded {{as a minor}} {{at the age of}} two years, and {{had been}} {{carefully}} raised and educated by his British overseers. He traveled widely and mixed with people in all walks of life in India and abroad. He returned to assume power determined to modernize his state, engaging in a furious program of building modern schools, dispensaries, government offices, courts, palaces, jails, irrigation tanks, and roads. In the short period of thirty-five years of his active rule, this little state advanced beyond anything achieved in the previous three centuries. The advent of Indian independence in 1947 and the withdrawal of the British caused the Nawab great sadness. Once the transfer formalities were completed, he retired to his private mansion at Dharwad, <b>never</b> <b>setting</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Savanur again. After his death in 1954, local authorities, out of sincere respect for a distinguished gentleman held in high regard almost universally, buried him in his beloved Savanur.|$|R

2500|$|Modern historians, however, {{state that}} {{the truth of the}} matter is this: There are indeed {{numerous}} ancient records of Mongol raids and occupations of Jerusalem (from Western, Armenian, or Arab sources), and in 1300 the Mongols did achieve a brief victory in Syria which caused a Muslim retreat, and allowed the Mongols to launch raids into the Levant as far as Gaza for a period of a few months. During that year, rumors flew through Europe that the Mongols had recaptured Jerusalem and were going to return the city to the Europeans. [...] However, this was only an urban legend, as the only activities that the Mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through Palestine, which may or may not have even passed through Jerusalem itself. [...] Regardless of what the Mongols may or may not have done, there is no evidence that Molay was ever a Mongol commander, and he probably <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Jerusalem.|$|E

A French worker, Vernet, supposedly stabbed in the stomach and the side by an Italian, had not answered a witness summons. The prosecutor sent for him by telegraph. The following day, a 30-year-old Vernet was called to the stand and asked if he had been stabbed. He replied, [...] "I wasn't stabbed. I didn't even go to the saltpans at Aigues-Mortes."
