So in addition to conventional power generation units, a large no. of renewable energy units are being integrated into the power system. A wind electrical generation system is the most cost competitive of all the environmentally clean and safe renewable energy sources in the world. The recent evolution of power semiconductors and variable frequency drive technology has aided the acceptance of variable speed generation systems. Fuzzy logic is a powerful and versatile tool for representing imprecise, ambiguous and vague information. It helps us model difficult, even intractable problems. Advantages of fuzzy control are that it is parameter insensitive, provides fast convergence and accepts noise noisy and inaccurate signals. The fuzzy algorithms are universal and can be applied retroactively in any system. In this thesis a squirrel cage induction generator feeds power to a double sided pulse width modulated converter system which feeds power to an autonomous load or grid. The generation system has three <b>no.</b> <b>s</b> <b>of</b> fuzzy logic control with vector control in its inner loop. * The first fuzzy controller tracks the generator speed with the wind velocity to extract maximum power. * The second fuzzy controller programs the machine flux for light load efficiency improvement. * The third fuzzy controller gives robust speed control against wind gust and turbine oscillatory torque. The fuzzy logic based control of the system helps to optimize efficiency and enhance performance. The system gives excellent performance and can easily be translated to a larger size in the field...|$|R

This proves the case of Lovasz’s path removal conjecture (1975), where f(3) = 6. This article examines the relationship between connectivity and path removal. The following definition of connectivity is used frequently Definition 1. A graph G is k − connected if a set <b>S</b> <b>of</b> k vertices disconnects the graph into at least two components C 1 and C 2 and <b>S</b> and <b>no</b> set <b>S</b> <b>of</b> k − 1 vertices disconnects the graph.

40|$|From the chapter) Stroop-type tests, {{consisting}} of naming coloured blocks or crosses, reading {{the names of}} colours in black ink, and reading the colour of ink which different colour names are printed in, are commonly used tests of cognitive flexibility, divided attention and speed of mental processing. Studies in the literature suggest that proneness to colour-confusion in an older population, coupled with test construction considerations of Stroop-type tests, may limit their usefulness with older adults. An adaptation of such a test for use with an older population, the California Older Adult Stroop Test (COAST), is described. Preliminary reliability and validity data are presented for Ss with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and healthy age-matched controls. No significant group effects on any dependent variable emerged for the COAST. The correlational data demonstrating high correlations between the COAST and Stroop imply that the 2 tests are similar in terms of measurement of time to complete the 3 trials <b>of</b> the tests. <b>No</b> <b>Ss,</b> regardless <b>of</b> diagnostic status, experienced colour-confusion on the COAST...|$|R

We undertake a fine analysis of Kurepa trees which results in defining canonical topological and combinatorial structures associated with the tree which possess a remarkably wide range of nonreflecting properties providing new constructions and solutions of open problems in topology. The most interesting results show that many known properties may not reflect at any fixed singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality.
