40|$|SUMMARY. A {{metallic}} mass brought o the Western Australian Museum {{from the}} Wongan Hills district N. W. of Perth {{has been identified}} as an iron meteorite of unique type. It has graphite inclusions about I mm across distributed throughout the metal giving a 'raisin bread ' appearance. Its nickel content (6 " 65 %) is comparable with that of coarse octahedrites but the kamacite grain structure is anomalous. Its gallium, germanium, and nickel contents place it close to, but outside, Wasson's chemical group IIb. Taenite is absent and troilite is rare. <b>Neumann</b> <b>bands</b> in the kamacite are distorted and the kamacite has flowed around large schreibersite inclusions. The latter have an exceptionally low nickel content (7 " 0 %) and probably formed at an unusually high temperature. The kamacite contains more phosphorus than normal iron meteorites, and small schreibersite grains in the kamacite are relatively nickel-poor (22 ~). The unusual structure of this iron is thought to be due to {{one or more of the}} factors high carbon, high phosphorus, and relatively rapid cooling. Details of thefind. Mrs. M. Bennett of Wongan Hills, Western Australia, reported a 'football-sized ' piece of iron recovered some years ago during stone picking in fields at Redfields Farm, 30 ~ 43 ' S.

40|$|THE Bondoc Peninsula {{meteorite}} {{appears to}} be unstable and is disintegrating {{as the result of}} terrestrial corrosion. The meteorite is complex with occasional 1 to 3 cm dia. 'Nodules ' of 'iron-class ' material, fig. I, within which are numerous non-metallic inclusions. These range in size from o' 5 -I- 5 mm and vary in shape from the extremes of angular to globular, shown in figs. 2 and 3. The metallic groundmass of fig. I is a polycrystalline array of kamacite grains that are equant in shape and about 3 to 4 mm dia. The boundaries between these kamacite grains are heavily invaded by corrosion product. The films of cracked schreibersite and strips of cornpositionally zoned taenite that are present at the kamacite boundaries each contribute about a % by volume and their average Ni contents are about 45 wt % and 4 o wt ~ respectively. When these figures are combined with the average 6 - 2 wt % Ni, o. 75 wt % Co, and o. o 2 wt % P of the kamacite the resulting bulk composition of the metal is [...] ~ 7 " 5 wt % Ni, [...] ~ o' 7 Wt~o Co, N o' 3 wt % P.

40|$|The misorientations between FCC and BCC {{crystals}} {{are characterized}} {{according to the}} common lattice correspondence relationships {{in terms of their}} parallelism conditions. Individual variants of the six models, namely the Bain, Kurdjumov-Sachs, Nishiyama-Wassermann, Pitsch, Greninger-Troiano and inverse Greninger-Troiano relations, are identified and represented in both pole figure form and in Rodrigues-Frank space with respect to various coordinate frames. In this way, the relations between the variants of these models are clarified. The orientations of the kamacite (BCC) lamellae transformed from a single prior-taenite (FCC) grain in the Gibeon meteorite were measured by analyzing the electron backscatter diffraction patterns. The local misorientations between individual FCC and BCC crystals along their common interfaces were computed and are compared with the common lattice correspondence relationships. The orientation relations between the alpha and gamma phases in the plessite regions are also characterized. The <b>Neumann</b> <b>bands</b> (mechanical twins) and their orientation variations within individual kamacite lamellae were studied and analyzed. A Nb-bearing TRIP steel was control rolled and a certain amount of austenite was retained through appropriate heat treatment. EBSD measurements were conducted on specimens deformed to various reductions and the textures (ODF's) of both the gamma and alpha phases were obtained from the measured data points. The orientations of the bainite formed within individual prior-austenite grains are compared to those expected from the common correspondence relationships and the average orientation of the prior-austenite grain. The crystallography of the bainite laths within a single packet is also characterized. The orientations of the bainite formed from individual prior-austenite grains are analyzed with respect to their parent orientations. The occurrence of variant selection at the grain scale was examined using a dislocation-based model. The model considers the role of the slip systems that were active during prior deformation, {{as well as those of}} in-plane reaction, cross-slip and the partial dislocations that are linked to specific variants. In this model, the K-S and N-W correspondence relations are united through the dissociation of perfect dislocations. The variants in more than 70 % of the grains examined are reasonably well predicted by this model...|$|E

40|$|Issues in {{simulation}} modeling, {{materials and}} high-energy explosives {{have been the}} three areas of research that have had {{the most impact on}} warhead technology. The present study focused on the materials issues and simulations and {{the relationship between the two}} in the case of Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs). ^ Tantalum (Ta), Armco iron (Fe) and oxygen-free high conductivity copper (OFHC Cu) EFPs were characterized using optical and transmission electron microscopy and microhardness testing, in order to understand the complex deformation mechanisms operating under the high strains (up to 300 %) and high strain rates (of the order of 104 – 105 s– 1) the EFPs are subjected to. Whereas dynamic recovery (DRV) was the dominant mechanism in Ta, Cu was characterized by complete dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and associated shear banding. Fe, on the other hand, showed features common to both Ta and Cu. It must be noted that Ta and Fe have a BCC crystal structure and Cu has a FCC crystal structure. Also, the melting point for Ta is 3020 °C compared to 1539 °C for Fe and 1083 °C for Cu. Extensive twinning (<b>Neumann</b> <b>banding)</b> occurred in Fe on shock wave interaction with the liner. Subsequent deformation caused the twins to deform, stretch and fragment, akin to the shaped charge jet formation and fragmentation process. This process resulted in the formation of DRV and DRX structures and shear bands. This shows that twinning, DRV, DRX and shear band formation are mechanisms not quite independent of each other, at least in the EFP regime. ^ Validations of the AUTODYN- 2 D hydrocode were performed in the case of each material not only considering the geometrical factors (which is the general practice) but also using microstructures and microhardness data. Plastic strain and temperature contour plots were correlated with observed microstructures, and microhardness maps matched with computer generated yield stress plots. It was shown that although both the Zerilli-Armstrong and Johnson-Cook strength models predicted the final EFP shapes fairly well, they showed stark differences in the yield stress predictions. Whereas Zerilli-Armstrong model predictions were better for Ta and Johnson-Cook for Fe, both models were equally good for Cu. ...|$|R

A final line up appeared post recording of the band's only album 'Volcanoes' comprising NJ Wilow (vocals), Richard Davies (guitar), Garry Becker (bass) and Dan <b>Neumann</b> (drums). The <b>band</b> quickly attracted press attention from the NME and Melody Maker. The band emerged as part of a perceived wave of female fronted bands influenced by the new wave sounds of the late 70s and early 80s. Other bands to emerge at the same time included Elastica, Sleeper, Echobelly and Salad.|$|R
