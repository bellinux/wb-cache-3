5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and <b>nanomedicine</b> are also being investigated.|$|E

25|$|A {{large area}} of {{interest}} in <b>nanomedicine</b> is the transdermal patch because {{of the possibility of}} a painless application of therapeutic agents with very few side effects. Transdermal patches have been limited to administer a small number of drugs, such as nicotine, because of the limitations in permeability of the skin. Development of techniques that increase skin permeability has led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermal patches and more options for patients.|$|E
30|$|There {{is also a}} {{reproducibility}} {{issue with}} nanoparticle production. Reproducible, large-scale synthesis of <b>nanomedicines</b> is still a challenge for the distribution of a homogeneous batch of <b>nanomedicines,</b> especially when considering that these nano-platforms often require specific conditions for production via self-assembly. Thorough characterization of these <b>nanomedicines,</b> at every stage of the production process must be enforced to ensure both reproducibility of synthesis and efficacy. Storage of these <b>nanomedicines</b> under appropriate conditions is also critical since colloidal instability can dramatically alter their performance in vivo. Ideal <b>nanomedicines</b> will have a modular design {{that can be easily}} scaled up for cGMP manufacturing and stored for a long time prior to use in patients.|$|R
30|$|To sum up, we overviewed the {{currently}} developed nanoplatforms for prognosis purpose {{as well as}} the promising strategies for the targeted delivery of drugs to the disordered CNS regions effective for GBM, AD, and PD. Through the enormous efforts to discover biomarkers and create <b>nanomedicines</b> targeting the biomarkers in the past decade, {{a number of studies have}} made fruitful progress to overcome current limitations that retard the clinical translation of CNS-targeting medicines. Moreover, recently proposed hybrid <b>nanomedicines,</b> combined with two or more <b>nanomedicines,</b> have accomplished diverse functions, such as dual or multiple targeting systems, multimodal therapies, multimodal diagnosis, or their combinations. These studies have thoroughly proven the incredible abilities of hybrid <b>nanomedicines</b> for detecting or treating neurological disorders both in vitro and in vivo, which may lead to success on the clinical translation at the end. Therefore, the significant improvement in the nanotechnologies for synthesis and functionalization of versatile <b>nanomedicines</b> will contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers and <b>nanomedicines</b> incorporated with the biomarkers to bring promising strategies to conquer the CNS diseases in the near future.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nanomedicines</b> {{based on}} {{biodegradable}} polymers for tumor imaging and therapy receive {{more and more}} attention due to their improved water solibility, bioavailability, and extended blood circulation times. Advanced polymer chemistry combined with {{a thorough understanding of}} the tumor microenvironment, allows the design and evaluation of improved multifunctional polymer-based <b>nanomedicines</b> for more effective cancer imaging and therapy. This thesis focuses on the design and evaluation of novel reduction-sensitive polymer-based <b>nanomedicines</b> for improved tumor-targeted imaging and therapy. The use of ligands (mono or dual) for targeting the nanosystems to the tumors and uptake by cells in the tumor have been described as well as the release of drugs from a nanosystem designed to release the drug in the tumor area by an external trigger. The in vivo performance of the <b>nanomedicines</b> described in this thesis including the stability, tumor targeting efficiency and antitumor efficacy have been evaluated using various tumor models...|$|R
25|$|Many {{polycarbonate}} {{grades are}} used in medical applications and comply with both ISO 10993-1 and USP Class VI standards (occasionally referred to as PC-ISO). Class VI is the most stringent of the six USP ratings. These grades can be sterilized using steam at 120°C, gamma radiation, or by the ethylene oxide (EtO) method. However, scientific research indicates possible problems with biocompatibility. Dow Chemical strictly limits all its plastics with regard to medical applications. More recently, scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center have developed aliphatic polycarbonates with improved biocompatibility and degradability for <b>nanomedicine</b> applications.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{currently}} {{debate the}} future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology {{may be able}} to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in <b>nanomedicine,</b> nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.|$|E
25|$|Human skin {{has a low}} permeability; that is, most foreign {{substances}} {{are unable}} to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most inorganic nanosized particles. This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to {{come into contact with}} internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in <b>nanomedicine</b> and biology to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms (cancer cells). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, <b>nanomedicines</b> {{in various}} medical fields hold a great promise {{to deliver the}} imaging agents or {{treatments}} for CNS diseases due to their beneficial features. The size of <b>nanomedicines,</b> operating {{in the range of}} 10 – 200  nm, achieve not only increased physiological properties of reactivity, strength, surface area, sensitivity, and stability [6], but also enhanced penetration properties across a BBB and deep into diseased brain tissues [7]. The drug encapsulation can prevent the degradation of drugs in the process of delivery, and the controlled release offers a safely delivery system by achieving the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to the disease area with appropriate dosage without harming healthy tissue. The modification on the surface of <b>nanomedicines</b> further enhance the BBB penetration as well as disease-targeting efficiency. Recently developed versatile <b>nanomedicines</b> can serve both diagnostic and multimodal treatment functions {{at the same time and}} proven their excellent potentials for targeting CNS diseases; a number of optimizations are still required for the future clinical purpose.|$|R
40|$|Drug {{targeting}} {{systems are}} nanometre-sized carrier materials designed {{for improving the}} biodistribution of systemically applied (chemo) therapeutics. Various different tumour-targeted <b>nanomedicines</b> have been evaluated over the years, and clear evidence is currently available for substantial improvement of the therapeutic index of anticancer agents. Here, we briefly summarise the most important targeting systems and strategies, and discuss recent advances and future directions {{in the development of}} tumour-targeted <b>nanomedicines...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} we provide an {{up to date}} {{snapshot}} of <b>nanomedicines</b> either currently approved by the US FDA, or in the FDA clinical trials process. We define <b>nanomedicines</b> as therapeutic or imaging agents which comprise a nanoparticle {{in order to control}} the biodistribution, enhance the efficacy, or otherwise reduce toxicity of a drug or biologic. We identified 51 FDA-approved <b>nanomedicines</b> that met this definition and 77 products in clinical trials, with ~ 40 % of trials listed in clinicaltrials. gov started in 2014 or 2015. While FDA approved materials are heavily weighted to polymeric, liposomal, and nanocrystal formulations, there is a trend towards the development of more complex materials comprising micelles, protein-based NPs, and also the emergence of a variety of inorganic and metallic particles in clinical trials. We then provide an overview of the different material categories represented in our search, highlighting <b>nanomedicines</b> that have either been recently approved, or are already in clinical trials. We conclude with some comments on future perspectives for <b>nanomedicines,</b> which we expect to include more actively-targeted materials, multi-functional materials (“theranostics”) and more complicated materials that blur the boundaries of traditional material categories. A key challenge for researchers, industry, and regulators is how to classify new materials and what additional testing (e. g. safety and toxicity) is required before products become available...|$|R
500|$|There are {{potential}} applications for DNA nanotechnology in <b>nanomedicine,</b> {{making use of}} its ability to perform computation in a biocompatible format to make [...] "smart drugs" [...] for targeted drug delivery. [...] One such system being investigated uses a hollow DNA box containing proteins that induce apoptosis, or cell death, that will only open when in proximity to a cancer cell. [...] There has additionally been interest in expressing these artificial structures in engineered living bacterial cells, most likely using the transcribed RNA for the assembly, although it is unknown whether these complex structures are able to efficiently fold or assemble in the cell's cytoplasm.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of MNT would be medical nanorobotics or <b>nanomedicine,</b> an area pioneered by Robert Freitas in numerous books and papers. [...] The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical nanorobots would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma. [...] Medical nanorobots might also make possible the convenient correction of genetic defects, and help to ensure a greatly expanded lifespan. [...] More controversially, medical nanorobots might be used to augment natural human capabilities. One study has reported on the conditions like tumors, arteriosclerosis, blood clots leading to stroke, accumulation of scar tissue and localized pockets of infection can be possibly be addressed by employing medical nanorobots.|$|E
40|$|As of 21 st century, {{cancer is}} arguably the most complex and {{challenging}} disease known to mankind and an inevitable public health concern of this millennium. Nanotechnology, suitably amalgamated with cancer research, has ushered an era of highly personalized and safer medicines which can improve cancer diagnosis and therapy. A wide variety of <b>nanomedicines</b> are currently under investigation, including polymeric/non-polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, lipid- and micelle-based nanoparticles. The bases of these <b>nanomedicines</b> in reducing toxicity associated with cancer therapy are their ability to carry a large payload and multivalent-ligand targeting. This imparts specificity for targeting the tissues as well as bypass resistance mechanisms. The major hurdles on these future medicines are potential toxicity of nanoparticles, which imposes the need of extensive regulatory evaluation before <b>nanomedicines</b> could be utilized as cancer therapeutics. This review highlights nanopharmaceuticals that have been investigated in oncology for various applications (diagnosis, therapeutic delivery and theranostics). It also discusses the effects of nano-sized materials on tissues/organ functions, the possibility of overcoming multi-drug resistance by using <b>nanomedicines</b> and their current clinical status...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>nanomedicines</b> {{for the treatment}} of cancer focuses on the local targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance drug efficacy and reduce adverse effects. The <b>nanomedicines</b> which are currently approved for clinical use are mainly successful in terms of improved bioavailability and tolerability but do not necessarily increase drug performance. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} improved drug carrier systems which are able to deliver high doses of anti-cancer drugs to the tumor. Stimuli responsive carriers are promising candidates since drug release can be triggered locally in the tumor via internal (i. e. pH, redox potential, metabolite or enzyme concentration) or external (i. e. heat, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) stimuli. This review summarizes the recent progress in the transition towards stimuli responsive <b>nanomedicines</b> (i. e. liposomes, polymeric micelles, nanogels and mesoporous silica nanoparticles) and other therapy modalities that are currently developed in the fight against cancer like the application of ultrasound, tumor normalization and phototherapy.

2500|$|Future {{advances}} in <b>nanomedicine</b> could {{give rise to}} life extension through the repair of many processes thought {{to be responsible for}} aging. K. Eric Drexler, {{one of the founders of}} nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book The Singularity Is Near that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a medical use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) [...] "swallow the doctor". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2003 book Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age, {{environmental}} ethicist Bill McKibben argued {{at length}} against {{many of the}} technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists, including germinal choice technology, <b>nanomedicine</b> and life extension strategies. He claims {{that it would be}} morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging, maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to [...] "improve" [...] themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples Ming China, Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Doxil® on the market nearly 20 years ago, a number of <b>nanomedicines</b> {{have become part of}} treatment regimens in the clinic. With the exception of antibody–drug conjugates, these <b>nanomedicines</b> are all devoid of targeting ligands and rely solely on their physicochemical properties and the (patho) physiological processes in the body for their biodistribution and targeting capability. At the same time, many preclinical studies have reported on <b>nanomedicines</b> exposing targeting ligands, or ligand-targeted <b>nanomedicines,</b> yet none of these have been approved at this moment. In the present review, we provide a concise overview of 13 ligand-targeted particulate <b>nanomedicines</b> (ligand-targeted PNMs) that have progressed into clinical trials. The progress of each ligand-targeted PNM is discussed based on available (pre) clinical data. Main conclusions of these analyses are that (a) ligand-targeted PNMs have proven to be safe and efficacious in preclinical models; (b) the vast majority of ligand-targeted PNMs is generated for the treatment of cancer; (c) contribution of targeting ligands to the PNM efficacy is not unambiguously proven; and (d) targeting ligands do not cause localization of the PNM within the target tissue, but rather provide benefits in terms of target cell internalization and target tissue retention once the PNM has arrived at the target site. Increased understanding of the in vivo fate and interactions of the ligand-targeted PNMs with proteins and cells in the human body is mandatory to rationally advance the clinical translation of ligand-targeted PNMs. Future perspectives for ligand-targeted PNM approaches include the delivery of drugs that are unable or inefficient in passing cellular membranes, treatment of drug resistant tumors, targeting of the tumor blood supply, the generation of targeted vaccines and <b>nanomedicines</b> that are able to cross the blood–brain barrier...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{integrity}} of the cells/tissues in anterior and/or posterior segments of the eye {{plays a crucial role}} in biofunctions of the vision. To maintain ocular homeostasis, selective restrictiveness of the ophthalmic membranes and barriers control must act on shuttling of biomolecules. Thus, not all attempts to apply de novo nanotechnology approaches for ocular pharmacotherapy have met with the same successes as those cited here in this review, and sometimes these novel technologies tools provoke a great deal of challenges and hurdles mainly because of functional presence of these barriers.
