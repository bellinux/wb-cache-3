The {{results show that the}} grains in the weld <b>nugget</b> <b>zone</b> were small, uniform and equiaxed. The grains in thermo-mechanical affected zone were stretched and relatively small, but were not as small and uniform as those in the weld <b>nugget</b> <b>zone.</b> The grains in the heat-affected zone were relatively coarse. The fracture of the welded joint occurred mainly in the heat affected zone. The tensile strength of the welded joints was up to 257. 4 MPa and was 87. 9 % of the base material strength. The microhardness in the weld <b>nugget</b> <b>zone</b> was higher.

40|$|Three {{rotation}} {{rates were}} selected for friction stir welded (FSW) rolled AZ 31 plates, at a constant welding speed of 100 mm/minutes. As the rotation rate was increased from 800 and 2000 to 3500 rpm, the nugget shape varied from a basin- or ellipse-shaped homogeneous structure to a two-layer structure. The grain characteristic was similar in the <b>nugget</b> <b>zones</b> (NZs) at 800 and 2000 rpm, with the column-rotated basal plane. However, at 3500 rpm, the equiaxed fine grains and column-rotated basal plane {{were found in the}} lower zone of the two-layer structure, while elongated coarse grains and the basal plane with little inclination comparable to that in the parent material (PM) were detected in the upper zone. Tensile tests indicated that the fracture behaviors of the FSW AZ 31 joints at 800 and 2000 rpm were similar with the weak zones being located at the NZ middle and along the boundary between the NZ and the thermo-mechanically affected zone, while contrasting fracture features were found at 3500 rpm. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the joints increased as the rotation rate increased, with the highest UTS being about 95 pct of the PMat 3500 rpm. The variations in the strength and fracture behavior of the jointswith the rotation rate were accounted for by the variation in the texture.

In this study, two pure aluminum strips of 2 mm thick were friction stir welded together. For all welding pairs, three rotational speeds of 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm were used. The traverse speed, axial force and tool geometry were kept constant.

A single tool made of polycrystaline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) with a Tungsten-Rhenium binder was used to conduct a series of bead-on-plate FSW traverses, approximately 64 inches (1. 6 m) in total length, on 0. 25 inch (6. 4 mm) thick plates of a hardenable alloy steel. The first series of traverses involved various revolutions per minute (RPM) and inches per minute (IPM) combinations on a dry plate.

A welded joint was obtained by joining together two plate of aluminium-lithium alloy 2050 -T 3 and then has been submitted to an additional T 8 post-welding heat treat-ment. Actually a typical friction stir weld consists of the unaffected base material (BM), a heat affected zone (HAZ), a thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and a dynamically recrystallized <b>zone</b> (<b>nugget).</b> Some samples were removed from the BM and the nugget of the welded joint in or-der to study the corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behaviour of these two zones individually. Immersion tests with and without an external mechanical stress were performed in a 0. 7 M NaCl solution to study the corrosion behaviour of the two zones and the influence of the stress. For both kinds of experiments, the corrosion damage was determined by measuring the average depth and the maximal depth of the corrosion defects. The results showed that the two zones presented different corrosion morphologies. The BM exhibited susceptibility to intragranular corrosion while the nugget presented both intragranular and intergranular corrosion. The external mechanical stress did not modify the corrosion morphologies and the open circuit potential. Nevertheless, as they present different corrosion morphologies, the external mechanical stress did not have the same influence on the propagation of the corrosion damage. Indeed, the external mechanical stress did not promote the propagation of the corrosion in the BM whereas it does in the Nugget. Considering the whole welded joint, the corrosion morphologies of the BM and the nugget were the same than those observed for each zone considered individually. A previous work [1] has shown that galvanic coupling phenomena existed between the different parts of the welded joint and the BM acted as a sacrificial anode. As the external stress did not change the OCP of the different parts, no modification of the galvanic coupling phenomena was expected and the BM was found to be more damaged than the other zones. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is adopting {{the application of}} magnesium and magnesium alloys {{in order to produce}} light-weight auto-body structures. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the load bearing capability of these metals in spot welded applications, since spot welding is widely used to assemble the body components. Failure of spot welds {{is one of the major}} durability issues of auto-body structures in monotonic, cyclic and impact loading conditions. Spot weld performance is a special concern because of the operation of a localized stress field at the edge of each weld nugget. The load-bearing capability of a spot weld depends strongly on the toughness of the microstructure existing at the edge of the <b>nugget</b> including fusion <b>zone</b> and heat affected zone. Therefore, any microstructural feature which deteriorates the toughness properties is considered to be detrimental to the structural integrity of a spot weld. This study attempts to assess the effects of microstructure on failure characteristics and mechanical performance of magnesium spot-welded structures in monotonic loading. Microstructural evolution in resistance spot welding of AZ 31, AZ 61 and AZ 80 magnesium alloys has been studied. The results indicated formation of β-Mg 17 (Al,Zn) 12 divorced eutectic phase at the grain boundaries of both fusion zone and heat affected zone. As the Al content of the magnesium base alloy increased from 3 wt. % (AZ 31) to 6 wt. % (AZ 61) and 8 wt. % (AZ 80), the volume fraction of β phase increased both in heat affected zone and fusion zone. It was found that with increase in volume fraction of the β phase, tensile shear properties of spot welds were adversely affected. Microstructural examinations identified the β intermetallics as preferred sites for micro-crack initiation in monotonic loading of spot welds. It was found that as the Al content of base metal increased from 3 wt. % (AZ 31) to 6 wt. % (AZ 61) and 8 wt. % (AZ 80), the load-to-failure and elongation-to-failure of spot welds (with almost identical nugget diameter) decreased. At the same time, the failure mode changed from interfacial (in AZ 31) to nugget pull-out (in AZ 61 and AZ 80). Removal of the β phase particles via post-weld solutionizing treatment was found to increase the weld strength and ductility of high Al-bearing magnesium spot welds (i. e. AZ 61 and AZ 80). Failure mode also changed from nugget pull-out to through-thickness. With the absence of β intermetallics in the microstructure of post-weld heat treated welds, plasticity occurred near the edge of nuggets under load, which introduced resistance against crack initiation. The plastic zones could be identified by observation of heavily twinned microstructure near the crack region. Inspection of misorientation boundaries between the parent and twinned segments revealed the role of { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 }-{ 1 0 1 ̅ 2 } double twinning, which essentially involved rotation of 〈 1 2 ̅ 1 0 〉/ 37. 5 ° relative to parent, on formation of transgranular micro-cracks. This twinning mode intensified the shear stresses resolved onto the basal slip systems, leading to early shear localization and transgranular void/crack initiation. It was argued that the susceptibility of an individual grain to transgranular cracking depended strongly on its orientation relative to the stress condition. Those grains in which the stress field created a high shear stresses onto their { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } twinning systems were more susceptible to transgranular fracture. The primary { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } twinning mode was found to follow a Schmid-type behavior in most of the studied grains. For AZ 61 and AZ 80 magnesium sheets with sharp basal texture, the stress condition under loading at the coarse-grained microstructure of the heat affected zone resulted in high activity of { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } twinning. Therefore, the heat affected zones of these AZ alloys were susceptible to transgranular fracture. The heat affected zone in ZEK 100 sheet, demonstrated higher toughness. Due to its fine-grained microstructure along with more randomized texture, heat affected zone of ZEK 100 exhibited lower twinning activity. Therefore, in tensile shear loading of AZ 80 /ZEK 100 dissimilar spot weld (in post-weld heat treated condition), fracture occurred preferentially in the heat affected zone of AZ 80, while the heat affected zone of ZEK 100 demonstrated high resistance against fracture initiation. From the experimental-numerical work on fracture study in tensile shear loading of magnesium spot welds, it was concluded that the toughness of the material was associated with combined effect of stress condition and microstructure. This combined effect was further investigated by mechanical testing of magnesium sheet metals using double-edged notched tensile (DENT) specimens. In order to evaluate the effect of texture on the notch sensitivity, DENT specimens were made with notches whose tip was pointing to the sheet’s normal direction (for ND specimens) and transverse direction (for TD specimens). The mechanical test results for AZ alloys indicated that the strength and ductility of specimens with notches along the normal direction were lower compared to those with notches along the transverse direction. Schmid law numerical calculations were conducted based on the notch stress condition and crystallographic texture of the alloys to predict the activity of different deformation mechanisms (i. e basal slip, prismatic slip, { 1 0 1 ̅ 2 } twinning and { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } twinning) at the notch root. The difference in notch sensitivity in ND and TD specimens was associated with an activity competition between prismatic slip and { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } twinning. The numerical results predicted higher activity for { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } contraction twinning at the notch root of ND specimens than that in TD specimens. The easy activation of { 1 0 1 ̅ 1 } twins in ND specimens, led to transgranular shear localization and early fracture; however in case of TD specimens, prismatic slip was more active at the notch root which led to more homogeneous deformation and delay in shear localization. Owing to its more randomized texture, ZEK 100 alloy appeared to be less sensitive to the notch orientation...|$|R
