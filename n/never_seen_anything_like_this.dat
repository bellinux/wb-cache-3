2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Ten Year War, Michigan's {{regular season}} {{performance}} declined, but their post season performance improved. The 1979 season included a memorable game against Indiana that ended with a touchdown pass from John Wangler to Anthony Carter with six seconds left in the game. The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's emotional radio narration: [...] "Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. Carter has it. [...] Carter scores[...] [...] [...] I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in all my 40 years of covering Michigan football[...] [...] [...] I hope you can hear me – because I've never been so happy in all my cotton-picking 59 years!

Lots of things go wrong like venue changes, best men getting ill, Jade {{not being able to}} make it from New York, and all this kind of stuff." [...] Moloney believed that the explosion storyline would rival that of his wedding to Dee. Morey said that she was [...] "pretty upset" [...] when she learned that there would be an explosion on Sonya and Toadie's wedding day. She called the storyline sad, dramatic and big. She later told Vicki Power from the Daily Express, [...] "I've just watched these episodes and I have been bawling my eyes out. It's really heavy, heavy stuff. I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> on Neighbours." [...] As Toadie was worried that something bad would happen at the wedding, he is relieved when everything goes well and he and Sonya are married. However, at their reception, which is being held in a marquee in the grounds of Lassiter's Hotel, a gas canister explodes as Sonya throws her bouquet.|$|E
2500|$|In Michigan's eighth {{game against}} an unranked Indiana team, Wangler had his most replayed {{moment in a}} Michigan uniform. [...] Dickey started the game, and Wangler entered the game as a substitute. [...] The game was tied at 2121 in the fourth quarter. [...] There was no {{overtime}} in college football, and Michigan fans would have regarded a tie as {{the equivalent of a}} defeat. [...] With six seconds left on the clock, Michigan had the ball on the Indiana 45-yard line. [...] Wangler dropped back to pass from his own 45-yard line, and his pass hit Anthony Carter at the 23-yard line. [...] Carter ran into the end zone as time ran out to give the Wolverines a 2721 victory. [...] The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's colorful and emotional radio narration as the play unfolded.

Every few steps he would stop short, glance wildly out from the dizzy height, and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently {{as if he had been}} running a race; and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy. He was a handsome fellow, and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror, but it was pitiful to see him suffer so.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{describe}} {{my feelings}} on beholding thus, {{for the first}} time, the king of beasts in all the savage majesty of strength and freedom, coupled with the terrible death of a human being. My brain was in a whirl of excitement; I scarce knew what I was doing. But I {{had no time to}} think, for almost immediately after firing the shots at the lion, two elephants came crashing through the bushes. One was between ten and eleven feet high, the other could not have been less than twelve feet. I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in the menageries of England, and their appearance, as they burst thus suddenly on my vision, was something absolutely appalling.|$|E
60|$|As for Joe, he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> girl {{across the}} counter. While he was wiser in natural {{philosophy}} than she, {{and could have}} given immediately the reason for woman's existence on the earth, nevertheless woman had no part in his cosmos. His imagination was as untouched by woman as the girl's was by man. But his imagination was touched now, and the woman was Genevieve. He had never dreamed a girl could be so beautiful, {{and he could not}} keep his eyes from her face. Yet every time he looked at her, and her eyes met his, he felt painful embarrassment, and would have looked away had not her eyes dropped so quickly.|$|E

60|$|I {{stood like}} one bewitched. I drank it in, in a {{speechless}} rapture. The world {{was new to}} me, and I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> at home. But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which {{the moon and the}} sun and the twilight wrought upon the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this fashion: This sun means {{that we are going to}} have wind to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small thanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody's steamboat one of these nights, if it keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling 'boils' show a dissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in the slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the 'break' from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with a single living branch, is not going to last long, and then how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the effect}} was only momentary; a few steps further she found that she could walk with little {{difficulty}} between the ranks of stalks, which were regularly spaced, and the resemblance now changed {{to that of a}} long pillared conservatory of greenish glass, that touched all objects with its pervading hue. She also found that the close air above her head was continually freshened by the interchange of currents of lower temperature from below,--as if the whole vast field had a circulation of its own,--and that the adobe beneath her feet was gratefully cool to her tread. There was no dust, as he had said; what had at first half suffocated her seemed to be some stimulating aroma of creation that filled the narrow green aisles, and now imparted a strange vigor and excitement to her as she walked along. Meantime her guide was not conversationally idle. Now, no doubt, she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before? It was ordinary wheat, only it was grown on adobe soil--the richest in the valley. These stalks, she could see herself, were ten and twelve feet high. That was the trouble, they all ran too much to stalk, though the grain yield was [...] "suthen' pow'ful." [...] She could tell that to her friends, for he reckoned she was the only young lady that had ever walked under such a growth. Perhaps she was new to Californy? He thought so from the start. Well, this was Californy, and this was not the least of the ways it could [...] "lay over" [...] every other country on God's yearth. Many folks thought it was the gold and the climate, but she could see for herself what it could do with wheat. He wondered if her brother had ever told, her of it? No, the stranger wasn't her brother. Nor cousin, nor company? No; only the hired driver from a San Jose hotel, who was takin' her over to Major Randolph's. Yes, he knew the old major; the ranch was a pretty place, nigh unto three miles further on. Now that he knew the driver was no relation of hers he didn't mind telling her that the buggy was a [...] "rather old consarn," [...] and the driver didn't know his business. Yes, it might be fixed up so as to take her over to the major's; there was one of their own men--a young fellow--who could do anything that COULD be done with wood and iron,--a reg'lar genius!--and HE'D tackle it. It might take an hour, but she'd find it quite cool waiting in the shanty. It was a rough place, for they only camped out there during the season to look after the crop, and lived at their own homes the rest of the time. Was she going to stay long at the major's? He noticed she had not brought her trunk with her. Had she known the major's wife long? Perhaps she thought of settling in the neighborhood? ...|$|E
