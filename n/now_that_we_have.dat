500|$|Some {{scholars}} and critics challenge {{the validity of}} Pinter's critiques of what he terms [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power" [...] or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being [...] "terribly disturbed {{as a young man}} by the Cold War. And McCarthyism... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then and feel as strongly <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an obligation to subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny." [...] Scholars agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|The RomanPersian Wars {{have been}} {{characterized}} as [...] "futile" [...] and too [...] "depressing and tedious to contemplate". Prophetically, Cassius Dio [...] noted their [...] "never-ending cycle of armed confrontations" [...] and observed that [...] "it {{is shown by}} the facts themselves that [...] conquest {{has been a source}} of constant wars and great expense to us. For it yields very little and uses up vast sums; and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> reached out to peoples who are neighbor of the Medes and the Parthians rather than of ourselves, we are always, one might say, fighting the battles of those peoples."* GarnseySaller (1987), 8 In the long series of wars between the two powers, the frontier in upper Mesopotamia remained more or less constant. Historians point out that the stability of the frontier over the centuries is remarkable, although Nisibis, Singara, Dara and other cities of upper Mesopotamia changed hands from time to time, and the possession of these frontier cities gave one empire a trade advantage over the other.

500|$|Hearing {{reports of}} the heavy {{fighting}} taking place between the junction and the Chinese Farm, Dayan suggested withdrawing Matt's brigade and canceling the operation. He voiced concerns that the paratroopers were threatened with annihilation and noted that all attempts to open a corridor for the bridges had failed. Gonen rejected the suggestion, stating that, [...] "If we knew in advance {{this was going to}} happen we would not have started the crossing operation, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> crossed then let us follow through to the bitter end." [...] Bar-Lev concurred with Gonen, and Dayan decided not to press his suggestion. At around 6:00 AM, Golda Meir telephoned Dayan to inquire about the situation. Dayan informed her that the bridges had not yet been laid and that the Egyptians had closed the routes leading to Deveroir. He also stated there were high hopes that Egyptian resistance would be overcome and that the bridges would be laid during the morning. Dayan also told her that Matt's paratrooper brigade had crossed to the west bank without encountering resistance and that Southern Command, as yet, had no intentions of withdrawing the brigade, even if the bridge-laying was delayed.|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [...] The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [...] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [...] most happy circumstance {{of my life to}} be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.|$|E

2500|$|On February 7, 1996, the Mighty Ducks made a {{blockbuster}} {{deal with the}} Winnipeg Jets, sending Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third-round draft pick to the Jets in exchange for Marc Chouinard, a fourth-round draft pick and, most notably, star right winger Teemu Selanne. [...] Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul [...] {{had a lot of}} pressure on him...

2500|$|Finally, the {{nomination}} was decided by delegates under the Democratic Party's rules, so the candidates campaigned {{to maximize their}} delegate advantage. If {{the nomination}} were decided by popular vote, they likely would have campaigned differently, in order to run up the vote in populous states like New York and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{has said that the}} popular vote should have no effect under the current rules: [...] "It‚Äôs a delegate race. The way the system works is that the delegates choose the nominee." [...] Obama's chief strategist suggested that the Clinton campaign's focus on the popular vote was a distraction tactic: [...] "When they started off, it was all about delegates.... <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> more delegates, it‚Äôs all about the popular vote. And if that does not work out, they will probably challenge us to a game of cribbage to choose the nominee." [...] Nevertheless, polls have shown that a plurality of Democrats think superdelegates should consider the popular vote when deciding which candidate to support.|$|E
2500|$|... 1995‚Äì96 {{would mark}} {{a big change}} for the team, {{especially}} for second-year superstar Paul Kariya. During the season, he was chosen {{to play for the}} Western Conference in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, (January 1996), Kariya was ranked 14th in league scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games, although the Ducks were overall a low-scoring team. Then a midseason blockbuster deal with the Winnipeg Jets improved the franchise. The Ducks sent Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third round pick to the Jets in return for Marc Chouinard, a fourth round draft pick and right winger Teemu Selanne. Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul [...] had {{a lot of pressure on}} him...
