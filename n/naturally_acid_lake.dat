40|$|Can, {{a county}} in the {{province}} of Canakkale, {{is one of the most}} prominent coal mining districts in Turkey. Many mining companies have been operating coal deposits for power generation and district heating in this region since 1980. Generally, small and medium-scale mining companies operate for short periods and abandon the operational land without providing any rehabilitation. Human intervention in the natural structure and topography of the earth surface causes large holes and deterioration in these areas. Artificial lakes occur because of surface discharge and underground leakage into abandoned open pit mines with high lignite sulfur content (0. 21 – 14. 36 wt %). Furthermore, these lakes gain acidic character due to acid generation from pyrite oxidation. <b>Acid</b> mine <b>lakes</b> are highly acidic (pH < 3. 05) and have elevated concentrations of (Formula presented.), Fe and some metals. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental conditions and demonstrate the development of a monitoring system for their possible changes in the <b>acid</b> mine <b>lakes</b> of the open cast lignite mining area on a regional scale. For this purpose, the data received from remote sensing satellites were used. Areal change detection and perimeter changes of nine <b>acid</b> mine <b>lakes</b> caused by coal mining companies in Can from 1977 to 2011, were determined using Landsat, Quickbird and Worldview satellite images. As a case study, an area of 9 km 2 was chosen for the variety of <b>acid</b> mine <b>lakes.</b> Using GIS software, satellite images were analyzed in time series, borders of <b>acid</b> mine <b>lakes</b> were digitized and converted into vector data format.

The areal and perimeter changes were computed and presented via tables and graphics. In addition, thematic maps of the <b>acid</b> mine <b>lakes</b> were created and visualized.

40|$|AbstractAcid mine {{drainage}} is {{a widespread}} environmental problem in Lusatia {{in the eastern part}} of Germany, where extensive brown coal and lignite mining was carried out during the last century. As a result of oxidation of pyrite in strip mine dumps of this region, numerous mine drainage lakes have pH values < 3 and are characterized by high concentrations of dissolved sulphate and ferrous iron. Using chemical and isotopic techniques, we tested in laboratory bottle experiments the extent to which the addition of degradable organic carbon to <b>acid</b> <b>lake</b> water and sediments could stimulate bacterial (dissimilatory) sulphate reduction. The overall goal was to evaluate whether bacterial sulphate reduction, and subsequent formation of sedimentary sulphide minerals, could generate enough alkalinity to potentially neutralize the <b>acid</b> <b>lakes</b> in Lusatia. Pyruvate, glucose, succinic acid, lactate, ethanol, acetate, and various industrial by-products were added in various concentrations to original lake water and sediments in glass bottles and incubated between 4 and 12 weeks in darkness. The extent of bacterial sulphate reduction was determined by analyzing the concentrations and the isotopic compositions of sulphate in the water column, and the contents and δ 34 S values of various sedimentary sulphur compounds at the beginning and the end of the experiments. Bacterial sulphate reduction was significantly enhanced after addition of pure substances (lactate, pyruvate, acetate, and ethanol) resulting in elevated pH values (4. 5 to 6. 0) in the bottle water at the end of the experiments. Cheap industrial by-products (whey, molasses, Pfezi-granules, and Carbokalk) as organic carbon source were also shown to be effective in enhancing bacterial sulphate reduction, thereby increasing the pH value of the bottle water. In general, the addition of selected organic carbon compounds enhanced sufficiently bacterial sulphate reduction and the formation of sedimentary sulphur minerals, generating enough alkalinity for raising the pH of the bottle water to near-neutral values. Further research in enclosures and under field conditions is needed to determine whether this technique constitutes a feasible remediation strategy for the <b>acid</b> <b>lakes</b> in Lusatia...|$|R
