25|$|The {{motives of}} the murder were not made clear during the trial. Was it a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members had talked about? Or was it rather a hate crime, {{motivated}} by the anger Nödtveidt and Vlad had felt when confronted with Meddour's personality? According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, there is <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that Nödtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a hate crime by the Swedish police.|$|E
25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E

500|$|The scenes showing Madonna walking {{alone on}} the beach was an homage to actress Joan Crawford in the 1946 film, Humoresque.

Rosa also noted that the ending showing Madonna walking towards the sea was purposefully ambiguous. [...] "Does Madonna drown herself in the ocean? Does she move on from her lover?

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 278 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10.

And she works that role with flawless professionalism, punctuating her choreographed moves with an amiable accessibility that drew fans into her airtight world even as it kept them at a safe distance.

[...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that he looks dapper and has an attractive baritone (a gift of his gene pool). But that does not translate into good performance or acting."

You may find his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter".

[...] Roger Ebert, in a mixed review, wrote [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard.

[...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine was disappointed, finding the father-son reconciliation storyline to be over-dramatically cliché. [...] "You recall The Boy Who Cried Wolf?

Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap."
