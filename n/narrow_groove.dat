500|$|Thomas disliked being {{regarded}} as a provincial poet, and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him {{for a review of}} his Collected Poems, he added [...] "Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh." [...] Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that [...] "His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked [...] "in a fanatically <b>narrow</b> <b>groove,</b> although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings.

2500|$|Instead of horns, their skulls bore massive, {{flattened}} bosses; a large boss {{over the}} nose and a smaller one over the eyes. A prominent pair of horns grew from the frill and extended upwards. The skull also bore several smaller horns or ornaments that varied between individuals and between species. In P. canadensis and P. perotorum, the bosses over {{the nose and}} eyes nearly grew together, and were separated only by a <b>narrow</b> <b>groove.</b> In P. lakustai, the two bosses were separated by a wide gap. In P. canadensis and P. lakustai, the frill bore two [...] additional small, curved, backward-pointed horns. These were not present in P. perotorum, and in fact some specimens of P. lakustai also lack them, which may indicate {{that the presence of}} these horns varied by age or sex.|$|E

60|$|Kenwardine {{had then}} {{suggested}} that she make a long visit to her aunts, in the cathedral town. They had received her gladly but she soon found her stay there irksome. The aunts were austere, religious women, who moved in a <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> and ordered all their doings by a worn-out social code. Still, they were kind and gave Clare to understand that she was to stay with them always and have no {{more to do with}} Kenwardine than duty demanded. The girl rebelled. She shrank with innate dislike from license and dissipation, but the life her aunts led was dreary, and she could not give up her father. Though inexperienced, she was intelligent and she saw that her path would not be altogether smooth now that she was going home for good. While she thought about it, the trap arrived and the shabby groom drove her up the hill with confused apologies.|$|E

5000|$|Partly as {{an attempt}} to compete with the LP {{introduced}} in 1948 by rival Columbia, RCA Victor introduced [...] "Extended Play" [...] 45s during 1952.

These were usually 10-inch LPs (released until the mid-1950s) split onto two seven-inch EPs or 12-inch LPs split onto three seven-inch EPs, either sold separately or together in gatefold covers. This practice became much less common with the advent of triple-speed-available phonographs.|$|R
50|$|Cast bullets {{require a}} longer bearing surface than {{jacketed}} bullets {{to maintain an}} equivalent alignment with the bore of the firearm; because the softer cast bullet can be more readily deformed. The most successful cast bullet designs have a round or flatened nose rather than a long, unsupported ogive. Bullet designs with a forward diameter designed to be supported on the rifling lands work best in barrels rifled with wide lands and <b>narrow</b> <b>grooves</b> like the 2-groove M1903-A3 rifles. Forward bearing surfaces of full groove diameter provide more effective alignment in barrels with wide <b>grooves</b> and <b>narrow</b> lands, provided the chamber throat is long enough to accept such bullets.|$|R

50|$|A dial test {{indicator}}, {{also known}} as a lever arm test indicator or finger indicator, has a smaller measuring range than a standard dial indicator. A test indicator measures the deflection of the arm, the probe does not retract but swings in an arc around its hinge point. The lever may be interchanged for length or ball diameter, and permits measurements to be taken in <b>narrow</b> <b>grooves</b> and small bores where the body of a probe type may not reach. The model shown is bidirectional, some types may have to be switched via a side lever to be able to measure in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|The pinning {{characteristics}} of a 180 degrees domain wall with grooves are investigated using the micromagnetic simulation.

The depinning field difference between the wall movement directions was improved by the increase of the lower depinning field compared to that with the steplike thickness change. It was {{also found that the}} depinning fields for various groove widths were almost constant and the wall displacement was further suppressed by the <b>narrower</b> <b>groove</b> having the vertical edge.
