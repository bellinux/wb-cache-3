5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

It was how, {{especially}} in the outer movements, he allowed the unique characteristics of Russian folk song to dictate symphonic form. This was a goal toward which the kuchka strived, both collectively and individually. Tchaikovsky, with his Conservatory grounding, could sustain such development longer and more cohesively than {{his colleagues in the}} kuchka. (Though the comparison may seem unfair, Tchaikovsky authority David Brown has pointed out that, because of their similar time-frames, the finale of the Little Russian shows what Mussorgsky could have done with [...] "The Great Gate of Kiev" [...] from Pictures at an Exhibition had he possessed academic training comparable to that of Tchaikovsky.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Like Under a Killing Moon and The Pandora Directive, a Tesla Effect {{novel was}} {{published}} {{shortly after the}} release of the game. Unlike previous titles, the game's script was adapted from the novel, written by longtime series scribe Aaron Conners. Although it follows the same basic story, there are many changes, and a different ending. Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer praised the novel in comparison to the game's story, stating [...] " [...] It’s <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> the novel is better, it’s night and day." [...] Aaron Conners has since announced two concluding books in the Tex-saga.|$|E
2500|$|Marlovians also {{claim that}} their {{interpretation}} allows more of Shakespeare's actual words {{to be interpreted}} as meaning literally what they say than is otherwise possible. For example, they can take [...] "a wretch's knife" [...] (74) to mean a wretch's knife, rather than assume {{that he must have}} really meant Old Father Time's scythe, take an [...] "outcast state"(29) to mean an outcast state, not just a feeling that nobody likes him, and accept that when he says his [...] "name receives a brand" [...] (111) it means that his reputation has been permanently damaged, and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> acting is considered a somewhat disreputable profession.

[...] Pulitzer Prize winning author David Potter wrote, [...] "The problem for Americans who, in the age of Lincoln, wanted slaves to be free was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> southerners wanted the opposite, but that they themselves cherished a conflicting value: they wanted the Constitution, which protected slavery, to be honored, and the Union, which had fellowship with slaveholders, to be preserved. [...] Thus they were committed to values that could not logically be reconciled." [...] Other important factors were partisan politics, abolitionism, nullification vs secession, Southern nationalism, Northern nationalism, expansionism, economics and modernization in the Antebellum period.|$|E

2500|$|She {{noted that}} Ewing's crime was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> of {{stealing}} three golf clubsit was stealing three golf clubs after being convicted of two violent or serious felonies. [...] "In weighing {{the gravity of}} Ewing's offense, we must place on the scales not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony recidivism. [...] Any other approach would fail to accord proper deference to the policy judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of sanctions." [...] Ewing's sentence might be long, but it [...] "reflects a rational judgment, entitled to deference, that offenders who have committed serious or violent felonies and who continue to commit felonies must be incapacitated." [...] For this reason, O'Connor reasoned that Ewing's 25-years-to-life sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1970s, the {{economic}} {{prosperity of the}} previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation and crime rates had soared. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from these negative economic issues. As well, in the 1970s, the key counterculture of the 1960s, the hippie movement, was fading away. The disco movement was far more than just music. It was also a subculture based around nightclubs, dance clubs, and DJs. In Beautiful Things in Popular Culture, Simon Frith highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960's counterculture. [...] "The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity {{that can only be}} described as hippie," [...] he says. [...] "The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

2500|$|Robert's {{role was}} <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> of a {{promoter}} of the Augustinian Order. His post {{was that of}} Summi (Archi)Episcopi Scotorum, called in the contemporary Scottish vernacular [...] "Ardepscop Alban", that is, [...] "High Bishop of Scotland". He was hence the structural leader of the Scottish church. Along with Bishop John of Glasgow, Robert became the chief reforming cleric in the reforming reign of King David I of Scotland. He {{is one of the}} most frequent witnesses to the charters of King David. Unlike most other incumbents Scottish bishoprics, most of them very new, Robert was a foreigner drawn from the non-Gaelic world, in the words of Oram, [...] "part of 'colonial' establishment which was emerging in the early twelfth century". In this context, the difference between [...] "reform" [...] and religious and cultural [...] "colonialism" [...] is merely one of perspective. However, Robert's episcopate in no way led to the destruction of the native clerical order at Cell Rígmonaid. In fact, many of the native Gaelic clergy were absorbed into the incoming orders, and those who were not, continued to receive the patronage of the bishop. In one case, the clergy of the Céli Dé abbey of St. Serfs at Loch Leven were given a large collection of books by the bishop.|$|E

6000|$|From {{our present}} point of view, then, it becomes {{obvious that the}} {{conception}} of a serial arrangement of the sciences is a vicious one. It is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that</b> the schemes we have examined are untenable; but {{it is that the}} sciences cannot be rightly placed in any linear order whatever. It is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>that,</b> as M. Comte admits, a classification [...] "will always involve something, if not arbitrary, at least artificial;" [...] it is not, as he would have us believe, that, neglecting minor imperfections a classification may be substantially true; but it is that any grouping of the sciences in a succession gives a radically erroneous idea of their genesis and their dependencies. There is no [...] "one rational order among a host of possible systems." [...] There is no [...] "true filiation of the sciences." [...] The whole hypothesis is fundamentally false. Indeed, it needs but a glance at its origin to see at once how baseless it is. Why a series? What reason have we to suppose that the sciences admit of a linear arrangement? Where is our warrant for assuming that there is some succession in which they can be placed? There is no reason; no warrant. Whence then has arisen the supposition? To use M. Comte's own phraseology, we should say, it is a metaphysical conception. It adds another to the cases constantly occurring, of the human mind being made the measure of Nature. We are obliged to think in sequence; it is the law of our minds that we must consider subjects separately, one after another: therefore Nature must be serial--therefore the sciences must be classifiable in a succession. See here the birth of the notion, and the sole evidence of its truth. Men have been obliged when arranging in books their schemes of education and systems of knowledge, to choose some order or other. And from inquiring what is the best order, have naturally fallen into the belief that there is an order which truly represents the facts--have persevered in seeking such an order; quite overlooking the previous question whether it is likely that Nature has consulted the convenience of book-making.|$|E

Naturally her grievances did not seem to her smaller than some of her male contemporaries held theirs to be when they felt a profession too narrow for their powers, and had an à priori conviction that it was not worth while to put forth their latent abilities. Because her education had been less expensive than theirs, it did not follow that she should have wider emotions or a keener intellectual vision.
