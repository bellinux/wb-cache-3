5|$|IFK Göteborg {{have used}} three other stadia as {{official}} home grounds. The first ground was Idrottsplatsen, in use from 1905 to 1915. It {{was built in}} 1896 for the cycling club Göteborgs Velocipedklubb, and was originally used for track cycling. During the 1909 season IFK Göteborg also used Örgryte IS' home ground of the time, Balders Hage, due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen. The third official stadium was Walhalla Idrottsplats, used {{for a number of}} home matches {{at the same time as}} Idrottsplatsen. A fourth ground, Slottsskogsvallen, has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> official home ground, but has nonetheless been used a number of times for IFK Göteborg home matches.|$|E

25|$|Teti's {{position}} in Coptos {{has been identified}} variously as a haty-a or as merely a temple official. James H. Breasted argued that the Coptos Decree must be read as ordering the demotion of a count and installing his replacement. Alternatively, Katja Goebs argues that Teti probably had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> haty-a, since the titles the Coptos Decree stripped him of were purely temple offices.|$|E

25|$|Asaba (an Anioma city) {{has been}} the capital of Delta State since the {{creation}} of the state in August 1991, by the then Military president, Gen Ibrahim B. Babangida (Retd). This development continues to generate criticism from the people of the Delta south notably Professor Itsay Sagay, an Itsekiri, Dr. Temi Akporhonor and Professor Obaro Ikime backed by Urhobo Historical Society. In an article in The Guardian, August 15, 2002 Professor Itsay Sagay openly campaigned for the relocation of the state capital from the Anioma city of Asaba to the town of Warri in Delta south. This was preceded by the reaction of Dr Cyril Uchenna Gwam published in the defunct Post Express Newspaper of June 1999 and several internet forums in reaction to the publication of Obaro Ikime in which he argued amongst others that centrality factor had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> major criteria for the location of State or Federal capitals. This was also followed by another article be Clem Okonji published in The Guardian, July 8, 2002 in which he maintained that Asaba had come to stay as the capital of Delta State. He further stressed that the peoples constituting the state are all located within the Delta region. Reactions in favour of the stay of Asaba as the capital of the state has since been supported by Henry Ogochukwu, Michael Ozah, Emeka Esogbue, Tony Odiadi, Emma Okocha and others alike. Dr. Temi Akporhonor would call for a political arrangement whereby governorship power would remain with what he termed 'The real Deltan' because according to him the capital of the state is located in the Igbo speaking town of Anioma. (Whither Delta state?, The Guardian, May 23, 2002) The strong resistance of this call has ensured that Asaba remains the state capital. Though all would unilaterally admit that a separate creation of another state from the present Delta State to constitute Anioma with the capital at Asaba, and Delta with state capital at Warri is necessary.|$|E
