To develop NRD for the characterization of rock- and particle like heterogeneous samples a JAEA/JRC collaboration has been established. As part of this collaboration a NRD demonstration workshop was organized at the time-of-flight facility GELINA of the JRC-IRMM in Geel (B). The potential of NRD was demonstrated by measurements on a complex mixture of different elements. It was demonstrated that the elemental composition of an unknown sample predicted by NRTA deviated on average by less than 2 % from the declared value.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the amount of nuclear materials in melted fuel resulting from a nuclear accident such as the one occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants has not yet been established. The problem is complex due to the expected presence of 10 B and other strong neutron absorbing impurities. For this reason, <b>neutron</b> <b>resonance</b> densitometry, combining <b>neutron</b> <b>resonance</b> transmission analysis and neutron capture analysis, is proposed and a feasibility study has been defined. In this contribution a method to account for the presence of 10 B is presented and investigated. The study includes GEANT 4 simulations to study the performance of a new well type gamma-ray detector based on LaBr 3 scintillators. In the design of the detector the main emphasis was on the capability to separate the full energy peak corresponding to the 478 -keV gamma ray resulting from the 10 B(n,αγ) reaction from the contribution of the 662 -keV gamma ray due to the decay of 137 Cs. In addition, experiments have been carried out at the time-of-flight facility GELINA of the EC-JRC-IRMM to test the capabilities of a LaBr 3 detector for NRCA applications, in particular to determine impurities present in the melted fuel. A <b>neutron</b> <b>resonance</b> capture gamma-ray experiment with a natSe sample was performed using a LaBr 3 scintillator in parallel with a Ge-detector.

Earlier analysis of data on reduced neutron widths, Γ 0 n, showed that the distributions of Γ 0 n for 192, 194 Pt deviate significantly from the Porter-Thomas distribution (PTD) predicted by random matrix theory. In this contribution we report on preliminary results of the analysis of distribution of total radiation widths, Γγ, in 192, 194, 195, 196 Pt+n reactions. Comparison of experimental data with predictions made within the nuclear statistical model indicates that standard models of Photon Strength Functions (PSFs) and Nuclear Level Density predict Γγ distributions which are too narrow. We found that satisfactory agreement between experimental and simulated distributions can be obtained only by a strong suppression of the PSFs at low γ-ray energies and/or by violation of the usual assumption that primary transitions from <b>neutron</b> <b>resonances</b> follow the PTD.
