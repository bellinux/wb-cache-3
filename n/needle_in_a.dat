500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E

2500|$|The MythBusters {{typically}} test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, {{the steps}} {{were described as}} [...] "replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results" [...] by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, {{to determine whether the}} alleged result occurs; if that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result. Occasionally the team (usually Savage and Hyneman) will hold a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results. This is most common with myths involving building an object that can accomplish a goal (for example, rapidly cooling a beer, or finding a <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> haystack).|$|E

In the western portion of their range, the ability of researchers to find right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands is greatly hindered by the difficulty and expense of getting access to these areas which are in Russian territorial waters and EEZ, and by the fog that makes visibility minimal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Bevel-tip {{flexible}} needles {{have greater}} mobility than straight rigid needles, {{and can be}} used to reach targets behind sensitive or impenetrable areas. Accurately planning and executing the optimal motions for such needles is difficult, however, and requires to solve inverse kinematics for a nonholonomic system. This paper presents an approach to 3 D motion planning for bevel-tip <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environment with spherical obstacles. The approach uses discretization of the control space instead of the configuration space (as done in earlier work), such that the trajectory of the needle can be expressed analytically, without the need for approximate numerical simulation. This results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fast optimization routine that finds the optimal path <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3 D environment with obstacles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few seconds on a standard PC. We introduce two different discretization strategies that lead to differently structured paths, and show that both produce valid trajectories from start to goal. To our best knowledge, the presented method is the first to address motion planning for bevel-tip <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3 D environment with obstacles. I...|$|R

40|$|Jacksonville, FL: We {{read the}} article by Dakka et al. 1 {{analyzing}} incidence of PLPH with cutting needles with interest. Our current research offers substantial evidence supporting their conclusions regarding the advantages of noncutting, atraumatic <b>needles.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> ongoing longitudinal biomarker study, we collected CSF by standard lumbar puncture in 20 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We used only Quincke (cutting) needles initially but we transitioned to Whitacre 2 (noncutting) <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to minimize risk of PLPH. Fifteen of 20 patients had at least 1 of 3 lumbar punctures using a Quincke or Whitacre needle, allowing di-rect comparison of PLPH rate with cutting vs non-cutting <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> the same subjects. PLPH rate was 30 % with Quincke needles and 9 % with Whi-tacre needles for patients undergoing lumbar puncture. Hence, the rate of occurrence of PLPH with a noncutting needle was one-third the fre-quency of PLPH with a cutting needle. Mean du-ration of PLPH was 5 days for cutting needles vs 1. 67 days for noncutting needles. Our results empirically support the conclusion of Dakka et al. that routine use of noncutting lumbar puncture needles could potentially result in fewer procedure-related adverse events and concomitant reduction in procedure-related costs...|$|R

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} the effects of three foliar potassium concentrations (high, intermediate and low) on the morphol-ogy, ultrastructure and polyamine concentrations of current-year and 1 - and 2 -year-old needles of 30 -year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees. Foliar K concentration had only a slight effect on needle morphology. The sclerenchyma cell walls were thinner, the xylem area was larger, and the resin ducts were smaller <b>in</b> <b>needles</b> with <b>a</b> low K concentration than <b>in</b> <b>needles</b> with <b>a</b> high or intermediate K concentration. In addition, the bundle sheath cells were collapsed <b>in</b> <b>needles</b> having <b>a</b> low K concentration. The secondary growth of phloem tissue and the mesophyll area were greater <b>in</b> <b>needles</b> with <b>a</b> high or intermediate K concentration than <b>in</b> <b>needles</b> with <b>a</b> low K concentration, possibly indicating greater production of photoassimilates in these trees. At the ultrastructural level, mesophyll cells with enlarged central vacuoles and small vacu-oles containing electron-dense material were common <b>in</b> need-les having <b>a</b> low K concentration. Enlargement of the central vacuole coincided with <b>an</b> exponential increase <b>in</b> putrescine concentration <b>in</b> <b>needles</b> with <b>a</b> low K concentration, suggest-ing that the central vacuole may function as a storage site for putrescine...|$|R
