5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E

Ezra is appalled at this proof of sin, and prays to God: [...] "O God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can stand in your presence." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Or him; {{and it is}} in {{that feeling}} that I find my chief satisfaction,--that he should have had the sense to have liked such a one as you better than others. Now I have said it. As <b>not</b> being <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> I did at first object to his choice. As being what you are yourself, I am {{altogether}} reconciled to it. Do not keep him long waiting." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "This {{does not}} reduce history to {{something}} arbitrary or capricious. It remains genuine knowledge. How can this be, if my thoughts about Julius Caesar differ from Mommsen's? Must <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> be wrong? No, because the object differs. My historical [...] is {{about my own}} past, not about Mommsen's past. Mommsen and I share in a great many things, and in many respects we share in a common past; but {{in so far as}} we are different people and representatives of different cultures and different generations we have different pasts. ... ur views of Julius Caesar must differ, slightly perhaps, but perceptibly. This difference is not arbitrary, for I can see—or {{ought to be able to}} see—that in his place, apart (once more) from all questions of error, I should have come to his conclusions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we all are," [...] the Bishop {{declared}} warmly. [...] "We are all pacifists in {{the sense}} that we are lovers of peace. There is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who does not deplore the horrors of to-day. There is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who is not passionately seeking for the master mind which can lead us out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Herrick, don't say that," [...] {{said the}} captain gently; [...] "when {{you know he}} don't make no {{difference}} between us. But, O! why <b>not</b> be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> why <b>not</b> come to Jesus right away, and let's meet in yon beautiful land? That's just the one thing wanted; just say, 'Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief!' and He'll fold you in His arms. You see, I know! I been a sinner myself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have not}} pretended to {{misunderstand}} you. I {{think that you}} have spoken wisely. Your stepdaughter must solve for herself the great riddle. It is <b>not</b> for any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to handicap her in her choice while she is yet a child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen you to me, Captain Amyas Leigh," [...] says Simon Evans, {{resting on}} his oar; [...] "and hang me for mutiny, if you will, when we're aboard, if we ever get there. Isn't it enough to bring us out to death (as you knew yourself, sir, for you're prudent enough) to please that poor young gentleman's fancy about a wench; but you must call coward an honest man that have saved your life this night, and <b>not</b> a <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> but has his wound to show?" ...|$|R
60|$|Strange to say, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{had been}} wounded, while many {{a better man}} close beside us had met his death.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Is of no consequence,' {{observed}} Keferinis, 'for {{she was a}} slave, and <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{and therefore}} may with singular exactitude be described as nothing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] said Ebbo, {{with perfect}} seriousness, [...] "I do <b>not</b> believe that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can {{live or die}} without the other. But, hark! there's an outcry at the castle! They have found out that they are locked in! Ha! ho! hilloa, Hatto, how like you playing prisoner?" ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the series}} {{was placed in the}} 1971 top 20 of most-viewed shows in Britain, Lew Grade wanted it to do well in the {{profitable}} American TV market. It followed his earlier series such as Man in a Suitcase, The Champions, and The Baron. But The Persuaders made little impact in America, airing on ABC on Saturday nights opposite Mission: Impossible. Its poor ratings stood out particularly because Mission: Impossible was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.'s</b> top 30 <b>of</b> programmes in 1971. ABC pulled the series before all 24 episodes were aired.|$|R

By that time it will be quite dark, and we will {{have a look at the}} place he has gone into; and if we can't learn anything, we must watch it by turns till midnight. We will arrange, at the inn, to hire a horse. One will be enough. He only caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>us</b> at that inn, and {{certainly}} would <b>not</b> recognize <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> if he saw him alone. The other can walk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Och, the thundering villains!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "the heathen thieves! And {{to think}} that <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was there {{to give them a}} bating." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{most of them}} hadn't been half dead with {{seasickness}} and fright, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{would have}} come out of that 'tween-deck alive," [...] said Jukes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Mac," [...] said I, [...] "give us a song. You know I'm wildly fond of music; and, most unfortunately, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> three {{can sing}} a note." ...|$|E
60|$|Until this announcement, I do <b>not</b> {{believe that}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> all {{had taken the}} time to look about him, so earnest and rapid had been our march. Now, however, each man threw aside his pack, laid down his rifle, and, thus disencumbered, we turned to gaze on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{surprisingly}} beautiful scenes eye of mine had ever beheld.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. Route 93 was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} <b>U.S.</b> highways {{proposed in the}} 1925 Bureau of Public Roads plan. [...] However, the revised numbering plan approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, established US 93 from the Canada-US border near Eureka, Montana south through Montana and Idaho to a southern terminus at Wells, Nevada.|$|R
5000|$|The lifeworld (German: Lebenswelt) is the [...] "world" [...] each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> lives in. <b>One</b> {{could call}} it the [...] "background" [...] or [...] "horizon" [...] of all experience, {{and it is that}} on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. The lifeworld is both {{personal}} and intersubjective (it is then called a [...] "homeworld"), and, as such, it does <b>not</b> enclose each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in a solus ipse.|$|R
60|$|AMERICAN. Now that 'pears to me kind o' blasphemy. I {{believe in}} heroism. I opine there's <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> settin' around here that's not a hero--give him the occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who can {{cling to}} this wreck {{half an hour}} longer," [...] a man cried, piteously. [...] "Already five have been washed away and drowned." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{uttered a}} sound till the mate, after imbibing--by means of suction {{out of a}} saucer--his second cup of tea, exclaimed: [...] "Where the devil is the man gone to?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the radical}} change in our diet was not good for us. We got few {{vegetables}} and fruits, and became fish-eaters. There were mussels and abalones and clams and rock-oysters, and great ocean-crabs that were thrown upon the beaches in stormy weather. Also, we found several kinds of seaweed that were good to eat. But the change in diet caused us stomach troubles, and none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> ever waxed fat. We were all lean and dyspeptic-looking. It was in getting the big abalones that Lop-Ear was lost. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> them closed upon his fingers at low-tide, and then the flood-tide came in and drowned him. We found his body the next day, {{and it was a}} lesson to <b>us.</b> <b>Not</b> another <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was ever caught in the closing shell of an abalone.|$|R
5000|$|On February 19, 2013, he and {{his family}} were {{detained}} at Los Angeles International Airport, when customs officials refused to believe his reason for entry. Although this was an unpleasant experience, this is a daily occurrence for Palestinians, every single day, throughout the West Bank. There are more than 500 Israeli checkpoints, roadblocks, and other barriers to movement across our land, and <b>not</b> a single <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has been spared the experience that my family and I experienced yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; and I don't want to--at least, I think I don't. Death grows friendlier {{as we grow}} older. <b>Not</b> that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{really wants}} to die though, Marshall. Tennyson spoke truth when he said that. There's old Mrs. Wallace up at the Glen. She's had heaps of trouble all her life, poor soul, and she's lost almost {{everyone}} she cared about. She's always saying that she'll be glad when her time comes, and she doesn't want to sojourn any longer in this vale of tears. But when she takes a sick spell there's a fuss! Doctors from town, and a trained nurse, and enough medicine to kill a dog. Life may be a vale of tears, all right, {{but there are some}} folks who enjoy weeping, I reckon." ...|$|R
60|$|Beat after beat falls sombre and dull. The wind is unchanging, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knows What {{will be in}} {{the final}} lull When we find the place where this dead road goes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Brown, don't now! She's <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> There's no saying what's {{going on}} there in her. Maybe she's praying; maybe she sees more than we do, over the sea there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then all the beasts, birds, and fishes said together, 'Eldest Magician, we {{play the}} plays that you {{taught us to}} play--we and our children's children. But <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> plays with the Sea.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you're young. The young always do. Death grows friendlier {{as we grow}} older. <b>Not</b> that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{really wants}} to die, though, master. Tennyson spoke truth when he said that. There's old Mrs. Warner at the Channel Head. She's had heaps of trouble all her life, poor soul, and she's lost almost {{everyone}} she cared about. She's always saying that she'll be glad when her time comes, and she doesn't want to live any longer in this vale of tears. But when she takes a sick spell, lord, what a fuss she makes, master!

6000|$|... "Although Mr. Tyler may <b>not</b> {{be exactly}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{owing to the}} fact that he does not belong to the profession, but is only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the adjuncts to it, so to speak," [...] {{continued}} the skeleton, in a voice which was fast being raised to its highest pitch, [...] "we feel proud, after his exploits at the time of the accident, to have him with us, and gladly welcome him now, through the medium of this little feast prepared by my Lilly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am heartily pleased, my lad," [...] Captain O'Connor said, as he {{laid his}} hand upon Terence's shoulder. [...] "I am proud of you. I have never seen my own name in general orders, but I am heartily glad to see yours.
