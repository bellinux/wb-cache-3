60|$|MY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:--Early {{last week}} you left me in high hope with your {{assurance}} {{that you would}} be off with your expedition {{at the end of that}} week, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you which, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months. I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine--that you have never seen it. My dear General, this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf, with the <b>necessary</b> <b>animals</b> to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going you have no use for them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said. You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before Congress meets. You would be better off anywhere, and especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not think this is an ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The simple publication of this requisition would ruin you.|$|E

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) {{has changed}} over the past decade. In addition to dramatic worldwide increases in incidence, new CDI populations are emerging. These populations include patients with community acquired infections with no previous antibiotic exposure, children, pregnant women and patients with IBD. Diagnosis of CDIs requires the identification of C. difficile toxin A or B in diarrheal stool. Current diagnostic tests, however, remains inadequate and an optimal diagnostic testing algorithm has not yet been defined. Metronidazole and vancomycin are currently first-line agents for CDI treatment. Vancomycine, however, has demonstrated superior efficacy and therefore is the preferred agent in patients with severe infections. As with many antibiotics, the incidence of treatment failure with metronidazole is increasing, thereby emphasizing the need to find alternative treatments. Disease recurrence continues to occur in 20 - 40 % of patients and its treatment remains challenging. In patients who develop fulminant colitis from a CDI, early surgical consultation is essential. Intravenous immunoglobulin and tigecycline have been used in patients with severe refractory disease, however delaying surgery may be associated with worse outcomes. Due to the risk of horizontal transmission of C. difficile infection control measures are <b>necessary.</b> <b>Animals</b> may serve as reservoirs for humans.

The inflammatory reaction triggered by surgical {{trauma to the}} peritoneum not only promotes adhesion formation but also stimulates tumour recurrence. Implicating a common denominator. The exact mechanisms involved are only partly clarified. To be able to prevent or reduce these surgical “complications” a thorough knowledge of the underlying process is <b>necessary.</b> <b>Animal</b> experimental models as well as cell culture models were used to unravel this process. For tumour recurrence this thesis showed that the (post) surgical intra-peritoneal microenvironment enhances successful implantation of spilled tumour cells, whereas growth of adhered tumour cell clusters is not affected. Further analysis of the microenvironment showed that {{an important role in}} this process is played by PMN and their products, reactive oxygen species. Tempering the post-operative inflammatory reaction proved to be a successful measure in reducing peritoneal tumour recurrence (eg scavengers, selective COX- 2 inhibition). The mechanism by which post-operative intra-abdominal adhesions are triggered is closely associated to the mechanism by which surgery stimulates tumourcell implantation. PMN showed to stimulate adhesion formation as well. Moreover tempering the post-operative inflammatory reaction by reducing the influx of PMN or treatment with anti-oxidants could reduce post-operative adhesion formation. Icodextrin is an immerging agent in the prevention of postoperative adhesions. An analysis to the mechanism of action of this agent is performed and its influence on different parts of the postoperative inflammatory reaction...|$|R

His appointment as professor of general pathology, morbid anatomy and morbid histology in 1881 was the first of its type in England; he was also in the English vanguard with his approach to the subject, borrowing ideas widely from laboratories throughout Europe and travelling extensively to do so. The outcome was that he established pathology as a significant medical discipline in the country. as well as advancing specific techniques such as staining with eosin. He almost forestalled Louis Pasteur in his researches on hydrophobia during the 1882-1883 rabies epidemic in Manchester. Of the attempts at a rabies vaccine, which entailed injecting infected tissue into rabbits, his biographer, Peter Mohr, has said [...] His work on rabies may have succeeded, but it was never completed because of the Cruelty to Animals Act (1876).

40|$|Introduction: Of {{the cancer}} gene therapy approaches, gene silencing, suicide/apoptosis {{inducing}} gene therapy, immunogene therapy and targeted gene therapy are deemed to sub­stantially control the biological consequences of genomic changes in cancerous cells. Thus, {{a large number}} of clinical trials have been conducted against various malignancies. In this review, we will discuss recent translational progresses of gene and cell therapy of cancer. Methods: Essential information on gene therapy of cancer were reviewed and discussed towards their clinical translations. Results: Gene transfer has been rigorously studied in vitro and in vivo, in which some of these gene therapy endeavours have been carried on towards translational investigations and clinical applications. About 65 % of gene therapy trials are related to cancer therapy. Some of these trials have been combined with cell therapy to produce personalized medicines such as Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®, marketed by Dendreon, USA) for the treatment of asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Conclusion: Translational approach links two diverse boundaries of basic and clinical researches. For successful translation of geno­medicines into clinical applications, it is essential 1) to have the guidelines and standard operating procedures for development and application of the genomedicines specific to clinically relevant biomarker(s); 2) to conduct <b>necessary</b> <b>animal</b> experimental studies to show the “proof of concept” for the proposed genomedicines; 3) to perform an initial clinical investigation; and 4) to initiate extensive clinical trials to address all necessary requirements.
