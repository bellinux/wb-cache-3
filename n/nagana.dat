25|$|The {{conquest of}} {{sleeping}} sickness and <b>nagana</b> {{would be of}} immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Human African trypanosomosis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial.|$|E
25|$|Bites from tsetse flies are painful {{but these}} flies are not {{generally}} associated with direct causes of lost production in cattle. Glossina morsitans and G.pallidipes tsetse-flies are transmitters of various species of Trypanosoma protozoa causing animal trypanosomiasis (= <b>nagana)</b> in cattle, {{and other forms}} of trypanosomiasis in sheep, goats, pigs, camels and horses. Tsetse-flies are also notorious as transmitters of the Trypanosoma species causing African trypanosomiasis (= sleeping sickness) in humans.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse flies are {{regarded}} as {{a major cause of}} rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because <b>nagana,</b> the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Those cattle that survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available to fertilize the worn-out soils.|$|E
25|$|Animal trypanosomiasis, {{also called}} <b>nagana</b> when {{it occurs in}} bovine cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in {{domestic}} pigs, is caused by several trypanosome species. These diseases reduce the growth rate, milk productivity, and strength of farm animals, generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals. Certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected.|$|E
25|$|Bites of tabanid flies are painful. Dense {{populations of}} these flies cause severe biting stress to {{livestock}} and horses leading to reduction of gain in liveweight. These hosts may additionally suffer loss of grazing time by clustering in tight defensive packs, a situation known as fly-syndrome. Many genera of tabanid flies transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma evansi that causes in camels and horses the disease called surra. These flies also transmit the protozoan T.vivax that causes in cattle the disease called <b>nagana.</b> Tabanid flies are also transmitters the bacteria Anaplasma marginale and A.centrale to cattle, sheep and goats, causing anaplasmosis.|$|E
25|$|The disease <b>nagana</b> or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health {{decline in}} {{infected}} livestock, reduces milk and meat production, increases abortion rates, and animals eventually {{succumb to the}} disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has {{an enormous impact on}} the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant prophylactic treatment with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.|$|E
2500|$|Tsetse are {{biological}} vectors of trypanosomes, {{meaning that}} {{in the process of}} feeding, they acquire and then transmit small, single-celled trypanosomes from infected vertebrate hosts to uninfected animals. Some tsetse-transmitted trypanosome species cause trypanosomiasis, an infectious disease. In humans, tsetse transmitted trypanosomiasis is called sleeping sickness. In animals, tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases include <b>nagana,</b> souma, and surra according to the animal infected and the trypanosome species involved. The usage is not strict and while <b>nagana</b> generally refers to the disease in cattle and horses it is commonly used for any [...] of animal trypanosomiasis.|$|E
50|$|Trypanosoma congolense is {{a species}} of trypanosomes and is the major {{pathogen}} responsible for the disease <b>nagana</b> in cattle and other animals including sheep, pigs, goats, horses and camels, dogs, as well as laboratory mice. It {{is the most common}} cause of <b>nagana</b> in east Africa, but is also a major cause of <b>nagana</b> in west Africa. This parasite is spread by tsetse flies. In its mammalian host, Trypanosoma congolense only lives in blood vessels, and causes in particular anaemia.|$|E
50|$|Animal trypanosomiasis, {{also known}} as <b>nagana</b> and <b>nagana</b> pest, or {{sleeping}} sickness, is a disease of vertebrates. The disease is caused by trypanosomes of several species in the genus Trypanosoma such as Trypanosoma brucei. Trypanosoma vivax causes <b>nagana</b> mainly in West Africa, although it has spread to South America. The trypanosomes infect {{the blood of the}} vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy, which lead to weight loss and anemia; in some animals the disease is fatal unless treated. The trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies.|$|E

50|$|The {{decimation}} of {{the wildlife}} was noted by both hunters and early naturalists, and in 1895 {{the first game}} reserves were proclaimed.

Many years followed where conflict arose over disease spreading from the protected game and a difference in priorities was evident between conservationists and farmers. Some game reserves were deproclaimed and the <b>Nagana</b> Campaign was implemented, which caused severe degradation of ecosystems.|$|E
