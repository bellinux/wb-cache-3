5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino {{in close proximity to}} the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he had been told that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously <b>not</b> <b>perceived.</b> Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{attained}} tropical characteristics near 0000UTC while situated {{south of}} Louisiana and was subsequently designated a tropical depression. Ship communications {{off the coast}} on July24 relayed winds of 23–50knots and a barometric pressure of 1007.5mbar (29.75inHg), which indicated it was a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Radar imagery taken near 0733CST (1333UTC) from a Dow Chemical plant in Freeport, Texas evidenced that Debra was a full-fledged Category1 hurricane on the scale, with a prominent spiral appearance that was <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> by the radar the previous afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Persistent (> six months), {{false belief}} that one emits an {{offensive}} odor, which is <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> by others. There may be degrees of insight (i.e. the belief {{may or may}} not be of delusional intensity).|$|E
25|$|This {{case would}} {{be an example of}} what Posey and Losch call ‘hearing a comforting or advising voice that is <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as being one’s own thoughts’. They {{estimated}} that approximately 10% of their population of 375 American college students had this type of experience.|$|E
25|$|This {{practice}} was most used during World War II by Italian immigrants because Italy was an enemy {{country for a}} few years. As Italians are Catholics and were easily assimilated in the larger Brazilian society, the practice is <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> and almost forgot after a single generation.|$|E

25|$|There {{is solid}} {{evidence}} from the Abwehr war diaries that methods employed by IRA units carrying out the S-Plan generated only annoyance and frustration in Germany. Attacks against mostly civilian targets, while causing panic and loss {{of confidence in the}} authorities, were <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as helpful to damaging British capability for waging war.|$|E
25|$|In {{locations}} {{with little}} light pollution, the moonlit night sky is also blue, because moonlight is reflected sunlight, {{with a slightly}} lower color temperature due to the brownish color of the moon. The moonlit sky is <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as blue, however, because at low light levels human vision comes mainly from rod cells that do not produce any color perception (Purkinje effect).|$|E
25|$|Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had {{previously}} warned Bush that replacing Thurgood Marshall, who was widely revered {{as a civil}} rights icon, with any candidate who was <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> to share Marshall's views would make the confirmation process difficult. Civil rights and feminist organizations opposed the appointment based partially on Thomas's criticism of affirmative action and suspicions that Thomas {{might not be a}} supporter of Roe v. Wade.|$|E

25|$|In its 2015 campaign, UKIP {{called for}} the foreign aid budget to be cut. It has also {{advocated}} a 40% increase in the UK's national defence budget. It opposes UK military involvement in conflicts that are <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> {{to be in the}} national interest, specifically rejecting the concept of humanitarian interventionism. For instance, in 2014 it opposed the Cameron government's plans to intervene militarily against the government of Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.|$|E
25|$|Grey {{noise is}} random white noise {{subjected}} to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted A-weighting curve) over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies. This {{is in contrast to}} standard white noise which has equal strength over a linear scale of frequencies but is <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as being equally loud due to biases in the human equal-loudness contour.|$|E
25|$|During the Renaissance, {{the study}} of art and science was <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as {{mutually}} exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach {{to the art of}} painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.|$|E

25|$|Police {{brutality}} is <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> to be {{a serious}} threat to society in Luxembourg. The European Union's 2014 Anti-Corruption report placed Luxembourg, along with Denmark and Finland, as having the lowest experiences of Police brutality within the European Union. Due to many positive characteristics of their society, such as freedom of media, the encouragement of public participation in the legal system and transparency mechanisms, the public also have great trust in the Grand Ducal police force.|$|E
25|$|In the ego, {{there are}} two ongoing processes. First, there is the {{unconscious}} primary process, where the thoughts are not organised in a coherent way; the feelings can shift, contradictions are not in conflict or are just <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> that way, and condensations arise. There is no logic and no time line. Lust is important for this process. By contrast, there is the conscious secondary process, where strong boundaries are set and thoughts must be organised in a coherent way. Most conscious thoughts originate here.|$|E
25|$|The Clock drawing test (CDT) {{is a brief}} {{cognitive}} {{task that}} can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test that can easily be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits. Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> as impacting the utility of the CDT.|$|E

25|$|To {{maintain}} {{public confidence}} in the judiciary, it is important to maximize judges' independence from personal interests, beliefs and prejudices, and ensure that they are <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> to be affected by their personal beliefs and prejudices. The State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act ("SCJA") provide that judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court, are not permitted to investigate or hear and decide any proceedings to or in which they are parties or personally interested, unless the parties to the proceedings have consented and the Chief Justice has given approval.|$|E
25|$|To {{this end}} the authors asked four adults {{to read a}} text {{reflected}} in a mirror for ten minutes a day for five months. In all subjects, the words were <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> in their globality but required a meticulous analysis of the letters and syllables. They also demonstrated total or partial inversions even sometimes affecting {{the order of the}} words in a sentence. They revealed a curious impression of not just horizontal but also vertical inversions. These are errors that exist amongst people with dyslexia and they suffer from the aggravating circumstance inherent in all learning.|$|E
25|$|Marshall {{had been}} the first African American Justice on the Court, and while the {{appointment}} of Thomas would preserve the existing racial composition of the Court, it was seen as likely to move its ideological balance to the right. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had previously warned Bush that replacing Thurgood Marshall, who was widely revered as a civil rights icon, with any candidate who was <b>not</b> <b>perceived</b> to share Marshall's views would make the confirmation process difficult. Civil rights and feminist organizations opposed Thomas' appointment, partially citing Thomas' criticism of affirmative action and also because they were suspicious that Thomas might not be a supporter of Roe v. Wade.|$|E

I {{would like to thank}} Marty Anisman for the appointment to this most honored position. At the time he asked me to accept the appointment, I protested- not a lot- but honestly because I did <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> myself as appropriate for this role. I do <b>not</b> <b>perceive</b> myself as a scholar and I may prove that an accurate perception today...|$|R
