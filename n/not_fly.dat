5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, KNILM began its first {{international}} flight to Singapore. In June 1937, several {{cities in the}} Dutch East Indies were visited by Amelia Earhart during her attempted circumnavigation. From Singapore, Earhart flew to Bandung, Surabaya, and Kupang before continuing her journey to Darwin, Australia. On 3 July 1938, KNILM began operations to Sydney, stopping at Darwin, Cloncurry, and Charleville. KNILM did <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> to the Netherlands, as the Amsterdam-Batavia weekly service was operated by KLM.|$|E
5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know past and future things. People paid them to cure the sick, which they did by saying prayers and making {{the sign of the}} cross all over the patient's body. The vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could <b>not</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|E

5|$|Returning to the U.S. in 1953, Hagerstrom {{remained}} in the Air Force {{until his retirement in}} 1968, during which he earned a master's degree in economics and a law degree. In 1965 he was assigned to Vietnam but did <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> combat missions. After retiring, Hagerstrom traveled the Pacific in a homemade boat with his family, living in various Pacific islands before settling in Mansfield, Louisiana. Hagerstrom died in nearby Shreveport of stomach cancer in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Fairey Spearfish was a British carrier-based, single-engined, torpedo bomber/dive bomber {{that was}} ordered from Fairey Aviation for the Fleet Air Arm during World War II. Designed during the war, the {{prototype}} did <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> until July 1945. Much larger than earlier naval bombers, {{it was designed}} for use aboard the large s that were cancelled {{after the war and}} was itself cancelled thereafter. Seven prototypes were ordered, but only five were built, of which four actually flew. They were mostly used for experimental work until the last aircraft was scrapped in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E

5|$|The {{display of}} the Hinomaru at homes and {{businesses}} is also debated in Japanese society. Because {{of the association of}} the Hinomaru with uyoku dantai (right wing) activists, reactionary politics, or hooliganism, some homes and businesses do <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> the flag. There is no requirement to fly the flag on any national holiday or special events. The town of Kanazawa, Ishikawa, has proposed plans in September 2012 to use government funds to buy flags with the purpose of encouraging citizens to fly the flag on national holidays. The Japanese Communist Party is vocally against the flag.|$|E

In addition, {{the remains of the}} first stage of Black Arrow R3 were recovered from the Anna Creek cattle station and are displayed in the William Creek Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|The monastery runs a {{fundraising}} {{program for}} cataract {{operations in the}} city, and receives wide support due to public suspicion of charities affiliated with the ruling Communist Party government, due to the communists' strong reputation for rampant corruption. Following the fall of Saigon and the communist takeover, religious bodies were required to be registered with and loyal to the party. The khat si complied {{and became one of}} the nine schools within the state-sanctioned Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation. However, the temple does <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> the national flag, and the only government material or symbols on display within Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm are letters of congratulations for charity initiatives.|$|E

5|$|Two Space Shuttle {{missions}} – {{the ill-fated}} STS-51-L (ended by the Challenger disaster) and STS-61-E – {{were scheduled to}} observe Halley's Comet from low Earth orbit. STS-51-L carried the Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-203) satellite, also called the Halley's Comet Experiment Deployable (HCED). STS-61-E was a Columbia mission scheduled for March 1986, carrying the ASTRO-1 platform to study the comet. Due to the suspension of America's manned space program after the Challenger explosion, the mission was canceled, and ASTRO-1 would <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> until late 1990 on STS-35.|$|E
5|$|Williams was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Municipal Auditorium in Charleston, West Virginia on Wednesday December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled US$3,500. That day, because of an ice storm in the Nashville area, Williams could <b>not</b> <b>fly,</b> so he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts. Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say that Williams would not arrive on time owing to the ice storm and was ordered to drive Williams to Canton, Ohio, for the New Year's Day concert there.|$|E
5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated that they will <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> again {{due to a lack}} of support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E

5|$|An {{adaptation}} is an observable {{structure or}} other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated {{by natural selection}} to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the hypothesis that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, {{there is also a}} historical question, namely, did the trait arise {{at the same time as}} bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did <b>not</b> <b>fly.</b> Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Singapore {{strategy}} was revived {{in the form}} of Operation Mastodon, a plan to deploy V bombers of RAF Bomber Command equipped with nuclear weapons to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the Vbombers could <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for Vbombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did <b>not</b> <b>fly.</b> The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, {{the company}} {{received}} {{an order for}} three prototypes to be built against Specification O.5/43 and the first prototype, serial number RA356, was constructed at Fairey's Hayes factory and first flew on 5 July 1945 from Heston Aerodrome; the other two did <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> until 1947. In November 1943 the company was ordered to build a dual-control dive-bombing trainer variant against Specification T.21/43 and this was built at the Heaton Chapel factory and assembled and flown at Ringway on 20 June 1946. Three further development aircraft were ordered in May 1944 to be built at Heaton Chapel, with the last two to be fitted with a Rolls-Royce Pennine engine; only the first Centarus-engined aircraft was built but never flew.|$|E
5|$|Nordmann was {{promoted}} to Major (major) on 18 June 1942. On 26 June 1942 Nordmann crashed his Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-2 (Werknummer 12825—factory number). The aircraft flipped during the landing and Nordmann suffered a basilar fractured skull, an injury typical of high-speed crashes. Although he flew again shortly after the crash his injury required hospitalization in August. Nordmann, who had been assisted by Hauptmann Joachim Müncheberg as a Geschwaderkommodore in training, temporarily replaced him during his absence. On 17 January 1943 Nordmann's Focke-Wulf Fw 190 {{was involved in a}} midair collision with Hauptmann Rudolf Busch, Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 51. Busch was killed and Nordmann, severely injured, did <b>not</b> <b>fly</b> operationally again. In total, Nordmann claimed 78 aerial victories, 69 of which on the Eastern Front, flying over 800 combat missions. Under his leadership JG 51 reported the 4,000th aerial victory on 16 December 1942, the 5,000th victory on 2 June 1943, the 6,000th victory on 27 July 1943 and the 7,000th victory on 15 September 1943.|$|E
