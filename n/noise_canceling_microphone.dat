5000|$|A good vogad circuit {{must have}} a very fast attack time, so that an initial loud voice signal does not cause a sudden burst of {{excessive}} modulation. In practice the attack time will be a few milliseconds, so a clipping limiter is still sometimes needed to catch the signal on these short peaks. A much longer decay time is usually employed, so that the gain does not get boosted too quickly during the normal pauses in natural speech. Too short a decay time leads to the phenomenon of [...] "breathing" [...] where the background noise level gets boosted at each gap in the speech. Vogad circuits are normally adjusted so that at low levels of input the signal is not fully boosted, but instead follow a linear boost curve. This works well with <b>noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R

40|$|Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G 2 P) {{conversion}} {{is concerned}} with describing the process of automatic conversion of letters in a text into their phonemic transcription and it {{plays an important role}} in text to speech synthesis. The G 2 P component of Yorùbá TTS is yet to be addressed. To achieve the conversion of the grapheme to phoneme, knowledge of the process underlying standard Yorùbá text to sound is expedient. This paper presents a system for generating the phonemic description of the sound corresponding to a piece of Yorùbá text. Standard Yorùbá text data was collected and digitised and resulting digital text was edited for correction of orthographic items using Tákádá text editor and Àkotó Yorùbá software. The corresponding speech data for the text collected was recorded in a quiet environment with a <b>noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> <b>microphone</b> on a typical multimedia computer system using the Speech Filing System software and analysed and annotated using PRAAT speech processing software. The system was designed with Finite State Transducer and implemented using Python 2. 7 programming language. The system was able to generate multiple correct representations for graphemes in Yorùbá language with 100 % accuracy on both grapheme level and word level. The results obtained in this study confirmed the hypothesis that the Yorùbá G 2 P system has a systematic procedure underlying it and this procedure can be computationally specified, analysed and represented using computational tools...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic <b>noise</b> <b>canceling</b> {{methods are}} used to <b>cancel</b> out <b>noise</b> from a noise source. A {{frequently}} used algorithm is the filtered-X algorithm. This method uses {{an estimate of the}} acoustical path from secondary sound source to microphone. Because the secondary path can change due to movements or other circumstances it is desirable to track the secondary path online. In this paper several online modeling techniques are discussed and a new method is proposed, this new method uses additive noise to track the secondary path online. The power of the additional noise is dependent on the quality of <b>noise</b> <b>canceling.</b> Simulations show that this new online modeling method tracks the changes of the secondary path well.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{is to provide a}} user-friendly index of the relative impairment associated with noise in the aircraft cabin. As such, the relative effect of noise, at a level typical of an aircraft cabin was compared with varying levels of alcohol intoxication in the same subjects. Since the detrimental effect of noise is more pronounced on non-native speakers, both native English and non-native English speakers featured in the study. <b>Noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> headphones were also tested as a simple countermeasure to mitigate the effect of noise on performance. A total of 32 participants, half of which were non-native English speakers, completed a cued recall task in two alcohol conditions (blood alcohol concentration 0. 05 and 0. 10) and two audio conditions (audio played through the speaker and <b>noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> headphones). The results revealed that aircraft noise at 65 dB (A) negatively affected performance to a level comparable to alcohol intoxication of 0. 10. The results also supported previous research that reflects positively on the benefits of <b>noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> headphones in reducing the effects of noise on performance especially for non-native English speakers. These findings provide for personnel involved in the aviation industry, a user-friendly index of the relative impairment associated with noise in the aircraft cabin as compared with the effects of alcohol.
