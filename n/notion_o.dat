In a few minutes Mr. Browne was seated beside her, and how he {{accomplished}} this manoeuvre Cynthia could not have said, so skilfully and gradually was it done. For lack of a better subject he chose Mr. Robert Worthington. Related, for Cynthia's delectation, several of Bob's escapades in his freshman year: silly escapades enough, but very bold and daring and original they sounded to Cynthia, who listened (if Mr. Browne could have known it) with almost breathless interest, and forgot all about poor Susan talking to Mr. King. Did Mr. Worthington still while away his evenings stealing barber poles and being chased around Cambridge by irate policemen? Mr. Browne laughed at the <b>notion.</b> <b>O</b> dear, no! seniors never descended to that. Had not Miss Wetherell heard the song wherein seniors were designated as grave and reverend? Yes, Miss Wetherell had heard the song. She did not say where, or how. Mr. Worthington, said his classmate, had become very serious-minded this year. Was captain of the base-ball team and already looking toward the study of law.|$|E

This paper studies two natural generalizations o P-selectivity: the NP-selective sets and the sets reducible or equivalent to P-selective sets via polynomial-time reductions. We establish a strict hierarchy among the various reductions and equivalences to P-selective sets. We show that the NP-selective sets are in (NP coNP) /poly, are extended low, and (those in NP) are Low 2; we also show that NP-selective sets cannot be NP-complete unless NP = coNP. By studying more general <b>notions</b> <b>o</b> nondeterministic selectivity, we conclude that all multivalued NP functions have single-valued NP refinements only if the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level...|$|R

Lectures 2 - 5 are basic and slow, while the remaining ones are more intense.

40|$|In this survey, {{we review}} {{practical}} algorithms for graph-theoretic {{problems that are}} expressible in monadic second-order logic. Monadic second-order (MSO) logic allows quantifications over unary relations (sets) {{and can be used}} to express a host of use-ful graph properties such as connectivity, c-colorability (for a fixed c), Hamiltonicity and minor inclusion. A celebrated theorem in this area by Courcelle states that any graph problem expressible in MSO can be solved in linear time on graphs that admit a tree-decomposition of constant width. Courcelle’s Theorem has been used thus far as a theoretic tool to establish that linear-time algorithms exist for graph problems by demonstrating that the problem in question is expressible by an MSO formula. A straightforward implementation of the algorithm in the proof of Courcelle’s Theorem is useless as it runs into space-explosion problems even for small values of treewidth. Of late, there have been several attempts to circumvent these problems and we review some of these in this survey. This survey also introduces the reader to the <b>notions</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis juxtaposes the {{relationship}} between domestic servants and their employers in metropole (England) and colony (India) between 1850 and 1914. It considers the master/servant relationship as a site for the formation, maintenance and contestation of class, gender, race and national identities. As well as exploring the significance of {{the relationship}} in terms of the construction of social identities, this thesis also argues that in certain circumstances the servant/employer relationship could take on an unexpected political significance. For Britain this is considered in relation to the labour and women’s movements. For India, the connection between service and <b>notions</b> <b>o</b> f ‘the Indian’ is linked to the perceived purpose of the imperial project and fear amongst colonizers of nascent Indian nationalism. The structure of service engendered certain ‘the tensions of intimacy’, which could spill into violence. These are explored in both contexts, with reference to the effects of the employment of a primarily female service workforce in Britain, and a male workforce in India.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} special kind of {{conservative}} translation between abstract logics, namely an abstract Glivenko's theorem. Firstly we define institutions on the categories of logic, algebraizable logics, and Lindenbaum algebraizable logic. In the sequel, we introduce the <b>notion</b> <b>os</b> Glivenko's context relating two algebraizable logics (respectively, Lindenbaum algebraizable logics) and we prove that for each Glivenko's context can be associated an institutions morphism between the corresponding logical institutions. As a consequence of the existence of such institutions morphisms, we have established abstract versions of Glivenko's theorem between those algebraizable logics (Lindenbaum algebraizable logics), generalizing the results presented in To. In particular, considering the institutions of classical logic and of intuitionistic logic, we build a Glivenko's context and thus an abstract Glivenko's theorem that is exactly the traditional Glivenko's theorem. Finally we present a category of algebraizable logic with Glivenko's context as morphisms. We can interpret the results of this work as an evidence of the (virtually unexplored) relevance of institution theory in the study of propositional logic. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} {{widespread}} support for the twin notions of sustainability and sustainable development in government, corporate and environmental circles in South Africa. i However, {{as soon as one}} starts to dig below the surface of public rhetoric, a number of serious questions emerge about our general acceptance of these concepts. Bureaucrats will tell us that sustainability or sustainable development are empty concepts, too vague or ill defined to be of any use in practical decision-making and real life policy implementation (Jacobs 1999 : 22). Similarly, environmentalists will point out that the notion of “wise ” or “sustainable use ” is a “dangerous influence that is a threat not only to wildlife and nature in Africa, but indeed to natural resources world wide ” (Patterson 1998 : 63). Instead of contributing towards the protection of nature and ensuring a continued availability of resources, it is claimed that “sustainable use ” is nothing but a green mask used by industry and governments to justify and continue the ruthless exploitation of natural resources as it has always been done before. In the same vein we often hear the warning that aims such as sustainability “are lightly professed in theory without looking at all at practical realization ” (Achterhuis 1994 : 198).

However, those details were provided only for Π 11 indescribable cardinals, roughly as follows. First, looked at within set theory, let κ be any regular uncountable cardinal (also called a 1 -regular cardinal), and let f, g range over all functions from κ to κ, while F ranges over functionals F(f) = g of next higher type. F is said to be bounded if for every f: κ → κ and every ξ < κ, the value of F(f) (ξ) is determined by less than κ values of f. α {{is said to be a}} witness for F if for all f: κ → κ, if the restriction of f to α maps α into α then the same holds for F(f). κ is said to be 2 -regular if every F that is bounded has a witness.
