5|$|Filming {{took place}} at Saint Hilda's Primary School, Presbyterian High School and other {{locations}} during the school holidays in June. Neo hired real gangsters to act in several gangster scenes as he was dissatisfied with the extras. According to him, communicating with the gangsters was difficult, but {{when he decided to}} apply the lessons from the movie and praised them for a good take, they reacted well. Several members of the cast also said that I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> Too inspired them to communicate better with their family members. On 26 January 2006, distributor United International Pictures released I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> Too on 36 screens in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Neo and Rebecca Leow co-wrote the script, {{which was}} {{completed}} in May 2005. I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> Too was produced by MediaCorp Raintree Pictures on a budget of S$1.5 million. Shanghai Film Studio had agreed to co-produce I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> Too with Raintree Pictures, but backed out because they found the film too liberal. The production crew included Daniel Yun as executive producer, Chan Pui Yin and Seah Saw Yan as producers, Ardy Lam as cinematographer and Mo Ju Li as sound editor. Besides writing and directing, Neo starred as Mr. Yeo and composed the theme song, which was sung by Hong Junyang.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid,</b> a sequel was suggested, but Neo had {{difficulty}} finding a suitable topic. His inspiration was a book on appreciation education, a method of teaching developed by Chinese educator Zhou Hong. Through the movie, Neo hoped to capture the culture of Singapore {{at the turn of}} the millennium, and to explore the issue of poor parent-child communication.|$|E

At the 2006 Hong Kong Film Awards, it was nominated for Best Asian Film, but lost to Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles. Critical reception was also generally positive, although some criticized the movie as overly preachy.|$|E
25|$|There are {{increasing}} {{reforms in the}} Education system. Primary education was made compulsory in 2003. This style of educational policy was still extremely competitive, and favoured those that did well initially, and tended to ignore the suffering students, {{in the process of}} streaming. This remains a controversial issue even today. It was theme for the successful local film I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> which also addresses the culture of competition induced by the post-independence education policy. Although the education policy has evolved over the years to address such concerns, the streaming issue is still prominent.|$|E

500|$|While {{watching}} the Iranian film Children of Heaven, Singaporean filmmaker Jack Neo {{and his wife}} were moved to [...] "holding hands and crying after seeing the love shared by the children". Children of Heaven inspired Neo to explore issues faced by Singaporean youths in his 2002 film I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid.</b> Following the success of I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid,</b> he decided to adapt Children of Heaven to a 1960s Singaporean kampung setting, to emphasise the messages of friendship and kinship.|$|E
500|$|I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> earned just S$46,000 {{during a}} limited sneak preview run, {{prompting}} Raintree Pictures {{to embark on}} a massive publicity campaign, including invitations for teachers to discuss the film.

The movie also screened at the Pusan International Film Festival, Tokyo International Film Festival, the Jakarta International Film Festival and the 2005 Singapore Season cultural exhibition in London. Over 50,000 VCDs of I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> were sold and its sole distributor, VideoVan, declared it the [...] "No. 1 selling VCD in Singapore". This claim was disputed by Alliance Entertainment, which said that 70,000 VCDs of Money No Enough were sold, but VideoVan called the comparison inaccurate, as Money No Enough was a mature title, rather than a new release.|$|E
500|$|Awards that I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> won include Best Chinese Film at the Golden Bauhinia Awards and Best Chinese Humanitarian Film at the 2002 Taiwan Golden Torch Awards; {{the movie}} was also {{nominated}} for Best Asian Film at the Hong Kong Film Awards, losing to My Sassy Girl.

For example, Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com wrote, [...] "I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> covers a variety of serious subjects, but all the while maintains a light comedic touch. Jack Neo [...] a clever, well-crafted social commentary and a damn good film to boot." [...] Other reviewers described I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> as [...] "one of the greatest cinematic feats I’ve {{had the pleasure of}} experiencing" [...] and displaying a [...] "simple and yet excellent execution". In contrast, FilmAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei, found it [...] "most shocking...that the Singapore censors actually allowed this film through in the first place".|$|E

500|$|Critics praised I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> Too for its {{touching}} {{portrayal of}} the problems faced by Singaporean teenagers.

Nie Peng of Shenzhen Daily felt the film [...] "captured the emotional depth and effectively conveyed the underlying theme of generation gaps", while movieXclusive.com reviewer Jolene Tan called it [...] "a good local movie that will have [...] laughing in stitches and crying at certain points". However, I <b>Not</b> <b>Stupid</b> Too was also panned for being overly preachy: a reviewer for The Hindu said that the movie [...] "feels like a public service program written by Singapore's social welfare department". Geoffrey Eu, a reviewer for The Business Times, commented that it [...] "takes the line that the viewer needs to be clubbed into submission rather than persuaded via a more subtle line of reasoning".|$|E
