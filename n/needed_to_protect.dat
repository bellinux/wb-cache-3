5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War in September, {{construction}} continued desultorily until October when it was suspended by the Admiralty for one year to release labour and material for escorts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> merchant convoys. Construction of the 16-inch guns and their turrets was to continue, however. The question was raised again on 12 November 1940 and the decision to suspend construction was reaffirmed. All three ships ordered were cancelled in 1942, but Lions keel was not scrapped until {{after the end of the}} war. Only four 16-inch guns, and no turrets, were ever completed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature and the fact that inspections were no longer <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the Long Bridge against sabotage, Fort Jackson fell into the third-class category.|$|E
5|$|Strategically, the Allied {{mission was}} simple. The fleet <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the {{flank of the}} army at Thermopylae, whilst not being cut off themselves. For the Persians, the {{strategic}} situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position. Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around {{the east coast of}} Euboea. The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found a better position near the city of Histiaea.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|The Bismarcks' use of four twin turrets (the 4 × 2 configuration) was {{a design}} {{practice}} that hearkened {{back to the}} First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while {{reducing the number of}} turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the Bismarcks, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvoes.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1990, 24 F-4G Wild Weasel Vs and six RF-4Cs were {{deployed}} to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, for Operation Desert Storm. The F-4G {{was the only}} aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role, and was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> coalition aircraft from Iraq's extensive air defense system. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera, and was used {{for a variety of}} reconnaissance missions. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G Wild Weasel Vs from 561st Fighter Squadron, were retired on 26 March 1996. The last operational flight of the F-4G Wild Weasel was from the 190th Fighter Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard, in April 1996. The last operational USAF/ANG F-4 to land was flown by Maj Mike Webb and Maj Gary Leeder of the Idaho ANG.|$|E

25|$|Since {{its formal}} {{founding}} in 1839, {{the city of}} Galveston had weathered numerous storms, all of which the city survived with ease. Residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events. In order to provide an official meteorological statement on the threat of hurricanes, Galveston Weather Bureau section director Isaac Cline wrote an 1891 article in the Galveston Daily News in which he argued not only that a seawall was not <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the city, but also {{that it would be}} impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike the island. The seawall was not built, and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms. Sand dunes along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city, removing what little barrier there was to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Johnston {{withdrew his}} 60,000 men into the Richmond defenses. Their {{defensive}} line {{began at the}} James River at Drewry's Bluff and extended counterclockwise so that his center and left were behind the Chickahominy River, a natural barrier in the spring when it turned the broad plains {{to the east of}} Richmond into swamps. Johnston's men burned most of the bridges over the Chickahominy and settled into strong defensive positions north and east of the city. McClellan positioned his 105,000-man army to focus on the northeast sector, for two reasons. First, the Pamunkey River, which ran roughly parallel to the Chickahominy, offered a line of communication that could enable McClellan to get around Johnston's left flank. Second, McClellan anticipated the arrival of McDowell's I Corps, scheduled to march south from Fredericksburg to reinforce his army, and thus <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their avenue of approach.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{during each}} fiscal year, a {{prefecture}} that has nuclear power stations in its territory is legally bound to hold nuclear accident disaster drills, demonstrating how {{to evacuate the}} population out of the 10-kilometer evacuation zone according to the governmental anti-disaster guidelines. The Fukishima Daiichi accidents proved this 10-kilometer zone to be an underestimation of the evacuation zones that would actually be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> {{the population of the}} prefecture from escaping radiation in a proper way. On 5 September 2011, three prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima and Ibaraki—were unable to hold the drills before March 2012. Six prefectures, including Hokkaido and Fukui, had not taken a decision to hold a drill and were awaiting new governmental guidelines on how far to evacuate. Four other prefectures, including Ehime and Saga, planned to hold drills by establishing temporary guidelines and by expanding evacuation zones on their own. The Nuclear Safety Commission aimed to review the evacuation zones and other policies by the end of October.|$|E
25|$|At {{the debate}} at Freeport Lincoln forced Douglas {{to choose between}} two options, either of which would damage Douglas' {{popularity}} and chances of getting reelected. Lincoln asked Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision. Douglas responded {{that the people of}} a territory could keep slavery out even though the Supreme Court said that the federal government had no authority to exclude slavery, simply by refusing to pass a slave code and other legislation <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> slavery. Douglas alienated Southerners with this Freeport Doctrine, which damaged his chances of winning the Presidency in 1860. As a result, Southern politicians would use their demand for a slave code for territories such as Kansas to drive a wedge between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic Party. In splitting what was the majority political party in 1858 (the Democratic Party), Southerners guaranteed the election of Lincoln, the nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, in 1860.|$|E
