40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel auto-throttle controller designed for robust and fuel-efficient operation under chang-ing flight conditions in four-dimensional (4 D) flight trajectories (3 D+time). Following typical receding horizon tech-niques, the throttle values are obtained by optimizing the predicted {{response of the}} system over future time intervals. The novelty is two-fold: First, the controller is designed to achieve a user-defined, realistic reference value for the air-craft Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), while maintaining the <b>nominal</b> safety <b>margins</b> during the 4 D flights. Second, the throttle commands result from a closed-form expression with minimal computational effort, thus simplifying the proposed auto-throttle’s on-board implementation. Tests against a conventional PID-based auto-throttle illustrate the current controller’s superior robustness under challenging flight conditions (turbulence) ...|$|R
40|$|Effective power {{transfer}} {{has been one}} of the main issues in power electronics. In particular, low-harmonic alternating current (AC) shaping is required by various regulations at the interface between AC power grid and direct current (DC) loads or sources,. In order to meet rapidly evolving efficiency standards and environmental concerns, intelligent AC current shaping strategies are required. In the power converter stage, however, inherent uncertainties caused by passive component tolerances and changes in operating conditions may impair the control loop stability, while mis-detection of operating modes over wide load range aggravates the situation further. This thesis introduces an auto-tuning technique in digitally controlled single-phase AC-DC rectifiers and DC-AC inverters. The approach is capable of precise on-line estimation of the power stage passive component values. The control loop compensator parameters are modified adaptively to maintain the <b>nominal</b> stability <b>margins</b> and control loop bandwidth based on the estimated component values. Furthermore, accurate continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) boundary detection is achieved as a result of the tuning process, without the need for additional circuitry. Implementation of the tuning approach is relatively simple. The proposed tuning approach is verified on experimental AC-DC and DC-AC prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to extend as much as possible the dissipativity approach for the study of robustness of stability in the presence of known/unknown but ignored input dynamics. This leads us to : ffl give a new characterization of control Lyapunov functions (CLF) where L f V is upperbounded by a function of L g V, ffl define the dissipativity approach as : [...] assuming the ignored dynamics are dissipative with storage function W and (known) supply rate w, [...] analyzing closed-loop stability with the sum of the storage function W and a CLF for the <b>nominal</b> part.

40|$|Experience {{from the}} United Kingdom and the United States {{suggests}} that expert evidence is often reshaped and repackaged by governments {{so that it}} supports existing policy rather than informing policy decisions. The Australian government based its decision to introduce FuelWatch on evidence {{in the form of}} econometric work by the ACCC. This paper asks two questions about that decision. First, was the policy shaped by the economet- ric evidence or was the government�s presentation of the evidence shaped by the pre-determined policy? Second, is the econometric evidence sufficiently robust as to support the FuelWatch policy? I find that some of the facts suggest that evidence was reshaped and repackaged to support the FuelWatch policy. I also find that the ACCC analysis was not robust. Specifically, they study the <b>nominal</b> retail <b>margin</b> when economic theory suggests that analysis should focus on the real retail margin to producers. Using data digitized from a graph in the ACCC report I redo the econometric analysis and find that the evidence no longer unambiguously supports the FuelWatch policy. The ACCC claim that their analysis is robust because it has been subject to scrutiny within the ACCC and by Treasury but such claims of robustness cannot be verified because they refuse to release the data for public scrutiny. Publication of data and analysis underpinning government decisions and independent review of econometric work provides a more credible evidence base for future policy decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{free-flying}} SCRAMSPACE I Mach 8 hypersonic flight experiment will {{be launched}} using a two-stage sounding rocket motor system (RMS) from the Andoya Test Range in Norway in June 2013. The vehicle will reach {{an altitude of}} approximately 100 km before detaching from the RMS, with the fuelled phase of the scramjet experiment occurring between 32 km- 27 km during the down-leg of the ballistic RMS trajectory. Satisfying the static stability requirements specified by the launch service provider when SCRAMSPACE {{is attached to the}} RMS whilst also maintaining an acceptable static stability margin during the free-flying phase of the mission is shown to be an interdisciplinary and multi-constraint design problem. Inviscid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools have been used to perform a trade-off analysis between the competing requirements of the RMS and the desired SCRAMSPACE stability margins from launch until termination of the experiment. The placement of both vehicles 2 ̆ 7 (RMS and SCRAMSPACE) centre of gravity (CG) and centre of pressure (CoP) are a coupled problem, with the vehicle length, outer mould line, stability fin mass and shape all having a profound effect on the stability margin evolution over the trajectory. The second (Improved Orion) stage is found to be the critical flight phase for the RMS stability during ascent. The addition of 50 mm high strakes between the Improved Orion stability fins has been shown to ensure static stability throughout the ascent phase. The shape of the stability fins on the SCRAMSPACE vehicle has evolved to place the fin CoP as far aft as possible without interfering with the launch rail or RMS manacle band release mechanism.

40|$|Abstract—Subthreshold {{circuit design}} is {{promising}} for future ultralow-energy sensor applications {{as well as}} highly parallel high-performance processing. Device scaling {{has the potential to}} increase speed in addition to decreasing both energy and cost in subthreshold circuits. However, no study has yet considered whether device scaling to 45 nm and beyond will be beneficial for subthreshold logic. We investigate the implications of device scal-ing on subthreshold logic and SRAM and find that the slow scaling of gate-oxide thickness leads to a 60 % reduction in Ion/Ioff between the 90 - and 32 -nm device generations. We highlight the effects of this device degradation on noise margins, delay, and en-ergy. We subsequently propose an alternative scaling strategy and demonstrate significant improvements in noise margins, delay, and energy in sub-Vth circuits. Using both optimized and unoptimized subthreshold device models, we explore the robustness of scaled subthreshold SRAM. We use a simple variability model and find that even small memories become unstable at advanced technology nodes. However, the simple device optimizations suggested in this paper can be used to improve <b>nominal</b> read noise <b>margins</b> by 64 % at the 32 -nm node.

40|$|Inertial {{motion sensors}} in the {{flight control system}} pick up high {{frequency}} signals due to the flexible modes {{in addition to the}} rigid body responses and could lead to instability at the structural frequencies when the rigid body stability augmentation feedback loops are closed. To attenuate the effects of this structural coupling, notch filters are designed and placed in series with the inertial sensors in each of the feedback paths. During the initial phase of control law design and development, aircraft structural response data is generally not available. Therefore, while designing the rigid body control laws, an additional budget is allocated for phase lags introduced by the structural notch filters. Once the structural coupling tests are carried out on the aircraft, structural filters are designed {{in order to meet the}} certification requirements. During developmental flight tests with multiple prototype vehicles there are likely to be variations in the structural response characteristics as the production processes are maturing and also, due to minor updates to the aircraft standard of preparation and addition of different external stores. This calls for the redesign of structural filters and subsequent onboard software development and testing which is a lengthy process. Hence, in order to meet project schedules without compromising safety, the clearance procedure was modified so that it could be efficiently used for flights during the development phase. This paper presents a revised clearance procedure based not only on values of the <b>nominal</b> stability <b>margins,</b> but also on the sensitivity of structural stability margins to the modal frequency perturbation. This change in the clearance philosophy was considered acceptable for the developmental phase of flights but for the final production vehicle standard one would need to strictly follow the MIL-F 9490 D Standard guidelines. This paper discusses the changes carried out to the clearance procedure, the rationale behind the changes made, and also gives directions for future research in robust stabilization of structural modes as well as notch filter design...|$|R
40|$|While {{operating}} at low airspeeds with <b>nominal</b> static <b>margins,</b> the controls on a blended-wing-body aircraft begin to saturate, and the dynamic performance gets sluggish. Augmentation of aerodynamic controls with the propulsion system is therefore considered in this research. Two aspects were of interest: namely, thrust vectoring and flap blowing. An aerodynamic {{model for a}} large blended-wing-body transport aircraft with blown flap effects was formulated using empirical and vortex lattice methods and then integrated with a Trent 500 turbofan engine model. To enhance control effectiveness, both internally and externally blown flaps were simulated. For a full-span internally blown flap arrangement using intermediate compressor flow, the amount of engine bleed and the resulting blowing coefficients were limited. However, even with a reduced bleed mass flow, the pitch control effectiveness increases by 15. 9 % at 85 % fan revolutions per minute. For an externally blown flap arrangement using bypass air, much higher blowing coefficients can be achieved. For instance, at 100 % fan revolutions per minute, there is a 44 % increase in pitch control authority at low dynamic pressures. The main benefit occurs during takeoff, where both thrust vectoring and flap blowing help in achieving early pitch rotation, reducing takeoff field length and liftoff speed considerably. With central flap blowing and a limited thrust vectoring of 10, the liftoff range reduces by 48 %, and liftoff speed reduces by almost 26 %.

40|$|The Blended Wing Body (BWB) {{aircraft}} {{offers a}} number of aerodynamic perfor- mance advantages when compared with conventional configurations. However, while operating at low airspeeds with <b>nominal</b> static <b>margins,</b> the controls on the BWB aircraft begin to saturate and the dynamic performance gets sluggish. Augmenta- tion of aerodynamic controls with the propulsion system is therefore considered in this research. Two aspects were of interest, namely thrust vectoring (TVC) and flap blowing. An aerodynamic model for the BWB aircraft with blown flap effects was formulated using empirical and vortex lattice methods and then integrated with a three spool Trent 500 turbofan engine model. The objectives were to estimate the effect of vectored thrust and engine bleed on its performance and to ascertain the corresponding gains in aerodynamic control effectiveness. To enhance control effectiveness, both internally and external blown flaps were sim- ulated. For a full span internally blown flap (IBF) arrangement using IPC flow, the amount of bleed mass flow and consequently the achievable blowing coefficients are limited. For IBF, the pitch control effectiveness was shown to increase by 18 % at low airspeeds. The associated detoriation in engine performance due to compressor bleed could be avoided either by bleeding the compressor at an earlier station along its ax- ial length or matching the engine for permanent bleed extraction. For an externally blown flap (EBF) arrangement using bypass air, high blowing coefficients are shown to be achieved at 100 % Fan RPM. This results in a 44 % increase in pitch control authority at landing and take-off speeds. The main benefit occurs at take-off, where both TVC and flap blowing help in achieving early pitch rotation, reducing take-off field lengths and lift-off speeds considerably. With central flap blowing and a lim- ited TVC of 10 ◦, the lift-off range reduces by 48 % and lift-off velocity by almost 26 %. For the lateral-directional axis it was shown that both aileron and rudder control powers can be almost doubled at a blowing coefficient of Cu = 0. 2. Increased roll authority greatly helps in achieving better roll response at low speeds, whereas the increased rudder power helps in maintaining flight path in presence of asymmetric thrust or engine failure, otherwise not possible using the conventional winglet rudder.

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to introduce a}} national FuelWatch scheme provides a timely case study of `evidence-based- policy' making in Australia. The government based its decision on econometric work by the ACCC who refuse to release the data. They claim that their analysis is robust {{because it has been}} subject to scrutiny within the ACCC and by Treasury. Experience with `evidence based policy' making in the United Kingdom (UK) raises doubts about such claims. The UK experience led to the term `policy-based-evidence' to describe the end result where government agencies filtered out information that was inconsistent with government policy. The data used by the ACCC can be digitized from a graph in their report. I then use the data so obtained to assess the robustness of the ACCC analysis and econometrics. Since the government and their advisors did not realize that the data could be obtained in this way it provides a `natural experiment' in which their claims can be evaluated and tested. I find that the ACCC apply the wrong tests to the wrong variable. Specifically, they study the <b>nominal</b> retail <b>margin</b> when economic theory suggests that analysis of anything but the real retail margin to producers creates a misspecified model inconsistent with the econometric assumptions used. The econometrics in Appendix S of the ACCC report on petrol is substandard in application of techniques and in reporting of what was done. This should not be seen as an adverse reflection on the econometricians employed by the ACCC. Rather, it is a reflection on the process through which their work is incorporated into reports and used by government. The ACCC findings are not robust. When I apply the correct version of the procedures used by the ACCC to the correct variable I find that the data does not support the original ACCC finding. Specifically, {{it is not possible to}} conclude as the ACCC did that FuelWatch did not raise petrol prices in Western Australia. FuelWatch of itself is unimportant. The important issues here relate to the integrity of the government's `evidence-based' approach to policy. The UK experience clearly shows that relying on the untested opinion of `experts' leads to fudging' of the evidence or overstatement of the conclusions that can be supported by the data. This ultimately corrupts the evidence-based-policy approach. The FuelWatch experience shows that these dangers are present for Australian policy makers. Greater transparency by government, publication of data and analysis underpinning government decisions and independent review of econometric work are the only protections against this danger. Failure to implement these protections will invalidate claims about the evidence base of future policy decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|Estimation and {{simulation}} of sustainable real exchange rates {{in some of}} the new EU accession countries point to potential difficulties in sustaining the ERM 2 regime if entered too soon and with weak policies. According to the estimates, the Czech, Hungarian, and Polish currencies were overvalued in 2003. Simulations, conditional on large-model macroeconomic projections, suggest that under current policies those currencies would be unlikely to stay within the ERM 2 stability corridor during 2004 - 10. In-sample simulations for Greece, Portugal, and Spain indicate both a much smaller misalignment of national currencies prior to ERM 2, and a more stable path of real exchange rates over the medium term than can be expected for the new accession countries.
