He went to the dressing-tent, and on examining his watch was horrified to find that he had just ten minutes in which to do everything, and the walk to the station, he reflected, was a long five minutes. He literally hurled himself into his clothes, and, disregarding the Bargee, who had entered the tent and seemed to wish to continue the discussion at the point where they had left off, shot off towards the gate nearest the station. He had exactly four minutes and twenty-five seconds in which to complete the journey, and he had just run a mile.|$|E

Different protein supplements as well as methods of feeding them on dry bluestem pasture are being tested. Forty head of good quality Hereford yearling steers, four lots, 10 head to a lot, were used in this test. All lots were wintered on dry bluestem pasture. Each lot had sufficient dry grass to winter on; the acreage varied from 6 acres per head for one lot to 19 acres per head for another lot.

40|$|Stocking {{density is}} a {{management}} factor which has critical {{implications for the}} poultry industry. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in an experimental model of necrotic enteritis in broiler chicks. The experimental challenge model included an oral inoculation with 10 -fold dose of attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and multiple oral inoculations with a specific strain of Clostridium perfringens. Two hundred and forty as hatched day-old broiler chicks were randomly allocated to four treatment groups according to the following experimental design: group N, with <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density (15 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group D, with high stocking density (30 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group P, with <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density and positive challenge; and group DP, with high stocking density and positive challenge. From each bird, the intestine, gizzard and liver were collected and scored for gross lesions. The intestinal digesta was collected for pH and viscosity determination. One caecum from each bird was taken for microbiological analysis. The statistical analysis and evaluation of the experimental data revealed significant interaction effects between "stocking density" and "challenge", regarding gross lesion scores in intestine and liver, pH values in jejunum, ileum and caeca as well as C. perfringens counts in the caeca (P <= 0. 05). High stocking density in challenged birds increased the gross lesion score in the intestine (P <= 0. 05), contrary to unchallenged birds. It can be concluded that high stocking density affects unfavourably the welfare and gut health of broiler chicks, predisposes to necrotic enteritis in a subclinical experimental model and increases further its importance as a management factor for the poultry industry...|$|R

50|$|The blesbok was hunted {{nearly to}} {{extinction}} {{because of its}} large numbers, but having been protected since the late 19th century, it has proliferated and today it is sufficiently numerous not to be classed as endangered.

At the start of the 21st century, blesbok numbers are stable, estimated to be around 240,000. However, 97% of them live outside reserves, and only 3% in national parks.

Hicks and Gillett placed what was widely believed to be an unrealistic value on the club in the hope of making a vast profit however, for which they were severely criticised in the House of Commons as [...] "asset strippers draining the club with their greed".

50|$|The player {{generates a}} party of up to three {{characters}}; more characters can be recruited and swapped in and out between modules. Characters are selected by class, which determine equipment type they can use, and race, which grant special bonuses during combat. Each character has a deck of 36 cards which are determined by class, race, and their current equipment. Initially, the amount of equipment each character carries is limited, but as the characters gain experience points, they gain more equipment slots, expanding the abilities through new cards that enter their deck, allowing players to customize their characters. Equipment can only be swapped out between battles, and various stores, with both <b>normal</b> <b>stock</b> and time-limited exclusives, {{can be used to}} buy and sell equipment and treasure at this time. Card Hunter has a microtransaction ability to spend real-world money as to gain access to better loot from the end of encounters or to open prize chests that contain random equipment.

A total 300 Cobb 500 male chicks were placed in cages and stocked as 10 birds/cage (<b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density) and 15 birds/cage (high stocking density).

Recognizing that most capital services are not traded on spot rental markets, we treat the intersectoral mobility of capital as the outgrowth of investment behavior.

We model expected returns by CAPM, and relate "excess" returns in a period to unanticipated shocks to the variables that affect current and future profits.
