5|$|During the Invasion of the Waikato, his militia {{unit was}} mobilised {{and it was}} his conduct at Paterangi, where he rescued British {{soldiers}} under fire, that saw him awarded the VC. He was the first recipient of the VC to be a <b>non-regular</b> soldier. After his military service ended, Heaphy served a term as Member of Parliament for Parnell. From 1870 to 1881, he held a variety of civil service positions but his health declined and he moved to Queensland, in Australia, seeking a better climate in which to recover. He died a few months after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted {{better than}} in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman allowed his <b>non-regular</b> bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, with nobody taking more than four.|$|E

25|$|Tolerance varies for daily, regular {{caffeine}} {{users and}} high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200mg/day {{spread throughout the}} day) {{have been shown to}} produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. <b>Non-regular</b> caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, the 1st {{was in the}} West Indies; {{it moved}} to South Africa in 1884, when it saw action in the Bechuanaland campaign, and {{remained}} there until 1891, when it {{moved back to the}} UK to serve as the depot battalion and the 2nd moved out to India, where it remained until 1909. With the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War, the 1st was quickly earmarked for service in South Africa, and sailed in late 1899. It remained there until 1903, being joined by the 3rd from 1900 to 1902 – the first time a <b>non-regular</b> unit of the regiment had been activated. The bulk of the time in South Africa was spent patrolling and in mobile columns, with neither battalion engaged in any major battles.|$|E
25|$|The {{declaration}} of war against Germany in August 1914 found the North Irish Horse at summer camp, as was its sister regiment, the South Irish Horse. The Expeditionary Force squadron (designated A Squadron) {{under the command of}} Major Lord Cole, consisting of 6 officers and 154 other ranks, along with its counterpart in the South Irish Horse (designated B Squadron) was assigned to the British Expeditionary Force. Both squadrons sailed from Dublin on the SS Architect on 17 August 1914. They were the first <b>non-regular</b> troops to land in France and be in action in the First World War. They were joined shortly afterwards by C Squadron of the North Irish Horse under the command of Major Lord Massereene and Ferrard DSO. Three more squadrons of the 'Horse' were to join the regiment in France landing on 2 May 1915, 17 November 1915 and 11 January 1916. A total of 70 officers and 1,931 men of the regiment went to war between 1914 and 1916.|$|E
25|$|The North Irish Horse is a yeomanry {{unit of the}} British Territorial Army {{raised in}} the {{northern}} counties of Ireland {{in the aftermath of}} the Second Boer War. Raised and patronized by the nobility from its inception to the present day, it was one of the first <b>non-regular</b> units to be deployed to France and the Low Counties with the British Expeditionary Force in 1914 during World War I and fought with distinction both as mounted troops and later as a Cyclist Regiment, achieving 18 battle honours. The regiment was reduced to a single man in the inter war years and re-raised for World War II, when it achieved its greatest distinctions in the North African and Italian campaigns. Reduced again after the Cold War, the regiment's name still exists in B (North Irish Horse) Squadron, the Queen's Own Yeomanry and 69 (North Irish Horse) Signal Squadron (V), part of 32 Signal Regiment.|$|E
500|$|Some writers {{consider}} Mr. Hankey one of {{the most}} easily recognizable and popular of the <b>non-regular</b> South Park characters. His high-pitched greeting, [...] "Howdy-ho", was equally recognizable and became {{one of the}} most quoted lines from the show's first season. Several fan websites were made about the character within months of the episode's broadcast. In January 1998, Entertainment Weekly reported that Comedy Central executives had plans to produce a Mr. Hankey chocolate bar. Larry Lieberman, the channel's vice president of strategic planning and new business development, said a sketch of a Mr. Hankey candy bar was drawn and circulated, but mainly as a joke; he said no serious discussions were held about producing such an item. A stuffed Mr. Hankey became {{one of the most}} popular South Park tie-in products of the 1998 Christmas season.|$|E

Comedy Central censors were concerned about this portrayal of Jesus in South Park, but did not prevent Parker and Stone from following through with it.|$|E
500|$|By May 1881, Heaphy's {{health was}} in severe decline, still {{affected}} by his rheumatism, he caught tuberculosis. He resigned from all his civil service positions {{the following month}} and with his wife, moved to Brisbane, in Queensland, Australia. They hoped the warmer climate would help with Heaphy's health but Heaphy died on 3 August 1881. Survived by his wife (the couple had no children), he was buried at Toowong Cemetery, formerly the Brisbane General Cemetery. His grave, located in Portion 1 of the cemetery, approximately [...] north-east up the hill from the [...] "8th Avenue" [...] roadway, was at first marked with a numbered plaque and became overgrown. A descendant of his wife discovered the burial site in 1960 and a headstone was erected by the New Zealand Government. The inscription reads: He served New Zealand in peace and war as artist, explorer and member of parliament. He was the first <b>non-regular</b> soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
500|$|Nano{{structures}} of arbitrary, <b>non-regular</b> shapes {{are usually}} made using the DNA origami method. [...] These structures {{consist of a}} long, natural virus strand as a [...] "scaffold", which is made to fold into the desired shape by computationally designed short [...] "staple" [...] strands. This method has the advantages of being easy to design, as the base sequence is predetermined by the scaffold strand sequence, and not requiring high strand purity and accurate stoichiometry, as most other DNA nanotechnology methods do. DNA origami was first demonstrated for two-dimensional shapes, such as a smiley face and a coarse map of the Western Hemisphere. Solid three-dimensional structures {{can be made by}} using parallel DNA helices arranged in a honeycomb pattern, and structures with two-dimensional faces can be made to fold into a hollow overall three-dimensional shape, akin to a cardboard box. These can be programmed to open and reveal or release a molecular cargo in response to a stimulus, making them potentially useful as programmable molecular cages.|$|E
500|$|In late 1864, Major General Thomas Galloway, the {{commander}} of the New Zealand colonial forces, recommended Heaphy for the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Paterangi. The recommendation was supported by Sir George Grey (serving a second term as the Governor of New Zealand), despite knowing that Heaphy and another man recommended for the VC, for an action earlier in the campaign, was not in the British Army or Royal Navy. At the time, only personnel from the regular British military could be awarded the VC and thus Heaphy, as a militiaman, was not eligible. Grey argued that as Heaphy was under the effective command of British officers he should be made an exception. In London, the authorities disagreed and the recommendation was turned down. Heaphy refused to accept this and began to agitate, with support from Grey, Havelock, and General Duncan Cameron, commander of British forces in New Zealand, with the British government. He was eventually successful and on 8 February 1867, Queen Victoria made a declaration that the local forces of New Zealand would be eligible for the VC. That day, the award of a VC to Heaphy, the first to a New Zealander and also to a <b>non-regular</b> soldier, was gazetted. The citation read: ...|$|E
500|$|Contemporary critics {{believed}} that Fender's handling {{of a limited}} bowling side while Surrey captain in the 1920s, and his achievements in taking the county to [...] high positions in the County Championship, made him the best captain in England. Teammates and opponents praised his captaincy skills, and described him as the best [...] they had known. His Times obituary stated: [...] " [...] was a sharp captain, quick to observe the slightest opportunity of advantage and ready to gamble {{on his ability to}} exploit it. His keen eye for weakness in an opponent and ability to extract and employ the best powers of his own players caused him often, and with reason, to be described as the best county captain who never captained England. No more flexible thinker on cricket ever lived." [...] Always willing to take risks in order to win, Fender's main objective was to surprise the opposition; legends grew of his successful ploys. Prior to Fender, few county captains displayed tactical imagination; Fender inspired his teams to play forceful, entertaining cricket which made him and his Surrey team very popular. His leadership was often specifically commented on by the press, an unusual occurrence in county cricket reports. In particular, his declarations often were the subject of attention and controversy—he often declared, contrary to orthodox tactics at the time, before his side had built up a big lead or even before they reached the opposition's first innings total. One of his favoured approaches was for the batsmen in the lower middle-order to hit out at the bowling, no matter the state of the match; if successful, the team either quickly consolidated a position of strength or regained the initiative if earlier batsmen had failed. Fender also used <b>non-regular</b> bowlers in an attempt to unsettle batsmen. His innovative approach included the introduction of [...] caps with larger peaks to shade his players' eyes from the sun, and he recruited a baseball coach to improve their throwing.|$|E

2500|$|The captain decides {{when each}} bowler will bowl.

If the regular bowlers are not achieving the desired results, the captain may decide to use <b>non-regular</b> bowlers to attempt to unsettle the batsmen.

Mao rejected Stalin's position and on 21 April, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On 23 April they captured the KMT's capital, Nanjing. [...] The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to Taiwan on December 10. [...] By late 1949 the People's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet was left. In addition, the Ili Rebellion was a Soviet-backed revolt by the Second East Turkestan Republic against the KMT from 1944–49, as the Mongolians in the People's Republic were in a border dispute with the Republic of China. A Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Cavalry, was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the Pei-ta-shan Incident.|$|E

50|$|Another study {{examined}} how the AIM relates {{to a specific}} type of risk behavior: gambling. It investigated how mood affects an individual's sustained inclination to gamble, especially among <b>non-regular</b> gamblers. The researchers separated regular and <b>non-regular</b> gamblers and measured how their moods affected their experiences on the gaming floor. Specifically, they expected <b>non-regular</b> gamblers in a good mood to be more persistent than <b>non-regular</b> gamblers in a bad mood. This is because gambling, when it is a new and unfamiliar experience, complete with the bright lights and colors that are a feature of the average casino, requires {{a great deal of information}} processing, making it especially unattractive to someone in a bad mood. Their research confirmed this notion, but in addition, it was used to positively identify depression as a causal factor of addictive gambling, when the casino has become a familiar environment.|$|E
