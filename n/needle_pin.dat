50|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} is a syndrome characterised by tingling burning and pain (<b>needle,</b> <b>pin)</b> {{through the course}} of median nerve particularly over the outer fingers and radiating up the arm, that is caused by compression of the carpal tunnel contents. It is associated with repetitive use, rheumatoid arthritis, {{and a number of other}} states. It can be detected using Tinel's sign and the Phalen maneuver. It may be treated non-surgically by splinting and/or corticosteroid injection, though definitive management often requires surgical division of the flexor retinaculum, which forms the roof of the carpal tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Badges {{were made}} of pressed steel, brass and zinc. All {{versions}} of the Wound Badge were worn on the lower left breast of the uniform or tunic. The badge was worn below all other awards on the left. It ranked lower than combat badges. There were 24 approved manufacturers of the Wound Badge. At first, the Wound Badge in Black was stamped from sheet brass, painted semi-matte black with a hollow reverse pin back attachment or of solid construction. From 1942, steel was {{used to make the}} badges. The Wound Badge in silver was made (before 1942) from silver-plated brass, and (after 1942) from lacquered zinc, and had a solid reverse with either a <b>needle</b> <b>pin</b> or a broad flat pin bar. The Wound Badge in Gold was a gilded version of the Wound Badge in Silver. In 1957, a revised version of the Wound Badge was authorised for wear; however, the previous type could still be worn if the swastika were removed (for example by grinding).|$|E
5000|$|While most spikes {{are between}} 3/16 inch (5 mm) and 1/2 inch (12 mm) long, {{the most common}} is 1/4 inch (6 mm). Additionally, there are various {{specialty}} lengths, as well as minimal [...] "blank" [...] spikes (also called studs) used to cover a spike well. Spikes are generally metal or ceramic and come in three main types: the pyramid, the <b>needle</b> (<b>pin),</b> and the compression tier (Christmas tree). Pyramids are conical spikes that taper to a sharp point. They normally have a maximum diameter nearly equal to {{the diameter of the}} threads of the spike. Needles also have a sharp point, but a thinner cone diameter. Track spikes create traction by penetrating the track surface. Some tracks do not allow pin spikes and limit the length of pyramid spikes to minimize damage to the track. A variation for synthetic tracks is the Christmas tree spike. It uses a terraced cone shape with a flat end to compress rather than penetrate the track below it and use the track's reaction force to return energy to the runner, increasing the runner's speed. Since it does not penetrate the track surface, it reduces wear on the track. Since the end is flat rather than pointed, it is less harmful to other runners in the event of being [...] "spiked." [...] Lastly, there are Tartan spikes that are dull that are most commonly used for rubber tracks.|$|E

5000|$|On 7 January 1868 W. Avery & Son {{patented}} {{their first}} brass needle case in Great Britain, #58, a flat single packet case named The Golden Needle Case. By November {{that same year}} they patented the Quadruple Casket which contained slots for four different sized needle packets. Two years later in 1870, the Quadruple Casket and a Demi-Quad needle case were also patented in the United States. [...] Within eight years the firm had created at least twenty-seven needle case designs, mostly figural, which were displayed at the London (1873), Vienna (1873) [...] and Paris exhibitions. In 1875, the company was highly praised not only for their quality and workmanship, {{but also for the}} artistic appeal of their needle cases which were mentioned in exhibition reports sent to the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. [...] Several years later in 1878, W. Avery & Son appeared in an exhibition catalogue as needle and pin manufacturers and inventors from Headless Cross, and <b>needle,</b> <b>pin</b> and needle case manufacturers from 192 Great Hampton Row in Birmingham. By the time the Liverpool Exhibition opened in 1886, the firm had added at least 30 more designs to their repertoire, including a souvenir Quadruple Casket needle case with a drawing of the exhibition hall embossed on its exterior. During the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887 their booth was noted for another invention, a machine that could stick pins in rows of paper. A year later the firm won a gold medal for their participation in the 1888 World’s Fair in Brussels. [...] At the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris the W. Avery & Son booth displayed needles, pins and fancy pin and needle cases, as well as the machinery for sticking pins into paper. Also for sale in their booth that year was a new brass needle case {{in the shape of the}} Eiffel Tower, a miniature scale replica of the exhibition’s main attraction, the architectural masterpiece of French structural engineer Gustave Eiffel.|$|E

40|$|Hermetically sealing a {{gas tank}} and opening it into tubing under {{telecommand}} {{control is a}} function required in various space instruments. There {{are a number of}} space valves that are power saving, withstand vibration, and do not contaminate the gas. But none of them combines these features with low mass and the ability to withstand temperatures of 130 C during the sterilization process mandatory for planetary missions. In this paper, a novel miniature valve is presented, which is particularly adapted to space applications. It is electrically actuated, utilizing a bimetallic snap-disc that pierces a metallic membrane by a <b>needle</b> <b>pin,</b> thereby opening the valve. The design of this single-shot valve is such that it allows it to withstand a temperature of 130 C and a pressure of 50 bars.

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} numerical {{study on}} the flow and heat transfer characteristics over a rotating disk with bottom wall subjected to uniform heat flux was conducted {{with the use of}} RNG k-ε turbulent model. And some experiments were also made for validation. The effects of rotating angular speed and pin configuration on the temperature maps and convective heat transfer charac-teristics on rotating surface are analyzed. As the increase of rotating velocity, the impingement of pumping jet on the centre of rotating disk became stronger and the transition from laminar to turbu-lent occurred at the outer radius of rotating disk, which resulted in heat transfer enhancement. The pins on the disk made the pumping action of a rotating disk weaker. Simultaneously, they also acted as disturbing elements to the cyclone flow near the rotating disk surface, which made the overall heat transfer to be enhanced. Under the same extend areas of different pins, <b>needle</b> <b>pin</b> has higher convective heat transfer capacity than the discrete ring pin...|$|E

The results of samples associated with corn that were submitted from 2000 through 2010 were summarized. One or more genera of plant-parasitic nematodes {{were found in}} 92 % of the samples. Spiral nematode and root-lesion nematode were most commonly found. Other nematodes recovered were dagger, lance, <b>needle,</b> <b>pin,</b> ring, and stunt nematodes. Nematodes recovered at damaging population densities were dagger, needle, ring, and spiral nematodes. An average of 15 samples were submitted per year from 2000 to 2004. Sample numbers increased nearly threefold since 2005, but overall sample numbers were low every year from 2000 through 2010. Samples were received from 53 of the 99 Iowa counties, and most samples were received in June and July, which is the recommended sampling time. Nematodes that {{have been associated with}} corn in Iowa in the past that were not recovered from the samples were sheath, sting, and stubby-root nematodes. The methods used to extract the nematodes from soil and roots and how the samples were handled during collection and processing may have affected the species and population densities recovered.

Preparation (set up) is done by pulling at the fabric of the floor and fixes the fabric to pin multiple times at a certain distance. From this background, this study aims to evaluate the work set up drying on the grounding {{to reduce the risk of}} injury or operator fatigue and how to reduce product defects that occur. The next goal is to repair the fabric drying remove the grounding process. The method used to meet the goals of this research is the Nordic Body Map method used to determine the complaints experienced by the operator by means of interviewing the operator about any posture that have complaints. Making the design tools is also proposed in an effort to make improvements to the drying fabric grounding process results. In order to know the criteria for tools that can meet the needs of the operator by using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) / House of Quality (HOQ) and anthropometric data. The tools are made to reduce the activity of the operator bent when performing the drying process. These do not need to lift the fabric from the grounding process to the drying process. The proposed tool also reduces the fabric touching the floor, so that the fabric does not become dirty, which is one form of disability. <b>Needle</b> <b>pin</b> that is used to associate the fabric when drying was changed to clamp, so that the fabric is not perforated or torn.
