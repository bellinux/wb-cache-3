40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} of bifunctional Δ 12 /ω 3 desaturases from Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium graminearum, and Magnaporthe grisea. The bifunctional activity of these desaturases distinguishes them from all known Δ 12 or ω 3 fatty acid desaturases. The ω 3 desaturase activity of these enzymes also shows a broad ω 6 fatty acid substrate specificity by their ability to convert linoleic acid (LA), γ-linolenic acid, di-homo-γ-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid to the ω 3 fatty acids, α-linolenic acid (ALA), stearidonic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ω 3 desaturases arose by independent gene duplication events from a Δ 12 desaturase ancestor. Expression of F. moniliforme Δ 12 /ω 3 desaturase resulted in high ALA content in both Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast naturally deficient in ω 3 desaturation, and soybean. In soybean, seed-specific expression resulted in 70. 9 weight percent of total fatty acid (%TFA) ALA in a transformed seed compared with 10. 9 %TFA in a <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> seed and 53. 2 %TFA in the current best source of ALA, linseed oil. The ALA/LA ratio in transformed seed was 22. 3, a 110 - and 7 -fold improvement over the <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> seed and linseed oil, respectively. Thus, these desaturases have potential for producing nutritionally desirable ω 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as EPA, with a significantly improved ratio of ω 3 /ω 6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in both oilseeds and oleaginous microbes...|$|E

Previously, transgenic barley with constitutive CaMV 35 S expression of AVP 1, a gene encoding the type I Arabidopsis vacuolar proton-pumping pyrophosphatase (H⁺-PPase), had a larger shoot biomass in non-saline and saline conditions compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants.</b> However, the growth and grain yield of the transgenic AVP 1 barley was yet to be evaluated in a saline field. It was also yet to be investigated whether the larger shoot biomass of transgenic AVP 1 barley in both non-saline and saline conditions arose from a change in tissue solute accumulation, water use, plant nutrition, carbohydrate metabolism, heterotrophic growth {{or a combination of}} these traits. In addition, for this AVP 1 technology to be applicable for barley grain growers, a commercially relevant transgenic AVP 1 barley cultivar with well-regulated control of AVP 1 expression was needed. The first focus of this project evaluated the growth and grain yield of 35 S:AVP 1 barley (cv. Golden Promise) in a low and high salinity field near Kunjin, Western Australia. Field trial results validated greenhouse-based findings of improved shoot biomass in transgenic AVP 1 barley compared to wild-type. Furthermore, results demonstrated {{for the first time that}} transgenic AVP 1 barley had increased grain yield per plant compared to wild-type in a field with high salinity. These findings suggest that transgenic AVP 1 barley is a promising option to help increase the grain yield of cereal crops in a saline field. The second focus of this project investigated the abiotic stress tolerance and potential factors contributing to the larger shoot biomass of 35 S:AVP 1 barley. At low phosphorus (P) supply, 35 S:AVP 1 barley had a larger shoot biomass, greater root P uptake and increased rhizosphere acidification compared to wild-type. At low nitrate (NO₃⁻) supply, two 35 S:AVP 1 barley lines had increased shoot biomass but with no difference in NO₃⁻ uptake capacity compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants.</b> The shoot biomass of 35 S:AVP 1 barley was also increased compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants</b> under low water availability and low water availability concurrent with salinity. Furthermore, an increase in plant biomass from 6 days after seed imbibition, thus seedling vigour, was detectable in 35 S:AVP 1 barley compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants.</b> Leaf metabolites involved in ascorbic acid synthesis were also significantly altered in the 35 S:AVP 1 barley compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants.</b> Collectively, these findings suggest that a combination of traits is contributing to the improved growth of transgenic AVP 1 barley. The third focus of this project evaluated the salt stress inducibility of the ZmRab 17 promoter and investigated the salinity tolerance of commercially relevant barley (cv. WI 4330) expressing AVP 1 via the ZmRab 17 and the constitutive ZmUbi 1 promoter. The ZmRab 17 promoter was salt-stress inducible in barley root stelar cells with basal transgene expression in non-saline conditions. However, the shoot and root biomass of ZmRab 17 :AVP 1 and ZmUbi 1 :AVP 1 barley did not differ to wild-type and <b>null</b> <b>segregants</b> in saline conditions. These findings suggest that the type of promoter driving AVP 1 expression in transgenic barley is an important factor. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Here, we describe the effect of biochemically active, overexpressed thioredoxin h on germination and the onset of α-amylase activity. Relative to <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> controls lacking the transgene, homozygotes overexpressing thioredoxin h effected (i) an acceleration {{in the rate of}} germination and appearance of α-amylase activity with a 1. 6 - to 2. 8 -fold increase in gibberellin A 1 (GA 1) content; (ii) a similar acceleration in the appearance of the α-amylase activity in deembryonated transgenic grain incubated with gibberellic acid; (iii) a 35 % increase in the ratio of relative reduction (abundance of SH) of the propanol soluble proteins (hordein I fraction); and (iv) an increase in extractable and soluble protein of 5 – 12 % and 11 – 35 %, respectively. Thioredoxin h, which was highly reduced in the dry grain, was degraded in both the <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> and homozygote after imbibition. The increase in α-amylase activity and protein reduction status was accompanied by a shift in the distribution of protein from the insoluble to the soluble fraction.

40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of yield loss in {{agricultural}} crop production worldwide. Numerous attempts have been made to produce salinity tolerant crops by manipulating the expression of genes involved in ion transport; yet, the reported results are often rather controversial. In this work, Arabidopsis AtNHX 1 gene encoding vacuolar Na?/H? exchanger was introduced into barley (Horduem vulgare L. cv. Golden Promise) plants grown under saline conditions. Transgenic plants were compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants</b> for biomass, water content, gas exchange, and Na? and K? content of the leaf. It was shown that most of the lines expressing AtNHX 1 have no significant difference to <b>null</b> <b>segregants,</b> suggesting the lack of beneficial effect of expressing the AtNHX 1 gene in barley, at least under our experimental conditions. The lack of phenotype might be explained by: (1) low level of activity of vacuolar H?-inorganic pyrophosphatase and vacuolar H?-ATPase resulting in an insufficient proton gradient required for the vacuolar Na?/H? exchanger; (2) the inability of transgenic plants to prevent a passive leak of sodium via Na? permeable slow activating and fast activating channels; (3) insufficient ATP pool to support H? pumping activity; and (4) the fact that the AtNHX 1 protein might not been properly folded, inactive or incorrectly targeted. Overall, this study suggests that, while targeting vacuolar Na? sequestration, at least several genes need to be pyramided to ensure the efficiency of the above process. Getnet D. Adem, Stuart J.

This protein, localized to the plasma membrane of root stelar cells, has its expression reduced by salt or ABA, which are key predictions for a protein involved with loading Cl– into the root xylem. Artificial microRNA knockdown mutants of AtSLAH 1 had significantly reduced shoot Cl− accumulation when grown under low Cl–, whereas shoot Cl– increased and the shoot nitrate/chloride ratio decreased following AtSLAH 1 constitutive or stelar-specific overexpression when grown in high Cl–.

Genetic transformation provides a tool to introduce new genes without altering the original gene combinations.

The agronomic performance of 50 transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines containing additional copies of native or modified high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes and the selectable marker bar, their untransformed parent 'Bobwhite', four lines containing only bar, and 10 <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> lines were assessed in small plot trials over 2 yr and three locations.

Despite the overall lower performance of the transgenic lines, many with agronomic performance equivalent to Bobwhite were identified.

Florida and L 88 - 31 via particle bombardment, using the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (pat) gene as a selectable marker. All six independent transgenic wheat lines recovered expressed the GST- 27 gene. T 1 progeny of these wheat lines were germinated on solid medium containing the chloroacetanilide herbicide alachlor, and tolerance to this herbicide was correlated with GST- 27 expression levels.

40|$|Acid soils limit {{crop yields}} {{around the world}} due to {{nutrient}} deficiencies and mineral toxicities. Non-adapted plants grown on acid soils typically have shorter and thicker root systems because high concentrations of soluble aluminium (Al 3 +) inhibit root elongation. This restricts their ability to acquire water and nutrients. An important mechanism of Al 3 + resistance discovered in many plant species relies on the release of organic anions from roots. The gene controlling this trait are members of two gene families called the aluminium activated malate transporter (ALMT) family and multidrug and toxic compound exudation (MATE) family. Members of the ALMT family encode anion channels which release malate anions from roots while the MATEs encode co-transporter proteins which facilitate citrate release from roots. Although barley (Hordeum vulgare) is more sensitive to Al 3 + toxicity than many other cereals including wheat (Triticum aestivum), rye (Secale cereale) and rice (Oryza sativa) significant genotypic variation in resistance does occur. This variation is controlled by citrate efflux from the root apices which is encoded by a MATE gene called HvAACT 1. In this study three MATE genes from barley, Arabidopsis and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were transformed into the Al 3 +- sensitive barley cultivar ‘Golden Promise’ with a constitutive promoter. These genes include the major Al 3 +-resistance genes from barley and sorghum (HvAACT 1 and SbMATE respectively) and the Frd 3 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana which is important for iron nutrition. All three are known to encode transport proteins that facilitate citrate efflux from cells. The resulting transgenic lines were assessed for transgene expression, citrate efflux from root apices, and Al 3 + resistance in hydroponic solution and acid soil. The control plants included in these experiments were <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> lines and the parental barley cultivar. The Al 3 +-resistant barley cultivar Dayton was also included as a positive control. Barley cultivar “Golden Promise” was transformed separately with the MATE genes using the Agrobacterium method. Several independent T 2 or T 3 barley lines homozygous for each transgene were generated as well as <b>null</b> <b>segregant</b> lines. The transgenic lines released significantly more citrate from their root apices than the null controls. Plants expressing the HvAACT 1 and SbMATE genes required Al 3 + in the external solution to activate citrate efflux while plants expressing Frd 3 released citrate in the presence and absence of Al 3 +. This {{is consistent with previous}} studies showing that HvAACT 1 and SbMATE are Al 3 +-activated proteins. The citrate efflux from the transgenic lines was similar to, or greater than, the efflux detected from cv. Dayton. Transgenic and control seedlings were grown in an aerated hydroponic culture containing a simple nutrient solution with 0, 1, 2, or 4 μM AlCl 3 (pH 4. 3). Net root growth was measured after 4 d. Relative root growth (growth in the Al 3 + solution relative to control solution) was significantly greater in the transgenic lines than the null controls for most Al 3 + treatments and similar results were obtained for the three MATE genes. The Al 3 + resistance of the transgenic lines was similar to the Al 3 + resistance of cv. Dayton. Al 3 + resistance of the transgenic and control lines was also assessed in short-term soil experiments. The acidic ferrosol was either unamended (pH 4. 33 with aluminium being 21...|$|E

The expression of AVP 1, an Arabidopsis gene encoding a vacuolar proton pumping pyrophosphatase (H⁺-PPase), {{has been shown to}} improve the salinity tolerance of transgenic plants in greenhouse conditions. However, the potential for this gene to improve the grain yield of cereal crops in a saline field has yet to be evaluated. Recent advances in high-throughput nondestructive phenotyping technologies also offer an opportunity to quantitatively evaluate the growth of transgenic plants under abiotic stress through time. In this study, the growth of transgenic barley expressing AVP 1 was evaluated under saline conditions in a pot experiment using nondestructive plant imaging and in a saline field trial. Greenhouse-grown transgenic barley expressing AVP 1 produced a larger shoot biomass compared to <b>null</b> <b>segregants,</b> as determined by an increase in projected shoot area, when grown in soil with 150 mM NaCl. This increase in shoot biomass of transgenic AVP 1 barley occurred from an early growth stage and also in nonsaline conditions. In a saline field, the transgenic barley expressing AVP 1 also showed an increase in shoot biomass and, importantly, produced a greater grain yield per plant compared to wild-type plants. Interestingly, the expression of AVP 1 did not alter barley leaf sodium concentrations in either greenhouse- or field-grown plants. This study validates our greenhouse-based experiments and indicates that transgenic barley expressing AVP 1 is a promising option for increasing cereal crop productivity in saline fields. Rhiannon K.

Through genetic segregation, <b>null</b> <b>segregants</b> carrying only the desired mutant alleles without the CRISPR transgene could be generated in T 1 progeny. Inheritance of an active CRISPR/Cas 9 transgene leads to additional target-specific mutations in subsequent generations. Duplex infection of immature embryos by mixing two individual Agrobacterium strains harbouring different Cas 9 /gRNA modules can be performed for improved cost efficiency. Together, the findings demonstrate that the ISU Maize CRISPR platform is an effective and robust tool to targeted mutagenesis in maize...|$|R
