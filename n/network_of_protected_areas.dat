At low population densities, characteristic of threatened populations, this procedure selects networks that maximize the growth rate <b>of</b> the overall <b>network.</b> This method offers an improved link between connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. Our framework is applied to connectivities estimated for marine larvae and demonstrates that, for open populations, the best strategy is to <b>protect</b> <b>areas</b> acting as both strong donors and recipients of recruits. It should be possible to implement an EPT framework for connectivity analysis into existing holistic tools for design <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
