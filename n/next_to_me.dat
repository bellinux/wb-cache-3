The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. Vulović was celebrated as a national hero and decorated by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song in her honour, titled Vesna stjuardesa ("Vesna the Stewardess"). She continued to fly regularly and stated that fellow passengers were surprised to see her on flights. [...] "People always want to sit <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on the plane," [...] she remarked.|$|E

500|$|Walton of The Moving Picture News, who {{typically}} praised Thanhouser films, deviated {{from the norm}} by immediately dismissing the film as a whole by stating, [...] "This theme is getting threadbare; a foreign film is almost identical. The son's wife acts brutally to her husband's mother; things are set right by a child. Compare Gaumont's Twilight of a Soldier's Life, etc. The acting of the child is charming, and of the old lady a womanly concept – even to details. The wife's grabbing the old lady's bag, umbrella, etc. was, as one said who sat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'a bit too rushed. This criticism of the theme was accurate because the Gaumont Film Company release had a nearly identical plot except that that [...] "grandma" [...] was an elderly soldier. The similarities between the two films likely are coincidental because the Gaumont film was released four days prior.|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} began Gordon-Cumming {{discussed}} the tapestry with Wilson, commenting {{that the different}} colours of the cloth {{made it difficult to}} see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the [...] system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered [...] "My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!" [...] further explaining that [...] "the man <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is cheating!" [...] After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson [...] "this is too hot". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Stanley Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.|$|E

2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E

[...] She explained further that she heard [...] "terrifying screaming" [...] and that she had [...] "never heard anything like that". [...] Kowalski believed that she was witnessing a child abduction. [...] She also identified the car as a Camaro but stated the color as blue (rather than green). [...] She stated that she had made eye contact with the driver after which [...] "a hand came up and started banging on the passenger window". [...] Since she had crossed the county line into Charlotte, the call was routed to Charlotte County's 9-1-1 call center. [...] It was only after she saw the news the following day that she realized she had witnessed the abduction of Lee rather than that of a child. [...] When she called the North Port Police Department to explain who she was and that she had made a 9-1-1 call, it became apparent that the call had not been forwarded to the correct authorities. [...] It is this call that is alleged to have been mishandled {{due to the fact that}} the operatives neglected to file it correctly.

She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke.
