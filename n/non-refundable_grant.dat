40|$|The study {{assessed}} the participatory role of community involvement {{in line with}} the achievement of the National conservation goals. This entails the use of active involvement of local people in park planning formation, executing and implementing management strategies of renewable resources and its environment. Data were collected from parks annual reports, park management plan, research and information units and environ-consult reports. The global environmental facility (GEF) through the local empowerment programme (LEEMP) provides a <b>non-refundable</b> <b>grant</b> while the World Bank with assistant of the internal development association (IDA) provides a refundable credit facility for local communities. This financial supports was aimed at providing alternative means of livelihood for the rural people in the community and alleviate the poverty. The attention was diverted from wanton and illegal exploitation of natural resources within the locality. The first stage considered ten communities selected from the Borgu sector and the second stage also has ten communities selected as well for their financial assistance. Constraints observed in the implementation of the programme includes lack of project vehicle, computer system and accessories, frequent changes in programme design and directives, lack of confidence in project administration, remoteness of the communities and lateness in release of the micro-projects fund. Successful implementation of the programme requires sound management and supervision of the project time frame...|$|E
25|$|Student Allowances, {{which are}} <b>non-refundable</b> <b>grants</b> to {{students}} of limited means, are means tested and the weekly amount granted depends on residential and citizenship qualifications, age, location, marital status, dependent {{children as well}} as personal, spousal or parental income. The allowance is intended for living expenses, so most students receiving an allowance will still need a student loan to pay for their tuition fees.|$|R
40|$|In this study, I {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} offering two large <b>non-refundable</b> <b>grants</b> to low-income Canadian youth on postsecondary attendance. The grants had two interesting features. First, they were clawed back from loans, thus reducing costs but providing no additional liquidity. Second, the grants were only available to students if parental income was below a fixed threshold. This sharp discontinuity in the offer of the grants provides for near ideal conditions to study their causal impact, closely mimicking random assignment. Despite the large size of the grants (up to $ 6, 000 or $ 7, 000), the fact that students were automatically assessed for the grants with their regular student loans application, and evidence that most Canadian youth are at least aware of <b>non-refundable</b> study <b>grant</b> opportunities, I find that the grants had no impact on postsecondary or university attendance. Some policy implications are discussed. Access to postsecondary, student debt...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to present the EU policies, how they relate with Member States and with its partners, the multiculturalism has never been an impediment, but it has made it special, mentioning here the economic level, where the Union has the highest GDP per capita in the world. Our intention is to present the components of globalization, a phenomenon that {{is the basis for}} the European Union and the sudden evolution of Romania in the recent years. Romania was integrated in the globalization process and took advantage of all the benefits of this engine of the modern world. The result lies in a better understanding of EU policies and its effects on the Romanian economy. In this paper we have achieved an analysis of <b>non-refundable</b> <b>grants</b> offered by the European Union for the period 2007 - 20013 and how they helped the industrial and social development of Romania. The added value of the scientific interpretation of the Romanian situation at economic level is highlighted by the beneficial influence of the European space, opening towards a global market and the original approach in economic terms of the development analysis and participation in the globalization process...|$|R
40|$|Since {{at least}} the 1970 s, Israel has been benefiting hugely from the {{so-called}} "special relationship" with the United States. The US provides the Jewish state with considerable financial aid which reached $ 3 billion annually {{in the form of}} <b>non-refundable</b> <b>grants</b> in the 1990 s. America also supplies Israel with modern military systems and American companies cooperate with their Israeli counterparts in developing new weapons, devices etc. US representatives also protect Israel from major diplomatic failures at the international forums like the UN. Some people believe that the American support for Israel is driven by moral imperatives, as Israel constitutes a shelter for the minority which experienced hundreds-of- years lasting hatred, with its ultimate expression being the Holocaust. This argument further states that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and therefore it presents a natural choice for an ally of the United States. Others argue that Israel is an indispensable strategic asset, necessary for maintaining the American presence and securing the American interests in the region. However, all these points can be refuted. The often emphasized moral aspect omits the painful issue of Palestinian refugees forced out by Jewish forces in 1948 - 1949 and continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the origin of a family farm. By {{creating}} a business plan and issues connected with it, its priority is an organic poultry farm, which will produce poultry meat and eggs. Another service beyond the farm production will be creating conditions for a developing branch, which is agro-tourism and other services related to {{the operation of the}} farm, so that it leads to the economic development and profit. The farm will arise by rebuilding of an old house with a large barn and adjacent 10 ha of lands inherited from grandparents. There will be built a multi-purpose building called the poultry farm from which the poultry will have access to pasture. The property includes another 1 ha of forest from which the wood will be used as a building material and firewood. The work is divided into two parts: theoretical and practical. The theoretical part especially focuses on explaining the concepts that are important to understand the business plan. Then there is the legislation concerning the organic farming, a tangle of laws, public notices and regulations that must be followed {{in order to meet the}} conditions for the organic farming. An integral motivational service of the country and the European Union for farmers and not only for those who are environmentally-managing farmers, is support and grants for the years 2014 - 2020. A very important step not only for the starting farmers is a market analysis in the given branch, as well as a SWOT analysis that will show us the positive and negative aspects of the business. The conclusion of this section deals not only with the concept of agro-tourism, but also with its market position as well and possibilities of its use and further development. In the practical part there is a description of a business plan and individual periods of the project including financing. Finances will flow from own and foreign capital, or the possibility to apply for support through <b>non-refundable</b> <b>grants.</b> The establishment of the farm will have an impact on the labor market, as there will be 5 newly created jobs and the community will fit into the wider public awareness thanks to the activities that the farm will develop for the purpose of product promotion and further development. Furthermore, there are itemized individual items that lead to the final evaluation of the effectiveness of the business plan. By processing the theoretical and practical part of the thesis the requirement of the thesis objective is met - to design a prosperous family farm focused on poultry keeping with a hypothesis if it is currently possible to be competitive while importing poultry meat and eggs from abroad. It can be concluded that the business plan is viable...|$|R
