The social goals of the plans were improving health and education as well as encouraging equitable income distribution. Although each plan had different development priorities, the allocation of resources did not always reflect these priorities. The first four plans concentrated on infrastructure—to {{make it possible to}} facilitate the movement of goods and services—and to increase the size of the market. Each of the five-year plans depended heavily on foreign assistance in the forms of grants and loans.

40|$|Background: Reproductive years {{represent}} a major proportion of women‟s life. This review focuses on recommended nutritional considerations, physical activity pattern {{as well as}} the effect of nutrition education (NE) on behavior modification and health outcomes of women of reproductive age using either single-level, multiple-level or community-level interventions. Methods: For this narrative review, numerous searches were conducted on databases of PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar search engine using the keywords women, reproductive age, NE, interventions, community-based. Results: Even though single intervention is effective, multiple intervention programmes in addition to behavior modification components are even more successful in terms of modified behaviors and health outcomes. Moreover, community based interventions using multilevel strategies are further useful for improved health outcomes and behavior modification. Conclusion: NE programmes have been effective in positive behavior modifi-cation measured in terms of eating pattern and health quality. Thus, it is recommended that health professionals use multiple intervention strategies at community level to ensure improved outcomes. Political support is also required to create culturally sensitive methods of delivering <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes.</b> Finally, as policy is dependent on program cost, <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes</b> need to combine methods of cost analysis to show cost effectiveness of supplying adequate nutrition for women throughout the lifecycle...|$|R

A review of literature demonstrated that, within the developmental framework, the point of view of civil society, government and the academia on the school feeding programmes are a valuable strategy to intervene in the nutritional and cognitive development of learners. It also made it evident that there are diverse views as to whether the School Feeding Programme is achieving its intended objectives. The findings of this study suggest that, although the programme has the potential to improve nutrition and health, enrolment, attendance and cognitive development, there are still some challenges and areas that need to be addressed and improved. These challenges arise as a result of lack of effective monitoring and evaluation, geographical location of the schools and other implementation flaws.

40|$|Nodding {{syndrome}} {{has affected}} {{and led to}} the deaths of {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 in Northern Uganda since 2009. There is no reliable explanation of the disease, and currently the only treatment is through a <b>nutritional</b> <b>programme</b> of vitamins, combined with medication to prevent symptoms. In the absence of a proper medical treatment, we develop a dynamic compartmental model to plan the management of the syndrome and to curb its effects. We use incidence data from 2012 and 2013 from Pader, Lamwo and Kitgum regions of Uganda to parameterize the model. The model is then used to look at how to best plan the <b>nutritional</b> <b>programme</b> in terms of first getting children on to the programme through outreach, and then making sure they remain on the programme, through follow-up. For the current outbreak of nodding disease, we estimate that about half of available resources should be put into outreach. We show how to optimize the balance between outreach and follow-up in this particular example, and provide a general methodology for allocating resources in similar situations. Given the uncertainty of parameter estimates in such situations, we perform a robustness analysis to identify the best investment strategy. Our analysis offers a way of using available data to determine the best investment strategy of controlling nodding syndrome. Författarna delar förstaförfattarskapet. </p...|$|E

This {{makes it possible to}} identify priorities, sensitize policy-makers, establish political commitment and design appropriate community pro-grammes for income generation and education for the best use of food resources. Experiences acquired from community-based <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes</b> show that ownership of a programme by the community and using a tailor-made approach are essential factors in the successful implementation of programmes. A multi-faceted approach is needed, involving a range of sectors—agriculture, commerce, education and health— and commitment at all levels from government to communities and individuals...|$|R

The evaluation sample of the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL) is unique in having four different treatment types, which are randomly assigned to four different groups of localities, with one group designated to receive transfers but without any requirement to attend health and nutrition courses. We find that attendance at educational sessions does not affect drinking and smoking behaviour, but significantly reduces the probability of having a large waist circumference among women. We provide evidence that attending health and nutrition related courses determines a large drop in the probability that adult women have excessive calorie intake. The results suggest that lack of information can explain, at least in part, the impressive rise in female obesity in developing countries.

In Northern Albania child malnutrition is a public health priority. As the main risk factor for underweight we found a recent history of diarrhoea (OR = 2. 45) together with female gender (OR = 2. 28), rural (OR = 2. 09) or mountain (OR = 1. 61) residency.

Aim: To test {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>nutritional</b> counselling <b>programme</b> in improving <b>nutritional</b> behaviours, knowledge and status, physical activity and health-related quality of life in a general population. Methods: In the period between January–December 2007, we studied the application of the <b>nutritional</b> counselling <b>programme</b> (NCP) developed by Local Health Agency 10 (Florence-Italy). We compared, diet, nutritional knowledge, physical activity, health related quality of life (measured by SF 36 questionnaire), body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference before and after a two months intensive <b>nutritional</b> counselling <b>programme</b> using the paired t test and McNemar test. Diet, nutritional knowledge, physical activity, socio-demographic and morbidity information were collected through questionnaires. BMI and waist circumference were assessed by a medical doctor. Results: We enrolled 74 persons, 59 of whom completed the educational programme. Of these, 34 had a nutritional status assessment after the programme. Mean age was 49 years, 80 % were females. BMI, waist circumference and diet, except for water intake, did not change. The percentage of people who had “never exercised in a week" decreased from 46 % to 17 % (p< 0. 001). Mean percentage of right answers to nutritional knowledge indicators increased from 64 % to 78 % (p< 0. 001).

We find that there is a very high incidence of substitution within cereals (especially for poor households) and that between group substitution explains at most 59 % of the income elasticity for food quality. These estimates suggest that the potential of a cash transfer programme to have a positive impact on the food diversity and the nutritional status of households is quite limited. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the returns to differential programme exposure {{in the context}} of a large-scale <b>nutritional</b> <b>programme.</b> It addresses this question using information available only on programme participants. To that end, the authors develop a methodology that circumvents this data hurdle and estimate returns to differential lengths of exposure using administrative data. Such data are generally collected as a by-product of the monitoring process of programme implementation but are rarely exploited to assess the effectiveness of the programme. The analysis finds that the returns to exposure are positive: communities exposed for an additional 1 (or 2) years of display on average lower malnutrition rates of around 7 [...] 9 percentage points. Moreover, the differential returns are decreasing over time, although they do not dissipate to zero. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the returns to the programme reflect learning effects from the intervention. Copyright 2011 The author 2011.

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on how to identify pregnant women as acutely malnourished and when to enroll them in <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes.</b> Médecins Sans Frontières Switzerland undertook a literature review with the purpose of determining values of anthropometric indicators for acute malnutrition that are associated with adverse birth outcomes (such as low birth weight (LBW)), pre-term birth and intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR). A literature search in PUBMED was done covering 1 January 1995 to 12 September 2012 with the key terms maternal anthropometry and pregnancy. The review focused on the humanitarian context. Mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) was identified as the preferential indicator of choice because of its relatively strong association with LBW, narrow range of cut-off values, simplicity of measurement (important in humanitarian settings) and it does not require prior knowledge of gestational age. The MUAC values below which most adverse effects were identified were < 22 and < 23 cm. A conservative cut-off of < 23 cm is recommended to include most pregnant women at risk of LBW for their infants in the African and Asian contexts...|$|R
40|$|Situation Malnutrition plays a {{significant}} role in under-five mortality rates following disasters. Older people {{play an important role in}} childcare in non-Western societies, which often increases in displacement contexts. Until now, policy, in general, and nutrition programmes, in particular, have focused on the mother-child dyad. Aim To gather information on possible barriers to older carers accessing nutritional services for the children they care for and explore ways to overcome these obstacles. Method A qualitative approach was taken to explore the experiences of the carers themselves. Focus group discussions provided data, which were analysed using grounded theory. Results Data collected showed older people have similar needs to other caregivers in emergency settings, needs that are often amplified by age. Moreover, many barriers to accessing services were elicited, including targeting and advertising of <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes,</b> alongside physical and psychosocial barriers to assessing existing support. Participants generated potential solutions to each identified barrier. Conclusion As older people in Haiti were often the sole carers of under-fives, there is a need to recognise their importance in this role and support them within. More generally, in any emergency setting, organisations need take into account all stakeholders in child nutrition when planning and implementing programmes...|$|R
40|$|Nutrition in {{children}} under 5 {{years is a}} major problem in developing countries as it is the commonest cause of child mortality and morbidity. The aims of this study were to assess the nutritional status using anthropometric measurements and to define certain socio-demographic factors which were associated with the nutritional status in low income sectors of the community. To fulfill these aims, a cross sectional survey was carried out on 379 children, age zero to 59 months in Elengaz Area in Hantoub locality. Age was determined from mothers and weight and height were measured using standard techniques. Data on weight and height were expressed in Z-scores and compared to international NCHS standards. According to WHO criteria and suggestion proposed by Water low 31. 3 % were normal, 19 % were wasted, 49. 7 % were stunted and 10. 2 % were both wasted and stunted. The wasting was positively related to the number of fetuses (P= 0. 003) and birth weight (P= 0. 020). the stunning was positively related to birth weight (P= 0. 000), succeeding birth interval (P = 0. 000), duration of breast feeding (P = 0. 004) and infection with malaria (P = 0. 03).

40|$|Objective: Food {{prepared}} and consumed {{away from home}} accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} dietary intake among Canadians. Currently, Canadians receive little or no nutrition information when eating in restaurant and fast-food outlets. The present study examined the impact of nutrition information on menus in hospital cafeterias on noticing and perceived influence of nutrition information and on food consumption. Design: Cross-sectional surveys. Setting: Exit surveys (n 1003) were conducted in two hospital cafeterias. The ‘intervention ’ site featured energy (calorie), sodium and fat content on digital menu boards, as well as a health logo for ‘healthier ’ items. The intervention site had also revised its menu items to improve the nutrient profiles. The ‘control ’ site provided limited nutrition information at the point of sale. Subjects: Cafeteria patrons recruited using the intercept technique. Results: Significantly more respondents at the intervention site reported noticing nutrition information (OR 5 7 ? 6, P, 0 ? 001) and using nutrition information to select their food items (OR 53 ? 3, P, 0 ? 001) compared with patrons at the control site, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Patrons at the intervention site consumed significantly less energy (221 %, P, 0 ? 001), sodium (223 %, P, 0 ? 001), saturated fat (233 %, P, 0 ? 001) and total fat (237 %, P, 0 ? 001) than patrons at the control site.

40|$|Purpose: The {{results of}} several studies {{point to the}} {{positive}} role of vegetarian diets in {{reducing the risk of}} diabetes, some cancers and cardiovascular diseases. However, exclusion of animal products in vegetarian diets may affect the cobalamin status and cause an elevation of the plasma homocysteine level. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of vegetarian diets on serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B 12 and total antioxidant status (TAS) in children. Material and methods: The study included 32 vegetarians (including 5 vegans), age 2 - 10 years. Dietary constituents were analyzed using a local <b>nutritional</b> <b>programme.</b> Serum homocysteine, folate and vitamin B 12 were determined with fluorescence and chemiluminescence immunoassays. The concentration of TAS was measured by a colorimetric method. Results: Average daily energy intake and the percentage of energy from protein, fat and carbohydrates in the diets of the studied children were just above or similar to the recommended amounts. It could be shown that vegetarian diets contain high concentrations of folate. In vegan diets it even exceeds the recommended dietary allowance. Mean daily intake of vitamin B 12 in the studied diets was adequate but in vegans was below the recommended range. The serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B 12 and TAS in vegetarian children remained within the physiological range. Conclusions: The presented data indicate that vegetarian children, contrary to adults, have enough vitamin B 12 in their diet (excluding vegans) and normal serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate and vitamin...|$|E

40|$|Investment in <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes</b> can {{contribute}} to economic growth and is cost-effective in improving child survival and development. In order to communicate this to decision-makers, the PROFILES nutrition advocacy and policy development programme was applied in certain developing countries. Effective advocacy is necessary to generate financial and political support for scaling up from small pilot projects and maintaining successful national programmes. The programme uses scientific knowledge to estimate development indicators such as mortality, morbidity, fertility, school performance and labour productivity from the size and nutritional condition of populations. Changes in nutritional condition are estimated from the costs, coverage and effectiveness of proposed programmes. In Bangladesh this approach helped to gain approval and funding for a major nutrition programme. PROFILES helped to promote the nutrition component of an early childhood development programme in the Philippines, and to make nutrition a top priority in Ghana’s new national child survival strategy. The application of PROFILES in these and other countries has been supported by the United States Agency for International Development, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Micronutrient Initiative and other bodies.

It also provides original child-focused evidence on perceptions of government food programmes {{such as the}} Midday Meal Scheme and the Targeted Public Distribution System. The paper analyses three rounds of longitudinal qualitative data and one round of survey data from Young Lives. We found that: access to good-quality food is a key preoccupation {{for children and families}} in low-income households; there is widespread awareness of the importance of a good diet for health, nutrition and cognition (among children as well as caregivers), irrespective of their age, education or income levels; quality of diet is sensitive to the precarious economic circumstances in which families find themselves, and is affected by food price rises and drought; food programmes, particularly school meals, are generally seen as valuable safety net interventions, although concerns emerged regarding the quality of the food provided, in private schools and hostels as well as government schools. The paper concludes that children’s experiences are important to take account of when public programmes are implemented, and that there are high levels of awareness of the importance of dietary diversity that could be built upon in health and <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} effect of {{information}} and cultural barriers on the demand for health care in both developed and developing countries. Chapter 1 exploits the randomized research design of PROGRESA, a conditional cash transfer programme implemented in rural Mexico, to study whether health interventions can have indirect effects on the propensity to screen for gender specific diseases. We show that among women not entitled to a cash transfer there is a higher likelihood of being screened for cervical cancer as result of greater social acceptance of the test and increased awareness of potential risk factors. Chapter 2 discusses whether attendance at health and nutrition sessions {{as one of the}} requirements for receiving a transfer, affects the health behaviour of eligible adults. Using data from the randomized design of the PAL <b>nutritional</b> <b>programme,</b> implemented in rural Mexico, we show that there is a lower propensity among women for a large waist circumference, which is driven by reduced calorie intake based on better nutrition knowledge. Chapter 3 examines whether the quality of primary care affects the uptake of mammography and colonoscopy among individuals aged 50 plus, in eight European countries. We find that better quality general practitioner are significantly increases the propensity to undergo screening. Finally, Chapter 4 looks at whether the costs involved in acquiring health information are an important determinant of the decision to buy supplementary private health insurance and whether this explains in part the large cross country variation in supplementary private health insurance coverage across European countries.

Under-nutrition is the result of many interrelated factors such as poverty, insufficient household food security, inadequate health services, poor maternal and child care practices and inadequate water and sanitation. For communities with a high prevalence of under- nutrition, it may take years or even decades before all of these factors can be addressed. Aims and Objectives:  to find out child feeding practices responsible for severe acute malnutrition among Under-five Children and to recommend a Community Action Plan based on Positive Deviance Approach to deal with under-nutrition quickly, affordably and sustainably in a culturally acceptable manner. Materials & Methods : Study design : Matched Case Control study. Sample size : 143 cases and age, socio-economic status matched 143 controls. Study place : MTC and Immunization clinic. Study Duration: May, 2013 - May, 2014. Study Tool and Data Collection : Semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. Data analysis: with help of SPSS 16 (Mean, SD, Proportion, odds ratio). Results: Strong positive association was found between duration of exclusive breast feeding(both shorter and longer), prelacteals, diluted milk as weaning food, bottle feeding, giving excess milk and less solid protein diet, not able to recognize cue of hunger by mother, lack of demand feeding, and severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion : Not any <b>nutritional</b> <b>programme</b> can help in preventing SAM unless we motivate the mothers for good child feeding and rearing practices. This can be achieved by identification of the Positive Deviant mothers from the same community and SES, who can motivate the mothers of SAM children and can practically demonstrate positive child feeding practices in a culturally acceptable manner. </p...|$|E
40|$|One hundred Sinhalese {{mothers with}} infants at three months age {{in a rural}} {{population}} in Central Sri Lanka were interviewed by questionnaire on the feeding of their infants from birth to 3 months of life. 96 % of babies were being breast fed at 3 months age. However, 32 % have already been started on formula. Of this 32, eight mothers were from poor families receiving state subsidies. 20 of the 32 were giving expensive formulas made by multinational companies, (including four of the eight mothers receiving state subsidies and feeding formula) {{in spite of the}} availability of cheap comparable state subsidized formulas. In rural Sri Lanka only about a quarter have access to drinking water but 96 % were giving water or other weak nutritional solutions at 3 months of age. 72 % were using bottles for feeding. 77 % were being given sugar and, 13 % salt through non-milk solutions while 11 % were getting sugar through their formula. Maternal employment, increasing maternal age, less than sixteen hours of maternal contact time per day with child, delay in initiation of breast feeding after birth were all significantly associated with a higher risk of formula feeding. A lower birth order and early initiation of breast feeding after birth were associated with a higher risk of babies being fed on non-milk solutions. In the light of these findings it is suggested that the time is now opportune for the National <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Programme</b> to shift its present emphasis from the promotion of breast feeding in these (and similar) areas to the promotion of exclusive breast feeding in the early infant's diet, while discouraging formulas, non-milk solutions, weaning foods, salt, sugar {{and the use of the}} bottle as a feeding utensil. feeding infant Sri Lanka rural...|$|E
50|$|In 1983. the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, {{headed by}} Jennie Brand-Miller, {{undertook}} a <b>nutritional</b> analysis <b>programme</b> analyzing bushfood for Aboriginal health. Vic Cherikoff, {{a member of}} the Human Nutrition Unit team, started-up a wholesale distribution company marketing native Australian ingredients. Cherikoff played a vital role in linking-up the Aboriginal and regional bushfood research with the restaurant and food processing industry. Cherikoff also contributed to Jennifer Isaacs' book, Bush Food and authored The Bushfood Handbook and Uniquely Australian, A wildfood cookbook which publicly defined the emerging industry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{paucity of}} data on the dietary intake and {{nutritional}} status of urban Ethiopians which necessitates comprehensive nutritional assessments. Therefore, {{the present study was}} aimed at evaluating the dietary intake and nutritional status of urban residents in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods This cross-sectional community based nutrition survey was conducted by involving 356 participants (71. 3 % female and 28. 7 % male with mean age of 37. 3 [*]years). Subjects were selected by random sampling. Socio demographic data was collected by questionnaire. Height, weight, hip circumference and waist circumference were measured following standard procedures. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire and 24 -h dietary recall. The recommended dietary allowance was taken as the cut-off point for the assessment of the adequacy of individual nutrient intake. Results Undernourished, overweight and obese subjects composed 12. 9 %, 21. 3 % and 5. 9 % of the participants, respectively. Men were taller, heavier and had higher waist to hip ratio compared to women (P[*] Conclusions The overall risk of nutritional inadequacy among the study participants was high along with their poor dietary intake. Hence, more stress should be made on planning and implementing <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes</b> in urban settings aimed at preventing or correcting micronutrient and some macronutrient deficiencies which may be useful in preventing nutrition related diseases in life. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In {{malnourished}} populations, the weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) {{distribution is}} {{shifted to the}} left. The aim of nutrition interventions should be to restore a normal WHZ distribution for the whole population. The present paper examines the WHZ change needed by each individual to achieve this objective. Design: We developed a mathematical model of required individual change in WHZ {{as a function of}} characteristics of the initial population to restore a normal distribution. This model was then tested by simulating WHZ change needed to restore a normal WHZ distribution in a test population. Setting: A rural area of Democratic Republic of the Congo with a high prevalence of undernutrition. Subjects: Children under 5 years of age. Results: To restore a normal distribution for the whole population, the WHZ of all children should be shifted. The desired WHZ change of each individual should be higher when the individual’s initial WHZ is low, when the mean WHZ of the whole population is low and, for the most wasted individual, when the variance of WHZ and WHZ change in the population are high. Using the suggested model in a simulation on the test population resulted in a WHZ distribution close to the growth standard. Conclusions: To restore a normal WHZ distribution in wasted populations, <b>nutritional</b> <b>programmes</b> should cover the whole population with a higher weight gain in areas where mean WHZ is low. </p...|$|R
