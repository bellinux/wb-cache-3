5|$|Throughout all this, Lody's {{demeanour}} {{was relatively}} calm {{after the initial}} shock. Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was not the usual class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but {{admitted that he had}} <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that the man was German.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol has <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen {{said that there}} is something about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

She promoted Vélez's career as a dancer and recommended her to Flo Ziegfeld, who hired her to perform in New York City. While Vélez was preparing to leave Los Angeles, she {{received a call from}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer producer Harry Rapf, who offered her a screen test. Producer and director Hal Roach saw Vélez's screen test and hired her for a small role in the comedy short Sailors, Beware!, starring Laurel and Hardy.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{was a man}} of many contradictions. His {{good looks}} and noble comportment greatly {{impressed}} his contemporaries. The Italian condottiero Gaspare Broglio da Lavello (son of Angelo Tartaglia), whom he met in 1452, wrote that he had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> prince more refined and dignified, surpassing even the intellectual humanist Federico da Montefeltro, Broglio's idol. At the same time, however, Thomas' inconstancy and lack of courage inspired disdain. He was capable of both great generosity and pettiness. His reputation abroad was damaged by his fickleness, while religious persecution and forced conversions caused disapproval at home; he was cursed {{in the early years of}} the Ottoman rule for robbing the indigenous Bosnian Church of its property.|$|E

500|$|As a captain, Woodfull {{was known}} for his courage and high moral {{principles}} {{in the face of the}} bodyline series. Fellow player Stan McCabe described him as [...] "the greatest man I ever met", while wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield said that he had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> more exemplary character. Oldfield said that Woodfull was a psychologist and humanitarian in addition to a captain. Bradman attributed Woodfull's success to his ability to command the intense loyalty of his players and convert it into team spirit. Bill O'Reilly said that Woodfull's men [...] "all held imperishable memories of his personal touch and his courage". Ray Robinson said that [...] "nobody thought Bill Woodfull the cat's whiskers as a strokeplayer but his many qualities made him a pre-eminent leader of men". He added that [...] "Woodfull's unrivalled selflessness won fidelity bordering on devotion". Australian cricket writer Jack Pollard said that [...] "Woodfull had the habit of being where things were tough, and he brought rare dignity to the Australian captaincy". Pollard compared the respect he commanded from his players to that of Ian Chappell. The English writer RC Robertson-Glasgow said of Woodfull: ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1910 Troy Middleton enlisted {{into the}} 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Porter in Buffalo, New York. [...] He {{was put to}} work as a company clerk, and as a private earned $15 a month, which was paid in gold until it became scarce, and was then paid in silver. [...] Private Middleton tired of this desk work quickly and asked to become a soldier. While this did not happen at Fort Porter, his talents as a {{football}} player became known, and he was pressed into duty as the quarterback of the local team, which played civilian teams in the Buffalo area as well as other army teams such as the one at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls. [...] For the next several years Middleton would play a lot of football, a sport that was strongly endorsed by the army. After getting a commission, an officer is never returned to the same unit from which he served as an enlisted member, but Middleton became the exception because of his talents as a quarterback. Middleton felt that football provided him with the finest training he received while in the army, and he said he <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> good football player who wasn't also a good soldier.|$|E

In the article, entitled [...] "Women Can't Fight", Webb described his personal experiences in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Marine infantry officer, and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women. Webb also wrote that he had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> woman [...] "whom [...] would trust to provide those men with combat leadership". The article also characterized the Naval Academy dormitory situation as [...] "a horny woman's dream", due to the ratio of men to women being 13⅓ to 1 at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Osterberg {{was first}} {{inspired}} {{to form the}} Stooges after meeting blues drummer Sam Lay {{during a visit to}} Chicago. Upon returning to Detroit, Osterberg sought to create a new form of blues music that was not derivative of historical precedents.

2500|$|In the 1993 All-Star Game held at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, he {{was criticized}} for not getting Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina into the game. Mussina {{got up in the}} ninth inning to warm up in the bullpen. Mussina later claimed that he was simply doing a between-start workout, but some {{interpreted}} it was an attempt to force Gaston to put him into the game. As angry fans jeered in dismay, incredulous that Gaston would not use the popular local player and believing Mussina had been sent to warm up for no reason, Gaston instead allowed Blue Jays pitcher Duane Ward to close out the victory for the American League. Baltimore fans did not like this perceived snub, and T-shirts were sold outside of Camden Yards that season bearing the phrase, [...] "Will Rogers never met Cito Gaston", referencing the famous line by Will Rogers, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>a</b> man yet that I didn't like." ...|$|E
