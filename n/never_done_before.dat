Schoolchildren are not afraid of “Foma”, as the P. E. Teacher is teaching them, and they are teaching him in turn. “Foma”’s path is thorny, he constantly makes mistakes, and ruins his own positive results having been achieved with great difficulty, and yet, slowly and painfully, he changes to become better.|$|E

Eventually, they became the first Bulgarian team to qualify twice for the group stage of the tournament. In the group stage, Ludogorets achieved two draws against Basel and one against Paris Saint-Germain, which were enough to secure them the third place and a transfer to the knockout phase of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, another milestone <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> by a Bulgarian team.

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War Wilson volunteered for service and was commissioned in the army. He served in the King's Royal Rifle Corps in France and was twice severely wounded - at Ypres in 1914 and on the Somme near High Wood in 1916; the first, in the lungs, seriously threatened his potential singing career but he worked hard to overcome the injury. He then worked in the Intelligence Bureau of the General Staff at the War Office and General Headquarters in France. Authorities differ on whether the wounds, which resulted in the loss of a lung and a kidney, affected his singing voice. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that they did not; Frank Howes, writing in 1951, and The Times in its obituary, both state that they did. According to his biographer and third wife, Margaret Stewart, those who had heard Wilson sing before the war [...] "agreed that his voice did not have quite the same carrying-power after the wound". Arthur Bliss, who had known Wilson at Cambridge, told Stewart that when the tenor [...] "got tired he was sometimes inclined to sing a little flat, as he had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> the war".|$|E
