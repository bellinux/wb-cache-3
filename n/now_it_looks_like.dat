2500|$|Early in the {{recording}} process, Kerrang! reported that the band's new album would be released sometime in 2010. Towards the end of {{the recording}} process, Gaskarth said the album would be released in January 2011. On August 17, a demo was posted online of the track [...] "Actors".

In October and November, the band went on a headlining club tour in the US with support from A Rocket to the Moon and City (Comma) State. The band held a contest where five fans could hear the new album at each stop on the tour. On October 18, the album's title as revealed: Dirty Work. In November, Barakat revealed that the album's release date had been pushed back to early spring and {{that the majority of the}} album's songs were mixed.

5000|$|G4S-run Medway {{managers}} received performance-related pay {{awards in}} April 2016, despite the chief inspector of prisons weeks saying weeks earlier that “managerial oversight failed to protect {{young people from}} harm at the jail.” In January, the BBC’s Panorama programme showed an undercover reporter working as a guard at the Medway secure training centre (STC) in Kent. The film showed children allegedly being mistreated and claimed that staff falsified records of violent incidents. No senior managers were disciplined or dismissed. Prior to the Panorama programme's broadcast, the Youth Justice Board (YJB), which oversees youth custody in England, stopped placing children in Medway. In February, a Guardian investigation revealed that, in 2003, whistleblowers had warned G4S, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the YJB that staff were mistreating detained children. Their letter, forwarded by Prof John Pitts, a youth justice expert, was ignored. When the prisons inspectorate carried out a snap inspection at Medway it found detainees reported staff had used insulting, aggressive or racist language toward them and felt unsafe in facility portions not covered by closed circuit TV. Reviewers agreed to the legitimacy of evidence presented by Panorama showing, [...] "...targeted bullying of vulnerable boys,” by employees, and that, “A larger group of staff must {{have been aware of}} unacceptable practice but did not challenge or report this behaviour.” In an earlier Ofsted report on Medway, inspectors said staff and middle managers reported feeling a lack of leadership and having “low, or no confidence in senior managers.” Nick Hardwick, at the time the chief inspector of prisons said, “Managerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm. Effective oversight is key to creating a positive culture that prevents poor practice happening and ensuring it is reported when it does.” The Guardian newspaper learned that senior managers at Medway received performance-related pay awards in April amounting to between 10-25% of their annual salaries, according to seniority. One 15-year-old girl placed at Medway in 2009 said she was frequently unlawfully restrained over 18 months, citing an occasion in which her face was repeatedly slammed into icy ground. “I assumed the senior management team would be sacked... But <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> they have been rewarded for allowing children to be abused in prison,” she said. Former Labour MP Sally Keeble has complained about G4S maltreatment in STC's for over ten years, stating: “This is people making personal profit out of tragedy. I hope that justice minister Liz Truss would intervene and make sure these bonuses are not being paid by a Ministry of Justice contractor.” Notwithstanding the results of the investigations no senior managers at Medway were disciplined or dismissed. In May, the MoJ said the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) would take over the running of Medway. In July, it formally assumed control of the STC. In February 2016, G4S had announced that it was to sell its children's services business, including the contract to manage two secure training centres. The company hoped to complete the process by the end of 2016.|$|E
