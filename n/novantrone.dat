40|$|The {{combination}} of hormonal treatment {{based on a}} long-acting delivery system for the agonist [6 -D-tryptophan]luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ([D-Trp 6]-LH-RH) with the chemotherapeutic agent <b>Novantrone</b> (mitoxantrone dihydrochloride) was studied in the Dunning R 3327 H rat prostate cancer model. Microcapsules of [D-Trp 6]-LH-RH formulated from poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) and calculated to release a controlled dose of 25 micrograms/day were injected intramuscularly once a month. <b>Novantrone</b> (0. 25 mg/kg) was injected intravenously once every 3 weeks. Three separate experiments were carried out. When the therapy was started 45 days after transplantation and continued for 70 days, tumor volume {{in the presence of}} the microcapsules (966 +/- 219 mm 3) or <b>Novantrone</b> (3606 +/- 785 mm 3) given alone was significantly decreased compared to controls (14, 476 +/- 3045 mm 3). However, the {{combination of}} microcapsules and <b>Novantrone</b> caused a greater inhibition of tumor growth (189 +/- 31 mm 3) than the single agents. Similar effects were seen when the percent increase in tumor volume was examined. Tumor volume increased 10, 527 +/- 1803 % for the control group. The inhibition of growth caused by the [D-Trp 6]LH-RH microcapsules alone (672 +/- 153 % increase in volume) was again greater than that caused by <b>Novantrone</b> alone (2722 +/- 421 % increase). The combination of the two agents was again the most effective, resulting in an increase in tumor volume of only 105 +/- 29 %. Control tumors weighed 30. 0 +/- 6. 5 g. Tumor weights were much less in the groups treated with either microcapsules (3. 28 +/- 0. 69 g) or <b>Novantrone</b> (19. 53 +/- 3. 3 g) alone. The lowest tumor weights after 70 days of treatment were obtained in the group that received the combination of [D-Trp 6]LH-RH microcapsules and <b>Novantrone</b> (1. 02 +/- 0. 2 g). Testes and ventral prostate weights were significantly diminished by the administration of microcapsules of [D-Trp 6]LH-RH alone or in combination with <b>Novantrone.</b> In both of these groups, luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels were reduced and serum testosterone was suppressed to undetectable levels. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments in which the duration of treatment was 60 or 105 days. These results suggest that the overall response could reflect the inhibition of proliferation of hormone-independent cancer cells by <b>Novantrone</b> in addition to the suppressive effect of [D-Trp 6]LH-RH on the growth of androgen-dependent tumor cells. The administration of <b>Novantrone</b> in combination with microcapsules of [D-Trp 6]LH-RH might produce a better clinical response than LH-RH analog alone in patients with advanced prostate carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of improving the}} quality of responses of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients has led to the design of protocols that combine fludarabine (FDR) with synergistic drugs. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of a schedule that includes fludarabine, ara-C, <b>novantrone</b> and dexamethasone (FAND) for the management of previously treated CLL patients under 60 years old. Design and Methods. Thirty-one patients underwent FAND treatment. Twenty-three patients had active disease (relapsed patients: 9; unresponsive to prior therapy: 14). Fight patients had a partial response (PR) to prior therapy and were treated with the aim of further reducing residual disease. The FAND schedule included fludarabine (25 mg/ml i. v. days 1 - 3), ara-C (1 g/m(2) i. v. day 1 : 8 patients; days 1 - 2 : 23 patients), <b>novantrone</b> (10 mg/m(2) i. v. day 1) and dexamethasone (20 mg i. v. days 1 - 3).

40|$|Background: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a common}} complex disorder, with new treatment options emerging each year. Social media is being increasingly used to investigate opinions about drugs, diseases and procedures. In this descriptive exploratory study, we sought to investigate opinions about currently available MS treatments. Methods: The Twitter resource Topsy was searched for tweets mentioning the following MS treatments: Aubagio, Avonex, Betaferon or Betaseron, Copaxone, Extavia, Gilenya, Lemtrada, <b>Novantrone,</b> Rebif, Tysabri and Tecfidera between 1 Jan 2006 to 31 Jul 2014. Tweets were normalised and sentiment analysis performed. Results: In total, there were 60037 unique tweets mentioning an MS treatment. About half of the tweets contained non-neutral sentiment. Mean sentiment scores were different for treatments ranging from - 0. 191 to 0. 282 when investigating all tweets. These differences in sentiment scores between treatments were statistically significant (P< 0. 001). Sentiment scores tended to be higher for oral MS treatments than injectable treatments.

40|$|Abstract—Mitoxantrone is {{the first}} drug {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) in the United States. This assessment considers use of mitoxantrone in the treatment of MS. Mitoxantrone probably reduces the clinical attack rate and reduces attack-related MRI outcomes in patients with relapsing MS (Type B recommendation). Also, mitoxantrone may have a beneficial effect on disease progression in patients with MS whose clinical condition is worsening (Type B recommendation). The potential for serious toxicity of mitoxantrone, however, {{must be taken into account}} when considering this therapy in individual patients. Moreover, because the potential clinical benefits on disease progression appear to be only modest, the results of the single phase III trial should be replicated in another (and hopefully much larger) clinical study before this agent is widely recommended for the treatment of patients with MS.

Here, we report that these MS patients are disproportionately more likely to be older, male, unemployed, and disabled with lower levels of education and financial resources when com-pared to veterans not receiving care within the VHA or to non-veteran MS patients. When comparing the VHA MS patients to a cohort of nonveteran MS patients matched for age, sex, and disability, we found that veterans receiving care within the VHA were equally likely to have received care from a neurolo-gist and more likely to have received care from rehabilitation specialists and primary care physicians than nonveterans. Sim-ilarly, veterans in the VHA were more likely to receive therapy with certain symptomatic medications but {{were less likely to be}} treated with disease-modifying agents for MS (DMAMS) than nonveterans.

40|$|In aqueous {{solution}} the deoxyheptanucleotide, 5 ′-d(GpCpGpApApGpC), exists {{as a very}} stable hairpin structure in equilibrium with small proportions of the single-stranded and duplex forms. Complexation of the anti-cancer drug <b>novantrone</b> (mitoxantrone) with the DNA heptamer was investigated by one- and two-dimensional 500 MHz 1 H NMR spectroscopy (2 M-TOCSY, 2 M-NOESY) and molecular dynamics simulations. The proton chemical shifts of NOV in mixed solutions with the heptamer were measured {{as a function of}} concentration and temperature and the equilibrium association parameters were determined for complexation of NOV with the three forms of the heptamer. The spatial structure of the complex of the antibiotic with the hairpin form of the heptamer was built on the basis of 2 D-NOE data. The conformational dynamics of the complex and its interaction with the water environment were investigated by molecular dynamics methods. The results suggest that NOV complexes with the hairpin form of the heptamer in solution by intercalation. Complexation of NOV with the hairpin stem results in a disruption of about one half of the intramolecular water bridges of the hairpin, which is considered to be the main reason for the observed decrease in the thermodynamical stability of the hairpin on binding with the ligand...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria has an {{essential}} role in myocardial tissue homeostasis; thus deterioration in mitochondrial function eventually leads to cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell death and consequent cardiovascular dysfunction. Several chemical compounds and drugs have been known to directly or indirectly modulate cardiac mitochondrial function, which can account both for the toxicological and pharmacological properties of these substances. In many cases, toxicity problems appear only in the presence of additional cardiovascular disease conditions or develop months/years following the exposure, making the diagnosis difficult. Cardiotoxic agents affecting mitochondria include several widely used anticancer drugs [anthracyclines (Doxorubicin/Adriamycin), cisplatin, trastuzumab (Herceptin), arsenic trioxide (Trisenox), mitoxantrone (<b>Novantrone),</b> imatinib (Gleevec), bevacizumab (Avastin), sunitinib (Sutent), and sorafenib (Nevaxar) ], antiviral compound azidothymidine (AZT, Zidovudine) and several oral antidiabetics [e. g., rosiglitazone (Avandia) ]. Illicit drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and synthetic cannabinoids (spice, K 2) may also induce mitochondria-related cardiotoxicity. Mitochondrial toxicity develops due to various mechanisms involving interference with the mitochondrial respiratory chain (e. g., uncoupling) or inhibition of the important mitochondrial enzymes (oxidative phosphorylation, Szent-Györgyi-Krebs cycle, mitochondrial DNA replication, ADP/ATP translocator). The final phase of mitochondrial dysfunction induces loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in mitochondrial oxidative/nitrative stress, eventually culminating into cell death. This review aims to discuss the mechanisms of mitochondrion-mediated cardiotoxicity of commonly used drugs and some potential cardioprotective strategies to prevent these toxicities...|$|E

40|$|Background: Registry to Evaluate <b>Novantrone</b> Effects in Worsening Multiple Sclerosis (RENEW) was a 5 -year, phase IV {{study in}} which the safety of Mitoxantrone was {{monitored}} in a patient cohort from the United States (US). The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the long-term safety profile of Mitoxantrone in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS), and worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods: Overall, 509 patients (395 SPMS, 81 worsening RRMS, 33 PRMS) were enrolled and treated at 46 multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment centers located in the US. Patients received Mitoxantrone in accordance with the package insert every 3 months. During the treatment phase, patients received laboratory workups and cardiac monitoring every 3 months and then annually for a total of 5 years.

40|$|SummaryPrimary (extranodal) non-Hodgkin’s {{lymphoma}} (NHL) of {{the oral}} cavity is relatively rare. We report a case of NHL involving the left anterior mandibular gingiva of a 56 -year-old man. He was initially treated with antibiotics and root canal therapy of the lower lateral incisor as there was a history of trauma to this area. The adjacent lateral incisor tested non-vital. However, after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy the swelling increased in size and an incisional biopsy was performed. A diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, large-B cell type was rendered. The patient was then referred to medical oncology for staging work-up and treatment. A course of six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydoxorubicin, Oncovin, Prednisone) and radiotherapy were scheduled. There was a complete response {{upon completion of the}} combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One year later, the patient developed a 2 × 2 -cm, painless, firm, fixed mass of the left anterior maxillary vestibule. No additional findings were noted clinically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the clinical findings and there was no suspicion of disease elsewhere. Pathologic examination revealed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, B-cell type. This lesion was identical morphologically and immunophenotypically to the initial mandibular lesion. Complete radiographic staging detected no other sites of disease. The bone marrow was not involved. The lesion rapidly normalized after six cycles of Fludara, <b>Novantrone</b> and Mabthera chemotherapy and one cycle of Cytarabine (Ara-C). Partial remission was achieved, but the patient died of disseminated disease, 12 months after relapse.

40|$|Eight {{years after}} diagnosis, 40 % of MS {{patients}} develop a chronically progressive form. Annually we treat approximately 200 patients with progressive MS. Treatment consists of medication, i. e. agents {{that help to}} prevent future impairment, or interferon-beta injections, and intervals of mitoxantrone infusions (<b>Novantrone</b> 1), {{and in some cases}} cyclic cyclophosphamide (Endoxan 1) or nucleoside analogue cladribin (Leustatin 1). Without clear scienti®c evidence, we recommend unsaturated fatty acids (thistle or sun¯ower oil), suf®cient protein, and freshly prepared fruits and vegetables as a sound basis for remyelination. Remyelination pro®ts from general prophylaxis in the use of ascorbic acid to help prevent urinary infections via acidi®cation, autogenic training to reduce fatigue, improve ventilation of deeper airways, and stimulate vagotonic regeneration, and prevention of unnecessary immune stimulation caused by insects and some food. We recommend the use of sun hats and disencourage blood donation (Allain 1998). Physiotherapy can improve strength, reduce spasticity, and train the patient to compensate for dysbalance and ataxia; supported by beta blockers and good antispastics, tremor and gait disturbances can be positively in¯uenced. Music and motion, speech therapy, realistic training of daily activities, and prudent psychotherapy complete the range of measurements to reconstitute as much as possible of the patient's individual freedom. In the individual, we eventually provide prudent technical aids and careful prognostic estimations.

Polymerase chain reaction on small pools of DNA equivalent to 100 sperm and Southern blotting were used to screen at least 7900 sperm in each sample to quantify the mutation Frequency at the minisatellite MS 205 locus. Pretreatment and postreatment semen samples were obtained at least 2 months after completion of therapy from 4 patients treated with a regimen (<b>Novantrone,</b> Oncovin, vinblastine and prednisone [NOVP]) that lacks alkylating agents and from three patients treated with regimens (Cytoxan, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone/ Adriamycin, bleomycin, dacarbazine, lomustine, and prednisone [CVPP/ABDIC] or mechlorethamine, Oncovin, procarbazine and prednisone [MOPP]) containing alkylating agents. There were no effects of NOVP or CVPP/ABDIC on the mutation frequencies. In the 1 patient treated with MOPP, the treatment with the highest dose of gonadotoxic alkylating agents, there was a statistically significant increase in mutation frequency from 0. 79 % pretreatment to 1. 14 % posttreatment, indicating induction of mutations in stem spermatogonia. During-treatment semen samples obtained from 2 patients treated with ABVD, which does not contain gonadotoxic alkylating agents, and 1 with NOVP also did not show any increases above the baseline mutation frequencies, indicating no increase in the minisatellite mutation frequency in spermatocytes.

40|$|What {{is known}} and objectiveThe {{relative}} effectiveness and safety {{profile of the}} treatments with marketing authorization for relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) are not well known because randomized controlled trials with head-to-head comparisons between these treatments do not exist. Thus, a network of multiple-treatments meta-analysis was performed using four clinical outcomes: patients free of relapse', patients without disease progression', patients without MRI progression' and patients with adverse events'. MethodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) on MS were systematically searched in PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial. The network analysis performed pairwise comparisons between the marketed treatments (Betaferon 250 mcg, Avonex 30 mcg, Rebif 44 mcg, Rebif 22 mcg, Aubagio 7 mg, Aubagio 14 mg, Copaxone 20 mg, Tysabri 300 mg, Gilenya 0 5 mg and <b>Novantrone</b> 12 mg/m(2)) using direct and indirect analyses. Results and discussionThe analysis included 48 articles, involving 20455 patients with MS. The direct analysis showed better response {{for more than one}} outcome for Gilenya compared with Avonex (patients free of relapse' and patients without MRI progression') and for Betaferon compared with Avonex (patients without disease progression' and patients without MRI progression'). The indirect analysis indicated that Tysabri may have better relative effectiveness compared with the other treatments for two outcomes: patients free of relapse' and patients without MRI progression'.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: From February, 1987 to August, 1988, fifty-one {{patients}} with high and intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) entered a chemotherapy program MNCOP-B (M = Methotrexate, N = <b>Novantrone,</b> C = Cytoxan, O = Oncovin, P = 6 methyl-prednisolone, B = Bleomycin). Forty patients received MNCOP-B as first-line therapy and 11 patients as salvage therapy after relapse-resistance to other schemes or radiotherapy. RESULTS: The overall remission rate was 51 % {{with a similar}} distribution of remissions {{between the two groups}} under study. At a mean follow-up of 28 months, 20 patients (40 %) remain in CR with a disease-free probability of 83 % for patients treated with MNCOP-B as up-front therapy and 67 % for patients treated with MNCOP-B as salvage therapy. The overall survival at 3 years is 45 %; bulky, disease stages III-IV and symptoms are not correlated with poorer survival or a lower remission rate. Patients who received less than 70 % of the scheduled doses paradoxically figure better than the others, showing an 87 % remission rate, as compared to those who received 100 % of the scheduled doses and obtained a 35 % remission rate. Major toxicity consisted of mucositis, recorded in 15 % and 9 % of previously untreated and treated patients, respectively; severe neutropenia was recorded in 27 % and 63 %, respectively. Despite the number of recorded side effects, only one toxic death due to sepsis occurred. CONCLUSIONS: MNCOP-B is an effective regimen in intermediate and high grade NHL and easily manageable in the out-patient clinic. The incidence of mucositis is sensibly reduced as compared to the parental regimen MACOP-B reported in the literature; this result allows the use of MNCOP-B in older patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine whether <b>Novantrone,</b> Oncovin, Velban, and Prednisone (NOW) combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease increases the frequencies of the specific types of aneuploid sperm that might elevate the risk of fathering a child with one of the major clinical aneuploidy syndromes, i. e., Down (disomy 21 sperm), Edward (disomy 18 sperm), Turner (nullisomy sex sperm), XYY (disomy Y sperm), triple X (disomy X sperm), or Klinefelter (XY sperm). A four-chromosome multicolor sperm fluorescence in-situ hybridization assay that simultaneously evaluates chromosomes 18, 21, X, and Y was applied to semen provided by four healthy men and to repeated samples of eight Hodgkin's disease patients before treatment, 35 - 50 days after treatment {{to examine the effects of}} treatment on male meiotic cells, and 1 - 2 years after treatment to measure the persistence of damage. There were chromosome-specific variations in baseline frequencies and significant inductions of all of the detectable types of sperm aneuploidies: XY sperm (14 -fold increase), disomy 18 (7 -fold), nullisomy sex (3 -fold), disomy 21 (3 -fold), and disomy X and Y (similar to 2 -fold each). Disomy 21 was about twice as frequent as disomy 18, and neither showed a preferential segregation with a sex chromosome. Extrapolating across the genome, similar to 18 % of sperm carried a numerical abnormality after NOW treatment of meiotic cells. Induced effects did not persist to 1 - 2 years after treatment, suggesting that persistent spermatogonial stem cells were not sensitive to NOW. These findings establish the hypothesis that conception shortly after certain chemotherapies can transiently increase the risks of fathering aneuploid pregnancies that terminate during development or result in the birth of children with major human aneuploidy syndromes...|$|E
40|$|Mitoxantrone (<b>Novantrone,</b> American Cyanamid Company; NO) and {{high-dose}} cytarabine (Ara-C; AC) {{have each}} {{been shown to}} be active in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) in various studies. The studies reported here are sequential. The first study (NOAC I) combined high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m 2 / 12 h as a 3 h infusion on day 1) with mitoxantrone (10 mg/m 2 /d on days 2 and 3). Of 31 patients with relapsed and refractory NHL, 7 achieved complete remission (CR) and 7, partial remission (PR). Myelosuppression was the major toxicity of this regimen. In the second study (NOAC II), the dosage of cytarabine was escalated to 3 g/m 2 / 12 h on days 1 and 2 (4 doses) while mitoxantrone remained 10 mg/m 2 /d on days 2 and 3. The effects of recombinant human (rh) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were simultaneously studied. Twenty-three patients from five centers were treated with NOAC plus rhGM-CSF while 14 patients from four centers received NOAC II alone. A CR was achieved in 9 of 23 patients who received the additional rhGM-CSF and in 2 of 14 patients treated with NOAC alone. With rhGM-CSF, the median duration of severe neutropenia (less than 0. 5 /nL) after chemotherapy was 8 days versus a median of 13 days without rhGM-CSF, while the duration of severe thrombocytopenia (less than 20 /nL) was not significantly different. The rates of infection and mucositis were 25 % and 17 %, respectively, with rhGM-CSF compared to 53 % and 60 % without rhGM-CSF. Thus, this last nonrandomized pilot study indicates that administration of rhGM-CSF reduces the duration of chemotherapy-induced cytopenia and the rate of mucositis. This growth factor does not appear to result in stimulation of lymphoma cells. At present, a controlled randomized trial is being conducted using NOAC II with rhGM-CSF or placebo to establish the definitive role of this growth factor in the treatment of NHL...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{study has}} shown that the {{combination}} of mitoxantrone (<b>Novantrone,</b> NO) and Ara-C (AC) (NOAC) was active in refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) but myelosuppression was dose-limiting. In a pilot study, we investigated the effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) after NOAC chemotherapy in patients with refractory NHL. NO was applied at a dosage of 10 mg/m 2 /day on days 2 and 3 and AC at 3 g/m 2 / 12 h on days 1 and 2. RhGM-CSF was administered at 250 ug/m 2 /day as a continuous i. v. infusion from day 6 until the neutrophils were greater than 3. 0 /nl for 3 consecutive days. Twenty-three patients from five of the nine participating centers were treated with NOAC chemotherapy plus rhGM-CSF, whereas 14 patients from the other four centers received chemotherapy alone. With rhGM-CSF, the median duration of severe neutropenia (less than 0. 5 /nl) after NOAC was 8 days versus a median of 13 days without rhGM-CSF (P = 0. 0058), and that of thrombocytopenia (less than 20. 0 /nl), 3 days versus 7 days (P greater than 0. 4, NS). The rates of infections and stomatitis were 25 % and 17 %, respectively, for patients treated with rhGM-CSF as compared to 53 % (P = 0. 0547, NS) and 60 % (P = 0. 0078), respectively, without rhGM-CSF. The following side effects were associated with the administration of rhGM-CSF: pleural and/or pericardial effusions in five patients, thrombosis in two patients, bone pain in two patients, and respiratory distress syndrome in one patient. A complete remission was achieved in nine of the 23 patients treated with NOAC plus rhGM-CSF, and in two of the 14 patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The median survival of patients treated with rhGM-CSF was not reached at 400 days and seemed to be longer than that of patients treated with chemotherapy alone (median, 109 days; P = 0. 036). RhGM-CSF after chemotherapy can be applied safely to patients with NHL, shorten the period of severe cytopenia, reduce the rates of stomatitis, and did not seem to cause adverse effects on response...|$|E
