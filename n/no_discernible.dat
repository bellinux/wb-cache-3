5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>discernible</b> {{variation}} in size or appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations {{in size and}} appearance between different populations are outweighed by variations within the populations themselves. Females {{are more likely to}} be found away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E

5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> defect trend exists.|$|E
5|$|The class {{performed}} well from the outset, {{but there were}} a number of minor modifications over the years. The first ten were built without smoke deflectors, but these were added from August 1931, and the remaining thirty were fitted with them from new. Following the successful introduction of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes on to the Lord Nelson class, Maunsell's successor Oliver Bulleid began to fit them to the Schools class. However <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> improvement to draughting was experienced, and only twenty examples were so modified, the most obvious change in their appearance being the large diameter chimney.|$|E
5|$|The highest numbers {{used for}} highway designations include M-553 in the UP and Interstate 696 (I-696) {{running along the}} {{northern}} Detroit suburbs. The lowest numbers in use are M-1 along Woodward Avenue in the Detroit area and US Highway 2 (US2) across the UP. Most M-numbered trunkline designations are in the low 200s or under, but some have been designated in the low 300s. MDOT has not assigned a designation outside the Interstate System in the 400s at this time. <b>No</b> <b>discernible</b> pattern exists in Michigan's numbering system, {{although most of the}} M-numbered routes lower than 15 are typically located in or around the major cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the {{invasion}} of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, {{the heart of the}} Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> grand strategy in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{diamonds}} {{have very}} few if any nitrogen impurities. Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during crystal growth; these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian diamonds. Type IIb diamonds, which account for ~0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties). Most blue-gray diamonds coming from the Argyle mine of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those diamonds contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain. Type II diamonds weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225nm, unlike type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> visible absorption spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Bailly's uneven crater floor has {{remained}} free of lava flooding, {{and it is}} covered with a multitude of ridges and craters. The entire crater has been battered and worn, and the outer s are eroded and in some places have even been worn away by myriad impacts. If the crater ever possessed a central peak, it is <b>no</b> longer <b>discernible.</b> Due to its current condition, observers have termed this feature a 'field of ruins'.|$|R

5|$|After moving ashore, Sandy {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west, weakening below hurricane force {{by the time it}} reached Pennsylvania. Because the system was non-tropical, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) – known at the time as the Hydrometeorogical Prediction Center (HPC) – took over the responsibility of issuing advisories on the low. The remnants of Sandy brought heavy snow and high winds to the central Appalachian Mountains, resulting in blizzard warnings being issued. The system continued to weaken as it moved across western Pennsylvania, and by 0300UTC on October31, the storm's movement had shifted to the northwest. Blizzard conditions continued in the Appalachians, bringing more snow to the region that had already seen high amounts the day before. By 0900UTC on October31, the circulation degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> center of low pressure. Later that day, the remnants of Sandy spread into the Great Lakes, and the WPC issued its last advisory. By the time the system had moved out of the region, nearly three feet of snow had fallen in some areas of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, with lesser amounts elsewhere in the region. During the next two days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada, on November 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered <b>no</b> <b>discernible</b> population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E
