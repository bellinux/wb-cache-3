It costs at least $200 to get a lawyer to file a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>grievance,</b> unless a free {{community}} lawyer acts on your behalf. Community lawyers can be found by ringing the local citizens advice beurau. A day-long mediation at the Department of Labor costs about $300 in legal fees which is only necessary if the case goes beyond one day before the ERA mediator / court. To file a case with the Employment Relations Authority it costs about $71.56 in legal fees and this includes {{the first day of}} court costs. The average payout is between $2000 and $4000 and the successful party usually has their legal fees reimbursed by the losing party.Not surprisingly, 95% of cases do not go past mediation.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a critical {{study of the}} administrative court of Saudi Arabia (Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances).</b> Its aim is to evaluate the modem Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances.</b> The study also investigates {{the nature of the}} Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances,</b> that is, the extent to which its role is entirely administrative according to the Act of 1982, or also contains aspects of an appeal, review, or investigatory court. The study explores the legal nature and jurisdiction of the Board, the appointment, qualifications, and training of its members and processes for their removal or retirement, transfer, promotion, and discipline. It is argued that the Board's membership, jurisdiction and procedures all reflect historical, legal and constitutional factors; and that these influences affect the efficiency of the Board as a mechanism for the legal control of administration and <b>of</b> <b>grievances</b> against the government. The thesis seeks to identify major changes which would enhance the Board's role and strengthen its contribution {{to the rule of law}} in Saudi Arabia. The first part of the thesis consists of two chapters dealing with the historical, constitutional and legal framework within which the Board operates. Chapter 1 examines the law and constitutional background of Saudi Arabia. The main thrust of this chapter is to place the Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances</b> within the constitutional and legal environment in which it operates, in other words within the history of the growth of the state itself. Chapter 2 examines the historical development of the Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances</b> in Islam. The chapter also briefly compares the Islamic Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances</b> with an institution that has interesting similarities, the Court of Chancery in English legal history. The four chapters of the second part examine the modern Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances,</b> tracing its development since 1924, and its present jurisdiction, practice, and procedures. Chapter 3 discusses the modem development of the Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances</b> in Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this chapter is to explain the various stages of the development of the Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances</b> as established in Saudi Arabia. Chapter 4 examines the composition and structure of the modern Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances.</b> This chapter also discusses the status of the Board members as administrative judicial officers. Chapter 5 highlights the scope and limits of jurisdiction of the Board <b>of.</b> <b>Grievances.</b> Chapter 6 examines the rules of procedure of the Board <b>of</b> <b>Grievances</b> and its working practices. The concluding Chapter 7 refers to issues arising from the study in order to suggest some reforms necessary to improve the performance of the Board and to satisfy the expectation of the people.

The question arises, however, how and when grievances in nursing services arose and developed? The {{purpose of this article is}} to give a historical description of the development and management <b>of</b> <b>grievances</b> in nursing services for the time frame 1652 - 1990. An historical analysis was undertaken by means of news paper analysis, as well as other written resources. The results show that the development <b>of</b> <b>grievances</b> are related to the development of hospitals in South Africa and that grievances were poorly managed. The following conclusions are made: * grievances in nursing are related to the establishment of hospitals; * the first official grievance was lodged in 1824 by a surgeon; * grievance are mainly related to the working conditions, remuneration and management; * complaints with salaries and food were lodged by nurses as early as 1869; * it appears as if nursing service managers are not adequately skilled in the management <b>of</b> <b>grievances</b> experienced by nursing staff - the same mistakes are made leading to strike action by nurses/midwives; * unhappiness with the inappropriate manner in which grievances are managed lead to industrial action by nursing staff since 1889. Continuous empowerment of nursing services managers in the management <b>of</b> <b>grievances</b> is important and therefore the development of a model for grievance management in nursing services is also recommended...|$|R

The role of HR staff in grievance processes can be ill-defined and show wide variation, causing problems for both line managers and employees. This can lead to negative outcomes and damage {{the credibility of the}} HR department.
