Nowadays egg grading process in Indonesia was still done manually. The {{objective of this}} research was for designing, constructing, and performance testing of egg sorting machine. The machine testing includes performance accuracy, machine capacity, and egg crack of the sorting result. The egg sorting machine consisted of five main parts: conveyor system, steering conveyor system, sorting conveyor system, and exit conveyor system. Test result showed that the machine could sort the egg with accuracy of 83 % without any cracking in eggshell. The machine capacity was most affected by the speed of sorting conveyor system. The variables which influence the speed of sorting conveyor system were initial speed rotation (<b>Na),</b> <b>work</b> speed rotation (Nb), and length of the track on initial speed rotation path (L). The maximum machine capacity was 61 eggs per minute and obtained by configuration of Na, Nb, and L of 15. 5 rpm, 24. 5 rpm, and 6 cm respectively...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} to exact and inexact graph matching is introduced. We propose a compact network representation for graphs, which is capable of sharing identical subgraphs of one or several model graphs. The new matching algorithm <b>NA</b> <b>works</b> on the network and uses its compactness in order to speed up the detection process. Next, the problem of inexact graph matching is described and a distance measure based on basic graph edit operations and subgraph isomorphism is defined. We propose an inexact network algorithm INA which determines the optimal distance between an input graph and a set of model graphs along with the corresponding subgraph isomorphism. In addition to INA, a new lookahead procedure is proposed. The lookahead procedure works simultaneously over a set of model graphs and efficiently limits the size of the search space. The advantages of the new methods are studied in a theoretical complexity analysis. Finally, some experimental results with randomly generated g [...] ...|$|R

He primarily worked with hip hop producers No I.D. and Salaam Remi, a frequent collaborator of Nas. Remi said that he wanted his production [...] "to be something that a mumble-mouth rapper can’t rap on. You better have something to say and be speaking up." [...] Along with producer Swizz Beatz, No I.D. and Nas related to the latter's lyrics concerning divorce during the recording sessions.

40|$|The current {{available}} {{agents for}} the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) include immunomodulatory agents, such as interferon-α and pegylated interferon-α, and oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs), including lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir. The <b>NAs</b> <b>work</b> mainly by inhibiting hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase activity and thus suppress HBV replication. Oral NAs have become the mainstay of CHB treatment, mainly due to their profound viral suppressive effects and also {{due in part to the}} ease of single daily dosing and lack of significant side effects. One major drawback of NA therapy is the development of drug resistance mutations with long-term treatment. Lamivudine, the first oral NA approved for CHB patients, is associated with high rates of drug resistance, with resultant virological relapse and biochemical flare. Fortunately, newer and more potent NAs, such as entecavir and tenofovir, have very low resistance rates, with potent and durable viral suppression. This review is aimed at the current developments in NAs for CHB treatment, detailing the mechanisms of antiviral activity of the different agents, the efficacy of viral suppression, the achievement of treatment endpoints, the development of drug resistance and the optimal strategies for using these drugs. © The Author 2011.
