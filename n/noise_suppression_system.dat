40|$|Acoustic {{background}} noise in mobile speech communication systems, while largely inevitable, {{can have a}} severely detrimental effect on speech intelligibility. Noise suppression is highly desirable in these systems. However, the process of reducing noise in a speech signal is associated with distortion of the processed signal, the severity of which is generally proportional {{to the amount of}} noise suppression applied. Placing the noise suppression at the decoder side of a communication link, allows for user control, but for a speech coder to be used for coding noisy signals it must be robust to noise. The thesis explores these two issues regarding this type of system: 1) To evaluate the feasibility of decoder based noise suppression, the effect of coding noisy speech signals with the Adaptive Multi Rate codec (AMR) at several bit-rates is evaluated for various noise types and noise levels, using objective methods. The results show that the coding is robust to noise and has a signal enhancing effect in these tests. 2) User control is simulated using the <b>noise</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> present in the Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC) and user control over several system parameters is implemented and evaluated using subjective tests.

When the power semiconductor devices do high-speed switching, the high-frequency leakage currentwill occur. This kind of leakage current backtracks to the utility power source through the ground path and leads to the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise. In addition, common-mode (CM) noise is the main ingredient of the conducted EMI noise. Furthermore, the accurate modeling of the EMI noise equivalent circuit will be beneficial to the design of effective <b>noise</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system.</b> This dissertationpresents an equivalent circuit containing non-linear component for inverter-fed drive air conditioner system. By comparing the amplitude of leakage current when the air conditioner is working in different modes, the main effect factors of the CM EMI noise are indentified. Though the analysis of interference conduction mechanism and the waveform of leakage current in inverter-fed drive system, an accurate equivalentcircuit with non-linear resistance is proposed for the first time. Afterward, according to the waveform of the leakage current in the ground path when only one phase of inverter is switching, the parameters of the equivalent circuit are calculated. And the accuracy of this equivalent circuit is verified again, bycomparing the result of simulation with the waveform when two phases of inverter are switching at the same time. Further, the equivalent circuit is indentified again through an optimize software modeFRONTIER to correct the errors during the subjective calculation before. A linear model and a non-linear model are separately discussed. With the results of these two models, the necessity and effectiveness of theintroduction of the non-linear resistance about the common-mode equivalent circuit are confirmed.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of an {{auxiliary}} sensor, the GEMS device, for improving the quality of noisy speech and designing noise preprocessors to MELP speech coders. Use of auxiliary sensors for noise-robust ASR applications is also investigated to develop speech enhancement algorithms that use acoustic-phonetic properties of the speech signal. A Bayesian risk minimization framework is developed that can incorporate the acoustic-phonetic properties of speech sounds and knowledge of human auditory perception into the speech enhancement framework. Two noise suppression systems are presented using the ideas developed in the mathematical framework. In the first system, an aharmonic comb filter is proposed for voiced speech where low-energy frequencies are severely suppressed while high-energy frequencies are suppressed mildly. The proposed system outperformed an MMSE estimator in subjective listening tests and DRT intelligibility test for MELP-coded noisy speech. The effect of aharmonic comb filtering on the linear predictive coding (LPC) parameters is analyzed using a missing data approach. Suppressing the low-energy frequencies without any modification of the high-energy frequencies is shown to improve the LPC spectrum using the Itakura-Saito distance measure. The second system combines the aharmonic comb filter with the acoustic-phonetic properties of speech to improve the intelligibility of the MELP-coded noisy speech. Noisy speech signal is segmented into broad level sound classes using a multi-sensor automatic segmentation/classification tool, and each sound class is enhanced differently based on its acoustic-phonetic properties. The proposed system is shown to outperform both the MELPe noise preprocessor and the aharmonic comb filter in intelligibility tests when used in concatenation with the MELP coder. Since the second <b>noise</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> uses an automatic segmentation/classification algorithm, exploiting the GEMS signal in an automatic segmentation/classification task is also addressed using an ASR approach. Current ASR engines can segment and classify speech utterances in a single pass; however, they are sensitive to ambient noise. Features that are extracted from the GEMS signal can be fused with the noisy MFCC features to improve the noise-robustness of the ASR system. In the first phase, a voicing feature is extracted from the clean speech signal and fused with the MFCC features. The actual GEMS signal could not be used in this phase because of insufficient sensor data to train the ASR system. Tests are done using the Aurora 2 noisy digits database. The speech-based voicing feature is found to be effective at around 10 dB but, below 10 dB, the effectiveness rapidly drops with decreasing SNR because of the severe distortions in the speech-based features at these SNRs. Hence, a novel system is proposed that treats the MFCC features in a speech frame as missing data if the global SNR is below 10 dB and the speech frame is unvoiced. If the global SNR is above 10 dB of the speech frame is voiced, both MFCC features and voicing feature are used. The proposed system is shown to outperform some of the popular noise-robust techniques at all SNRs. In the second phase, a new isolated monosyllable database is prepared that contains both speech and GEMS data. ASR experiments conducted for clean speech showed that the GEMS-based feature, when fused with the MFCC features, decreases the performance. The reason for this unexpected result is found to be partly related to some of the GEMS data that is severely noisy. The non-acoustic sensor noise exists in all GEMS data but the severe noise happens rarely. A missing data technique is proposed to alleviate the effects of severely noisy sensor data. The GEMS-based feature is treated as missing data when it is detected to be severely noisy. The combined features are shown to outperform the MFCC features for clean speech when the missing data technique is applied. Ph. D. Committee Chair: David V.

40|$|The alpha-stable {{distribution}} {{family has}} received great interest recently, {{due to its}} ability to succesfully model impulsive data. alpha-stable distributions have found applications {{in areas such as}} radar signal processing, audio restoration, financial time series modelling and image processing. Various work on linear parametric models with alpha-stable innovations {{have been reported in the}} literature. However, some recent work has demonstrated that linear models are not in general adequate to capture all characteristics of heavy-tailed data. Moreover, it is known that the optimal minimum dispersion estimator for alpha-stable data is not necessarily linear. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest a shift in the interest to nonlinear parametric models for problems involving alpha-stable distributions. In particular, we study a simple yet analytic nonlinear random process model namely polynomial autoregressive alpha-stable processes. Polynomial autoregression and Volterra filtering have been successful models for some biomedical and seismic signals reflecting their underlying nonlinear generation mechanisms. In this paper, we employ alpha-stable processes instead of classical Gaussian distribution as innovation sequence and arrive at a model capable of describing unsymmetric as well as impulsive characteristics. We provide a number of novel adaptive and block type algorithms for the estimation of model parameters of this class of nonlinear processes efficiently. Simulation results on synthetic data demonstrate clearly the superiority of the novel algorithms to classical techniques. The paper concludes with a discussion of the application areas of the techniques developed in the paper, including impulsive <b>noise</b> <b>suppression,</b> nonlinear <b>system</b> identification, target tracking and nonlinear channel equalization...|$|R
