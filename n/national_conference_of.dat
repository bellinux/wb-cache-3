5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill.

In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Ford rebuilt the state's Democratic machine, which would help elect him and others, including Senator Walter Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins. When Governor Nunn asked the legislature to increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted. Ford lost this battle; the increase passed without exemptions. From 1970 to 1971, Ford {{was a member of}} the Executive Committee of the <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Lieutenant Governors.|$|E

5|$|Mandela took Xuma's {{place on}} the ANC {{national}} executive in March 1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression {{and the introduction of}} the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups. At the ANC <b>national</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.|$|E

5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for lieutenant governor entered the race, {{the most formidable}} being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge.

Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Lieutenant Governors.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted {{in the emergence of}} a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first <b>national</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.|$|E
5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} {{they hear the}} case.

Both parties consented to the filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson.

5|$|The Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act, first {{tentative}} {{draft in}} 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, {{was a result}} of work by the <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the Harrison Act in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose. As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics encouraged state governments to adopt the act. By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.|$|E
