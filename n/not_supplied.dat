This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was <b>not</b> <b>supplied,</b> but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.|$|E

The Bulgarians used siege {{machines}} {{on a large}} scale for the first time during the reign of Khan Krum (803-814), when they employed Arab renegades to gain experience. By 814 they possessed a large number of enormous siege machines - battering rams, ballistas, mangonels, catapults, siege towers, machines against battlements. They were transported by 5,000 iron-covered carts, hauled by 10,000 oxen. In addition, after the siege of Mesembria, the Bulgarians captured 36 copper siphons which the Byzantines used to throw the famous Greek fire.|$|E

In another case, Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans (1982), a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in Surinder Singh Kanda v.

2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{informal}} logic {{has been}} partnered and even equated, {{in the minds}} of many, with critical thinking. The precise definition of [...] "critical thinking" [...] is a subject of much dispute. Critical thinking, as defined by Johnson, is the evaluation of an intellectual product (an argument, an explanation, a theory) in terms of its strengths and weaknesses. While critical thinking will include evaluation of arguments and hence require skills of argumentation including informal logic, critical thinking requires additional abilities <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> by informal logic, such as the ability to obtain and assess information and to clarify meaning. Also, many believe that critical thinking requires certain dispositions. Understood in this way, [...] "critical thinking" [...] is a broad term for the attitudes and skills that are involved in analyzing and evaluating arguments. The critical thinking movement promotes critical thinking as an educational ideal. The movement emerged with great force in the '80s in North America as part of an ongoing critique of education as regards the thinking skills not being taught.|$|E

Furthermore, it is alleged that the explosive materials used were <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> from secret bases in Chechnya but from GRU stockpiles near Moscow." [...] The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta stated that the Basayev brothers [...] "both recruited as agents by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff (GRU) in 1991–92."

Tests by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Boscombe Down showed the Airacobra reached [...] at 13,000ft (3,962m). The cockpit layout was criticized, and {{it was noted that}} the pilot would have difficulty in bailing out in an emergency because the cockpit roof could not be jettisoned.
