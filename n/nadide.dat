40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This study was {{designed}} to investigate the problematic areas in paragraph translation from Turkish into English and to examine the effect of interaction on group work while students translated from Turkish into English in translation courses at Hacettepe University, School of Foreign Languages, Department of PostPreparatory English Courses, in which the final stage is a translation course. The translation course, which combines previously learned skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, attempts to develop the awareness of differences between Turkish and English in grammar, semantics, and discourse. In order to collect data, error analysis and interaction analysis were used. While the first stage of the study investigated translation as product in English, the second stage dealt with the process of translation as well as the analysis of students’ written translations. Observation of errors revealed that students produced errors in the areas grammar, semantics and discourse. Problems with grammar included the present perfect tense, past progressive tense, and the passive voice. Problems with semantics included issues such as collocations and deciding which terms to use when an L 1 term had multiple equivalents. Students were also observed to perform translation work better when working in groups rather than when working individually. Erer, <b>Nadide</b> GüherM. S...|$|E
40|$|Ankara : The Department of Graphic Design, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2012. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes biblioraphical {{references}} 43 - 44. Animation is a {{form that}} allows the animator to enter a world of impossibilities. Things that are hard or impossible to show in live action become easier or possible in animation. The animator as a subject animates an object that has no life, soul and movement. So the whole relationship is between the subject and object. French philosopher Sartre, on the other hand, plays with the concepts of subject and object when he constructs his philosophy on existence especially in Other concept. When a man confronts with another one, he puts the other in an object form in his world. As the one does so, the other also does the same, i. e. puts the other in an object form. When they confront and become objects for the other’s world they start judging each other. The Other, for this reason, is hell, according to Sartre. Animator’s Hell is a clay animation, which attempts to integrate Jean Paul Sartre’s concepts of subject - object relations and the Other into animation. It {{tells the story of}} an animator who defines an object for her animation but later faces with {{the fact that it is}} actually a subject. The characters in the film become hell for each other, and try to be recognized. Akgülgil, <b>Nadide</b> GizemM. S...|$|E
