To investigate this ' we conducted a case control study of 180 matched pairs of peptic ulcer patients and controls obtained from surgical and dermatology outpatient clinics.

The acetaminophen group had virtually no observed mucosal injury and this was statistically significant in comparison with the other groups (p< 0 - 01).
