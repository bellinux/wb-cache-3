Percent mortality in plots monitored over the entire summer was 8. 6, 3. 6 and 8. 0 in sections 31, 36, and 37 respectively, and ranged from 0 to as high as 21. 9 in individual mortality plots. Percent mortality in sections 31 and 37 was similar and significantly greater than in section 36, indicating variation in conditions associated with individual sections. Percent mortality combined for sections 36 and 37 (seed source 72 - 180) was significantly less than that for section 31 (seed source 72 - 144) indicating variation in host or seed lot susceptibility or tolerance. Higher rates of application, 28 and 42 pounds active per acre, applied during a second treatment period were ineffective. Because of experimental design inadequacies, however, the results are inconclusive. Bioassay studies to determine chemical distribution in soil and within seedlings were generally negative. Reasons for lack of control and negative assays are discussed. Isolation studies did reveal a high frequency of occurrence of Fusariuin spp. in dead seedlings, and disease expression increased with increasing summer temperatures, implicating fusarial pathogens in the causal complex...|$|R

In 1980, the fifth year of the primary school returned to Boulevard de la Foire, with the third and fourth years following in 1985. In December 1987, the Board of Governors of the European Schools made a request to the Luxembourg government for additional buildings, with the government agreeing in October 1988 on a plan that would involve the phased closure of the Boulevard de la Foire site in conjunction with the renovation and extension of the Kirchberg campus. A new nursery building was opened on Kirchberg in 1993. In July 1998, work started on the new primary and secondary school buildings, a long with a new canteen and theatre.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to study the {{thoughts}} and intentions of preschool teachers in two different kindergartens have been, how they have designed the physical indoor environment. We also wanted to study how {{they look at the}} physical indoor environment to children's learning and also the child perspective and epistemological pre-school teachers and how they are reflected in the environment. One was a Reggio Emilia inspired preschool and the other a nursery school without any specific direction. We chose to limit our investigation to two <b>nursery</b> with <b>sections</b> where the children were aged 1 - 2 years. The study included three pre-school teachers from each of pre-school in the interviews. We chose to study on this problem area on which we based on our past experience has seen that there are very big differences in how the preschool teachers at various nursery schools have chosen to develop the physical indoor environment. These differences contributed to that we wanted to show what these differences are based, as we believe that the physical indoor environment is very important for children's opportunities to explore and be challenged, which in turn contributes to the development of children. In our view, we chose to include highlighting past research on the nursery has been developed to date, the curriculum for pre-school approach to children's learning and development, and the physical environment to children's learning. Our study was a qualitative study where we used interviews and observations as data collection methods. Our results indicate that the preschool teachers at both of them based on their age and interests when they are continuously designing the physical indoor environment. The purpose of the material's availability, the room's design is that it will enable the children to be independent and make their own choices. All pre-school teachers believe that the physical indoor environment has a significant impact on children's learning. Our results indicate that preschool teachers have a lot of similar thoughts and intentions regarding the physical indoor environment design but based on our observations, we feel that in practice is reflected in different ways in each preschool. Our results also show that preschool teachers' way of thinking at both preschools differ on how they reflected on their child perspective and approach to knowledge and how it is expressed in the physical indoor environment.

40|$|UK {{nurseries}} {{are required}} {{to carry out a}} progress check with two-year-olds {{in a number of areas}} of development, including language. Nurseries may use any format (Blades et al., 2014). Many use a format based on the guidance produced by DfE’s Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) ‘my unique child’ whereby each of the child’s developmental domains is assigned to an age band (e. g. 22 - 36 months). Since significant delays in the receptive language of two-year-olds are more predictive of later language and other developmental difficulties than are delays in expressive language (Chiat & Roy, 2008, 2013; Beitchman et al., 1996), we compared this current keyworker method of assessment with two other tools in relation to a direct standardized assessment of receptive language. Seventy monolingual 30 - 35 -month-olds were included. The direct measure was the auditory component of the Preschool Language Scale (PLS), which has been found to have high predictive validity (Chiat & Roy, 2008). The same children were assessed by their keyworkers on three language screening measures: the Language Use Inventory (LUI), the WellComm and the EYFS ‘my unique child’ language and communication <b>sections.</b> <b>Nursery</b> workers also rated children’s attentional difficulties. The Wellcomm had acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity but only when we adapted the manual guidelines. Both the EYFS and LUI had poor sensitivity.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 This thesis {{examines}} the competitive aspects of Douglas-fir trees growing with two commonly associated competitors [...] red alder and grass [...] at varying densities. Two Nelder plots {{in three different}} environments in the Oregon Coast Range were studied. The sites represented the warm, dry climate of the Willamette Valley; the warm, moist climate of the valleys of the mid-range; and the cool, moist climate found along the fog belt {{a few miles from}} the Pacific Ocean. Plots ranged in spacing from 300 to 15250 cm²/tree and consisted of six "pie-shaped" treatments. The plots had been previously planted in the spring of 1978 with 2 - 0 bare root Douglas-fir <b>nursery</b> stock. Two <b>sections</b> were interplanted with red alder, and two sections were broadcast seeded with grass the following year. Measurements indicate that Douglas-fir growth is inhibited by red alder and grass competition as well as competition from other Douglas-fir. Grass competition is severe only during the initial years of the plantation, while red alder competition becomes more pronounced with time. Growth is a function of density, competitor type, and site, and significant interactions occur among the three. Leaf area per tree of Douglas-fir under competition can be predicted by leaf weight, stand density, and competitor type. The formation of shade needles in response to density and competitor type increases the leaf area:leaf weight ratio. Growth efficiency (stemwood volume production/unit of leaf area) is not highest for the most vigorous trees. On a per hectare basis, high productivity is correlated with high leaf area index, but the relation is reversed on a per tree basis...|$|R
