When jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities, those willing to work beyond their regular CPS jobs could earn extra spending money.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided for the divergent and convergent validity of its items. It {{is considered to be}} the Swiss Army knife of motivation measures: A small but versatile tool for understanding the complexity of human attitudes and behaviours...|$|R

5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and <b>needs.</b> <b>The</b> Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E

In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's <b>needs,</b> <b>the</b> Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport <b>needs.</b> <b>The</b> unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E
