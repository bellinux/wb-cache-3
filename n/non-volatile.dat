5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigation is}} {{not restricted to}} retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of these devices have volatile memory while some have <b>non-volatile</b> memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from <b>non-volatile</b> memory sources. Depending {{on the type of}} devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics investigation is branched into various types.|$|E
5|$|Only two osmium {{compounds}} {{have major}} applications: osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy {{and for the}} oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis, and the <b>non-volatile</b> osmates for organic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{is due to}} be eclipsed at Oak Ridge by Summit in 2018, {{which is}} being built by IBM and {{features}} fewer nodes with much greater GPU capability per node {{as well as local}} per-node <b>non-volatile</b> caching of file data from the system's parallel file system.|$|E
5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of {{protactinium}} are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic structure {{composed of}} double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow <b>non-volatile</b> solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural {{to that of other}} actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E
5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, <b>non-volatile</b> molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament was {{released}} for the Mega Drive in 1994. The cartridge features a <b>non-volatile</b> memory (NVR) chip that stores lap times and game achievements. The game was ported to MS-DOS, Game Gear, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and Game Boy. An Amiga version was also planned. Codemasters handled {{development for the}} Game Gear version, which began in September 1994, and the port {{was released}} in spring 1995. The MS-DOS version was published in North America by GameTek on 31 May 1996. The European PC release was by Codemasters in July 1995. The SNES and Game Boy versions were published by Ocean Software.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of <b>non-volatile</b> ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then <b>non-volatile</b> major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The cartridge has {{a small amount of}} <b>non-volatile</b> RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge. Sega planned to release a single cartridge version of both games titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The purest metal is {{obtained}} from nickel oxide by the Mond process, which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99%. The process was patented by Ludwig Mond {{and has been}} in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In this process, nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide {{in the presence of a}} sulfur catalyst at around 40–80°C to form nickel carbonyl. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, the nickel may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a <b>non-volatile</b> solid.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} <b>non-volatile,</b> fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
25|$|When a 2-terminal, <b>non-volatile</b> {{memory device}} {{is found to}} be in a {{distinct}} resistance state {j}, there exists therefore no physical one-to-one relationship between its present state and its foregoing voltage history. The switching behavior of individual <b>non-volatile</b> memory devices can thus per se not be described within the mathematical framework proposed for memristor/memristive systems.|$|E
25|$|Flash {{memory is}} an {{electronic}} (solid-state) <b>non-volatile</b> computer storage medium {{that can be}} electrically erased and reprogrammed.|$|E
25|$|In memristors, under externally-applied {{electric}} field, {{shock waves}} can be launched across the transition-metal oxides, creating fast and <b>non-volatile</b> resistivity changes.|$|E
25|$|Secure Digital (SD) is a <b>non-volatile</b> {{memory card}} format {{developed}} by the SD Card Association (SDA) for use in portable devices.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-Volatile</b> Memory Solutions Group 4% of 2016 {{revenues}} manufactures NAND {{flash memory}} and 3D XPoint, branded as Optane, products primarily used in solid-state drives.|$|E
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, experts {{speculate}} that <b>non-volatile</b> RAM types like PCM (phase-change memory), RRAM (resistive random-access memory), or MRAM (magnetoresistive random-access memory) could replace DDR4 SDRAM and its successors.|$|E
25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is defined}} as distillation {{in the presence of}} a miscible, high boiling, relatively <b>non-volatile</b> component, the solvent, that forms no azeotrope with the other components in the mixture.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Leon Chua {{published}} a tutorial underlining the broad span of complex phenomena and applications that memristors span {{and how they}} can be used as <b>non-volatile</b> analog memories and can mimic classic habituation and learning phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Similar is {{the effect}} of {{reducing}} the mobile phase flow rate to the nanolitre-per-minute range since, in addition to resulting in improved desolvation, the smaller droplets formed are more tolerant to the presence of <b>non-volatile</b> species in the sample matrix.|$|E
25|$|Thiourea is {{also used}} in the reductive workup of {{ozonolysis}} to give carbonyl compounds. Dimethyl sulfide is also an effective reagent for this reaction, but it is highly volatile (b.p.) and has an obnoxious odor whereas thiourea is odorless and conveniently <b>non-volatile</b> (reflecting its polarity).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} hybrid {{techniques}} such as hybrid drive and ReadyBoost that attempt to combine the advantages of both technologies, using flash as a high-speed <b>non-volatile</b> cache for files on the disk that are often referenced, but rarely modified, such as application and operating system executable files.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a library}} {{is a collection}} of <b>non-volatile</b> resources used by computer programs, often to develop software. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.|$|E
25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive, or hard drive, hard disk, or fixed disk drive, is a <b>non-volatile</b> storage device which stores {{digitally}} encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. The {{hard disk drive}} was invented by Reynold Johnson and commercially introduced in 1956 with the IBM 305 RAMAC computer.|$|E
25|$|As a result, simple {{distillation}} {{is effective}} {{only when the}} liquid boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25°C) or when separating liquids from <b>non-volatile</b> solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually different enough that the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial plants make leaf waxes to {{coat the}} {{surfaces}} of their leaves as an adaptation to minimize water loss. These waxes are largely straight-chain n-alkyl lipids. They are insoluble, <b>non-volatile,</b> chemically inert, and resistant to degradation, making them easily preserved in the sedimentary record, and therefore good targets as biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|The third {{proposed}} {{theory for}} ion suppression in ESI {{relates to the}} presence of <b>non-volatile</b> species which can either cause co-precipitation of analyte in the droplet (thus preventing ionisation) or prevent the contraction of droplet size to the critical radius required for the ion evaporation and/or charge residue mechanisms to form gas phase ions efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{circuits}} called fractional-n {{phase lock}} loops (frac-N PLLs) multiply the resonator’s mechanical frequencies to the oscillator’s output frequencies. These highly specialized PLLs set the output frequencies under control of digital state machines. The state machines {{are controlled by}} calibration and program data stored in <b>non-volatile</b> memory and adjust the PLL configurations to compensate for temperature variations.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the Yellow Book CD-ROM {{standard}} was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a <b>non-volatile</b> optical data computer data storage medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{mode and}} {{hibernation}} can be combined: The contents of RAM are copied to the <b>non-volatile</b> storage {{and the computer}} enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, and its state, including open and unsaved files, survives a power outage. Hybrid sleep consumes as much power as sleep mode while hibernation powers down the computer.|$|E
25|$|The Computer Command System (CCS), {{the central}} {{controller}} of the spacecraft, is two 18-bit word, interrupt type processors with 4096 words each of plated wire, <b>non-volatile</b> memory. During {{most of the}} Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main (<b>non-volatile)</b> storage medium.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of cannabis infusions {{owing to the}} variety of <b>non-volatile</b> solvents used. The plant material is mixed with the solvent and then pressed and filtered to express the oils of the plant into the solvent. Examples of solvents used in this process are cocoa butter, dairy butter, cooking oil, glycerine, and skin moisturizers. Depending on the solvent, these {{may be used in}} cannabis foods or applied topically.|$|E
25|$|Attractive {{fields for}} current and {{potential}} utilization of polyaniline is in antistatics, charge dissipation or electrostatic dispersive (ESD) coatings and blends, electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI), anticorrosive coatings, hole injection layers, transparent conductors, {{indium tin oxide}} replacements, actuators, chemical vapor and solution based sensors, electrochromic coatings (for color change windows, mirrors etc.), PEDOT-PSS replacements, toxic metal recovery, catalysis, fuel cells and active electronic components such as for <b>non-volatile</b> memory.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem for}} the early twenty-first century {{is the fact that}} the organic {{component}} of any deposited material is readily destroyed by heat, such as occurs when a gun is fired or a bomb is detonated, when the temperature may reach as high as 500°C. Encouragingly, however, the <b>non-volatile</b> inorganic component of eccrine secretion has been shown to remain intact even when exposed to temperatures as high as 600°C.|$|E
25|$|RFID tags contain {{at least}} three parts: an {{integrated}} circuit for storing and processing information that modulates and demodulates a radio-frequency (RF) signals; a means of collecting DC power from the incident reader signal; and an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal. The tag information is stored in a <b>non-volatile</b> memory. The RFID tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.|$|E
