5|$|Back in the warehouse, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{strike up a}} {{relationship}} with a new warehouse worker, Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), observing Gabe's pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val does <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same way, but to no avail. When Gabe does ask Val out, she politely declines and says she does not date co-workers. Darryl hears all of this and decides he will not pursue Val either.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{after the}} game's release, Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight {{director}} Tetsu Katano remarked {{that although he}} did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> Werehog concept was a mistake, time and resources were a limiting factor in the game's production. He also remarked that the Werehog may reappear in future games, or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed, should one be made.|$|E
5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because {{he was the only one}} who confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker {{said he could not}} hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it would hold.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced shaking at Pangandaran (where the M6.3 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake {{was felt}} more strongly) of intensity III–IV (Weak–Light), intensity III at Cianjur, and II (Weak) at Yogyakarta. Further inland and {{farther from the}} epicenter, intensity IV shaking made tall buildings sway in Jakarta, but at some coastal villages {{where many of the}} casualties occurred, the shaking was not felt as strong. An informal survey of 67 people that were present at the time revealed that in at least eight cases, individuals stated that they did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> earthquake at all (a typical M7.7 earthquake would have been distinctly noticed at those distances). The unusually low felt intensities, along with the short period body wave magnitudes, were components of the event that narrowed its classification into that of a tsunami earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E

She feels it is to soon after husband Dan's death and does <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same, leaving him upset. Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) then helps him track down Jai, a boy from Phuket whom he told he would help, but never did. He comes to live with Miles, their {{relationship}} is strained by Jai's reluctance to trust him, eventually they become close. Religious Christine Jones (Elizabeth Alexander) later starts a campaign to have Miles removed from his job when she does not agree with his choice of book used for teaching. Morag later helps rid of Christine and saves his career. He lets Melody Jones stay with him, but she rebels and causes trouble for him with her new-found bad attitude. He then has a brief relationship with Jazz Curtis (Rachel Gordon).|$|E
5|$|Walker had protested in vain against {{releasing}} the brigade, believing {{he needed it}} and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 17th Infantry Regiment and the 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves. Walker did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it could hold back the North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic clergy at {{the time}} of the new Republic were keenly aware that anti-British {{sentiment}} made their canonical allegiance to Bishop Richard Challoner, the vicar-apostolic of the London district, somewhat suspect. As a result, they explored various options. When Bishop Challoner died in 1781, his successor, James Talbot, refused to exercise jurisdiction in the new nation. But the American clergy, then numbering some two dozen, did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> time was right to have a bishop appointed in the new nation.|$|E

25|$|Hancock {{wrote the}} piece to help sell his debut album as a leader, Takin' Off (1962), on Blue Note Records; {{it was the}} first piece of music he had ever {{composed}} with a commercial goal in mind. The popularity of the piece, due primarily to Mongo Santamaría, paid Hancock's bills for five or six years. Hancock did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> composition was a sellout however, describing that structurally, it was one of his strongest pieces due to its almost mathematical balance.|$|E
25|$|Including {{the lower}} bending stiffness, {{composite}} baseball bats {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving because {{if they do not}} make contact with the ball on the sweet spot, they will <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E

Houston's first film role was in The Bodyguard, released in 1992 and co-starring Kevin Costner. Houston played Rachel Marron, a star who is stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard to protect her. USA Today listed {{it as one of}} the 25 most memorable movie moments of the last 25 years in 2007. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind.|$|E

25|$|The {{member states}} can assess {{merchandise}} from these areas {{with the common}} external tariff used for Mercosur merchandise, or, {{in the case of}} certain special products, the domestic tariff prevailing in each individual state. In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, in the case of certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local companies do <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> need to compete with large international companies.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E
25|$|Weinzweig’s {{move toward}} {{serialism}} {{was not a}} complete transition; he was very selective and deliberate in which principles he chose to adopt. While he acknowledged that Schoenberg’s influence on the musical world was powerful, he was not particularly taken with Schoeberg’s music and preferred that of composers such as Berg and Webern. His attraction to serialism {{was not the same}} as that of its Viennese founders. Since he was not taught strictly using tonality in his early education, he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> need to rebel and use serialism simply as a means to avoid tonality. While he often employed the techniques used by Stravinsky, Bartók, Copland and Varèse, he did not teach these methods to his students exclusively.|$|E

Not {{long after the}} lockout ended, Howard, who was eligible to become a free agent {{at the end of}} the season, demanded a trade to the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers or Dallas Mavericks. Howard stated that although his preference was to remain in Orlando, he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> Magic organization was doing enough to build a championship contender. He would later meet with Magic officials and agree to back off his trade demands, but stated that he also felt the team needed to make changes to the roster if they wanted to contend for a championship.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd Webber {{returned}} to the project in 2006, collaborating {{with a number of}} writers and directors. However, he still did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> ideas he had were adaptable into a piece of musical theatre. Finally, in early 2007, Lloyd Webber approached Ben Elton (who had served as the librettist for Lloyd Webber's The Beautiful Game) to help shape a synopsis for a sequel, based on Lloyd Webber's initial ideas. Elton's treatment of the story focused more on the original characters of The Phantom of the Opera and omitted new characters that Lloyd Webber and Forsyth had developed. Lloyd Webber was pleased with Elton's treatment and began work on the sequel. In March 2007, he announced he would be moving forward with the project.|$|E
25|$|The police further {{speculated that}} the victims did not {{initially}} realize the danger they were facing, {{the location of the}} bodies in the estate's second floor indicated that they did not consider escaping when they faced their intruder, and in spite of the unexpected and dramatic break-in nobody made any effort to alert the police or others. One explanation may be that the victims initially did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> intruder to be threatening or did not see it necessary to contact the police. The fact that Kristian Orderud was killed while lying in his bed, indicated that the perpetrator was not a random predator without intimate knowledge of the family, but rather knew exactly who his victims were. This was backed up by the fact that nothing was missing from the house, ruling out a robbery.|$|E
