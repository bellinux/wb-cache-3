The squadron operated a site near Elizondo, Spain, one of seven Radar sites in Spain operated by the 65th Air Division which provided early warning of unidentified aircraft and controlled <b>NATO</b> <b>airspace</b> over the region. the 874th AC&W and other geographically separated radar squadrons in Spain was supported logistically by the host units at Zaragoza.|$|E

The CAOC in Uedem's primary peacetime role is the tactical Command and Control of Quick- Reaction Alert Forces used to police <b>NATO</b> <b>airspace</b> above the Benelux countries, above Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States (Baltic Air Policing). There are also over 50 Control and Reporting Centres and Points, plus linkages with civilian air traffic control networks.|$|E

50|$|NATO STANAG 4671 is the NATO Standardized Agreement 4671 {{which is}} the UAV SYSTEM AIRWORTHINESS REQUIREMENTS (USAR). It is {{intended}} to allow military Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate in other <b>NATO</b> members <b>airspace.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 86th AD {{always had}} one flight of interceptors in the air. A normal sortie lasted about 90 minutes. Along with the {{airborne}} aircraft, each squadron had {{two to four}} aircraft in an alert hangar, with one pair on five-minute and the other pair on fifteen minute alert (although in November 1963, this was changed to a thirty-minute alert). An additional two squadron aircraft were maintained on a one-hour standby. [...] The main peacetime mission for the interceptors was the identification of unknown aircraft in the ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone). This was a thirty-mile wide zone between Communist-controlled areas and <b>NATO</b> <b>airspace.</b> Between two and four alert scrambles happened weekly to identify intruders. These were usually airliners or private aircraft off their track or flight plan. In addition, each squadron was tasked to provide assistance to pilots in distress.|$|E
40|$|What {{has come}} to be called the ‘refugee crisis’ {{is the latest in a}} series of crises bedevilling the European Union – the four-fold monetary, budgetary, {{economic}} and financial ‘Euro-crisis’; a geopolitical security challenge posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war in Syria and incursions into <b>NATO</b> <b>airspace,</b> and a looming Brexit, combined with the possible fragmentation of old EU member states like the United Kingdom and Spain. The ‘refugee crisis’ is the most serious of all. It encapsulates the EU’s failings and failures that other crises laid bare: the lack of long-term prevision and strategy, an overburdened decision-making system, and an outmoded conception of sovereignty. It goes to the very heart of the EU, for three reasons: Firstly, the cleavages it creates between member states add to those that have been dividing the EU since the early days of the Euro-crisis; secondly, the massive displacement of populations gives rise to complex problems, sparking controversies that weaken the social and political fabric of individual member states and feed into populism and xenophobia; and, thirdly, the German Chancellor, who has played a crucial role in alleviating, if not solving, other crises, is facing domestic and European rebellions for her handling of the refugee issue. Will the agreement that the EU and Turkey concluded on 18 March 2016 manage to limit the influx of refugees, patch up differences, and re-establish Angela Merkel’s authority in Germany and in the Union...|$|E
50|$|The first NATO {{troops to}} enter Pristina on 12 June 1999 were Norwegian special forces from FSK Forsvarets Spesialkommando and {{soldiers}} from the British Special Air Service's 22 SAS, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The Norwegian soldiers from FSK Forsvarets Spesialkommando {{were the first to}} come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport and to report back to Mike Jackson. At 5 am on 12 June the British 5th Airborne Brigade began flying into Kosovo from Skopje to secure the ten mile long Kačanik Gorge for 4th Armoured Brigade to pass through to Pristina. Jackson flew by helicopter to Pristina in the evening to hold a press conference, then went to meet two star general Victor Zavarzin who commanded the small Russian force. Sheltering from heavy rain in the wrecked airport terminal Jackson shared a flask of whisky with him, leading to a warming of relations. That evening Clark still seemed obsessed with the possibility of more Russian troops being flown in even though <b>NATO</b> controlled the <b>airspace.</b> Russia had placed several airbases on standby, and prepared battalions of paratroopers to depart for Pristina on Il-76 military transport planes. Fearing that Russian aircraft were heading for the airport, General Clark planned to order helicopters to block the runway, and requested American Admiral James O. Ellis for helicopter support. Jackson's staff contacted the US brigade and were told that the Americans were using their right to opt out of the operation. Two hours later they called to say that the operation was back on again. Bad weather however made this impossible at that time.|$|R
