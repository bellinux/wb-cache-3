25|$|Innovative {{solutions}} {{have been}} conceived {{to deal with}} nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts. Nutrient remediation {{is a form of}} environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In environmental remediation <b>nutrient</b> <b>removal</b> technologies include biofiltration, which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, riparian areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development. Biofiltration utilizes biological assimilation to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of <b>nutrient</b> <b>removal</b> is bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, called biostimulation.|$|E
25|$|After the EPA had {{introduced}} watershed-based NPDES permitting in 2007, interest in <b>nutrient</b> <b>removal</b> and achieving regional TMDLs {{led to the}} development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a type of water quality trading, a market-based policy instrument used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater. By June 2010, there were 1,519 municipal wastewater treatment plants in China and 18 plants were added each week. Many existing plants are being expanded and upgraded to include a tertiary treatment stage for <b>nutrient</b> <b>removal</b> to comply with more stringent discharge standards introduced in 2002. In terms of technologies, in 2007, the most commonly used technologies were various forms of activated sludge, including oxidation ditches (24% of all plants), sequencing batch reactors (11%), conventional activated sludge (5%) and membrane bioreactors. In small communities, plants using only primary treatment were still common (15% of all plants). An analysis in 2004 by the Ministry of Construction showed that, according to treatment plant records, most plants operated in compliance with discharge standards.|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus {{removal and}} {{recovery}} from domestic wastewater is urgent nowadays. A novel process of <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal</b> coupled with phosphorus recovery from domestic sewage was proposed and optimization of induced crystallization reaction {{was performed in}} this study. The results showed that 92. 3 % of phosphorus recovery via induced Hydroxyapatite crystallization was achieved at the optimum process parameters: reaction time of 80 min, seed crystal loads of 60 g/L, pH of 8. 5, Ca/P mole ratio of 2. 0 and 4. 0 L/min aeration rate when the PO 43 [...] P concentration was 10 mg/L in the influent, displaying an excellent phosphorus recovery performance. Importantly, {{it was found that}} the effect of reaction temperature on induced Hydroxyapatite crystallization was slight, thus favoring practical application of phosphorus recovery method described in this study.

40|$|Although {{based on}} limited {{empirical}} data, concerns {{have been raised}} that increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>removals</b> associated with full-tree harvesting on shallow-soiled sites may result in reduced productivity in subsequent rotations.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performances}} obtained in full scale anaerobic digesters co-digesting waste activated sludge from biological <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal</b> wastewater treatment plants, together with different types of organic wastes (solid and liquid). Results showed that the biogas production can be increased from 4, 000 to some 18, 000 m 3 per month when treating some 3 – 5 tons per day of organic municipal solid waste together with waste activated sludge. On the other hand, the specific biogas production was improved, passing from 0. 3 to 0. 5 m 3 per kgVS fed the reactor, when treating liquid effluents from cheese factories. The addition of the co-substrates gave minimal increases in the organic loading rate while the hydraulic retention time remained constant. Further, the potentiality of the struvite crystallisation process for treating anaerobic supernatant rich in nitrogen and phosphorus was studied: 80 % removal of phosphorus was observed in all the tested conditions. In conclusion, a possible layout is proposed for designing or up-grading wastewater treatment plants for biological <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal</b> process. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio {{variation}} in a University of Cape Town Membrane bioreactor (UCT-MBR) was investigated. The experimental campaign was divided into two phases, each characterized by a different C/N ratio (namely, 10 and 5, Phase I and Phase II, respectively). The UCT-MBR pilot plant was analysed in terms of carbon and <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal,</b> biomass respiratory activity, activated sludge features and membrane fouling. The results highlighted that the <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal</b> was significantly affected by the decrease of the C/N ratio during the Phase II. The biological carbon removal was also affected by the low C/N value during the Phase II. Indeed, the average biological COD removal efficiency was equal to 72. 9 % during the Phase II, while the average value was 82. 8 % in the Phase I. The respirometric batch test suggested that both heterotrophic and autotrophic species were severely affected by the lower C/N ratio in the Phase II. Moreover, a decrease of the membrane filtration properties was observed during the Phase II, mainly due to the worsening of the activated sludge features, which enhanced the increase of SMP production...|$|R

40|$|Fertilization has a {{great impact}} on GHG {{emissions}} and crop nutrient requirements play an important role on the sustainability of cropping systems. In the case of bioenergy production, low concentration of nutrients in the biomass is also required for specific conversion processes (e. g. combustion). In this work, we investigated the influence of soil texture, irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rate on nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations and uptakes in Miscanthus × giganteus when harvested at two different times: early (autumn) and late (winter). Our results confirmed winter harvest to significantly reduce <b>nutrient</b> <b>removals</b> by as much as 80 % compared to autumn. On the other hand, a few {{attempts have been made to}} investigate the role of soil texture and irrigation on nutrients in miscanthus biomass, particularly in the Mediterranean. We observed an effect of soil mainly on nutrient concentrations. Similarly, irrigation led to higher nutrient concentrations, while its effect on nutrient uptakes was less straightforward. Overall, the observed differences in miscanthus nutrient uptakes as determined by the crop management (i. e. irrigation and nitrogen fertilization) were highlighted for autumn harvest only, while uptakes in all treatments were lowered to similar values when winter harvest was performed. This study stressed the importance of the time of harvest on <b>nutrient</b> <b>removals</b> regardless of the other management options. Further investigation on the environmental and economic issues should be addressed to support decisions on higher yields-higher nutrient requirements (early harvest) vs. lower yields-lower nutrient requirements (late harvest) ...|$|R

Later the study was designed in two phases which revealed interesting findings. Phase I evaluates the potential of isolated strains viz., Pseudomonas otitidis, Bacillus firmus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus circulans for their individual ability in terms of COD and <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal.</b> Bacillus circulans showed highest carbon (COD) removal (70 %; 0. 56 kg CODR/m 3 -day), while maximum <b>nutrients</b> <b>removal</b> (nitrate, 81 %; phosphates, 90 %) was observed with Bacillus subtilis. B. firmus showed maximum volatile fatty acid (VFA) production. Based on Phase I results, four synthetic consortia were designed in phase II with diverse combination of isolates and evaluated for its remediation efficiencies. Consortium 4 (P. otitidis, B. subtilis and B. firmus) illustrated higher treatment potential [COD, 86 %; SDR (cum) : 0. 64 kg CODR/m 3 -day; Nitrates, 87 %; Phosphates, 97 %]. The exploitation of such explicit consortia can overcome the inefficiencies pre-existing with the biological wastewater treatment plants by acting as prospective candidates for bio-augmenting the native microflora.
