Both effects stem from the superposition of many Newton spheres that originate from scattering events between particles from each beam. This is particularly apparent here, as the NO radicals have a very narrow velocity distribution. In the forward direction, the blurring of the image is governed by the velocity spread of the NO beam. Consequently, the <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> are found close together, and the resolution in this part of the image is high. In the backward direction, however, the resolution is mainly determined by the velocity distribution of the Ne atoms, and the <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> are spread over a larger area. For side scattering, an additional asymmetry can arise. In certain cases, the various <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> tend to overlap on one side of the relative velocity vector, while they occupy a larger area at the opposite side. A special case has been described by Chandler and coworkers to produce cold molecules with low translational temperature [20].|$|E

The power spectrum and bispectrum {{estimation of the}} pulse-like ultrasonic signal used in the commercial SAM (scanning acoustic microscopy) equipment is especially considered in this study. The usefulness of the proposed estimation is confirmed by experiments for a <b>Newton</b> <b>ring</b> with a continuous air gap and a real semiconductor sample with local delaminations.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{appearance}} of transient <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> in dielectrics (sapphire and lead-oxide glass) during ablation with single fs laser pulses. Employing femtosecond microscopy with 800 nm excitation and 400 nm illumination, we observe a characteristic ring pattern that dynamically changes for increasing delay times between pump and probe pulse. Such transient <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> have been previously observed in metals and semiconductors at fluences above the ablation threshold and were related to optical interference of the probe beam reflected at the front surface of the ablating layer and at the interface of the non-ablating substrate. Yet, it had been generally assumed that this phenomenon cannot be (and has not been) observed in dielectrics due to the different ablation mechanism and optical properties of dielectrics. The {{fact that we are}} able to observe them has important consequences for the comprehension of the ablation mechanisms in dielectrics and provides a new method for investigating these mechanisms in more detail.

We exploit <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> interference patterns to study the deformation of a double-layer graphene drum 13. 2 micrometer in diameter when a pressure step is applied. By studying the time evolution of the deformation, we find that filling the drum cavity with air is 2 - 5 times slower than when it is purged...|$|E

Cancer took his mother four years later. Ring was hence an orphan {{at the age of}} fourteen. Depressed from the {{combination}} of losing his parents and the difficulties of his disability, Ring dropped out of high school. Ring specifically struggled with losing his mother, the only woman he believed would love him. According to Ring, he attempted to commit suicide many times {{over the course of the}} following two years due to his depression. With the encouragement of his sister, however, he gave his life to Jesus in 1970 and returned to Liberty High School in Liberty, Missouri, where he graduated in 1971. Ring earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from William Jewell College in Liberty in 1976, where he was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.His new signature message is [...] "I have cerebral palsy, but cerebral palsy don't have me."

Three different types of scattering patterns can be identified. The most frequent pattern of concentric rings reflects {{the event of a}} single spherical cluster in focus. Fine interference rings similar to <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> appear when two clusters are illuminated at ?m distance, revealing three-dimensional information about the location of the clusters. Between 10 and 30 % of all hits show a previously unknown twin cluster configuration with two clusters in direct contact.

40|$|A {{study of}} the surface {{modification}} induced by single femtosecond laser pulses in phosphate glass has revealed surface swelling at fluences just below the ablation threshold. This behavior {{is different from that}} observed in other dielectric materials. Optical micrographs obtained with monochromatic light show a pattern of <b>Newton</b> <b>rings</b> within the swollen region whose number scales inversely with the illumination wavelength, acting as a micro Fabry-Perot etalon. The swollen surface layer has lower refractive index than the bulk glass and can reach a maximum thickness of 820 nm. We relate these findings to results obtained during subsurface waveguide writing inside phosphate glass, which also show a refractive index decrease at energies near threshold for waveguide fabrication. We have identified low density free-electron plasma to be the trigger of the refractive index change. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Ring Image Analyzer {{software}} analyzes {{images to}} recognize elliptical patterns. It determines the ellipse parameters (axes ratio, centroid coordinate, tilt angle). The program attempts to recognize elliptical fringes (e. g., <b>Newton</b> <b>Rings)</b> on a photograph and determine their centroid position, the short-to-long-axis ratio, and {{the angle of}} rotation of the long axis relative to the horizontal direction on the photograph. These capabilities are important in interferometric imaging and control of surfaces. In particular, {{this program has been}} developed and applied for determining the rim shape of precision-machined optical whispering gallery mode resonators. The program relies on a unique image recognition algorithm aimed at recognizing elliptical shapes, but can be easily adapted to other geometric shapes. It is robust against non-elliptical details of the image and against noise. Interferometric analysis of precision-machined surfaces remains an important technological instrument in hardware development and quality analysis. This software automates and increases the accuracy of this technique. The software has been developed for the needs of an R&TD-funded project and has become an important asset for the future research proposal to NASA as well as other agencies...|$|E
25|$|The Sun wobbles as it rotates {{around the}} galactic center, {{dragging}} the Solar System and Earth along with it. What mathematician Kepler did in arriving at his three famous equations was curve-fit the apparent {{motions of the}} planets using Tycho Brahe's data, and not curve-fitting their true circular motions about the Sun (see Figure). Both Robert Hooke and Newton were well aware that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation did not hold for the forces associated with elliptical orbits. In fact, Newton's Universal Law {{does not account for}} the orbit of Mercury, the asteroid belt's gravitational behavior, or Saturn's <b>rings.</b> <b>Newton</b> stated (in section 11 of the Principia) that the main reason, however, for failing to predict the forces for elliptical orbits was that his math model was for a body confined to a situation that hardly existed in the real world, namely, the motions of bodies attracted toward an unmoving center. Some present physics and astronomy textbooks do not emphasize the negative significance of Newton's assumption and end up teaching that his math model is in effect reality. It is to be understood that the classical two-body problem solution above is a mathematical idealization. See also Kepler's first law of planetary motion.|$|R
