This {{is due to the}} problem of converting <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> data into money flows and the introduction of non-SNA data, compounded by issues of inconsistent <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> data (which is prevalent for many developing nations, while developed nations tend to include a SAM version of the <b>national</b> <b>account,</b> generally precise to within 1% of GDP). This was noted as early as 1984 by Mansur and Whalley, and numerous techniques have been devised to ‘adjust’ SAMs, as “inconsistent data estimated with error, is a common experience in many countries”.|$|R
25|$|The <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> balance {{would be}} {{positively}} related to carbon emissions. The <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> balance shows the difference between exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).|$|E

However, <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> principles are of great importance for financial reporting.

The analysis of these accounting issues was conducted with respect to all 28 EU member states. The results indicate that EU member states regulate their principal accounting issues through separate accounting acts or implement those issues in companies acts. Some EU member states do not have <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> standards, the <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> principles being incorporated in companies acts and <b>accounting</b> acts.

In all four of the latter countries, this fraction is an increase over 1970, but there are other countries where the sector has declined since 1970, sometimes in absolute terms, where other sectors have replaced its role in the economy. In the United States the sector has declined from 19% of GDP to 14%, though it has risen in absolute terms from $4,500 to $7,400 per capita per year. In China the sector has grown from 7.3% to 11.5%, and in India even more, from 8.4% to 18.7%. Emarketer predicts China will have the largest retail market in the world in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard {{measure that would}} indicate changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of <b>national</b> <b>accounts,</b> in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E

500|$|The {{roots of}} modern {{econometrics}} {{can be traced}} to the American economist Henry L. Moore. [...] Moore studied agricultural productivity and attempted to fit changing values of productivity for plots of corn and other crops to a curve using different values of elasticity. [...] Moore made several errors in his work, some from his choice of models and some from limitations in his use of mathematics. [...] The accuracy of Moore's models also was limited by the poor data for <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> in the United States at the time. [...] While his first models of production were static, in 1925 he published a dynamic [...] "moving equilibrium" [...] model designed to explain business cycles—this periodic variation from overcorrection in supply and demand curves is now known as the cobweb model. [...] A more formal derivation of this model was made later by Nicholas Kaldor, who is largely credited for its exposition.|$|E

Care work also involves [...] "close personal or emotional interaction." [...] Also included in this category is [...] "self-care," [...] in which leisure time and activities are included. Subsistence work is work done {{in order to meet}} basic needs, such as collecting water, but does not have market values assigned to it. Although some of these efforts [...] "are categorized as productive activities according to the latest revision of the international System of <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> (SNA) ... are poorly measured by most surveys." [...] Unpaid market work is [...] "the direct contributions of unpaid family members to market work that officially belongs to another member of the household." [...] Voluntary work is usually work done for non-household members, but in return for little to no remuneration.|$|E

2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> and governmental accounting raise the spectre of {{two sets of}} accounts, each with a similar focus, offering competing information on the net worth of government. This paper examines the reasons for preparing balance sheets for government in each system {{and the implications of}} a growing convergence in objectives between <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> and governmental accounting. While governmental accounting has a professed financial reporting objective, it is shown to have a similar economic focus to <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> therefore establishing the need for compatibility in accounting treatment. In the Australian case, difficulties in obtaining a harmonious and complementary reporting are examined using the treatment of government assets. The reconciliation problem is shown to rest mainly on differing approaches to measurement and inclusion, rather than definitional and recognition difficulties. This gap prevents the use of governmental accounting asset values in <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> and offers potential for conflicting information on both the economic and financial performance of governments. Both approaches ignore the valuation problems associated with valuing community, especially dedicated use, assets. Address for correspondence...|$|R
