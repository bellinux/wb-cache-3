Large <b>nano-onion</b> particle with diameter about 90 nm is observed on isotropic graphite after pulse irradia-tion at 30 kV for 100 times. Copper material in the cathode, has enhanced the formation of <b>nano-onion</b> during the irradiation, while the irradiation pro-cess with graphite cathode could not provide any formation of <b>nano-onion.</b> The present pulsed pro-cess consists of electron beam emission, Cu metal plasma, and high current up to 54 kA, which are considered as the essential factors for the reaction of <b>nano-onion</b> synthesis in this method. In this case, the current density is 17 kA/cm 2 and the en-ergy is 78 J/cm 2 per pulse.

40|$|Supercapacitors are {{electrical}} devices composed by two electrodes and a dielectric material. They have the high storage capacity of batteries and the fast charging characteristic of capacitors. An approach {{to make such}} devices smaller while preserving the capacity to hold significant amounts of charge depends {{on the use of}} materials for electrodes that provide a large surface area for the adsorption of electrolytes. This work develops a model for molecular dynamics simulations of carbon <b>nano-onions</b> and tests how well electrodes made by agglomerating such structures increase the effective surface area on which electrolytes adsorb. <b>Nano-onions</b> are modeled using a few layers of fullerenes. The internal layers serve to give the molecule more realistic mechanical and geometrical properties. Molecular dynamics simulations with controlled pressure at one atmosphere and room temperature were performed with different combinations of <b>nano-onions</b> with outer shells made of: C 720, C 500, C 320, C 240, C 180, C 80, and C 20 fullerenes in water in order to observe the adsorption of electrolytes onto the <b>nano-onions.</b> Electrolytes were added and positive or negative charges were assigned to the carbon atoms in the <b>nano-onions.</b> The amount of ions adsorbed onto the onions was counted as a measure of effective area.

Measuring the distance between the top of the peak (A) and the valley between two peaks (B) at different loads in a range between 3 and 33 nN shows that the distance (i.e., the peak height or the valley depth) changes in a linear way with the load (Figure 5 d) revealing the elastic deformation.|$|R

Experiments were performed in UHV at room temperature. We found that the coefficients of friction between silicon AFM tip and MoS 2 nanotube or MoS 2 <b>nano-onion</b> are much below the relevant values for flat single crystal MoS 2 or graphite. Further, we found indications that friction at the nanoscale depends strongly on interaction strength between the nanotube and underlying substrate, which is what is explained with shear deformation and dissipation of energy. The MoS 2 nanotubes with high interaction strength revealed up to four times larger COF (0.08 ± 0.02) than weakly supported tubes with COF of 0.023 ± 0.005. The results explain the contradictory old phenomena of higher friction typical for intracrystalline slip than for intercrystalline slip.

This work presents the use of carbon <b>nano-onions</b> as a potential oil additive for aerospace applications. Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center tested lubricant lifetimes in ambient air and ultrahigh vacuum and characterized the breakdown products of the friction and wear. These carbon nanoparticles can provide adequate lubrication {{very similar to that}} of graphitic material when run in air. Soot represents one of the very first nanostructured materials, although it has rarely been considered as such. Changes in the carbon nanostructure, resulting in increased graphitic layer plane length, correlate with reactivity loss. Upon heating spherically shaped nanometer-sized carbon black in the absence of oxidant, graphene sheets form, and the initial soot particle templates the growth of a graphitic particle into what is best described as a sphere with many flat sides having a hollow interior. Because there are no edge sites, these polygonal graphitic particles, or <b>nano-onions,</b> are relatively resistant to oxidation. Graphite is used as a solid lubricant because of its stability at moderately high temperatures. However, the temperature at which graphite oxidizes rapidly is strongly influenced by surface area. With the size of particles typically employed in lubrication, a great amount of thermal stability is lost because of size reduction either during preparation or during lubrication of contacting parts. Therefore, we have undertaken a study of the lubricating ability of graphitic <b>nano-onions</b> (ref. 1) ...|$|R

A negative bias voltage {{was applied to}} the substrate giving an effective ion energy of 28 eV. EELS revealed a variation of N incorporation inside the onions [1, 2]. The amount of N {{is directly related to the}} curvature of fullerene-like shells through the density of pentagons. N incorporation into the graphitic structure gives rise to sp 3 bonding and the appearance of chemically active sites, which can provide for cross-linking between <b>nano-onions</b> either with a direct chemical bond or by providing nucleation sites for new shells [1]. Thus mechanically stable solid films with a fullerene-like structure can form. TEM imaging of fullerene-like structures in a thin solid film form gives rise to difficulties compared to isolated fullerene features. Only thin samples, with thickness comparable with the characteristic size of the component features, provide conditions for focusing and resolving the actual structure of the film. Such samples can be obtained by applying the floating-off technique (Fig. 1 a). At fracture edges, as a consequence of a characteristic fracture process, both a suitable specimen thickness for imaging was created and the pristine structure of the <b>nano-onions</b> was preserved.

The anchoring of transition metal nanoparticles on large-area single-layer graphene is still a challenge.

The hybrid film, which allows for polymer-free transfer and is strong enough to float on water with no added supports, exhibits high optical transparency, excellent electric conductivity, and good hole/electron mobility under certain tensile/compressive strains. The results of contact resistance and transfer length indicate that the current in the rivet graphene transistor does not just flow at the contact edge. Carbon <b>nano-onions</b> encapsulating Fe nanoparticles on the surface enhance the injection of charge between rivet graphene and the metal electrode.

The latest innovations in carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes as an active electrode material for UCs, can provide up to five times as much energy and deliver up to seven times more power than today’s activated carbon electrodes. Further improvements in UC power density have been achieved by using state-of-the-art carbon nano-onions (CNOs) for ultracapacitor electrodes. CNO UCs could exhibit up to five times the power density of single-wall CNT UCs and could substantially contribute to reducing the size of an energy storage system as well as the volume and weight, thus improving device performance. This dissertation describes the fabrication of CNO electrodes as part of an UC device, the measurement and analysis of the new electrode’s performance as an energy storage component, and development of a new circuit model that accurately describes the CNO UC electrical behavior. The novel model is based on the impedance spectra of CNO UCs and cyclic voltammetry measurements. Further, the model was validated using experimental data and simulation.

The COF is an empirical property of the contacting materials, in our case, of AFM tip and MoS 2 nanotube, or MoS 2 fullerene-like <b>nano-onion,</b> MoS 2 single crystal or graphite.

40|$|International audienceThe carbon <b>nano-onion</b> can be {{considered}} as a new kind of interesting lubricating nanoparticle. Used as lubricant additives, carbon nano-onions lead to a strong reduction of both friction and wear, even at low temperature. To better elucidate the mechanisms by which these processes occur, coupled experimental and computational investigations are carried out. In addition, it is found that lubricious iron oxide nanoparticles are generated in the core of the steel contact through mechanisms that are not yet known. The molecular dynamics simulations of carbon onions placed between sliding diamond-like carbon surfaces at high contact pressure indicate that the lubrication mechanism of the onions is based on a coupled process of rolling and sliding inside the contact area. We conclude that most of carbon onions seem to remain intact under friction processes and do not generate graphitic planes, which is in contrast to the previously determined behavior of MoS 2 fullerenes that are mainly exfoliated inside the contact area and liberate lubricating lamellar sheets of h-MoS 2...|$|E

After the first enthusiastic suggestion of a possible rolling mechanism [6, 7], it was evidenced that under mechanical stress, the nanoparticles slowly deform and exfoliate, transferring WS 2 nanosheets onto the underlying surfaces (third body effect), and continue to provide effective lubrication until they are totally exfoliated [8, 9]. Another positive effect of this new nano-lubricant is that the metal surface impregnated with IF nanoparticles does not seem to oxidize during the tribological test, although the coverage of the metal surface by the nanoparticles does not exceed 20 % to 30 %. This observation was explained by a lower temperature of the WS 2 -impregnated interface relating to the pure metal surface during the friction test. It was furthermore suggested that the WS 2 nanoparticles may act as a kind of 'cathodic protection' against the oxidation of the metal surface, which prevents the oxidation of the metal surface [10].|$|E

The MoS 2 nanotubes with incorporated MoS 2 nano-onions were selected because no friction experiments are done yet on such morphology, which, besides unique inorganic peapod morphology, also answers health concerns regarding release of nanoparticles into the atmosphere. Nano-onions are safely stored inside long nanotubes in non-agglomerated stage and cannot become airborne. This particular morphology of MoS 2 nanotubes named 'mama'-tubes is made clear using transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with a special attention on surface and near surface structure. Dependency of friction on load was measured at different scan areas and angles with regard to the tube axis. Nanotubes with various adhesion supports to the substrate were tested with the aim to explain a large standard deviation in friction results using nanotubes as lubricants. Results explaining {{a quarter of a century}} old phenomena of higher friction was found between MoS 2 counterparts when shear was taking place for intracrystalline slip than for intercrystalline slip.

The unique structure of the buckyonion leads to a large electrostatic stabilization of charge-separated (CS) states in the C 60 @C 240. As a result, the CS states C 60 +@C 240 lie in the same region of the electronic spectrum (2. 4 - 2. 6 eV) as strongly absorbing locally excited states, and therefore, can be effectively populated. The CS states C 60 @C 240 + are found to be by 0. 5 eV higher in energy than the states C 60 +@C 240. Unlike the situation observed in donor-acceptor systems, the energy of the CS states in C 60 @C 240 does not practically depend on the environment polarity. This leads to exceptionally small reorganization energies for electron transfer between the shells. Electronic couplings for photoinduced charge separation and charge recombination processes are calculated. The absolute rate of the formation of the CS states C 60 +@C 240 is estimated at ~ 4 ps- 1.

Tremendous studies have been carried out on fullerenes and carbon nanotubes in the past a couple of decade due to their unique chemical and physical properties. This thesis studies the chemistry of the other two novel nanostructures in the carbon family: nanodiamond and carbon nano-onions. Nanodiamond is relatively a new engineering material with particular applications for fabrication of wear-resistant surface coatings, lubricating films and prototypes field emission displays. These materials are also of interest for studies of chemical reactivity stemming from their nanoscale particle sizes. The surface fluorination of nanodiamond at various temperatures yields a fluoro-nanodiamond with up to 8. 6 at. % fluorine content. The fluoro-nanodiamond was used as a precursor for preparation of the series of functionalized nanodiamonds by subsequent reactions with alkyllithium reagents, diamines, and amino acids. The fluoro-nanodiamond and all derivatives were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TG-MS, FTIR, XPS, and Raman measurements. In comparison with the pristine nanodiamond, all functionalized nanodiamonds show an improved solubility in polar organic solvents, e. g., alcohols and THF, and a reduced particle agglomeration. The fluoro-nanodiamond powder was also used as a precursor for diamond coating on solid substrate surface e. g. glass. This novel approach is based on the wet chemistry process (solution reaction) occurring at low temperature and resulting in a covalent bonding of tiny nanodiamond crystals to substrate through a molecular linker, 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). SEM, AFM and XPS were used for evaluation of surface morphology and elemental analysis to confirm the presence of diamond particles on surface.

30|$|The {{mesomorphic}} Au microtubes {{were able}} to migrate along the humidified wall of the capped bottle especially when desiccated. This indicates that the outer surface of the Au microtube is hydrophilic. This hydration nature is in drastic contrast with the case of carbon <b>nano-onions</b> floating on the water surface or falling {{to the bottom of}} the container [10], and carbon nanotubes by PECVD or pyrolysis in the absence of surfactant [32, 33]. Still, it is not clear if the Au nanotube has hydrophobic channel for tight hydrogen-bonding network facilitated conduction of water analogous to the case of carbon nanotube with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by the change in the local polarity and solvent condition [34].|$|R
