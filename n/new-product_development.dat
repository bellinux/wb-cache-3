However, these methods are deterministic and are susceptible to the propagation of response errors. They also assume, implicitly, a uniform prior on the partworths. In this paper we provide a probabilistic interpretation of polyhedral methods and propose improvements that incorporate response error and/or informative priors into individual-level question selection and estimation. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that response-error modeling and informative priors improve polyhedral question-selection methods in the domains where they were previously weak. A field experiment with over 2, 200 leading-edge wine consumers in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand suggests that the new question-selection methods show promise relative to existing methods. conjoint analysis, choice models, estimation and other statistical techniques, international marketing, marketing research, <b>new-product</b> research, product <b>development,</b> Bayesian methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Changes in food {{process and}} the higher demand for foods that have health benefits, besides high sensory and {{nutritional}} quality, make <b>new-products</b> <b>development</b> necessary. This study aimed to develop different formulas of glutenfree carrot cake with maize oil and traditional carrot cakes with wheat flour and maize oil or palm oil. Acceptance by consumers, their purchase intention and the nutritional facts of the formulas were also goals of this research. Firstly, a mix of gluten-free flours was suggested in order to replace wheat flour in cakes. Glutenfree cake was compared to two types of cake made with wheat flour (gluten) and with different types of fat. The gluten-free cake (BIG) produced with MIX - 1, the cake with gluten and maize oil (BGOM) and the cake with gluten and palm oil (BGOP) with 80 and 100 g were assessed for their nutritional values, preference and purchase intent. BIG MIX- 1 and BGOP 80 g had nutritional values, preference and purchase intent comparable to standard formulation. Therefore, the glutenfree-flour mix (MIX- 1) and palm oil {{can be used as}} ingredients for carrot cake, providing products with features that meet the requirements of the consumer market. Secondly, a new goal was drawn and new gluten-free formulas were developed and standardized from the first suggested gluten-free-flour mix. Acceptance rates were one more time evaluated. For this purpose and due to the large number of variables, mix of gluten-free flours and maize oil were the only two variables chosen. Thus, we left the suggestion of new experiments with palm oil. For the 12 -essays-experimental design, three gluten-free mixes with four different gluten-free flours were developed. The attributes of the cakes made with these mixes were compared with the attributes of the standard cake, with gluten. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey test (p< 0. 05) and Cluster Analysis. Three trials did not differ significantly from standard cake. The best formulas have obtained mass ratio between six and four. Overall linking of the gluten-free formulas was scored between 7. 55 and 6. 80 and the standard, gained 7. 15. Hardness, fracturability, gumminess and Adhesiveness interfered negatively in the acceptance, while Softness, resilience, cohesiveness and water activity interfered in a positive way. Thus, {{it can be said that}} it is feasible to substitute wheat flour for gluten-free flours in the production of carrot cake and keep its sensory characteristics. Once we have reached results that showed that the ratio of mass between six and four presented the best sensory and instrumental responses we decided to continue the research by standardizing the gluten-free formulations and also suggested a new mix of gluten-free flour, but at this time, without corn meal once some consumers commented that cakes with that flour tasted like cornmeal cake. In addition, we elaborated the diet version (without sucrose) of gluten-free formulas. So, the novel goal was to assess the sensory and temporal profiles and the overall acceptance rate of the new seven different formulas of carrot cakes. The formulas were then evaluated by Descriptive Quantitative Analysis (QDA) with 12 trained panelists and by Time-Intensity Analysis (TI) with 13 trained panelists. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey test (p< 0. 05) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In order to complement the analysis, Global Acceptance was carried out with 120 consumers and its results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey (p < 0. 05) and External Preference Mapping (MPREFE) which informed the descriptive attributes most preferred by the consumers in order to ensure acceptance of the products. Sixteen descriptor terms were defined during QDA study, and only sweet taste attribute underwent temporal study. It was observed that the samples that contained corn meal in its formula were more brittle, sandy, apparently drier, less elastic and less soft. In contrast, the formulas without cornmeal were more adhesive, but with better taste and flavor of carrots, while the standard sample, with gluten and sucrose, was said as being the softest, due to the presence of gluten. Cake samples showed no significant difference for the temporal profile of their sweet taste. The differences observed by the QDA trained panelists were not detected by consumers, who showed good acceptance for all samples with no difference. Furthermore, MPREFE shows that, for consumers, carrot cakes are supposed to be moist and soft, porous and smell sweet. Therefore, it was concluded that the replacement of wheat flour and sucrose in carrot cake is possible and meets consumer expectations. Finally, acceptance of appearance, aroma, flavor, texture and overall liking of the seven samples was evaluated by 120 consumers of carrot cake using the 9 cm-linear scale. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey test (p < 0. 05), internal preference mapping and dendogram. Furthermore, data of texture parameters such as hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, cohesiveness, fracturability and resilience, water activity and color of the samples were analyzed by Partial Least Square (PLS) in order to determine the influence of instrumental parameters on consumers' hedonic acceptance. It was observed that all the cakes were well accepted, except the SGD 1, which sweetness seemed to be questionable. As for the instrumental aspects, cohesiveness and elasticity have influenced the acceptance of products. The other parameters were not relevant to the panelists. Finally, we obtained results for purchase intention using the 5 -point-attitude scale. Panelists indicated an interest in buying the cakes, except for the SGD 1 sampl...|$|R

30|$|Research {{points to}} {{proactive}} alignment {{as a specific}} form of preparation. For example, Teixeira and Werther (2013) argued that anticipatory innovation and its management form {{the foundation of a}} resilient organization. Such organizations anticipate the needs and desires of buyers and are able to adapt proactively—“reacting to future changes before they happen” (Teixeira and Werther 2013, p. 335). Anticipatory innovation helps organizations to keep pace in fast-changing environments or even to be one step ahead of upcoming changes. In this context, diversity can be extremely helpful; it is believed to enhance innovation, resulting in better products and processes (Pregenzer 2014). Diversity research has demonstrated that diversity can lead to more creativity and innovation (Bantel and Jackson 1989; Cox 1991; Milliken et al. 2003). Innovation research also confirms that diversity is important for creativity in the <b>new-product</b> <b>development</b> process (e.g., Sarin and McDermott 2003; Haon et al. 2009; Hall and Ellis 2010; Açıkgöz et al. 2016; Dayan et al. 2017). For instance, there is evidence that functional diversity may be beneficial for <b>new-product</b> <b>development</b> teams and that this relationship is especially strong under high project uncertainty (e.g., Açıkgöz et al. 2016; Dayan et al. 2017). Therefore, it can be assumed that diversity may help organizations to better prepare in complex settings. However, previous research has also highlighted the important role of moderating factors. For example, Haon et al. (2009) argued that familiarity among team members positively influences the relationship between diversity and the instrumental use of information, helping teams to transform diverse knowledge into new products or solutions.

The research process is summarized as: 1) observing designers ’ sketch behaviors and their works, 2) analyzing designers ’ sketch behavior patterns for extracting sketch elements, and 3) mapping them to digital forms.

40|$|Models and {{scientific}} evidence suggest that firms are more successful at <b>new-product</b> <b>development</b> {{if there is}} greater communication among marketing, engineering, and manufacturing. This paper examines communication patterns for two matched product-development teams where the key difference between the groups is that one used a phase-review development process and the other used Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a product-development process adopted recently at over 100 United States and Japanese firms. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} head-to-head comparison of traditional U. S. product development processes with QFD. Our data suggest that QFD enhances communication levels within the core team (marketing, engineering, manufacturing). QFD changes communication patterns from "up-over-down" flows through management to more horizontal routes where core team members communicate directly with one another. On the other hand, the QFD team communicates less on planning information and less with members of the firm external to the team. If this paucity of external communication means that the team has the information it needs for product development, and the QFD process has provided an effective means for moving the information through the team, it is a positive impact of QFD. If the result means that QFD induces team insularity, even when the team needs to reach out to external information sources, it is a cause for concern. communication, product development, marketing...|$|E

Since cycle time reduction has become widely accepted as a key element in managing <b>new-product</b> <b>development,</b> this contribution organizes and integrates the literature on accelerated product development.

We attribute these inconclusive results to methodological differences in measurement approach, trade-offs in cycle time reduction, and the hidden costs of accelerated product development. Moreover, we discuss that it is essential to take the new product's window of opportunity into account while investigating the outcomes of accelerated product development.

40|$|Marketing {{decision}} makers are increasingly {{aware of the}} importance of shareholder value maximization, which calls for an evaluation of the long-run effects of their actions on product-market response as well as investor response. However, the marketing literature to date has focused on the sales or profit response of marketing actions such as advertising spending and <b>new-product</b> <b>development,</b> and the goals of marketing have traditionally been formulated from a customer perspective. There have been no studies of the long-term investor response to marketing actions, in particular the stock returns of publicly traded firms. Our research investigates one important aspect of this impact, the long-run relationship between advertising spending and market capitalization. We hypothesize that advertising can have a direct effect on valuation, i. e., an effect over and above its indirect effect via sales revenue and profit response. Our empirical test is based on several years of data for two industries. We use multivariate time-series methods that disentangle the longrun effects and short-run effects, as well as the direct and the indirect effects of advertising on firm valuation. The empirical results provide support for our hypothesis that advertising spending has a positive and long-run impact on firms ’ market capitalization. Thus, even if product-market response to the advertising is demonstrably weak, investors are willing to pay a premium for aggressive advertisers. We quantify the magnitude of this investor response effect for own firms as well as competition and discuss its implications for future research. ...|$|E

Within-team and interunit networks had different effects on the outcomes of three knowledge-sharing phases: deciding whether to seek knowledge across subunits, search costs, and costs of transfers. These results suggest that research on knowledge sharing can be advanced by studying how multiple networks affect various phases of knowledge sharing. What determines the occurrence and effective-ness of knowledge sharing in an organization? Scholars have examined this question from differ-ent viewpoints, focusing on the problem of trans-ferring tacit and complex knowledge across organ-ization subunits (e. g., Zander & Kogut, 1995), the nature of informal relationships between two par-ties to a transfer (e. g., Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000; Reagans & McEvily, 2003; Tsai, 2002), and the problem of searching for knowledge (e. g., Ancona & Caldwell, 1992). This growing body of literature has shed much light on the various problems un-derlying knowledge sharing in organizations. Yet, because the overarching process of knowledge sharing has been shown to consist of multiple phases—each with their own associated challeng-es—existing research on this question is quite dis-parate and has not shed much light on whether variables that explain one phase of knowledge shar-ing also explain other phases (Eisenhardt & Santos, 2002). In particular, while some studies have analyzed the transfer of knowledge from one point to anothe...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedIn this {{dissertation}} I discuss two {{empirical studies}} that examine how {{different types of}} firms in the biopharmaceutical industry approach different types of challenges posed by radical and uncertain technological change. In the first empirical essay I explore the role of different sources of experience in understanding incumbent pharmaceutical firms' decisions to develop new drugs. In the second empirical essay I explore how emerging new biotechnology ventures make alliance partner selection decisions {{as a function of}} both partner attractiveness and the risks of appropriation that arise from establishing alliances with incumbent pharmaceuticals.; In the first essay I examine the effects of different types of experience on the number of new products that a pharmaceutical firm develops for specific therapeutic areas. I focus on two sources of experience: a firm's internal experience and the experience {{of the members of the}} board of directors. First, I find that a firm's internal experience, which arises from prior new-product developments, has a curvilinear effect on the extent of new-product developments for a specific therapeutic area. Second, I provide evidence that the extent of new-product developments is explained by the directors' experience gained from participating in the <b>new-product</b> <b>development</b> activities of other organizations. Finally, I provide evidence that the directors' experience shapes the way in which the firm's internal experience affects the extent of new-product developments for a specific therapeutic area. These findings suggest that directors' experience may help firms overcome the constraints they face when trying to exploit their internal experience through new product developments.; In the second essay I explore how new biotechnology firms (NBFs) select pharmaceutical firms as R&D allies as a function of partner attractiveness and appropriation risks. I find that NBFs are more likely to ally with pharmaceutical firms that have the following two capabilities: (1) the ability to understand the NBF's technology (technological relatedness), and (2) strong development competences. Yet, I provide evidence showing that these positive effects of technological relatedness and a pharmaceutical firm's development experience on the likelihood of establishing an R&D alliance are negatively moderated by the pharmaceutical firm's therapeutic area diversity and the NBF's technology breadth. These findings suggest that NBFs see pharmaceutical firms' development experience and technological relatedness as increasing appropriation risks (rather than partner attractiveness) when the NBF's knowledge is broadly applicable or when the pharmaceutical firm is highly diversified across many therapeutic domains...|$|E
40|$|Although {{marketing}} {{scholars have}} investigated the significance of both radical and really new product innovations, the factors underpinning the success of such “market-driving” innovations remains elusive, especially at {{the front end of}} <b>new-product</b> <b>development</b> (NPD) process. Ensuring that future potential market-driving innovations are able to emerge from {{the front end of the}} NPD process into the development and commercialisation stages without losing their innovativeness is fraught with difficulty and is a key challenge for firms. Drawing upon the resource-based view (RBV) and the dynamic capability theory of the firm, this research examines the notion of Market Vision (MV) and its antecedent, Market Visioning Competence (MVC) to improve the “early performance” of market-driving innovations. The research extends the understanding of these factors through the incorporation of Absorptive Capacity (ACAP). Accordingly, a model is developed that integrates ACAP, MVC and MV with market-driving innovation performance, comprising before-launch stage performance, post-launch stage performance and financial performance. External and internal structural factors relevant to the firm such as size and the nature of its competitive environment are also considered as moderators in the model. The data were derived from a web-based survey of 179 managers from top innovative companies in Thailand. The focus of the research was at the NPD program level. The sample was primarily drawn from the 2011 – 2012 database of the National Innovation Agency, operating under the umbrella of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Thailand (National Innovation Agency, 2011, 2012). The hypothesised relationships were tested using linear regression whilst the overall set of relationships was examined using structural equation modelling. A major contribution of this research is the finding that ACAP as a dynamic capability significantly and distinctly influences both MVC and MV at the front end of market-driving innovation. On one hand, the firm’s ability to acquire and assimilate knowledge can lead to a discovery of new knowledge for market-driving ideas. On the other hand, a firm’s ability to transform and exploit knowledge, fosters the entrepreneurial mindset and actions of individuals or NPD team members, and can directly influence opportunity recognition in MVC, as well as generating the new initiatives and knowledge that are essential to develop a shared mental model of radically new or really new product for future markets (the MV itself). The findings also indicate that MVC significantly and positively influences MV and that both of these constructs significantly and positively influence certain aspects of before-launch stage performance and post-launch stage performance. Significant positive relationships are also observed between these performance outcomes and the financial performance of market-driving innovations. Additionally, large firm size is shown to have a significant positive moderating effect on the way in which MV translates into post-launch stage performance outcomes. Overall, these findings are important in suggesting that the capability to visualise future potential product-markets (MVC/MV) and in combination with broader organisational level dynamic learning capabilities (ACAP) can lead firms to achieve better performance of market-driving innovations, from the front end of the development process and through to commercialisation...|$|E
