5000|$|Multiple <b>basing</b> <b>points</b> is {{a method}} of {{regional}} pricing in milk marketing orders that would allow more than one <b>basing</b> <b>point,</b> or surplus area, to be used. Surplus areas are administratively defined as areas with low Class I utilization, meaning that a relatively {{small percentage of the}} milk produced in an area is used in that area as Class I (fluid) milk. In a multiple <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system, the order used as the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> has the smallest Class I differential (the difference between the Class I price and the Class III price). The Class I differential for other orders is then based on transportation costs to the nearest <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> plus the minimum differential. Pricing now largely reflects the Upper Midwest as the only <b>basing</b> <b>point,</b> even though the northeast and southwest are surplus areas.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> is a {{geographical}} site {{used to establish}} minimum fluid milk prices for federal milk marketing orders.

5000|$|In many localities, {{addresses}} often {{increase by}} 100 for each cross street, {{so that the}} building numbers in each block vary {{only in the last}} two digits. In some cities they are consecutive within each block, so that a block where one side is numbered 501, 503, 505, 507, 509, 511 is followed by a block beginning with 601. Generally, within a single city there is a single <b>base</b> <b>point</b> used for all addresses; numbering of all streets therefore reflects its distance from that <b>base</b> <b>point,</b> and directionals (north, south, east, west) are used to refer to buildings on streets which run in that direction and are in that direction from the <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The numbering system thus resembles a Cartesian coordinate system. Most cities start their numbering from the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> in either single-digits or at 100. For example, if an address is located six blocks north of a city's <b>base</b> <b>point,</b> it would likely be numbered in either the 600 or 700 range and often the designator [...] "north" [...] added to the street name. This is often omitted if the street does not cross beyond the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> or changes names when doing so.|$|R
50|$|To {{define the}} n-th {{homotopy}} group, the base-point-preserving maps from an n-dimensional sphere (with <b>base</b> <b>point)</b> into a given space (with <b>base</b> <b>point)</b> are collected into equivalence classes, called homotopy classes. Two mappings are homotopic {{if one can}} be continuously deformed into the other.

2500|$|Once a metric {{is given}} on a surface and a <b>base</b> <b>point</b> is fixed, {{there is a}} unique {{geodesic}} connecting the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> to each sufficiently nearby point. The direction of the geodesic at the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> and the distance uniquely determine the other endpoint. These two bits of data, a direction and a magnitude, thus determine a tangent vector at the <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The map from tangent vectors to endpoints smoothly sweeps out a neighbourhood of the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> and defines {{what is called the}} [...] "exponential map", defining a local coordinate chart at that <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The neighbourhood swept out has similar properties to balls in Euclidean space, namely any two points in it are joined by a unique geodesic. This property is called [...] "geodesic convexity" [...] and the coordinates are called [...] "normal coordinates". The explicit calculation of normal coordinates can be accomplished by considering the differential equation satisfied by geodesics. The convexity properties are consequences of Gauss's lemma and its generalisations. Roughly speaking this lemma states that geodesics starting at the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> must cut the spheres of fixed radius centred on the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> at right angles. Geodesic polar coordinates are obtained by combining the exponential map with polar coordinates on tangent vectors at the <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The Gaussian curvature of the surface is then given by the second order deviation of the metric at the point from the Euclidean metric. In particular the Gaussian curvature is an invariant of the metric, Gauss's celebrated Theorema Egregium. A convenient way to understand the curvature comes from an ordinary differential equation, first considered by Gauss and later generalized by Jacobi, arising from the change of normal coordinates about two different points. The GaussJacobi equation provides another way of computing the Gaussian curvature. Geometrically it explains what happens to geodesics from a fixed <b>base</b> <b>point</b> as the endpoint varies along a small curve segment through data recorded in the Jacobi field, a vector field along the geodesic. One and a quarter centuries after Gauss and Jacobi, Marston Morse gave a more conceptual interpretation of the Jacobi field in terms of second derivatives of the energy function on the infinite-dimensional Hilbert manifold of paths.|$|R

5000|$|One useful variant is the {{homotopy}} {{category of}} pointed spaces.

40|$|Abstract. We {{extend to}} the toric case two methods for {{computing}} the implicit equation of a rational parameterized surface.
