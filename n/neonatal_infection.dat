50|$|<b>Neonatal</b> <b>infection</b> can be {{distressing}} to {{the family}} and it initiates concentrated effort to treat it by clinicians. In industrialized countries, treatment for neonatal infections {{takes place in the}} neonatal intensive care unit. The causes and reasons for <b>neonatal</b> <b>infection</b> are many. The origin of infectious bacteria and some other pathogens is often the maternal gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract. Many of the maternal infections with these organisms are asymptomatic in the mother. Other maternal infections that may be transmitted to the infant in utero or during birth are bacterial and viral sexually transmitted infections. The infant's ability to resist infection is complicated by its immature immune system. The causative agents of <b>neonatal</b> <b>infection</b> are bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In addition, the immune system of the neonate may respond in ways that can create problems that complicate treatment, such as the release of inflammatory chemicals. Congenital defects of the immune system also affect the infants ability to fight off the infection.|$|E

Resistance to commonly used drug {{is emerging as}} the most important problem globally. Therefore rational use of antibiotic is a priority to reduce the burden of treatment failure. Objective: To evaluate the magnitude of <b>neonatal</b> <b>infections</b> in the <b>neonatal</b> ward of a medical institution and pattern of antibiotic use in these cases. Methodology: This was a cross sectional retrospective study. All the cases of <b>neonatal</b> <b>infections</b> admitted between October 2003 to September 2005 were included in the study.

Results: Eleven hundred and ninety six cases got admitted in the neonatal ward during the 24 months of study period. Three hundred and thirty four neonates with sepsis constituted 27. 8 % of the total cases. Majority of these cases were early onset infections (70. 7 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{amino acid}} {{glutamine}} {{has been shown}} {{to reduce the number of}} serious <b>neonatal</b> <b>infections</b> in very preterm children, which may benefit long-term brain development. The aims of the current follow-up study were to (1) determine the long-term effects of glutamine-enriched feeding in the first month after birth in very preterm children on measures of brain development at school age, and (2) elucidate a potential mediating role of serious <b>neonatal</b> <b>infections.</b> METHODS: Fifty-two very preterm children who originally took part in a randomized controlled trial on enteral glutamine supplementation between day 3 and 30 after birth participated at a mean (SD) age of 8. 6 (0. 3) years. Measures of brain development included volumetric outcomes of major brain structures, as well as fractional anisotropy (FA) values of major white matter tracts. RESULTS: Glutamine supplementation in the first month was associated with medium-sized increases in white matter (d = 0. 54, P =. 03), hippocampus (d = 0. 47, P =. 02), and brain stem (d = 0. 54, P =. 04) volumes at school age. Exploratory analyses using an uncorrected P value indicated higher FA values of the bilateral cingulum hippocampal tract in the glutamine group. All differences were either strongly associated (hippocampus volume, brain stem volume, and FA values of cingulum hippocampal tract) or completely mediated (white matter volume) by the lower number of serious <b>neonatal</b> <b>infections</b> in the glutamine group. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term glutamine supplementation after birth increases white matter, hippocampus, and brain stem volumes in very preterm children at school age, mediated by a decrease in serious <b>neonatal</b> <b>infections.</b> Copyright © 2012 by the American Academy of Pediatrics...|$|R

Traditionally, the bacteria was thought to move attached to spermatozoon, but this hypothesis did not explain female to male transmission of the disease. A recent study suggests that rather than “surf” on wiggling sperm, N. gonorrhoeae bacteria uses hairlike structures called pili to anchor onto proteins in the sperm and move through coital liquid.

The most important factors impacting the transmission of the virus is the stage of the mother's infection (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) and the damage of any maternal membranes during birth (the longer the tissue is damaged, the higher the chance of <b>neonatal</b> <b>infection).</b>|$|E
