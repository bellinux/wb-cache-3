5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, <b>nanorods,</b> tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E

The ZnO <b>nanorod</b> array grown using an aqueous solution method was combined with Al metal {{to form the}} diffused ZnO <b>nanorod</b> reflector.

40|$|Highly {{oriented}} {{and large-scale}} ZnO <b>nanorod</b> arrays {{have been successfully}} synthesized on zinc foil by a simple, low-temperature, solution-phase approach. In this approach, zinc foil was used {{not only as a}} substrate but also as a zinc-ion source for the direct growth of ZnO <b>nanorod</b> arrays. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns indicated that the structure of the ZnO <b>nanorod</b> arrays on the zinc foil substrate was single-crystalline and grown in the [0001] direction with a wurtzite structure. The optical properties of the ZnO <b>nanorod</b> arrays were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The photocatalytic activity of the ZnO <b>nanorod</b> arrays was tested by degradation of 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) under UV light irradiation compared to that of a ZnO <b>nanorod</b> film grown on a Ti substrate, indicating that the as-synthesized ZnO <b>nanorod</b> arrays exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity...|$|R
25|$|The Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}} is a non-linear scale of common minerals' resistances to scratching. Diamond {{is at the}} top of this scale (hardness 10), as it is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as aggregated diamond <b>nanorods,</b> are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of scratches. Diamond's hardness also is visually evident (under the microscope or loupe) by its highly lustrous facets (described as adamantine) which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond simulant to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external flaws and poor polish.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to preheat the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic <b>nanorods,</b> is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} by which heat may be delivered. Some {{of the most}} common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and <b>nanorods</b> that exhibit certain degrees of 'tunability' of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an 'optical window' in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a 'window' exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed.|$|E

In the <b>nanorod</b> LED, strong dependence of LEE on structural parameters such as the diameter of a <b>nanorod</b> and the p-GaN thickness is observed, which {{can be attributed to the}} formation of resonant modes inside the <b>nanorod</b> structure.

Compared with the conventional planar LED structure, the <b>nanorod</b> LED structure showed greatly enhanced LEE {{even under the}} presence of the p-GaN absorbing contact layer. Since the TM mode emits light mostly in the lateral direction, LEE for the TM mode was higher than that for the TE mode. When the LED structure is replaced from planar to <b>nanorod</b> structures, LEE for the TM mode was found to increase from 0.1 % to approximately 60 %. In addition, LEE of <b>nanorod</b> LED structures was observed to have strong dependence on structural parameters such as the diameter of a <b>nanorod</b> and the p-GaN thickness, which could be attributed to the formation of resonant modes inside the <b>nanorod</b> structure.

Gold <b>nanorods</b> are rod-shaped gold nanoparticles whose aspect ratios tune the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band from the visible to near-infrared wavelength.

For the smaller axial diameter <b>nanorods</b> (~10 nm), absorption dominates, whereas for the larger axial diameter <b>nanorods</b> (>35 nm) scattering can dominate. As a consequence, for in-vivo applications, small diameter gold <b>nanorods</b> are being used as photothermal converters of near-infrared light due to their high absorption cross-sections. Since near-infrared light transmits readily through human skin and tissue, these <b>nanorods</b> can be used as ablation components for cancer, and other targets. When coated with polymers, gold <b>nanorods</b> have been observed to circulate in-vivo with half-lives longer than 6 hours, bodily residence times around 72 hours, and little to no uptake in any internal organs except the liver.Apart from rod-like gold nanoparticles, also spherical colloidal gold nanoparticles are recently used as markers in combination with photothermal single particle microscopy.|$|E
