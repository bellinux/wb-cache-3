25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Low self-discharge NiMH battery (LSD-NiMH) in 2005 made rechargeable AA and AAA sized batteries more viable for powering LED bicycle lights. Previously, the self-discharge effect of <b>NiCAD</b> and NiMH batteries caused the battery to run down {{over a period of}} weeks or a few months, even when not in use. This was particularly a problem for low powered LED lights, and for users who only used their bicycle lights occasionally. The LSD-NiMH battery greatly reduced the self-discharge effect, allowing the battery to keep its charge for a year or more.|$|E
50|$|The General Electric {{automatic}} toothbrush {{was introduced}} in the early 1960s; it was cordless with rechargeable <b>NiCad</b> batteries and although portable, was rather bulky, {{about the size of a}} two-D-cell flashlight handle. <b>NiCad</b> batteries of this period suffered from the Memory effect. The GE Automatic Toothbrush came with a charging stand which held the hand piece upright; most units were kept in the charger, which is not the best way to get maximum service life from a <b>NiCad</b> battery. Also, early <b>NiCad</b> batteries tended to have a short lifespan. The batteries were sealed inside the GE device, and the whole unit had to be discarded when the batteries failed.|$|E

40|$|Many {{families}} own {{portable radios}} but use them very sparingly {{due to the}} high cost of dry cell batteries (which can cost the equivalent of three days' food). By converting existing radios to work from the sun, not only are running costs greatly decreased, but it also reduces the pollution caused when batteries are discarded. For a small radio, the cost of conversion can be as little as $ 1. A small company in the UK has come up with the simple solution of DIY solar conversion kits. These kits contain sheets of solar 'glass', leads, lead connectors, plastic moulding (to fix leads to glass) and glue. The smallest kit can be divided up to convert 30 small radios to solar power and costs just £ 15 plus postage. Each kit is supplied with detailed instructions and an example showing how things fit together; such assembly-work would make an ideal small-scale local enterprise. The leads are fitted to each end of a piece of 'glass' and connected into the radio's battery compartment, in place of the usual dry cells. For night-time use, either dry cell batteries or rechargeable <b>NiCads</b> can be used. Similar kits are available to recharge <b>NiCads,</b> giving the option of day and night solar powered listening from radios and radio/cassette players and also for powering torches.

40|$|The lithium {{molybdenum}} disulfide system {{as demonstrated in}} a C size cell, offers performance characteristics for applications where light weight and low volume are important. A gravimetric energy density of 90 watt hours per kilogram can be achieved in a C size cell package. The combination of charge retention capabilities, high energy density and a state of charge indicator in a rechargeable cell provides power package {{for a wide range}} of devices. The system overcomes the memory effect in <b>Nicads</b> where the full capacity of the battery cannot be utilized unless it was utilized on previous cycles.

50|$|Two small {{electric}} helicopters {{emerged in}} the mid-1990s. These were the Kalt Whisper and the Kyosho EP Concept, flying on 7-8 × 1.2 Ah <b>NiCad</b> batteries with brushed motors. However, the 540-sized brushed-motors were on the limit of current draw, often 20-25 amps on the more powerful motors, hence brush and commutator problems were common.|$|E

50|$|Success in a {{full-sized}} aeroplane {{would not}} be achieved until Nickel-cadmium (<b>NiCad)</b> batteries were developed, having a much higher storage-to-weight ratio than older technologies. In 1973, Fred Militky and Heino Brditschka converted a Brditschka HB-3 motor glider to an electric aircraft, the Militky MB-E1. It flew for just 14 minutes {{to become the first}} manned electric aircraft to fly under its own power.|$|E
50|$|The F2 also {{accepted}} the lighter, cheaper and less capable Nikon MD-3 motor drive. The MD-3 {{did not have}} power rewind and had an advance rate of 2.5 frame/s with the standard MB-2 battery pack holding 8 AA or LR6 batteries. Optionally, it could reach 3.5 frame/s with an MB-1 battery pack with 10 AA or LR6 batteries; 4 frame/s with MB-1 and MN-1 <b>nicad</b> battery.|$|E
50|$|Manpack and Portable Stations. Re-chargeable {{batteries}} were supplied {{for all of}} {{the portable}} range of radios. The PRC 344, PRC 351, 351/2 and PRC 320 all shared the same common battery - the 24 Volt 3.3 Ampere\Hour Nickel Cadmium (<b>NICAD)</b> type later upgraded to 4 Ampere\Hour (or Ah). Each radio would be issued with three batteries, and a range of battery chargers was available for this common battery.|$|E
50|$|Rechargeable batteries, such as NiMH and <b>Nicad,</b> are {{economical}} {{options for}} lights with heavy usage. Rapid capacity loss {{in comparison to}} alkaline and lithium batteries limits the use of rechargeable cells to lights in frequent use. With a lithium-ion battery or a low self-discharge NiMH battery, rechargeable battery shelf life is extended. Several new models of tactical flashlights incorporate {{the ability to be}} recharged from a USB cable.|$|E
50|$|Some former NiMH Ranger {{operators}} {{have expressed}} surprise that any vehicles are being released with NiMH {{due to the}} extremely high cost of replacement of cells and packs, while others {{have pointed out that}} some NiMH vehicles have run for over 125000 mi on their original battery packs. It is not yet clear what would need to be changed within the vehicle to use other batteries such as PbA or <b>NiCad.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{portable}} calculators {{appeared in}} Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the Sanyo ICC-0081 [...] "Mini Calculator", the Canon Pocketronic, and the Sharp QT-8B [...] "micro Compet". In January 1971, the Sharp EL-8 {{was close to}} being a pocket calculator, weighing about one pound, with a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) and rechargeable <b>NiCad</b> batteries. The EL-8 was the first battery-powered handheld calculator.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the PRC 349 and UK RT 350 which are 12 Volt (nominal), The Manpack and Portable sets and their chargers were almost all nominally rated 24V DC (Direct Current) to match the British Army's choice of 24 Volts to power its vehicle systems. The Direct Current Charging Units (DCCU) was used to float charge (provide a top up charge while the set was in use) the manpack battery, while it was mounted in a vehicle, using a clip in kit for example. It could also provide a full charge cycle over 4.5 Hours from flat, switching itself out of circuit when complete. (A clip-in kit locked the radio in a convenient frame for rapid deployment when dismounting, and had the charger as part of the installation.) There were a few exceptions where 24 Volts was not used in vehicles, such as in the General Service (GS) Landrover where a 12v system was used for example. A 12 Volt DCCU was provided. The Clansman 24V 4Ah Nickel Cadmium Battery was prolific and for convenience an Alternating Current Charging Unit (ACCU) was provided for use in barracks where up to sixteen batteries could be charged simultaneously or singularly. All of these chargers worked the same, basically providing an appropriate charging current while sensing the battery temperature to detect when charging was complete, achieved by measuring the voltage across two sets of a series pair of silicon diodes in the battery itself, one series pair would sense the internal temperature of the cells the other series pair fitted close to the outer case of the battery to sense ambient temperature, the difference in temperature being used to determine the state of charge. One drawback of the Clansman 24V 4Ah <b>NICAD</b> is that failure of these diodes makes batteries unserviceable. Also due to partial charge cycles due to the 'memory effect' of the <b>Nicad</b> cells. A discharge process could have prevented such failures, but was not provided for in either the DC or ACCU. Specialists can rebuild the unserviceable Clansman <b>NICAD</b> battery.|$|E
50|$|The MTV-1 used a German AEG Telefunken 2 inch cm black-and-white, {{electrostatic}} {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT), the smallest CRT built into a commercially available product, and included a rechargeable 4-AA-cell <b>NiCad</b> battery pack. It measured 4 * 6.25 * 1.625 in and weighed 28 oz. It was able to receive either PAL or NTSC transmissions on VHF or UHF. A Welsh company, Wolsey Electronics, manufactured it for Sinclair. Custom ICs made by Texas Instruments and Sinclair contributed to its small size and low power consumption.|$|E
50|$|Developed {{almost in}} {{parallel}} with <b>NiCad</b> technology, solar cells were also slowly becoming a practicable power source. Following a successful model test in 1974, the world’s first official flight in a solar-powered, man-carrying aircraft took place on April 29, 1979. The Mauro Solar Riser used photovoltaic cells to deliver 350 watts at 30 volts. These charged a small battery, which in turn powered the motor. The battery alone was capable of powering the motor for 3 to 5 minutes, following a 1.5-hour charge, enabling it to reach a gliding altitude.|$|E
5000|$|E-bikes use {{rechargeable}} batteries, {{electric motors}} and {{some form of}} control. Battery systems in use include sealed lead-acid (SLA), nickel-cadmium (<b>NiCad),</b> nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) or lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion). Batteries {{vary according to the}} voltage, total charge capacity (amp hours), weight, the number of charging cycles before performance degrades, and ability to handle over-voltage charging conditions. The energy costs of operating e-bikes are small, but there can be considerable battery replacement costs. The lifespan of a battery pack varies depends on the type of usage. Shallow discharge/recharge cycles will help extend the overall battery life.|$|E
