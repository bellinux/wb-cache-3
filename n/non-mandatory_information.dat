Important information categories deal with the party responsible for the information, the type of building element shown, whether a layer contains the direct graphical description of a building part or additional information needed in an output drawing etc. <b>Non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> categories facilitate the structuring of information in rebuilding projects, use of layers for spatial grouping in large multi-storey projects, and storing multiple representations intended for different drawing scales in the same mode...|$|E
40|$|Institutional {{and small}} investors, {{financial}} analysts {{and other key}} stakeholders are demanding more information about long-term strategies and profitability of companies. The growing information needs seemingly force managers to disclose more: (1) operational information, (2) performance analysis and (3) forward-looking data. However, little evidence is available concerning company’s disclosure policies addressed to stakeholders other than investors. This paper studies the <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> available on the web sites of 36 leading companies across Italy and U. S, the main objective is to describe companies’ information patterns {{in order to better}} understand voluntary disclosure choices. In particular, observed disclosures are presented through an original framework that purports to combine strategic and stakeholder reporting. This framework is based on seven perspectives that highlight information addressed to key stakeholders categories and information concerning business effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, an index attempts to measure the disclosure’s quality and it provides a first analysis of differences amongst industries and countries. A limited, but strategic, use of the <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> seems to influence the observed companies’ disclosure policies. Furthermore, cultural effects are likely to affect forms, quality and types of information released. These findings may be useful in providing an insight to further research on voluntary information addressed to stakeholders, other than investors, and they could also be helpful to accounting organizations that are attempting to regulate and control disclosure practices...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{influence}} of soft factors on the probability of successful funding and on the default probability in peer-to-peer lending for two leading European platforms. Soft factors such as orthography, the share of <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> items provided and the mentioning of certain social keywords are derived from the loan applications. We find that soft factors do have a significant influence on the funding probability on the less restrictive of both platforms, which even accepts applications without credit scores. This platform shows a better risk-return profile. Moreover, soft factors do not clearly determine the default probability peer-to-peer lending...|$|E
40|$|Other than debt financing, Initial Public Offerings (IPO) {{become a}} common method of capital raising among firms for various purposes. Prospectus is issued on the pre-issuance of the IPO {{disclosing}} various mandatory and <b>non-mandatory</b> voluntary <b>information</b> {{to help the}} potential investors in their decision making process. Other than financial information on previous and forecasted future performance, the intended use of the IPO’s proceeds information {{is one of the}} crucial information for the stakeholders especially the investors as they will be the financial contributor for the purposes. In one hand, the issuers may decide to issue highly priced IPO to fulfil their financial needs and other going-public motives. In the other hand, the investors willing to subscribe for the IPO to meet their investment target. The gap between the objectives of these two main stakeholders create uncertainties that may jeopardize the interest of the investors. Thus, the objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the relationship between the intended uses of the IPO’s proceed disclosed in the prospectus and their subsequent performance of the stocks. The result of the study can provide input for the investors and other stakeholders for their decision making process to meet their respective objectives...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} extent of <b>non-mandatory</b> {{disclosure}} of <b>information</b> (NMD) in the annual reports of the 17 companies listed on the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) in Fiji, a developing country, and whether NMD by these companies has changed over time providing additional and useful information to stakeholders. The empirical data was gathered from the years 2008 to 2010 to provide {{a clear picture of}} the change in the level and extent of NMD, and its influences over the periods 2008 to 2010. It {{can be seen from the}} Fiji perspective that the mandatory requirements tend to have a financial focus. However, it would be expected that the level of company disclosures would have changed over time, with not only global market forces but through differing societal values which have increased the frequency and demand of non-mandatory reporting by companies. All companies showed some degree of NMD, and on average this demonstrates an increasing trend. The stakeholders are receiving more information about a company’s activities. The companies were analysed in light of recent developments in corporate governance by the Capital Markets Development Authority (CMDA) implementing their 10 corporate governance principles. This became a major driver of the increase in NMD levels of the disclosures in the annual reports of the listed companies. However, a large variation still exists between the level and extent of the NMD and the different listed companies. The minimum disclosure level found over the three years was 9. 09 percent, which has increased to a minimum of 13. 66 percent in 2010, and the maximum disclosure level over the three years was 81. 82 percent. The findings for {{the extent of}} NMD was also similar where the minimum words used in NMDs was 114, increasing to 854 in 2010, and the maximum disclosure extent over the three years was 21, 414 words. However, it was found that the measurement of counting words tended to fluctuate over different periods where significant events took place that affected the company. Therefore, it was established that disclosure is impacted by what happens in the reporting period, and can explain why one period may have greater disclosure than another. The paper aims to extend earlier work of Sharma & Davey (2013) on the extent of NMD in Fijian context. While Sharma & Davey (2013) considered voluntary disclosure from 1999 - 2005, our study reviews NMD over 2008 - 2010. The study has shown that corporate governance code issued in 2009 by Capital Market Development Authority has influenced the level of NMD...|$|R
40|$|Marine Information Objects (MIOs) {{consist of}} chart- and navigation-related {{information}} that supplement the minimum information required by ECDIS {{to ensure safety}} of navigation at sea. As related {{to the use of}} Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) data, MIOs are additional, <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> not already covered by existing IMO, IHO, or IEC standards. Such information includes ice coverage, tide/water level, current flow, meteorological, oceanographic, and marine habitats. A Harmonization Group on MIOs (HGMIO) has been established between IHO and IEC to recommend additional data and display specifications that may be incorporated into future editions of IHO and IEC standards. This paper discusses the scope of MIO activities, particularly {{as it relates to the}} challenges of converting a wide variety of MIO-related information into suitable data formats for use with a type-approved ECDIS. This includes information that will be provided via shipboard Automated Identification Systems (AIS) and Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) centers. In particular, there are significant challenges related to developing data formats that deal with time-varying information (i. e., X, Y, Z and time), simultaneous display of MIOs with other chart and navigation-related information, and the means/process to disseminate in a timely manner...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether food package information is legible {{in a real}} purchase context; more specifically, it examined the level of legibility of non-mandatory, mandatory and nutritional information {{as well as the}} influence of age on legibility. This is an important issue, especially for older consumers who are usually advised to pay attention to their diet. Design An in-store study was conducted in a French hypermarket. Descriptive statistics were used to measure the overall level of legibility and then ANOVA tests were carried out to examine the influence of age on the legibility of information. Complementary results included the influence of level of education. Setting Participants were asked to read information on four food packages when they were food shopping. Subjects The sample included 196 consumers aged 18 – 82 years. Results An asymmetry was observed between the extremely high level of legibility of <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> and the low level of legibility of mandatory and nutritional information provided on food packages. Elderly respondents performed significantly worse than their younger counterparts. An interaction effect was found between age and level of education on the legibility of mandatory information. Conclusions Legibility of mandatory information is clearly unsatisfactory. There appears to be a hierarchy between significant, but non-mandatory, company information and important mandatory and nutritional information. The first type of information is promoted on food packages whereas the last two are all but concealed to older and less educated consumers...|$|E
40|$|Layering is {{a widely}} used method for {{structuring}} data in CAD-models. During {{the last few years}} national standardisation organisations, professional associations, user groups for particular CAD-systems, individual companies etc. have issued numerous standards and guidelines for the naming and structuring of layers in building design. In order to increase the integration of CAD data in the industry as a whole ISO recently decided to define an international standard for layer usage. The resulting standard proposal, ISO 13567, is a rather complex framework standard which strives {{to be more of a}} union than the least common denominator of the capabilities of existing guidelines. A number of principles have been followed in the design of the proposal. The first one is the separation of the conceptual organisation of information (semantics) from the way this information is coded (syntax). The second one is orthogonality - the fact that many ways of classifying information are independent of each other and can be applied in combinations. The third overriding principle is the reuse of existing national or international standards whenever appropriate. The fourth principle allows users to apply well-defined subsets of the overall superset of possible layernames. This article describes the semantic organisation of the standard proposal as well as its default syntax. Important information categories deal with the party responsible for the information, the type of building element shown, whether a layer contains the direct graphical description of a building part or additional information needed in an output drawing etc. <b>Non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> categories facilitate the structuring of information in rebuilding projects, use of layers for spatial grouping in large multi-storey projects, and storing multiple representations intended for different drawing scales in the same model. Pilot testing of ISO 13567 is currently being carried out in a number of countries which have been involved in the definition of the standard. In the article two implementations, which have been carried out independently in Sweden and Finland, are described. The article concludes with a discussion of the benefits and possible drawbacks of the standard. Incremental development within the industry, (where ”best practice” can become ”common practice” via a standard such as ISO 13567), is contrasted with the more idealistic scenario of building product models. The relationship between CAD-layering, document management product modelling and building element classification is also discussed...|$|E
