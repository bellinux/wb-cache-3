Indeed, constraints represent a highly declarative level. Writing specification at such a abstract level is easier due to its closeness to a user. Solving nonalgorithmic problems is studied in Artificial Intelligence. It usually involves search. Amount of a space to be searched determines efficiency of a problem solving method. In programming terms, extensive backtracking takes place which implements the search. It is therefore crucial to reduce amount of backtracking performed during search. There have bee...|$|E

Both possibilities are opened by coupling these instruments with ground based telescopes having short focal ratios, like those designed for far infrared studies. These possibilities are particularly amazing {{in view of the}} long delay usually present between the launch and the collection of the first scientific data (months in case of Mars Express, years in case of Rosetta). We propose in this article to employ immediately this technology, by coupling the developing model of the Image-Spectrometer VIRTIS-M with the ground telescope MITO.

40|$|Abstract. A dynamic {{universal}} accumulator is an accumulator {{that allows}} one to efficiently compute both membership and nonmembership witnesses in a dynamic way. It was first defined and instantiated by Li et al., based on the Strong RSA problem, building on the dynamic accumulator of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya. We revisit their construction and show {{that it does not}} provide efficient witness computation in certain cases and, thus, is only achieving the status of a partially dynamic universal accumulator. In particular, their scheme is not equipped with an efficient mechanism to produce nonmembership witnesses for a new element, whether a newly deleted element or an element which occurs for the first time. We construct the first fully dynamic universal accumulator based on the Strong RSA assumption, building upon the construction of Li et al., by providing a new proof structure for the non-membership witnesses. In a fully dynamic universal accumulator, we require that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> always create a membership witness without having to use the accumulated set for a newly added element, but also one can always create non-membership witnesses for a new element, whether a newly deleted element or an element which occurs for the first time, i. e., a newcomer who is not a member, without using the accumulated set...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} non-local {{artificial boundary}} conditions (ABCs) for the numerical simulation of genuinely time-dependent acoustic waves that propagate from a compact source in an unbounded unobstructed space. The key property used for obtaining the ABCs {{is the presence}} of lacunae, i. e., sharp aft fronts of the waves, in wave-type solutions in odd-dimension spaces. This property can be considered a manifestation of the Huygens ’ principle. The ABCs are obtained directly for the discrete formulation of the problem. They truncate the original unbounded domain and guarantee the complete transparency of the new outer boundary for all the outgoing waves. A central feature of the proposed ABCs is that the extent of their temporal nonlocality is fixed and limited, and it does not {{come at the expense of}} simplifying the original model. It is rather a natural consequence of the existence of lacunae, which is a fundamental property of the corresponding solutions. The proposed ABCs can be built for any consistent and stable finite-difference scheme. Their accuracy can always be made as high as that of the interior approximation, and it will not deteriorate even when integrating over long time intervals. Besides, the ABCs are most flexible from the standpoint of geometry and can handle irregular boundaries on regular grids with no fitting/adaptation needed and no accuracy loss induced. Finally, they allow for a wide range of model settings. In particular, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> analyze the simplest advective acoustics case with the uniform background flow, but also the case when the waves ’ source (or scatterer) is engaged in an accelerated motion. Key words: Time-dependent sound waves, unbounded domains, lacunae, non-deteriorating method, long-term computation, limited temporal nonlocality...|$|E
