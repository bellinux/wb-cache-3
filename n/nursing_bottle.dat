ECC {{has been shown to be}} a very common, transmissible bacterial infection, usually passed from the primary caregiver to the child. The main bacteria responsible for dental caries is Streptococcus mutans (S. Mutans) and Lactobacillus. There is also evidence that supports that those who are in lower socioeconomic populations are at greater risk of developing ECC.|$|E

They wanted to test what the consequences of infant rhesus monkeys would be from being separated from their mothers and having little interaction with other monkeys. First, they were separated from their mothers for six to twelve hours after birth and placed with a human made mechanical substitute in which they called the [...] "surrogate mother." [...] These surrogates were made of a wire cylinder structure and a terry cloth structure and were placed with the babies is a cage. The terry cloth structure was also placed with a <b>nursing</b> <b>bottle.</b> The monkeys preferred and clung to the cloth surrogate mother. In {{a short period of}} time the monkeys took on side effects of weight loss and not abnormal physical development. Once the monkeys reached an age where they could eat solid foods, they were separated from their cloth mothers for three days. When they were reunited with their mothers, they clung to them and did not wander off. Young rhesus monkeys in their natural habitat normally explore and venture off. Harlow concluded from this that the need for contact comfort was stronger than the need to explore. Being isolated from social interaction also caused negative outcomes later in their life. The surrogate-raised monkeys exhibited depression and aggressive behavior as they would clutch to themselves, rock constantly back and forth, and avoid interaction with others. Not only affecting their social behavior, it also impacted them interacting sexually. The monkeys underwent little if any sexual posturing or reproduction in their lifetime.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Longitudinal {{study to}} {{investigate}} how the dental caries in primary teeth progress with increasing age is still lacking. Aims. To describe {{the development of}} new caries over 2 years and to identify risk factors that can predict new caries development. DESIGN: A random sample of preschool children aged 3 - 4 years was surveyed and followed up when they reached 5 - 6 years of age in Hong Kong. Dental caries status was assessed using the dmft index. Negative binomial regression was performed to investigate the factors collected at baseline that could predict the caries increment over 2 years. RESULTS: Totally 358 children attended both examinations. The mean caries increment over 2 years was 0. 9. Results of the negative binomial regression showed that children who used <b>nursing</b> <b>bottles</b> during sleep when they were young (P= 0. 013), whose toothbrushing began after 12 months (P= 0. 005), who took snack once or more daily (P< 0. 001), and whose parents had 9 or fewer years of education attainment (P= 0. 002) had significantly higher caries increment. CONCLUSIONS: New caries development of Hong Kong preschool children was low. Children's feeding, snaking and brushing habits, and parents' education attainment were the significant predictors for new caries development of preschool children. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} bottle feeding, age, parental educational level, chronic use medication, gender, oral hygiene performed by patient/caregiver, previous orientation of caregivers regarding oral hygiene and treatment by specialists of several health fields {{on the presence of}} cavited carious lesions and restorations in primary teeth of cerebral palsy patients. Method: 141 records of children with cerebral palsy enrolled in the project “Dental Care to Patients with Specials Needs” of the School of Dentistry/UFMG were examined. These children came from the Minas Gerais State Rehabilitation Association and from the João Moreira Salles School, both located at the city of Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: There was positive association between caries experience and age (p= 0. 000) and the use of <b>nursing</b> <b>bottle</b> (p= 0. 002). These patients are bottle fed during a long period of their lives. In spite of this, 67. 4 % of the participants of this project did not present carious lesions or restorations.

With the help of Don Ferguson, Hanson tore apart a Packard touring car for ideas, and in February 1917 began plans to {{manufacture}} the first Hanson car at a factory in Detroit, Michigan although manufacturing was delayed due to the first World War. After the U.S. government released the factory from war production in June 1918, the first Hanson car was produced—a 5-passenger tourer with a Continental 7R six-cylinder engine in it. [...] "Tested and Proved in the South" [...] was one of the company's slogans, along with [...] "Made in Dixie" [...] (even though the factory was in Detroit, the headquarters were in Atlanta). In 1921, Hanson toyed with a torque converter but never made one. When the post war recession hit, Hanson was forced to slash prices. A Little Six was introduced at the bargain basement price of $995. In 1925, he closed the doors to his factory. A total of 1,800 cars are believed to have been made with the majority of them being sold in Atlanta and other parts of Georgia. George Hanson then turned to the manufacture of baby <b>nursing</b> <b>bottles</b> and returned to Atlanta in the mid-1930s to become a life insurance agent. He died in 1940 at age 65.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Traçar o perfil fonoaudiológico da comunidade do Dendê, caracterizando os aspectos de linguagem oral e escrita, voz, audição e motricidade {{orofacial}}, a partir de queixas referidas. MÉTODOS: Estudo exploratório-descritivo, realizado a partir da aplicação de protocolo abordando aspectos gerais e fonoaudiológicos, com base nas informações contidas nos prontuários das 335 famílias assistidas pela Fonoaudiologia na comunidade do Dendê, totalizando 1704 sujeitos. RESULTADOS: Grande parte das famílias do Dendê, 70 %, ganha até dois salários mínimos. Observou-se que 20, 6 % da população infantil apresentou queixas de problemas de linguagem, sendo 21, 2 % delas, de dificuldade de aprendizagem escolar. Houve ocorrências do hábito de sucção de chupeta em 50, 4 % das crianças, seguido da mamadeira em 42, 2 %, com até dois anos de idade. Nas crianças entre dois e seis anos ainda observou-se uso elevado destes hábitos, sendo 31, 2 % uso da mamadeira e 29, 7 % sucção de chupeta. A sucção digital foi observada em 9, 1 % das crianças acima de seis anos. Houve um baixo percentual de queixas auditivas, assim como de voz, em apenas 2, 2 % da população. CONCLUSÃO: Foi verificado que as alterações fonoaudiológicas mais prevalentes estavam relacionadas à presença de hábitos orais, seguidas por aspectos da linguagem oral e escrita. No entanto, um baixo nível de queixas de audição e de voz foi relatado. A realização de um diagnóstico situacional ajuda no redirecionamento das atividades postas em prática na comunidade, visando a população assistida. Isto é alcançado por meio de iniciativas educativas de prevenção e promoção de saúde, as quais devem conduzir a resultados melhores, mais rápidos e mais eficazes. PURPOSE: To {{trace the}} Speech-Language Pathology {{profile of the}} Dendê community, characterizing aspects of oral and written language, voice, hearing and orofacial myology, based on referred complaints. METHODS: Exploratory-descriptive study, carried out with {{the application of a}} protocol that addressed general and Speech-Language Pathology aspects, based on information available on the records of 335 families assisted by Speech-Language Pathology at the Dendê community, totalizing 1704 subjects. RESULTS: Great part of the families at Dendê (70 %) earns up to two minimum wages. It was observed that 20. 6 % of the children had language complaints, and 21. 2 % of these complaints regarded learning difficulties. Pacifier sucking habits were observed in 50. 4 % of the children, and 42. 2 % of the children up to two years old used <b>nursing</b> <b>bottles.</b> Children between two and six years old also presented high occurrence of these habits: 31. 2 % used <b>nursing</b> <b>bottles</b> and 29. 7 % used pacifiers. Thumb sucking was observed among 9. 1 % of the children older than six years old. There was a low percentage of hearing and voice complaints, reported by 2. 2 % of the population. CONCLUSION: It was verified that most prevalent Speech-Language Pathology alterations were related to the presence of oral habits, followed by oral and written language aspects. Nevertheless, a low level of hearing and voice complaints were reported. A situational diagnosis helps redirecting the activities practiced in the community, aiming its population. This is achieved through educational initiatives of health prevention and promotion, which should lead to better, quicker and more efficient results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to gather data on infant feeding habits and oral hygiene practices of Hong Kong preschool children, on the dental knowledge and attitudes of their caregivers and on the oral health status of the same group of children. Design. Cross-sectional study. Sample and methods. Data was gathered for a total of 369 boys and 297 girls (207 1 -year-olds, 269 2 -year-olds and 190 3 -year-olds) {{with a mean age of}} 20 - 19 (± 0. 38) months. Information related to children attending six randomly selected Maternity and Child Health Centres. It was obtained by examining the children and by interviewing the attending caregivers and completing a questionnaire. Each child was given an oral examination using a torch, disposable mirror and wooden tongue spatula. Results. Only 7 % of the children were exclusively breast-fed. More than 98 % (656 / 666) of infants used a <b>nursing</b> <b>bottle</b> for at least some drinks. Over 62 % (411 / 656) had used a <b>nursing</b> <b>bottle</b> to take fluids other than water and infant formula. At bedtime, 56 % (361 / 656) were given a <b>nursing</b> <b>bottle</b> prior to sleep and 96 % (340 / 361) of these bottles contained formula milk. Of these children, only 37 % (131 / 361) finished the contents of the bottle before falling asleep. Over 73 % (139 / 190) of the children continued to use a feeding bottle after 2 years of age. Non-nutritive sucking habits were practised by 35. 6 % (237 / 666) of the children. Visible plaque, on the labial surface of at least two maxillary incisors, was found in 19. 5 % (120 / 615) of the children. Oral cleansing habits were practised for 66. 2 % (441 / 666) of the children. Toothbrushing habits were reported for 42. 3 % (260 / 615) of the dentate children, of whom 19 % (49 / 260) had their teeth brushed twice daily. Toothpaste was used by 49. 23 % (128 / 260) of the children and 57. 3 % (149 / 260) brushed their own teeth. Caries was seen in 7. 6 % of the infants (47 / 615). Of the caregivers, 67. 7 % said they did not think carious primary teeth needed to be restored. Among the mothers, 12. 6 % (43 / 342) did not know the oral condition of their child. Reportedly, 82 % (417 / 510) and 87. 5 % (446 / 510) of the mothers had not received any oral health care information during the ante- or postnatal periods.

40|$|There are {{continuous}} {{reports of}} very high prevalence of early childhood caries. The most common factors in the aetiology of early childhood caries include, prolonged feeding of sweetened fluids from a <b>nursing</b> <b>bottle</b> at bed time, on-demand and prolonged breast feeding, use of sweetened pacifiers, carbonated beverages/. fruit juices, poor oral hygiene and certain socioeconomic factors. In the Middle East, a very high caries prevalence (higher than 70 %) {{has been reported in}} several recent studies. Strong preventive efforts are required to control this situation. The preventive programmes for early childhood caries should be designed in the light of socioeconomic, cultural and behavioural background of a specific population.
