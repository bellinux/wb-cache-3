5|$|Haruna {{fought in}} almost every major naval action of the Pacific Theater during World War II. She covered the Japanese {{landings}} in Malaya (in present-day Malaysia) and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in 1942 before engaging American forces at the Battle of Midway and during the Guadalcanal Campaign. Throughout 1943, Haruna primarily remained at Truk Lagoon (Micronesia), Kure <b>Naval</b> <b>Base</b> (near Hiroshima), Sasebo <b>Naval</b> <b>Base</b> (near Nagasaki), and the Lingga Islands (in present-day Indonesia), and deployed on several occasions in response to American carrier airstrikes on Japanese island bases. Haruna participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, engaging American vessels in the latter. In 1945, Haruna was transferred to Kure <b>Naval</b> <b>Base,</b> where she was sunk by aircraft of Task Force 38 on 28 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the {{commercial}} area on either side of I-95, SR40 becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane. SR40 gains a median again at its intersection with Kings Bay Road, one of several highways that lead to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. Another main highway to the <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> is St. Marys Road, which the highway meets at a partial cloverleaf interchange on the boundary between the cities of Kingsland and St. Marys. SR40 intersects a branch of the railroad that heads into the <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> and crosses Dark Entry Creek before meeting the southern end of SR40 Spur (Charlie Smith, Sr., Highway), which heads north along {{the western edge of the}} <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> on its way to Crooked River State Park.|$|E

50|$|<b>Naval</b> <b>bases</b> were {{introduced}} in Pacific, and were elaborated upon in Pacific 1940. In Pacific, <b>naval</b> <b>bases</b> were fixed on the board, and allowed allied ships in specific sea zones to move an extra space during noncombat movement. In Pacific (and Europe) 1940, <b>naval</b> <b>bases</b> may be built in any coastal territory, and allow ships in adjacent sea zones the movement of an extra space in combat movement in addition to noncombat movement.|$|R

5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the <b>naval</b> <b>base.</b> The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> development.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1944, under {{conditions}} of severe racism, a race riot broke out in Guam at a <b>naval</b> <b>base.</b> In March 1945 a Seabee battalion of 1,000 African-American men staged a hunger strike at their base, <b>Naval</b> <b>Base</b> Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California, in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, Fleet Admiral Ernest King and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert Lester Granger on a plan for total integration of the races within the Navy.

5|$|Traveling {{towards the}} northeast, Conson headed towards Okinawa where schools {{were closed and}} local {{transportation}} was disrupted due to the storm. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents about the threat of heavy rains and high winds resulting from the storm. A United States <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> located in Okinawa was placed under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCR) Four as Typhoon Conson was approaching. As the storm neared the islands, the <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> was put under TCCR Three, indicating that winds of 92km/h (57mph) were anticipated within 48hours. Ahead of the storm, upwards of 254mm (10in) fell across the islands, which were indirectly related to the storm. In southern Japan, several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|After the breakout, the Austro-Hungarian navy saw {{very little}} action, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in its base at Pola (now Pula, Croatia). The navy's general inactivity was partly caused {{by a lack of}} coal, which became a problem as the war progressed, and partly by a fear of mines in the Adriatic (which also kept the Italian navy in port for most of the war). They did, however, leave Pola to bombard Ancona in May 1915. On 23 May 1915, four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> at Pola, the members of the Tegetthoff class {{and the rest of the}} fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast. The Austro-Hungarian ships bombarded the important <b>naval</b> <b>base</b> at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E

5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore <b>Naval</b> <b>Base</b> again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore <b>Naval</b> <b>Base,</b> naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
