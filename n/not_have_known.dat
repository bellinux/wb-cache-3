Mulder insists that Bruckman join them in {{a visit to the}} crime scene at the doll collector's apartment.

5|$|Dreaming of You {{was among}} the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, best-selling debut by a female act, and the fastest-selling U.S. album of 1995. It has since been ranked among {{the best and most}} {{important}} recordings produced during the rock and roll era. Media outlets have since ranked the recording among the best posthumous releases. When Dreaming of You peaked at number one, Tejano music entered the mainstream market. Music critics said the general population of the U.S. would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about Tejano or Latin music {{had it not been for}} Dreaming of You. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 35×platinum (Latin field), for shipping 3.5 million units in the U.S. The album was eventually certified gold by Music Canada and by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON). As of January 2015, the album has sold five million copies worldwide, and remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E

5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he {{would probably have to}} have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire had {{a policy}} of not {{offering}} contracts to its players, but in return they would tell cricketers {{by the end of}} July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E

The story caused a political storm with the government denying any involvement in the intelligence content of the dossier.

25|$|There is {{no record}} of Liston's birth. His family's home state of Arkansas did not make birth {{certificates}} mandatory until 1965. His family, but not Sonny Liston, {{can be found in}} the 1930 census, and in the 1940 census he was listed as 10 years old. It has been suggested Liston himself may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> what year he was born, as he was not precise on the matter. He finally settled on a date of birth of May 8, 1932 for official purposes but by the time he won the world title an aged appearance added credence to rumors that he was actually several years older. One writer concluded that Liston's most plausible date of birth was July 22, 1930, citing census records and statements from his mother during her lifetime.|$|E

Police charged him with four counts of first-degree assault on law enforcement, five counts of armed criminal action, and one count of discharging a firearm at a motor vehicle. Harris was held on a $250,000 cash-only bond. According to Harris' father, {{he graduated from the}} same high school as Brown and was a close friend of his. Two days after the shooting, police released surveillance video of Harris firing a gun at an unmarked police car. Harris was out on bond for felony charges related to the theft of a vehicle and a gun {{at the time of the}} incident. Despite video evidence, Harris' father denied that his son had a gun.
