5|$|The first {{spectral}} {{classification of}} these distant supernovae {{was performed by}} Rudolph Minkowski in 1941. He categorized them into two types, based {{on whether or not}} lines of the element hydrogen appeared in the supernova spectrum. Zwicky later proposed additional types III, IV, and V, although these are no longer used and <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> to be associated with single peculiar supernova types. Further sub-division of the spectra categories resulted in the modern supernova classification scheme.|$|E
5|$|These {{were the}} major stamp {{productions}} for everyday use. Commemorative stamps {{first appeared in}} 1929, and these <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> several times a year, celebrating many aspects of Irish life, such as notable events and anniversaries, Irish life and culture, and many famous Irish people. Some definitive and commemorative stamps have been produced in miniature sheet, booklet and coil configurations {{in addition to the}} common sheet layout. Postage dues and airmails complete the stamp issues of the two, sequential, Irish stamp-issuing authorities. Two styles of watermark were used though the overprinted issues came with the watermarks of the British stamps provided for overprinting by the British Post Office.|$|E

25|$|In America, 34 states <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> to have {{statutes}} {{providing for}} mechanic's liens on personal property. These statutes tend {{to modify the}} common law rules. For example, in Virginia, a mechanic's lien can only be enforced up {{to the amount of}} $625, and if the property is valued at over $5,000, it must be sold at a sheriff's auction ordered by the court of appropriate jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Virtually {{all of the}} Bonin Islands' {{inhabitants}} are Japanese citizens. This {{includes the}} significant proportion with ancestors from the United States, Europe and other Pacific islands, who can often be distinguished by their family names and ancestry, physical features or adherence to Christianity. During and after the US military occupation of 194668, {{a small minority of}} islanders opted for US citizenship and/or emigrated from the islands. However, most islanders with non-Japanese ancestry <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> to be reassimilating with the ethnic Japanese majority.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Moscow Kremlin {{was built}} during the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, {{who in the}} 1480s invited architects from Renaissance Italy, such as Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.|$|E

While the finding of biological warfare agents such as anthrax and Ebola cultures was reported, those claims <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> to have been widely exaggerated. There were stockpiles of chemicals {{that could be used}} for producing enough sarin to kill four million people.|$|E

25|$|To {{restore the}} composer's reputation, The Rutland Boughton Music Trust was {{established}} in 1978, {{the year of the}} composer's Centenary, to encourage performances and sponsor recordings of his works. Many of these, including some world premieres, <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> on disc with the Hyperion Records label. The Oliver Cromwell symphony - first heard in 2005 - and three of the Songs of the English (last heard around 1904/5) have been released by Dutton, as well as a selection of Songs for mezzo and pianoforte on the British Music Society's own label. Dutton has also released the world premiere recording of Boughton's adaptation of Thomas Hardy's play, The Queen of Cornwall, sponsored by the Trust.|$|E
25|$|By 1912, the Post Office had {{received}} numerous complaints from postmasters that the many near-identical Washington stamps {{in the issue}} confused postal clerks, too often leading them to give customers higher denominations than they paid for. The Post Office addressed this problem in the series of 1912–14 by making {{a significant change in}} the line up in the Washington-Franklin denominations. Washington would <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> on the lower values only; all denominations of 8c and higher would display the Franklin-head. The realignment provided a clear visual distinction between the cheaper and the more expensive stamps. To further heighten the distinction, the Post Office now introduced the oak-leaf frame for the Franklin stamps, thus eliminating olive branches from the higher values along with Washington.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, 2016, it was {{announced}} that Alexander Hamilton would remain the primary face on the $10 bill, {{due in part to the}} sudden popularity of the first Treasury Secretary after the success of the musical Hamilton on Broadway. It was simultaneously announced that Harriet Tubman's likeness would appear on the $20 bill while Andrew Jackson would <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> on the reverse with the White House. The new design for the reverse of the bill will feature the heroes of the Women's Suffrage Movement, including Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott, and the participants of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession who marched in favor of full voting rights for women in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

500|$|The colours, which <b>now</b> <b>appear</b> {{so fresh}} and spring-like with pale pink, apple green, vivid yellow and sky blue against a {{background}} of warm pearly grey, were so discoloured by candle smoke as to make the pictures seem almost monochrome. The restoration has removed the filter of grime to reveal the colours again. However, the restoration was met with both praise and criticism. Critics assert that much original work [...] by Michelangelo – in particular pentimenti, highlights and shadows, and other detailing painted a secco – was lost in the removal of various accretions.|$|E
