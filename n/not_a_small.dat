Papers indicating {{the nature of}} the Alsos Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the Alsos Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered an evacuation plan to be prepared for the Alsos Mission's main headquarters in Paris. The embarrassing series of intelligence failures that had led up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the Alsos Mission's own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm that it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> nuclear explosion. Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945.|$|E

25|$|These slurs may {{represent}} a later development of stories in favour of Ælfflæd's sons, but {{there is evidence to}} suggest that the status difference between Edward's first two wives had been an issue at an earlier stage. A distant but near-contemporary poet writing in the 960s, Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, tells that Æthelstan's mother was lower in status (generis satis inferioris) than Ælfflæd, whose daughter Eadgyth married Otto I. Since she wrote her Life in praise of Otto I, Eadgyth and their descendants, presumably based on sources sympathetic to the latter, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> degree of bias may be assumed. On the other hand, if Ecgwynn had been set aside in favour of Ælfflæd, then the political importance of the latter's family may have played a large part.|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{went into}} lap 48 {{less than a}} second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he {{attempted}} to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, [...] "That didn't work Michael. You hit the wrong part of him, my friend". The right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve's Williams—unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill's suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race [...] "The car felt very strange. The hit was very hard. It was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> thing." [...] He continued but the damage to his car meant he was slower than the cars behind him.|$|E

He avoided social gatherings and was uncomfortable meeting people, which was in part caused by his consistent bouts of migraine.

2500|$|Some {{important}} {{properties of}} laser diodes {{are determined by}} the geometry of the optical cavity. Generally, the light is contained within a very thin layer, and the structure supports only a single optical mode in the direction perpendicular to the layers. In the transverse direction, if the waveguide is wide compared to the wavelength of light, then the waveguide can support multiple transverse optical modes, and the laser is known as [...] "multi-mode". These transversely multi-mode lasers are adequate in cases where one needs a very large amount of power, but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> diffraction-limited beam; for example in printing, activating chemicals, or pumping other types of lasers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, the {{financial}} {{health of the}} thrift industry was again challenged by a return of high interest rates and inflation, sparked this time by a doubling of oil prices and exacerbated by dwindling resources of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) It was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> problem: In 1980 {{there were more than}} 4,000 savings & loans institutions with assets of $600 billion, of which $480 billion were mortgage loans, many of them made at low interest rates fixed in an earlier era. [...] In the United States, this was 50 percent of the entire home mortgage market. In 1983, the FSLIC's reserves for failures amounted to around $6 billion, whereas, according to Robinson (footnoted), the cost of paying off insured depositors in failed institutions would have been around $25 billion. Hence, regulators were forced into [...] "forbearance"—allowing insolvent institutions to remain open—and to hope that they could grow out of their problems.|$|E

2500|$|Under the First Wilson Government, {{subsidies}} for farmers were increased. Farmers {{who wished to}} leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or <b>not.</b> <b>A</b> <b>Small</b> Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, 40,000 more farmers became eligible for the maximum £1,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous [...] "disturbance compensation." [...] A Hill Land Improvement Scheme, introduced by the Agriculture Act of 1967, provided 50% grants {{for a wide range}} of land improvements, along with a supplementary 10% grant on drainage works benefitting hill land. The Agriculture Act 1967 also provided grants to promote farm amalgamation and to compensate outgoers.|$|E
2500|$|Gabbard {{previously}} opposed both {{civil unions}} and same-sex marriage. As a Hawaii state legislator in 2004, she argued against civil unions, saying, [...] "To try {{to act as}} if {{there is a difference between}} 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii who have already made overwhelmingly clear our position on this issue... As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of homosexual extremists." [...] Gabbard opposed Hawaii House Bill 1024, which would have established legal parity between same-sex couples in civil unions and married straight couples, and led a protest against the bill outside the room where the House Judiciary Committee held the hearing. In the same year, Gabbard expressed her opposition to Hawaii undertaking research on LGBT students, arguing that it would be a violation of their privacy and that [...] "many parents would see the study as an indirect attempt by government to encourage young people to question their sexual orientation". At the time, she disputed that Hawaii schools were rampant with anti-gay discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition. [...] The Army said {{none of the}} carbines evaluated during testing met {{the minimum}} scoring requirement needed to continue to {{the next phase of}} the evaluation. [...] Letters were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier evaluation phase. [...] PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. [...] Weapons tested also had low reliability performance using M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR). [...] Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained fiscal environment, and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. [...] In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. [...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen as proprietary, and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|E

2500|$|Although Kellogg praised hydropathy for {{its many}} uses, he did {{acknowledge}} its limits. [...] "In nearly all cases, sunlight, pure air, rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic agencies are quite {{as important as}} water. Electricity, too, is a remedy which should not be ignored; and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable in <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of cases." [...] With this belief, {{he went on to}} criticize many medical figures who misused or overestimated hydropathy in the treating of disease. Among these, he criticized what he referred to as [...] "Cold-Water Doctors" [...] who would recommend the same remedy regardless of the type of ailment or temperament of the patient. These doctors would prescribe ice cold baths in unwarmed rooms even during the harshest winters. In his opinion, his prejudicial approach to illness resulted in converting hydropathy a more heroic type of treatment where many became obsessed with taking baths in ice cold baths. He addresses the negative consequences that resulted from this [...] "infatuation," [...] among them tuberculosis and other diseases. This dangerous habit was only exacerbated by physicians who used hydropathy in excess. Kellogg recounts an instance where a patient with a low typhus fever was treated with thirty-five cold packs while in a feeble state and, not to the surprise of Kellogg, died. Kellogg posits this excessive and dangerous use of hydropathy as a return to the [...] "violent processes" [...] of bloodletting, antimony, mercury and purgatives. Kellogg also criticizes the ignorance in [...] "Hydropathic Quacks" [...] as well as in Preissnitz, the founder of modern hydropathy, himself. Kellogg states that the [...] "Quacks" [...] as well as Preissnitz are ignorant for overestimating the hydropathy as a [...] "cure-all" [...] remedy without understanding the true nature of disease.|$|E
2500|$|This position, {{while being}} based on Marxism, was criticized by Maoists {{at the time}} of being the [...] "revisionist theory of the {{productive}} forces." [...] In a break with classical Marxism, Mao argued that the superstructure should play the leading role in the revolution, that is the political system and individuals, and not the materialist forces, which Mao considered secondary. This was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> ideological issue, and had been in the heart of Marxist theoretical debate since the era of Vladimir Lenin. Lenin had argued that socialist revolutions could occur in the peripheries of capitalism, that is countries not economically advanced enough to develop socialism according to Karl Marx, since these revolutions could instigate a revolutionary wave in the more advanced countries. Marx, in The Poverty of Philosophy, stated that [...] "in acquiring new productive forces, men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing their way of earning a living, they change all their social relations." [...] To explain, Marx believed as the productive forces, literally the economic forces, changed social relations would change, and when the social relations changed, something new would develop. In short, the Marxist founders argued that the socialist mode of production could only develop out of a developed capitalist economy, and not from a backward economy, developing it on a backward area was, according to Marx, a [...] "chiliastic dream fantasy." [...] After the failure of the revolutionary waves of the late-1910s, early 1920s, Lenin initiated the New Economic Policy, a series of policies which reintroduced capitalist economics in the country in a bid to develop socialism in Russia despite its backwardness. According to Maria Hsia Chang, Mao never grasped the central importance of the productive forces in developing socialism, and he argued until the end that socialism could be created through the superstructure alone with [...] "revolutionary commitment, political intransigence, personal sacrifice, and selfless dedication [...]" [...] Deng, on the other hand, staid true to classical Marxism, arguing until his death that the productive forces played the central role.|$|E
