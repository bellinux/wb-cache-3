25|$|Coppola's {{next project}} was Jack, which was {{released}} on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so {{at the age of}} ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, Jack also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film Big, in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.|$|E

Amin's family decided to disconnect life support and Amin died at the hospital in Jeddah on 16 August 2003. He was buried in Ruwais Cemetery in Jeddah in a simple grave without any fanfare.

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{disliked the}} double eagle and other Longacre coins showing Liberty, calling them routine. [...] He did {{find that the}} reverse [...] "has some commendable points of heraldic imagery" [...] and likened {{that side of the}} coin to [...] "the frontispiece for a patriotic brochure". The Daily Alta California in May 1850 reprinted a piece from an unnamed Eastern newspaper, which said of the new piece, [...] "we cannot say that we admire it... imperfectly formed, and marred by some adjacent flummery intended for radiance we suppose, by which the whole thing is rendered confused". The Journal of Commerce, a New York periodical, suggested that the piece be replaced with one showing George Washington on one side and on the other [...] "a handsome eagle standing out as if it were <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> itself". The Boston Evening Transcript suggested that Mint authorities should be [...] "stopping the issuance of this very shabby coin. [...] The manager of the mint would seem to be utterly destitute of taste to allow such a specimen to go forth." [...] Bowers, writing in 2004, stated that despite the negative contemporary reaction, the design of the double eagle is now very popular among collectors.|$|E
500|$|Benjamin was {{the first}} U.S. senator to profess the Jewish faith. [...] In 1845, David Yulee, born David Levy, had been sworn in for Florida, but he renounced Judaism and {{eventually}} formally converted to Christianity. As an adult, Benjamin was a nonobservant Jew, {{who was not a}} member of a synagogue and took no part in communal affairs. [...] He rarely spoke of his religion publicly, but was <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> it. Some of the stories told of Benjamin that touch on his faith come from Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who related that Benjamin delivered an address in a San Francisco synagogue on Yom Kippur in 1860, though whether this occurred is open to question as Wise was not there and it was not reported in the city's Jewish newspaper. One quote from Senate debate that remains [...] "part of the Benjamin legend", according to Evans, followed an allusion to Moses as a freer of slaves by a Northern senator, hinting that Benjamin was an [...] "Israelite in Egyptian clothing". Benjamin is supposed to have replied, [...] "It is true that I am a Jew, and when my ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate hand of deity, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the {{publications}} Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture and Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, {{it was the}} controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) in the sitcom Ellen in 1997 that {{paved the way for}} Patty's coming-out in this episode, as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows. In his book Queers in American Popular Culture, Jim Elledge noted that unlike many episodes of The Simpsons that go through a situation and then everything returns to normal during the ending, this one does not. He commented that the staff of the show could have made Patty heterosexual again {{at the end of the}} episode and leave it how it was before by having her marry Leslie. Instead, they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to the heteronormative audience by having Patty exclaim [...] "Hell no! I like girls!" [...] to Leslie's marriage proposal. The author also noted that it is possible the Simpsons staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were [...] "traditionally considered more acceptable" [...] on television. She did, however, not [...] "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" [...] that had previously been seen on shows such as Ellen. Instead, Patty is [...] "rude, crude, and <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> declaring her sexual preferences", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.|$|E
500|$|While {{agency is}} the first of two {{dimensions}} of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance. [...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was <b>not</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E
