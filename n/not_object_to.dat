5|$|The UNPROFOR {{operations}} {{staff in}} Sector West developed several defensive plans, assigning top {{priority to the}} plan codenamed Operation Backstop. It envisaged an active defence against the HV, assuming that the attack's main axis would be the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. CANBAT 1 (supported by General Zabala) thought the HV would attack Sector West to control the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, and the UN would <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> such a move. Any Croatian attack in the area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for Operation Backstop.|$|E

Following the hackers' threats on December 16, Rogen and Franco canceled scheduled publicity appearances and Sony pulled all television advertising. The National Association of Theater Owners {{said that they would}} <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> cinema owners delaying the film {{to ensure the safety of}} filmgoers. Shortly afterwards, the ArcLight and Carmike cinema chains announced that they would not screen the film.|$|E
5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E
50|$|Moving {{on to the}} non-constitutional arguments, {{the court}} was {{similarly}} unpersuaded. The letters to the Bass Berry paralegal, and her testimony, spoke directly to Perry's possible motive in committing the crime, especially since the defense had <b>not</b> <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> the introduction of his 1996 deposition where he had said the payments were not much of an issue between him and Janet.

5|$|Inside the Austrian Netherlands themselves, {{the lawyers}} Jan Frans Vonck and Verlooy formed a secret society called Pro Aris et Focis in April or May 1790 {{in order to}} plan for an armed {{uprising}} against Austrian rule. Weapons and revolutionary tracts were distributed. Most {{of the members of}} the organisation came from the liberal professions (such as lawyers, writers and merchants). Most were moderates who did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> Joseph II's reforms in principle but because they had been levied on the territories without consultation. They were supported financially by the clergy. Initially members of the opposition were divided on how the uprising should occur. Unlike Van der Noot, Vonck believed that Belgium should liberate itself rather than rely on foreign aid.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> her ideas.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2013, the Nationalist {{political}} party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's film wing threatened {{to disrupt the}} film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of Chennai Express had demanded prime slots in single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film Duniyadari had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if Duniyadari was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the release of Chennai Express in Maharashtra.|$|E

5|$|Trollope refused. Hugo's {{novel was}} {{published}} in The Gentleman's Magazine, beginning in May 1869. However, {{by the end of}} June, the sale of Once A Week to a new publisher was in progress. Rather than serialising The Vicar in the magazine, Bradbury and Evans issued it in eleven monthly shilling numbers, running from July 1869 to May 1870. Trollope could <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> this mode of independent publication; but it was one that had fallen out of favour with the public, and Trollope suffered a loss of reputation and readership as a result. He also suffered a pecuniary loss of £300, agreeing for reasons unspecified to accept only £2500 for the novel.|$|E
5|$|Chambers' {{return to}} {{athletics}} took an unusual turn when he confirmed in March 2008 {{that he had}} joined English rugby league team Castleford Tigers on trial; a move which surprised and angered in equal measure given the fact he had never played the sport before. The Rugby Football League did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the move, {{in spite of his}} drug-damaged reputation, but stated much improvement was needed prior to any appearance for Castleford in the Super League competition. At a rugby press conference, Chambers expressed a desire to compete in the Beijing Olympics, casting doubt on his dedication to his new career. Chambers officially registered as a player with the Rugby Football League, and Martin Offiah declared that he was prepared to mentor Chambers. He completed training with the Castleford Tigers first-team squad and made his début in a reserve game against York City Knights, but Castleford announced {{that they would not be}} offering him a contract.|$|E
5|$|Hensley's first {{experience}} with snake handling occurred between 1908 and 1914, after which he held snake-handling services in parts of rural Tennessee. His supporters later asserted that a revival broke out {{at the start of}} his ministry, a claim considered dubious by historians. At first, the Church of God did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> his snake-handling services, and, in 1914, he held a snake-handling meeting with a Church of God bishop in Cleveland, Tennessee. The next year, Hensley applied to be licensed as a Church of God minister, but required his wife's assistance to complete the paperwork owing to his illiteracy. He had memorized some Bible verses but also stated that he received divine revelation while speaking. After being licensed, Hensley held Church of God services throughout Tennessee, including revival services at church general assemblies. He preached about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, a Pentecostal teaching that referred to an additional spiritual experience after conversion. His ministry was often mentioned in Church of God newsletters, and his wife Amanda contributed an article about him. In the 1910s, Hensley is thought to have led churches in Grasshopper Valley (northwest of Cleveland, Tennessee); Cleveland; and Birchwood, Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|By that stage, Vann was {{frustrated}} by the Civil Guard soldiers of Task Force B, because {{they appeared to be}} in no hurry to reach Ap Bac, as they searched one house at a time while marching up from the southwest flank of the battlefield. In his final effort to defeat the Viet Cong, Vann flew into Tan Hiep and asked Cao to deploy an airborne battalion {{on the east side of}} Ap Bac, the most logical retreat route for the Viet Cong. Vann hoped to trap the Viet Cong inside the hamlets by blocking their retreat routes on all sides, and annihilate them using an elite battalion of South Vietnamese paratroopers. To Vann's disappointment, Cao strongly opposed the idea and decided to drop one of his airborne battalions behind the M113 formation on the west side instead. Vann accused Cao of wanting to let the Viet Cong escape in order to avoid further South Vietnamese casualties. However, Cao argued that a surrounded and well-entrenched enemy would fight more fiercely than a retreating one, so he wanted the Viet Cong units inside the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi to expose themselves by retreating through the eastern side of the battlefield, where he could destroy them with artillery and air power. Cao had also lost confidence in Vann, because Cao felt Vann had placed the lives of many South Vietnamese soldiers at risk to save the lives of a handful of Americans. Major-General Tran Thien Khiem, Chief of the ARVN Joint General Staff, was present during the argument. He did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> Cao's plan because it was consistent with President Diem's objective to save Vietnamese lives through the Rural Revolutionary Development and Chieu Hoi Programs, which encouraged Viet Cong fighters to join the South Vietnamese military.|$|E
5|$|By the war's end in 1945, Bruce {{had become}} {{tired of the}} High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's {{successor}} Ben Chifley that he would <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> being replaced in the position. In {{the last years of}} the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work {{came to the attention of}} Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.|$|E
5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did <b>not</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E
