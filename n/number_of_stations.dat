40|$|Abstract — Optimisation of IEEE 802. 11 e MAC {{protocol}} {{performance can}} be performed by modifying several parameters left open in the standard, like buffer size and acknowledgement policies. In this work, an event driven simulator was developed, and {{a comparison of the}} results between the case of standalone services and several services supported simultaneously was addressed. With only a single service, higher values for the goodput are obtained for video and background (BK) traffics, while the lowest is found for the voice application. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> supported users is higher for voice. With mixtures of traffic, when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>station</b> is small the goodput is lower for voice. However, for higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>station,</b> the lowest values of the goodput occur for background traffic. By using the Block Acknowledgement (ACK) procedure, for video and BK traffics, the capacity is improved when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>station</b> is equal or higher than 16 and 12, respectively. From a detailed analysis of the video application, a reduction of more than 40 % was achieved in the delay...|$|R

5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> {{at the eastern}} end of the line. Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M, which provided only a single-platform station {{at the end of its}} line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E

5|$|In March 2000, NSB {{announced}} that they were considering reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> on the commuter rail from the then 31 stations to between 15 and 20. NSB stated that 50% of the stations were responsible for only 2% of the traffic, and that a bus service to these areas—which would transport people to the closest railway station—would be more economic and reduce travel time for the remaining passengers. NSB also stated that they indented to re-brand the service {{as part of the}} Puls brand used for the other commuter rail services. Part of the reason for the change of service was that Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality had permitted TrønderBilene to double the number of services on their competing coach service along the route and the commuter rail needed to increase its speed to not lose customers to the coach.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, {{the unit}} was reorganised {{as the war}} moved north and {{planning}} began for it to deploy further afield. Major Lennard Cumpston took over command from Guiney in March. Meanwhile, in March and April a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> closed or transferred to ANGAU following {{a reduction in the}} threat of large-scale air raids against Australian controlled territory. As debate about the future employment of Australian forces in the Pacific continued, the future of the unit was in doubt and there was consideration given to it being disbanded. However, following a request from the Americans a detachment of 43 signalers, cipher operators, and medical orderlies was subsequently attached to US forces during operations as part of the advance to Hollandia and Tadji, with the NGAWW being the only Australian unit involved in this action.|$|E

The date indicates the official opening date of the line on the section noted in the fourth column. Sections with blue background indicate lines that were opened as tramways, while white background indicates the line was converted to or built as metro standard. The length column indicates the total length of the line at the time of opening or upgrade, and the extension column indicates the length of the extension.

5|$|Besides {{the main}} depot at the South Framingham junction, Framingham has been {{served by a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> inside or just outside its borders. The Agricultural Branch {{included}} three of these stations. One, variously known as Montwait, Mt. Wayte, and Lakeview, was located just north of Mt. Wayte Avenue {{at the north end}} of Farm Pond. The station served the Montwait neighborhood as well as the Montwait Camp Ground, a worship camp used by Methodist, Chautaqua, and later Pentecostal groups from the 1870s to the 1910s. The Framingham Centre station – at times known simply as Framingham – located at Maynard Street adjacent to Route 9. It was opened in 1849 when the branch to Framingham Center was completed. A new station was built in 1855 when the branch was realigned and extended. It also served the Framingham & Lowell after that line opened in 1871. A freight house and coal shed were located nearby to the north. Fayville station was located just over the Southborough border in the Fayville village and also served the western reaches of Framingham. The station was placed at Central Street between Route 9 and Route 30 at or after the 1855 opening of the line. The three stations closed with the end of passenger service on the branch in 1937; none of the buildings remain.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stations</b> monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
