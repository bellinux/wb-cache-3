5|$|CenturyLink Field often sells out for Seahawks games. Although {{the team}} {{struggled}} in 2008 and 2009, the team maintained its base of season ticket holders. Before the 2008 season, the 14,000 single game tickets <b>not</b> <b>already</b> allotted sold out less than 15 minutes after they became available. By {{the end of}} the 2009 season, the Seahawks had sold out 60 consecutive games. After going 9–23 over two seasons in 2008 and 2009, the number of available season tickets was increased to 62,000. The largest crowd to attend a Seahawks game at CenturyLink Field was 69,055 vs the Pittsburgh Steelers on November 29, 2015.|$|E

This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E

5|$|On 15June 1389 Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Branković, and Tvrtko's nobleman Vlatko Vuković of Zachlumia, {{confronted the}} Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad I at the Battle of Kosovo, the best-known battle in medieval Serbian history. With {{the bulk of}} both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, {{the outcome of the}} battle was inconclusive. In its {{aftermath}} the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Serbian principalities which were <b>not</b> <b>already</b> Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 2013, the EBU {{released}} the official {{rules for the}} 2014 contest, which introduced rule changes regarding the jury voting. The rules aimed at providing more transparency regarding each five member national jury by releasing {{the names of all}} jurors on 1 May 2014 {{prior to the start of}} the contest and providing each juror's full ranking results after the conclusion of the contest. In addition, jury members on a particular nation's jury can only serve as a juror if they have <b>not</b> <b>already</b> participated as such in one of the preceding two contest editions.|$|E
5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do <b>not</b> <b>already</b> have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E

5|$|The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had {{supported}} the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499–494BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young {{and prone to}} revolts by its subject peoples. Moreover, Darius was an usurper and had to spend considerable time putting down revolts against his rule. The Ionian Revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those <b>not</b> <b>already</b> part of the empire). Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal {{point in the}} {{development}} of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes <b>not</b> <b>already</b> in operation were cancelled. In the following years, Government budget proposals such as David Lloyd George's establishment of the welfare state in 1909, greatly reduced the power of the Lords. Land value fell around Mayfair, and some leases were not renewed.|$|E

The company offered the authorities free land on the condition that they received a satisfactory intersection with the bridge. A formal agreement was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan had to be made, which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land <b>not</b> <b>already</b> owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E

5|$|A few time-expired E {{models were}} retired in 1967 and 1968, but the bulk (82) were retired between May 1969 and March 1970. Most F models were also retired between 1967 and 1973, but 23 survived as {{trainers}} until late 1978. The fleet of D models served much longer; 80 D models were extensively overhauled under the Pacer Plank program during the mid-1970s. Skinning {{on the lower}} wing and fuselage was replaced, and various structural components were renewed. The fleet of D models stayed largely intact until late 1978, when 37 <b>not</b> <b>already</b> upgraded Ds were retired. The remainder were retired between 1982 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|Although beaten, the Japanese did {{not leave}} the area. Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, the {{commander}} of the Japanese 20th Division, ordered the 80th Infantry Regiment to hold the Wareo area to protect the withdrawal of the 79th Infantry Regiment and other units. The 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment was to act as a rearguard on the coast. Lieutenant General Frank Berryman, the commander of Australian II Corps, now urged Wootten to commence a coastal advance to cut the Japanese supply lines and force Adachi to retreat from the Huon Peninsula if he were <b>not</b> <b>already</b> doing so. Wootten took a more cautious approach. The Battle of Wareo proved that the Japanese intended to defend the area. After a fierce fight, Wootten managed to drive the Japanese from the high ground around Sattelberg and Gusika. In early December, Adachi ordered all his troops to withdraw to Sio. Wareo was captured by the Australians on 8 December and the last Japanese rearguards left the area on 15 December. Meanwhile, Berryman's coastal advance had commenced on 5 December.|$|E
