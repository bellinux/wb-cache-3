5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and <b>North-Eastern</b> Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from <b>North-Eastern</b> Area.|$|E
5|$|On 15January 1942, Northern Area {{was split}} into North-Western Area and <b>North-Eastern</b> Area, to counter {{distinct}} Japanese threats to Ambon and Darwin {{in the former}} case, and Rabaul and Port Moresby in the latter. Lukis remained at Townsville as AOC of the new <b>North-Eastern</b> Area Command. North-Western Area Command was headquartered at Darwin, Northern Territory; its inaugural AOC was Air Commodore Douglas Wilson.|$|E

25|$|Administration {{north of}} the Zambezi was {{rudimentary}} before 1901. In <b>North-Eastern</b> Rhodesia, Abercorn and Fife were fortified outposts and the Administrator of <b>North-Eastern</b> Rhodesia was resident in Blantyre in the British Central Africa Protectorate until Fort Jameson was founded in 1899 as its headquarters. In Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, there was no Secretariat until 1901.|$|E
25|$|<b>North-Eastern</b> Rhodesia was {{initially}} policed by locally recruited rank-and-filers, led by white officers from {{south of the}} river; the first force was raised in 1896. During its early years it busied itself eliminating the slave trade, in which foreign traders, mostly Arabs, captured villagers for sale as slaves overseas. A more regular police force was then introduced by the Company {{in each of the}} northern territories. Because there were so few white immigrants to <b>North-Eastern</b> Rhodesia—and because most of them were men of the church or of business rather than potential recruits—the <b>North-Eastern</b> Rhodesia Constabulary was almost exclusively black, including all of its non-commissioned officers.|$|E
