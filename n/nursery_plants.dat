2500|$|The Fremont area grew rapidly at {{the time}} of the California Gold Rush. [...] A town called Mission San Jose grew up around the old mission, with its own post office from 1850.

60|$|Meanwhile, {{why could}} he not {{make up his mind}} to the absence of {{children}} from a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily to that void, {{as if it were the}} sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never can be thoroughly joyous: under the vague dullness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of an untried good. Dissatisfaction seated musingly on a childless hearth, thinks with envy of the father whose return is greeted by young voices--seated at the meal where the little heads rise one above another like <b>nursery</b> <b>plants,</b> it sees a black care hovering behind every one of them, and thinks the impulses by which men abandon freedom, and seek for ties, are surely nothing but a brief madness. In Godfrey's case there were further reasons why his thoughts should be continually solicited by this one point in his lot: his conscience, never thoroughly easy about Eppie, now gave his childless home the aspect of a retribution; and as the time passed on, under Nancy's refusal to adopt her, any retrieval of his error became more and more difficult.|$|E
