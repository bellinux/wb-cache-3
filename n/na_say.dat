50|$|Before World War II, Eijiro was a young, bright man {{who fell}} in love with Nae Kogure, who is from a wealthy family. When Yuta came to town, Nae falls in love with him, {{planning}} to meet him in the red valley. When Eijiro discovers that Nae is planning to run away with Yuta, he refused to believe that she would go wander off to a world with a wanderer like Yuta. So he staged a meeting to test her loyalty to him. Nae did not realize he had set her up, but it was too late. Eijiro murdered her realizing that she had rejected him for Yuta. After realizing what he did, he hid her body in the red valley. Whatever love he had turned to something disgusting. He states he mostly vowed to find the mermaid ashes to resurrect her and keep her for himself; to do with her as he basically pleased. He would eventually find them and use them to bring her back; but Nae is a shadow of herself. Further, she has an almost instinctive drive to return to the valley and hopefully see Yuta. But he most likely stopped her often, until Yuta and Mana returned. This throws all his plans astray and he tries any means to kill both of them. Whether she vaguely remembers him murdering her or a sounds triggers her murderous side, she hits him with a rock; which shocks him. He then realizes that Nae is heading to the valley again to see Yuta. More proof that even in death, Nae never loved him and still wanted Yuta. He then orders his men to kill her. Though Mana and Yuta stop his plans, he rejects <b>Nae</b> <b>saying</b> she was a demon with no feelings. However, Mana loudly disagrees and states that her love for Yuta is what's driving her to keep some of her old self.|$|R
