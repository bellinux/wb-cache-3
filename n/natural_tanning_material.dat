40|$|Gambier is {{obtained}} from the extraction of leaves and young twigs of Uncaria gambir, a shrub that grows in Indonesia. Gambier contains tannin by 20 % to 55 % so {{that can be used}} as a vegetable <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> using the C-RFP system (C=Conditioning, R=Rapid, F=Fass (drum), P=Powder). This research aimed to determine the effectiveness of gambier as a vegetable <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> using the C-RFP system. Pickled leather underwent a tanning process using the C-RFP system with gambier as the <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> at various percentages, namely by 15 %, 20 %, and 25 %, to be processed as leather for jackets. The variations of oil used to keep the leather supple were 12. 5 %, 15 %, and 17. 5 %. The tanned leather was then tested in terms of its organoleptic, physical, chemical, and morphological properties. Results of the organoleptic test and most of the results of the physical test showed that leather for jackets which was tanned using a vegetable <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> met the requirements set out by SNI 4593 : 2011 (sheepskin/goatskin leather for jackets). Results of the SEM test indicated that leather for jackets which was tanned using a vegetable <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> displayed dense and strong skin tissue, and this proves that gambier is very effective for vegetable tanning using the C-RFP system...|$|R

50|$|Many <b>tanning</b> {{methods and}} <b>materials</b> exist. The choice {{ultimately}} {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> to the leather—and the more <b>tanning</b> <b>material</b> fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|R

50|$|Tanning is {{the process}} that {{converts}} the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable material which will not putrefy and is suitable {{for a wide variety}} of end applications.

40|$|The term of {{eco-friendly}} leather can {{be interpreted}} as chrome-free tanned leather.

Due to environmental requirements and demands on natural products there is an increasing interest on alternatives to chromium tannage especially on vegetable tanned leathers.

In this study, the effect of various <b>tanning</b> <b>materials</b> to the sewability of garment leathers was investigated. For this purpose, vegetable, chromium and chromium-vegetable combination tanned garment leathers from the same animal origin were supplied from a garment leather manufacturing factory.

50|$|During the Medieval era tanning was {{considered}} a skilled trade and was second to wool as a textile fabric. During this period the first job of a tanner was to wash hides free of blood, manure and other curing materials before being rehydrated. To accomplish this task a nearby river or stream was often used. Other methods for this task would include trampling on the hides with feet or pounding on the material with hammers. Upon this task's completion, the hides were then set with the hair side up to remove the hair without damaging the surface. To loosen the hair it was common to either let the leather become putrid or by speeding up the process with liquors such as stale beer, fermented barley or mulberry, dung or bryony leaves. Soaking skins in liquors prepared with wood ash or lime would accomplish a similar effect. When the skin was deemed adequetely prepared it would be stretched over a beam and scraped. The hair side would be scraped with a blunt, single edge unhairing knife and the flesh with a sharper, two-edge fleshing knife. The process would continue with another soaking and scraping with a blunt scudding knife. The {{next step in the}} process was to wash the skin further and then add an alkaline bating to remove excess lime and create a softer, finer grain. After repeating this step, the skin would be laid over the beam once more to remove any of the waste products that were released in the process often referenced as slime. After the skin {{was considered}} cleaned and prepared it was ready for the tanning process. This would occur by placing the skin in a pit on top of ground <b>tanning</b> <b>material,</b> then covered by additional ground <b>tanning</b> <b>material,</b> and the process would be repeated until the pit was nearly full. <b>Tanning</b> <b>materials</b> were dependent on the local landscape and were most often tree matter (oak, birch, willow, spruce, etc.). Upon filling the pit with the skins, the pit would be filled with cold water or another mixture and the skins were left to sit for close to a year. When a tanner judged that the leather was sufficiently tanned, the skins were removed, rinsed, and smoothed with a knife before being slowly dried in a dark space. At the point that the leather is dried, it is sold to a currier for additional processing.|$|R
