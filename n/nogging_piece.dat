5000|$|In construction, a nogging or <b>nogging</b> <b>piece</b> (England, Australia), dwang (Scotland Central {{and lower}} North Island, New Zealand and South Island, New Zealand,), {{blocking}} (North America), noggin (Greater Auckland region North Island, New Zealand), or nogs (New Zealand and Australia [...] ) are horizontal bracing pieces used between wall studs or floor joists to give rigidity {{to the wall}} or floor frames of a building. Noggings may be made of timber, steel, or aluminium. If made of timber they are cut slightly longer than the space they fit into, and are driven into place so they fit tightly or are rebated into the wall stud.|$|E
40|$|The heat {{requirement}} {{of a building}} can {{turn out to be}} greater than was calculated at the design stage. The reason for this may be that heat transport though the building envelope is greater than expected. This in turn can be due to the structure not fulfilling the design requirements in respect of windtightness and airtightness. In addition, there may be defects in the quality of the workmanship of the insulation that significantly reduce the thermal resistance of the external wall. The objective of this investigation has been to ascertain how normal variations in the insulation can affect heat transport through a well insulated wooden frame external wall under the influences of incident wind or wind flow through the wall. These 'normal variations' have been taken to be the presence of electrical conduits, breaks in the insulation, airgaps and nogging pieces, either singly or in combination. For incident wind, measurements in a hotbox and theoretical simulations have shown that the presence of electrical conduits, breaks in the insulation, airgaps or nogging pieces in a well insulated wooden frame external wall, whether singly or in combination, have negligible effect on thermal transport when subjected to incident wind. Heat transport is affected, however, by the presence of a break in the insulation: the combination of electrical conduits, airgaps, a <b>nogging</b> <b>piece</b> and a 16 mm gap in the insulation increased the U value of the wall by 0. 028 W/(m²·K) at the most. Measuring the effects of a flow of air through the insulation involved simulating a break in the air seal. A pressure difference of between 10 Pa and 20 Pa was established, causing air to flow from the cold side to the warm side. Measurements and calculations have shown that normal variations in the insulation have a negligible effect on the transmission losses on the cold side, due to the heat exchange effect of the insulation, which raises the temperature of the air flowing through it. This has meant that as the air flow increases, the transmission losses on the cold side have decreased while those on the warm side have increased. Air flow through a wall {{does not necessarily mean that}} the heat demand of the building will increase...|$|E
40|$|Lattelement AB in Ornskoldsvik {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{companies}} in Sweden in composite elements in walls, floors and roofs in particular. The company supplies elements to buildings located with a wide geographical variation, which means that the products are subjected to very different climate with regard to snow, wind and humidity. This places high demands and requires the elements to withstand large variable loads. The elements are made of lightweight beams with flanges of structural timber and beam webs made of OSB. These are bound together by <b>nogging</b> <b>pieces</b> with the same kind of structure. On top of the beams a nailed and glued plywood is added to absorb compressive forces and on the underside of the element a sheet of steel is added for tensile absorption. These elements are then attached to the building framework in different ways depending on the particular element height, loads and the structual supporting material of the frame work. In this thesis, one of the company's more common attachment arrangements has been closely investigated. Experimental laboratory tests on the attachment has been performed where the pressure perpendicular to the fibers of the top flange of the lightweight beam and the axial pull-out capacity of the screws have been investigated. This has then been compared and evaluated against theoretical calculations on the bracket. The results shows that the lightweight beam can sustain loads up to 17. 0 kN in experiment as to comparison with the theoretical limit 7. 6 kN. This in contrast with the screws that passed lower forces experimentally, 5. 8 kN, than theoretically, 12. 48 kN...|$|R
