The heavy metal band White Zombie appropriated their name from the film. The group's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film, [...] " [...] a great film that <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> know about...It amazes me that a film that is so readily available can be so lost."

500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band.

Charles' secret weapon {{turned out to be}} not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded {{for all the world like}} a Pixies song.|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face... there were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E
2500|$|Das Racist's unique {{style has}} a strong {{polarizing}} tendency; their set at the 2009 Pop Montreal festival was described as [...] "the most divisive show seen at the festival". They describe their approach to music as [...] "'deconstructionalist': sawing the legs out from under hip-hop as they celebrate it". New York Times wrote [...] "Das Racist’s lack of piety has become an aesthetic of its own, with songs that are as much commentary on hip-hop as rigorous practice of it". The Root said DasRacist could speak for both [...] "the ‘hood or the nearest gated community". Playboy called the duo [...] "equal parts hip-hop and Cheech & Chong". In an interview with Sepia Mutiny, Suri described Das Racist's music:we’re not making music that’s instantly appealing. We dabble with non sequiturs, dadaism, repetition, repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it’s a mask on some Paul Laurence Dunbar shit for actual discontent {{with a lot of}} shit in the world. Further, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> want to hear rappers talk about Dinesh D'Souza being a punk, Eddie Said, Gayatri Spivak being dope or even know who they are.

5000|$|Played by Whitehouse in {{the style}} of Michael Caine as parodied by Peter Sellers in his infamous {{appearance}} on Parkinson in the early 70's. The parody is in part based on Caine's character from The Italian Job released in 1969 and so loved by British audiences ("I told you to only blow the bloody doors off") and his diction when presenting his lines in many of his films. It relies on Caine's ability to impart trivial information in the same way, starting with [...] "Did you know..." [...] and ending with [...] ".. and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> know that.". Whitehouse continues in this tradition, talking about extremely dreary things his neighbours were doing such as [...] "do you know, he didn't call that woman back until... approximately two hours later.
