40|$|The <b>non-compliance</b> of {{patients}} with prescribed treatments is considered {{as a barrier to}} effective health care. <b>Non-compliance</b> has implications for the health {{of patients}}, effective use of resources and assessments of the clinical efficacy of treatments. Research into <b>non-compliance</b> has increased over the last 30 years. This seems to indicate that it is seen as an important area of concern for all health care professionals. Definitions of <b>non-compliance</b> are problematic, as are methods of assessment of its nature and frequency. Many factors which may account for <b>non-compliance</b> have been proposed, as well as methods to improve compliance. Research into these factors however, mainly based on a positivist epistemology, has failed to provide any conclusive answers to the problem. Sound clinical reasons are suggested {{as the basis for the}} increase in interest in <b>non-compliance.</b> It is contended, however, that it is not only these reasons that account for the identification of <b>non-compliance</b> as a problem. Non-compliant behaviour is seen as problematic, because it contravenes professional beliefs, norms and expectations regarding the ‘proper’ roles of patients and professionals. These have formed the basis of an ideology that views patients as passive recipients of health care. It has led to an inherent tendency to ‘blame’ the patient and view <b>non-compliance</b> as irrational and deviant. The professional view of <b>non-compliance</b> as irrational, is exemplified in the case of individuals with mental illness, where there are inherent assumptions that <b>non-compliance</b> can be seen primarily as a symptom of illness. This denies the legitimacy of patient choice, and has led to attempts to control compliance via suggested legislative measures. Serious moral and ethical problems arise from such measures, and can be seen as the ultimate legitimization of an ideology of <b>non-compliance.</b> The maintenance of professional power and control is suggested as central to the debates surrounding <b>non-compliance.</b> The ideological assumptions underpinning the concept of <b>non-compliance</b> need questioning, and a re-conceptualization of the roles of patients and professionals is required. This must involve a view of patients as active participators in their own health care. Research based on an interpretative epistemology, aimed at understanding individual action, rather than control, would seem a more appropriate model to pursue...|$|R

40|$|<b>Non-compliance</b> {{with drug}} therapies not only limits their effectiveness, {{but in some}} instances, is {{associated}} with grave clinical sequelae and substantial economic burden. It is important, therefore, to consider <b>non-compliance</b> in economic evaluations. A review of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, which have applied sensitivity analysis to <b>non-compliance</b> rates, was undertaken to evaluate the impact of <b>non-compliance</b> on the cost-effectiveness of different drug therapies. Although 22 evaluations satisfied the inclusion criteria, additional information {{was obtained from the}} authors of most studies, as the published details were inadequate. The majority of evaluations assumed altered effectiveness owing to reduced compliance in the absence of supportive clinical evidence. Because of the disparity {{in the nature of the}} outcomes, the measures of <b>non-compliance</b> and the time horizon of the studies evaluated, it was not possible to compare the magnitude of the impact of <b>non-compliance</b> among different drug-disease combinations. However, it was evident that <b>non-compliance</b> always results in a reduction in efficacy, but its impact on costs varied substantially. The importance of incorporating measures of compliance is highlighted, as failing to account for 'real world' compliance rates in pharmacoeconomic evaluations may lead to selection of sub-optimal treatment strategies.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDigoxin {{is highly}} potent and efficacious for {{treatment}} of heart failure (HF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF) yet compliance is often poor. AimsTo examine prevalence rates of <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin; variations between clinical settings, types of <b>non-compliance</b> and methods of detection; and potential factors influencing <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin. MethodsThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies of <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin in patients with HF and/or AF, published in English. The studies were identified through these bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA and Cochrane CENTRAL. Subgroup analysis examined the influence of clinical settings, types of <b>non-compliance</b> and methods of detection. ResultsTen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1841 patients with HF and/or AF. The corresponding prevalence rates of <b>non-compliance</b> for outpatients, after hospital discharge and inpatients were 43. 1 % (interquartile range [IQR] 29 – 48 %), 25 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12 – 37 %) and 4. 5 %, respectively. In patients with HF and AF co-morbidities, the prevalence rate of <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin was 38. 7 % (IQR 27 – 46 %); the corresponding prevalence rates of overdosing and underdosing were 33. 04 % (IQR 22 – 49 %) and 33. 8 % (95 % CI 25 – 42 %), respectively. Rates varied depending on the methods of detecting <b>non-compliance.</b> Regularity of prescribed dose, diuretic use, coronary artery bypass, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, number of office visits and pill boxes demonstrated strong associations with <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin. ConclusionsNon-compliance with digoxin is prevalent among patients with HF and/or AF.

Methods: This is an observational cohort study of data extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database, comprising data on patients served by over 350 primary care practices in the UK. Participants {{were included in the}} study if they had diagnostic codes indicative of type 1 diabetes.

40|$|Whether or not fishers {{comply with}} {{regulation}} {{depends on the}} economic and social context in which they operate their vessels. This is how conventional theory explains the phenomenon of <b>non-compliance.</b> It treats state-community interaction processes not as direct causes for <b>non-compliance</b> but rather as background conditions shaping individual fishers' perception and decisions for action. This paper argues that conventional theory fails to include the dynamics of tempo-relational processes between state and communities, which explains collective patterns of <b>non-compliance</b> in fisheries. The paper addresses this hiatus in the literature, using a process-sociological approach to analyse <b>non-compliance</b> in Vietnamese marine fisheries. The analysis highlights that Vietnamese marine fisheries are mainly regulated through informal networks of trust and mistrust, which function through their interplay with the highly centralised and formalised Vietnamese state. Based on this assessment, the paper concludes that outcomes of processes of the dynamic social interplay between state and communities are semi-dependent on individual perception and action, and as such have a causal effect of their own on patterns of <b>non-compliance</b> in fisheries. <b>Non-compliance</b> Process-sociological approach Sociology Marine fisheries Case study Vietnam...|$|R
