This work aimed {{to study the}} effect of three green-house covers (polyethylene sheet, white and black net) and three irrigation levels [80 %, 100 % and 120 % of the potential evapotranspiration estimated according to class A pan equation (ETo) ], applied by drip irrigation system, on plant growth and crop yield of Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Reda F 1). The experimental design was split–plot with three replicates. The results showed that white net green-house cover optimized growth and yield of cucumber plant. White <b>net</b> <b>cover</b> treatment recorded the highest vegetative growth (plant height, number of leaves, total leaves area, total fresh and dry weights), and significantly increased total yield. The highest vegetative growth was obtained by 100 % ETo compared to 80 % and 120 % ETo treatments.

In 2007 and 2008 we tested a protective net, rotenone and spinosad in a biodynamic peach orchard in Castrofilippo (AG). Traps baited with Trimedlure were placed in July and observed weekly. In 2007 there were 3 plots: rotenone, <b>net</b> <b>cover</b> and untreated. In 2008 a thesis with spinosad was added. Since the beginning of August four rotenone and spinosad treatments were done weekly. The net plot was covered {{since the end of}} July.

First male captures were recorded at the end of July, with an average, at the commercial harvesting, of 5 adults/trap/week in the first and 11 in the second year. Statistic analyses performed on the different theses at each sampling date, show that infestation was almost absent and significantly lower in both years under the net (0 - 2 %). In 2007 infestation in rotenone thesis reached 78 % in the third sampling, showing statistically differences with the net thesis but not with the untreated one.

40|$|Anti-hail nets {{may change}} the {{microclimate}} of orchards and hence modify the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of fruits. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of anti-hail nets on the physical, chemical, and sensory attributes of apples grown in southern Brazil. The {{study was conducted in}} commercial orchards, with apples grown under a black anti-hail net under an open sky during the 2008 / 2009, 2009 / 2010, and 2010 / 2011 cycles. Measurements of photosynthetically active radiation were collected at both sites. Physical, chemical, and sensory analyses of fruits were performed in the laboratory. The anti-hail net reduced incident photosynthetically active radiation by 32 %. The light spectrum in the canopy changed the corresponding R/FR (red/far-red) ratio in the lower and upper canopy layers from 0. 27 to 1. 55, respectively. In contrast to the majority of microclimate studies carried out in the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, this study in the southern hemisphere showed that although it reduced the incident solar radiation, the cover did not change the color or organoleptic characteristics of ?Royal Gala? and ?Fuji Suprema? apples. The <b>net</b> <b>cover</b> prolonged the subperiod between fruit setting and harvesting, thus slowing fruit ripening. Therefore, the use of anti-hail nets on apple orchards is a suitable alternative for the protection of apple trees against hail because it causes only small changes in the microclimate and in the maturation period, ensuring fruit production without affecting its quality. 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the substrate, cuttings collection time, the position and the cutting depth, and the propagation environment on rooting of 'Purple Valinhos' fig tree cuttings in Southwestern Paraná, Brazil. Two experiments were carried out at UTFPR, Câmpus Dois Vizinhos, with hardwoods cuttings from Roxo de Valinhos fig tree. The first experiment used a randomized block design, in 3 x 3 x 2 factorial (substrate x environment x collection time), with four replications of 10 cuttings per plot. The cuttings were collected in the first fifteen days of July and August. The substrates were sand, soil and the mixture of these [1 : 1 (v / v) ]. The environments used were open sky, tunnel with plastic cover and tunnel with half-shade black <b>net</b> <b>cover.</b> The second experiment used a randomized block design, 2 x 2 x 3 factorial (shoot cutting position x soil cover x shoot cutting depth), with four replications of 12 cuttings per plot. In the factor position, the vertically (0 º inclination) and inclined (45 º inclination) shoot cuttings were evaluated. Soil cover was tested with mulching plastic cover or not. The tested depths were 1 / 3, 1 / 2 and 2 / 3 in relation to the total length of the shoot cutting. In both experiments, the following were analyzed: rooting and mortality indices, number of leaves and primary shoots, length of the three largest roots per cutting. It was conclude that, the protected environment with plastic cover on sand as substrate must recommended for the rooting of fig estaca, collecting them in the first half of July.
