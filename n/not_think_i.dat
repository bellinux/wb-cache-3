25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

When it comes my turn to sell my land, I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall give it up as they did."

When I sit in my wigwam & smoke my pipe, I think of what has past and what is to come, and it makes my heart shake. When business comes before us, we will try and act like Chiefs.

500|$|At {{the close}} of Grant's two terms as {{president}} in 1877, the Republican-controlled Congress suggested that Grant {{not return to the}} White House for a third term. Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife Julia, [...] "I {{do not want to be}} here [...] another four years. I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could stand it." [...] After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E
500|$|Charles Darwin's {{studies at}} the University of Cambridge {{included}} two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired [...] "a burning zeal" [...] to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing [...] "books to be read", including [...] "Paley's Nat. Theology". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk {{had been going on for}} a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. Ike sat down to have another drink, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp [...] "You must <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> won't be after you all in the morning." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E

(Vote: For): President Truman later noted, [...] "The {{facts were}} {{that not only}} were there {{pressure}} movements around the United Nations unlike anything that had been seen there before, but that the White House, too, was subjected to a constant barrage.

"I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am overstating {{anything}} when I {{say that this}} phenomenon [...] can truly be likened to a cancer eating away remorselessly at the fabric of corporate privacy and extending its baleful effect into all aspects of administrative functions, whether state official or private sector manager. If it is not checked, it becomes systemic.

2500|$|On June 6, 2007, Calò and his co-defendants {{were cleared}} of murdering Calvi. The {{presiding}} {{judge in the}} trial threw out the charges because of [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] in a surprise verdict after 20 months of evidence. Calò, who gave evidence from his high security prison, denied the charges. [...] "I {{had no interest in}} killing Calvi," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't have the time, nor the inclination. Besides, if I had wanted him dead do you <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would have picked my own people to do the job?" [...] Calò's defence argued there were others who had wanted Calvi silenced.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 2008, Blair {{announced}} he would resign as Metropolitan Police Commissioner, with effect from 1 December 2008. He blamed a lack of support from London mayor Boris Johnson, saying that [...] "without the mayor's backing I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can continue". Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to Blair's service. Sir Paul Stephenson took over on 28 November 2008. Blair is entitled to a full police pension, estimated to be worth about £160,000 per year, based on his £240,000 commissioner’s salary. Blair was eligible to continue to receive his £234,000-a-year salary until his contract expired in February 2010. However, he lost his chauffeur-driven car and use of a £1 million flat in south-west London.|$|E

2500|$|Zionist {{lobbying}} in the United States aided {{the creation}} of the State of Israel in 1947-48. [...] The preparation of and voting for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine which preceded the Israeli Declaration of Independence, was met with an outpouring of Jewish American support and advocacy in Washington. President Truman later noted, [...] "The facts were that not only were there pressure movements around the United Nations unlike anything that had been seen there before, but that the White House, too, was subjected to a constant barrage.

2500|$|Between 1958 and 1961 Ōe {{published}} {{a series of}} works incorporating sexual metaphors for the occupation of Japan. He summarised the common theme of these stories as [...] "the relationship of a foreigner as the big power , a Japanese who {{is more or less}} placed in a humiliating position , and, sandwiched between the two, the third party [...] (sometimes a prostitute who caters only to foreigners or an interpreter)". In each of these works, the Japanese X is inactive, failing to take the initiative to resolve the situation and showing no psychological or spiritual development. The graphically sexual nature of this group of stories prompted a critical outcry; Ōe said of the culmination of the series Our Times, [...] "I personally like this novel [...] I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will ever write another novel which is filled only with sexual words." ...|$|E

2500|$|When first published, Nineteen Eighty-Four was {{generally}} well received by reviewers. V. S. Pritchett, reviewing the novel for the New Statesman stated: [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, {{such are the}} originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation {{that it is impossible}} to put the book down." [...] P. H. Newby, reviewing Nineteen Eighty-Four for The Listener magazine, described it as [...] "the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman since Rex Warner's The Aerodrome." [...] Nineteen Eighty-Four was also praised by Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster and Harold Nicolson. On the other hand, Edward Shanks, reviewing Nineteen Eighty-Four for The Sunday Times, was dismissive; Shanks claimed Nineteen Eighty-Four [...] "breaks all records for gloomy vaticination". C. S. Lewis was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was [...] "odious rather than tragic".|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he.

2500|$|Residence {{requirements}} kept Darwin in Cambridge till June. He {{resumed his}} beetle collecting, took career advice from Henslow, and read William Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity which {{set out to}} refute David Hume's argument that [...] "design" [...] by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect adaptation to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of Erasmus Darwin as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence. Paley's benevolent God acted in nature though uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a theodicy explaining the problem of evil by separating nature from direct divine action. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science. He later wrote [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E
