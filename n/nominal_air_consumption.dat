40|$|Compressed air {{is a major}} {{component}} of energy costs incurred in the weaving of textile fabrics on air-jet looms. The <b>consumption</b> of compressed <b>air</b> in air-jet weaving depends on different process variables. In this study, the effect of weft yarn count, reed count, fabric width and loom speed on the compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> of air-jet loom was determined using response surface methodology. Fabric width was found to be the most dominant factor affecting the <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> followed by loom speed, reed count, and weft yarn count respectively. A statistical model for predicting the compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> on air-jet loom was developed. The prediction ability and accuracy of the developed model was assessed by the fitted line plot between the predicted and actual <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> values. The prediction model may be used for optimizing the production planning, estimating the share of compressed air cost in weaving a particular fabric style, and in identifying any air wastages in the weaving shed by comparing the actual compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> with that predicted by the model which was developed under controlled conditions without any air leakages...|$|R

The way information is routed can be massaged to give the best solution-that being one that aptly satisfies both of these constraints. But, are the routers on a <b>nominal</b> <b>Air</b> Force base set up with all of these things in mind? The basis for this study will be graph theory, which will supply the tools necessary to analyze the underlying mathematical construct of the router configuration.

40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive weaving machines. However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet weaving machine is higher as compared with rapier and projectile weaving machines. This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet weaving machines comparing projectile weaving machines. In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet weft insertion. However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five weaving machine of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> was varying almost in all weaving machines. Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure.
