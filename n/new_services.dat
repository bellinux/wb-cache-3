5|$|Although {{deregulation}} itself {{took place}} in October 1986, Kelvin received permission to introduce its new routes from 31 August. A number of <b>new</b> <b>services</b> were started in competition with Strathclyde Buses, running from Glasgow to Clydebank, Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Springburn. Strathclyde responded by extending its services into Clydebank, Cumbernauld, Dumbarton, Kirkintilloch and Milngavie.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Fluor {{introduced}} <b>new</b> <b>services</b> like equipment rentals and staffing.

5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} <b>new</b> <b>services</b> in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After the {{nationalisation}} of British Rail in 1948, Marylebone {{was initially}} kept open as a long-distance station. <b>New</b> <b>services</b> were introduced, including the Master Cutler service to Sheffield and the South Yorkshireman to Bradford, {{but they were}} not well-used. From 1949, all local services towards High Wycombe and Princes Risborough were routed into Marylebone, although the frequency of trains was reduced two years later.|$|E
5|$|Euston was {{constructed}} as two separate underground stations. Three {{of the four}} Northern line platforms date from the station's opening in 1907. The fourth Northern line platform and the two Victoria line platforms were constructed in the 1960s when the station was significantly altered to accommodate the Victoria line. Plans for High Speed 2 and Crossrail 2 both include proposals to modify the station to provide interchanges with the <b>new</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} a supplier’s <b>new</b> <b>service</b> development capabilities and detail the means of capability development. Currently, most research stresses the active role of a customer in <b>new</b> <b>service</b> development. However, a service supplier needs to develop <b>new</b> <b>service</b> development capabilities to enable and enhance that active role. We use a multiple case study to detect such capabilities in a technological service setting. As a result, the study categorizes the capabilities into service-, structure- and interaction-based <b>new</b> <b>service</b> co-creation capabilities and finds interaction to be an important contributor to their development. The study provides tentative tools for managers that seek to involve their customers in the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> development process...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the case}} {{involving}} the International <b>News</b> <b>Service</b> (INS) and the Associated Press (AP) in 1918, New York created a misappropriation law.

5|$|The company {{expanded}} its operations in Glasgow prior to bus deregulation in 1986. <b>New</b> <b>services</b> {{were introduced in}} competition with Strathclyde Buses, many using AEC Routemaster double-deckers operated by conductors. Kelvin suffered from vehicle maintenance problems, and on two occasions was forced to hire vehicles from other companies to ensure operation of all its routes. After Kelvin lost money in 1987, the depot at Milngavie was closed and many routes withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Boeing 737-700s {{were taken}} into use {{starting}} in 1998, and the company rebranded from Braathens SAFE to Braathens. That year also saw the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which increased Braathens number of slots and allowed them {{to start a new}} route to Haugesund. Braathens started a costly price war with its competitors Color Air and SAS; after Color Air went bankrupt in 1999, Braathens started terminating routes, and the Swedish division was merged into the subsidiary Malmö Aviation. Málaga and Alicante were introduced as destinations in 2000. The next year, Braathens was bought by the SAS Group, and in 2002, the routes were split between SAS and Braathens. The latter kept only four international routes, but was granted <b>new</b> <b>services</b> to Northern Norway: Alta, Bardufoss, Kirkenes and Lakselv. Braathens was merged with SAS to create SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} came in April 1985, following {{over a year}} {{of consultation}} with county council members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by other operators. Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two new vehicles were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, {{the second of the}} <b>new</b> <b>services,</b> circular route 23/25, was reduced in frequency from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another new service, linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and <b>new</b> <b>services</b> to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, Braathens SAFE {{increased}} the number of services. The daily number of flights from Oslo to Bergen increased to nine, and the airline introduced four <b>new</b> <b>services</b> to Northern Norway from Oslo: two each to Tromsø and Harstad/Narvik. Later, the frequency to Tromsø increased to four, and from 28 June there were also two daily round trips to Bodø. SAS increased its services on the routes from Oslo to Stavanger and Trondheim, and from Bergen to Stavanger. The liberalization did not result in a price war, and prices remained constant. The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim.|$|E
