25|$|In 2000, {{the strain}} {{was found on}} the coast of California (U.S.A.), <b>near</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego,</b> and also on the coast of New South Wales, Australia. The California {{colonization}} was small enough to be considered controllable: it was covered with tarpaulin which was held down with sandbags {{at the edges of the}} infestation. Then chlorine was poured in through tubes which fed into certain openings in the tarpaulin: the interior of the tarpaulin filled up with chlorine and killed living organisms inside it, not only the unwanted alga but also fish, invertebrates and other seaweeds. The killing of such other organisms was not desirable but was deemed preferable to letting the algae grow unchecked.|$|E

25|$|Woods {{opened his}} 2011 {{season at the}} Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course <b>near</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego.</b> He has enjoyed {{tremendous}} success there, with six past Tour titles and a dramatic playoff win in the 2008 U.S. Open, but was making his first appearance at the course since that 2008 major win. Woods played strongly {{for the first two}} rounds, scoring 69-69 to sit five strokes behind halfway leader Bill Haas. But on the weekend, many wayward approach shots found greenside bunkers, and Woods was unable to recover sufficiently well to stay in contention. He scored 74-75 to end at one-under-par 287, 15 strokes behind winner Bubba Watson, in a tie for 44th place. It was the worst season-opening performance of his career.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons <b>near</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|E
500|$|McMillan {{joined the}} Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory [...] <b>near</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> in August 1941. There {{he worked on}} a device called a polyscope. The idea, which came from Lawrence, was to use sonar {{to build up a}} visual image of the {{surrounding}} water. This proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar, because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound. The polyscope proved to be impractical, and was abandoned. He also, however, developed a sonar training device for submariners, for which he received a patent.|$|E
