50|$|TPCs {{have been}} implicated in fatty liver diseases, such as <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH.</b> As TPC2 is a cation channel for endocytotic {{membrane}} trafficking, TPCs contribute in trafficking LDL molecules for their breakdown and recycling. This primarily occurs within the liver. The degradation pathway causes LDL {{to end up in}} endosomes and lysosomes - where TPCs are located. The TPC mechanism once again allows the influx of calcium for the fusion of the endosomes and lysosomes (where LDL is degraded). When TPCs are not present, or are not functioning properly, the degradation pathway results in defected trafficking. Without the fusion event LDL accumulates in liver cells. The loss of TPCs {{have been found to be}} a cause of the yellow coloration of liver, an expression of fatty liver which indicates liver damage.|$|E
40|$|Background: Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} (NAFLD) is a common, multi-factorial, and poorly {{understood}} liver disease whose incidence is globally rising. NAFLD is generally asymptomatic and associated with other {{manifestations of the}} metabolic syndrome. Yet, up to 25 % of NAFLD patients develop a progressive inflammatory liver disease termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that may progress towards cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, {{and the need for}} liver transplantation. In recent years, several lines of evidence suggest that the gut microbiome represents a significant environmental factor contributing to NAFLD development and its progression into NASH. Suggested microbiome-associated mechanisms contributing to <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH</b> include dysbiosis-induced deregulation of the gut endothelial barrier function, which facilitates systemic bacterial translocation, and intestinal and hepatic inflammation. Furthermore, increased microbiome-modulated metabolites such as lipopolysaccharides, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and ethanol, may affect liver pathology through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Scope of review: Herein, we discuss the associations, mechanisms, and clinical implications of the microbiome's contribution to <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH.</b> Understanding these contributions to the development of fatty liver pathogenesis and its clinical course may serve as a basis for development of therapeutic microbiome-targeting approaches for treatment and prevention of <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH.</b> Major conclusions: Intestinal host–microbiome interactions play diverse roles in the pathogenesis and progression of <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH.</b> Elucidation of the mechanisms driving these microbial effects on the pathogenesis of <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH</b> may enable to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic targets of these common metabolic liver diseases.

Our data showed that iHep cells were capable of synthesizing lipids from a cis-unsaturated fatty acid, a trans-unsaturated fatty acid, and a saturated fatty acid, accumulating the synthesized lipids in cellular vesicles, and secreting the lipids into the culture medium. Moreover, the lipid synthesis in iHep cells was significantly inhibited in cultures with lipid metabolism improvers.

Although liver biopsy is the keystone of patient management in NAFLD, it is also increasingly clear that such evaluation has its limitations. The availability of biochemical markers of <b>NAFLD</b> <b>and</b> <b>NASH</b> has tremendous potential to radically alter management strategies for these conditions, as well as to monitor disease activity. Our article provides an overview of biomarker discovery and selection in the setting of NAFLD and highlights future directions in the field...|$|E
40|$|Systems biology uses {{mathematical}} {{models to}} analyze large datasets and simulate system behavior. It enables integrative analysis {{of different types}} of data and can thereby provide new insight into complex biological systems. Here will be discussed the challenges of using systems medicine for advancing the development of personalized and precision medicine to treat metabolic diseases like insulin resistance, obesity, <b>NAFLD,</b> <b>NASH,</b> <b>and</b> cancer. It will be illustrated how the concept of genome-scale metabolic models can be used for integrative analysis of big data with the objective of identifying novel biomarkers that are foundational for personalized and precision medicine...|$|R
40|$|Due to obesity epidemics, nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (<b>NAFLD)</b> <b>and</b> nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (<b>NASH)</b> are becoming the main causes of chronic liver disease in western countries. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a potentially progressive disease that may cause cirrhosis. We analysed liver histology in 505 {{patients at the}} time of gastric by-pass surgery. Steatosis was present in 92 % of these patients, mild (< 30 % of hepatocytes) in 46 %, moderate (30 - 60 % of hepatocytes) in 30 %, and severe in 23 %. Insulin resistance, diabetes, elevated ferritin and elevated liver tests were independent predictors of NASH in the liver these obese patients. Early identification of these factors might help to select patients at risk of NASH in whom liver biopsy should be considered...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<b>NAFLD)</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (<b>NASH)</b> is increasing world-wide in {{parallel to the}} increase of the obesity epidemic. Insulin resistance (IR) and the accumulation of triglyceride-derived toxic lipid metabo-lites {{play a key role}} in its pathogenesis. Multiple biomarkers are being evaluated for the non-invasive diag-nosis of NASH. However, a percutaneous liver biopsy is still the gold standard method; the minimal diagnostic criteria include the presence of [5 % macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation, and liver cell ballooning. Several pharmaceutical agents have been evaluated for the treat-ment of NASH; however, no single therapy has been approved so far. Due to the increasing prevalence and th...|$|R
