As a wheel turns to zero, it transfers its value to a sector gear located between the odd/even columns. These values are transferred to the odd column causing them to count up.

In the interest of saving space, and noting that the results based on the 5 -product and 10 -product indicators typically very similar, we report only regressions based on the Herfindahl and 5 -product indices. We discuss differences between the 5 -product and 10 -product estimators when they arise, and results based on the 10 product indicator are available upon request. In general, and unless otherwise indicated, results based on the Herfindahl index are reported in odd <b>numbered</b> <b>columns,</b> and results based on the 5 product index are reported in even <b>numbered</b> <b>columns.</b> ∗The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed {{in this article are}} entirely those of the authors.
