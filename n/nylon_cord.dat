25|$|Inside Bonin's van, {{investigators}} discovered numerous artifacts attesting to his culpability in the Freeway Killer murders. These {{items included}} various restraining devices including lengths of <b>nylon</b> <b>cord,</b> {{an assortment of}} knives, a tire iron, and household implements such as pliers and coat hangers. Furthermore, both the interior of Bonin's van and sections of his home were extensively bloodstained, and the inner handles from the passenger-side and rear doors of his vehicle had been removed in an obvious effort to prevent a victim escaping the vehicle. Inside the glove box, investigators also discovered a scrapbook of newspaper clippings related to the murders.|$|E
25|$|Ribbon: It {{is made of}} satin {{or another}} similar {{material}} cloth of any colour and may be multi-coloured as well as have designs on it. The ribbon itself {{must be at least}} 35g (1oz), 4–6cm (1.6–2.4") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with buttonhole stitch or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, <b>nylon</b> <b>cord,</b> or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7cm (2.8"), not counting the strap or metal ring {{at the end of the}} stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, at age 19, Nisonoff {{graduated}} from Rutgers with a chemistry degree, {{and went to}} work for the U.S. Rubber company in Detroit, Michigan. He was assigned to determine a way to adhere <b>nylon</b> <b>cords</b> to rubber airline tires in order to add strength to the tires, previously manufactured using cotton cords. In passing through the factory, he stopped to watch a process in which <b>nylon</b> <b>cords</b> were used in strengthening self-sealing gas tanks made of rubber, and adapted this same process to the problem that faced him in strengthening the airplane tires. This type of analytical and creative thinking would prove to be useful in his future research on the structure of the antibody.|$|R

40|$|Stair-step loading, cyclic loading, and {{long-term}} relaxation tests {{were performed on}} an aircraft tire to observe the quasi-static viscoelastic response of the tire. The data indicate that the tire continues to respond viscoelastically even {{after it has been}} softened by deformation. Load relaxation data from the stair-step test at the 15000 -lb loading was fit to a monotonically decreasing Prony series. Introduction Aircraft tires are composite structures made of carbon-filled rubber, <b>nylon</b> <b>cords,</b> and steel wires. Under normal loading conditions, tires are subjected to large deformations with the constituents experiencing moderate strains. During aircraft ground operations and landings, the dynamic deformations of tires result in dissipative internal stresses. Tread friction and wear performance are affected, and heat is generated in the tire carcass. (See refs. 1 and 2.) Computational models that predict the dynamic responses of aircraft tires should address their viscous characteristi [...] ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} {{the results of}} the {{measurements}} of thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat of some rubber compounds reinforced with polyamide textile <b>cords</b> (<b>nylon</b> <b>cords)</b> are presented. For thermal diffusivity the relationship between this quantity and temperature was measured within the temperature range 20 – 170 C. Both type and arrangement of reinforcement and matrix composition have an effect on thermal properties. For the heat flow perpendicular to the fiber direction, the rate of heat conduction is limited by the properties of the matrix. In this case, thermal properties of composites are approaching the properties of this component. Thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity increase with the number of twists per 1 m of cord length because of the effect of thermal contact resistance in textile cords on the thermal properties perpendicular to the fiber direction. The thermal diffusivity parallel to the fiber direction is compared with the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the fiber direction and to the thermal diffusivity of the matrix...|$|R
50|$|Nylon Aylmeri jesses have {{recently}} grown in popularity. Thinner, lighter, and stronger, {{they do not}} rot or need oiling to stay supple. The anklets are grommetted on, like their leather counterparts, but instead of a folded button keeping the straps from falling through the anklets, a knot is used. The end of the knot is melted with a cigarette lighter {{to keep it from}} fraying. In order to form the loops the swivel or clips will attach to, a <b>nylon</b> parachute <b>cord</b> is hollowed out, threaded up through itself using an awl, and knotted.|$|R

25|$|A {{developing}} {{trend in}} the knitting world is interchangeable needles. These kits consist of pairs of needles with usually <b>nylon</b> cables or <b>cords.</b> The cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles.

50|$|A Prusik hitch is tied using a loop {{of narrow}} but strong <b>nylon</b> {{accessory}} <b>cord</b> or a sling. Note that Dyneema/Spectra {{has a very}} low melting point {{and should not be}} used in Prusik hitches unless the cord or sling is specifically engineered for it (as seen in some sheathed constructions). The length of this loop depends on the application. For instance, the loop used for an Auto-Bloc might only be 20 cm, whereas the foot loop for climbing a rope might work better with a length of 100 cm or more. As a general rule, longer loops are preferable over shorter ones, as a loop can always be shortened by tying a knot in it.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{tires are}} {{composite}} structures manufactured with viscoelastic {{materials such as}} carbon black filled rubber and <b>nylon</b> <b>cords.</b> When loaded they experience large deflections and moderately large strains. Detailed structural models of tires {{require the use of}} either nonlinear shell or nonlinear three dimensional solid finite elements. Computational predictions of the dynamic response of tires must consider the composite viscoelastic material behavior in a realistic fashion. We describe a modification to a nonlinear anisotropic shell finite element so {{it can be used to}} model viscoelastic stresses during general deformations. The model is developed by introducing internal variables of the type used to model elastic strain energy. The internal variables are strains, curvatures, and transverse shear angles which are in a one-to-one correspondence with the generalized coordinates used to model the elastic strain energy for nonlinear response. A difference-relaxation equation is used to relate changes in the observable strain field to changes in the internal strain field. The internal stress state is introduced into the equilibrium equations by converting it to nodal loads associated with the element's displacement degrees of freedom. In this form the tangent matrix in the Newton-Raphson solution algorithm is not modified from its form for the nonlinear statics problem. Only the gradient vector is modified and the modification is not computationally costly. The existing finite element model for the Space Shuttle nose gear tire is used to provide examples of the algorithm. In the first example, the tire's rim is displaced at a constant rate up to a fixed value. In the second example, the tire's rim is enforced to follow a saw tooth load and unload curve to generate hysteresis loops...|$|R
