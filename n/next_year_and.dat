5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.
