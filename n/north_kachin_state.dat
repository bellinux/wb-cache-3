It is bordered by India’s Nagaland, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh States to the <b>north,</b> <b>Kachin</b> <b>State,</b> Shan State, and Mandalay Region to the east, Mandalay Region and Magway Region to the south, with the Ayeyarwady River forming a greater part of its eastern and also southern boundary, and Chin State and India to the west. The region has an area of 93,527 km². In 1996, it had a population of over 5,300,000 while its population in 2012 was 6,600,000.

40|$|Rawang [ [...] . ] is a Tibeto-Burman {{language}} spoken {{by people who}} live in the far <b>north</b> of <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> in Myanmar (Burma), particularly along the Mae Hka ('Nmai Hka) and Maeli Hka (Mali Hka) river valleys (see map on back page); population unknown, although Ethnologue gives 100, 000. In the past they had been called ‘Nung’, or (mistakenly) ‘Hkanung’, and are considered to be a sub-group of the Kachin by the Myanmar government. Until government policies put a stop to the clearing of new land in 1994, the Rawang speakers still practiced slash and burn farming on the mountainsides (they still do a bit, but only on already claimed land), in conjunction with planting paddy rice near the river. They are closely related to people on the other side of the Chinese border in Yunnan classified as either Dulong or Nu(ng) (see LaPolla 2001, 2003 on the Dulong language). In this paper, I will be discussing the word-class-changing constructions found in Rawang, using data of the Mvtwang (Mvt River) dialect of Rawang, which is considered the most central of those dialects in Myanmar and so has become something of a standard for writing and inter-group communication...|$|R

40|$|Myanmar {{is one of}} {{the most}} recent democratizing {{countries}} in the world today. Although it represents a success story in many ways, the democratic system is still largely flawed, and the conflict level in ethnic regions, such as <b>Kachin</b> <b>State,</b> is higher than ever. This study carefully assesses the processes involved in the democratic transition in Myanmar since the introduction of democratic reforms in 2011, and the simultaneous developments of the conflict in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State.</b> Using Myanmar and <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> as a crucial case, it puts to the test two main theories in the school of democracy and democratization; democratic sequencing and gradualism/transformative democracy. The following questions are addressed: (1) what characterizes the democratic opening in Myanmar, and how can it be explained in light of major positions in democratization studies?; and (2) what, if any, are the links between the mode of democratization and the resumption of warfare in Burma/Myanmar and in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State...</b>|$|R
