The data regarding the three studied products, sawnwood of <b>non-coniferous,</b> veneer sheets and plywood, were joined through the method of Fisher so that an econometric evaluation of the market of the three products could be carried out. Supply and demand models of the Brazilian exports were specified. The results were satisfactory and they match with the literature.

40|$|Illegal timber {{harvesting}} is unsustainable and takes place {{around the world}} and in virtually every country that engages in forest harvesting. However, while the extent of these activities may be quite limited or negligible in some countries, in others they can lead to significant forest depletion, and subsequent biological and economic losses. China’s wood products industry has become reliant on imports of logs to fuel its growth.

40|$|Litter fungal {{communities}} and their ligninolytic enzyme activities (laccase, Mn-peroxidase, and lignin-peroxidase) {{play a vital}} role in forest biogeochemical cycles by breaking down plant cell wall polymers, including recalcitrant lignin. However, litter fungal {{communities and}} ligninolytic enzyme activities have rarely been studied in Neotropical, <b>non-coniferous</b> forests. Here, we found no significant differences in litter ligninolytic enzyme activities from well preserved, moderately disturbed, and heavily disturbed Quercus deserticola Trel. forests in central Mexico. However, we did find seasonal effects on enzyme activities: during the dry season, we observed lower laccase, and increased Mn-peroxidase and lignin-peroxidase activities, and in the rainy season, Mn-peroxidase and lignin-peroxidase activities were lower, while laccase activity peaked. Fungal diversity (Shannon-Weaver and Simpson indices) based on ITS-rDNA analyses decreased with increased disturbance, and principal component analysis showed that litter fungal communities are structured differently between forest types. White-rot Polyporales and Auriculariales only occurred in the well preserved forest, and a high number of Ascomycota were shared between forests. While the degree of forest disturbance significantly affected the litter fungal community structure, the ligninolytic enzyme activities remained unaffected, suggesting functional redundancy and a possible role of generalist Ascomycota taxa in litter delignification. Forest conservation and restoration strategies must account for leaf litter and its associated fungal community...|$|E

40|$|Most {{birds have}} {{specific}} habitat requirements for breeding. The vegetation structure surrounding nest sites {{is an important}} component of habitat quality, and can have large effects on avian breeding performance. We studied 13 years of Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus population data to determine whether characteristics of vegetation structure predict site occupancy, laying date and number of eggs laid. Measurements of vegetation structure included the density of English Oak Quercus robur, European Beech Fagus sylvatica, and other deciduous, coniferous and <b>non-coniferous</b> evergreen trees, within a 20 -m radius of nest-boxes used for breeding. Trees were further sub-divided into specific classes of trunk circumferences to determine the densities for different maturity levels. Based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reduced the total number of 17 measured vegetation variables to 7 main categories, which we used for further analyses. We found that the occupancy rate of sites and the number of eggs laid correlated positively with the proportion of deciduous trees and negatively with the density of coniferous trees. Laying of the first egg was advanced with a greater proportion of deciduous trees. Among deciduous trees, the English Oak appeared to be most important, as a higher density of more mature English Oak trees was associated with more frequent nest-box occupancy, a larger number of eggs laid, and an earlier laying start. Furthermore, laying started earlier and more eggs were laid in nest boxes with higher occupancy rates. Together, these findings highlight the role of deciduous trees, particularly more mature English Oak, as important predictors of high-quality preferred habitat. These results aid in defining habitat quality and will facilitate future studies on the importance of environmental quality for breeding performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Improving {{vegetation}} {{management decisions}} in Pacific Northwest forests requires {{a better understanding}} of the interactions between planted conifers and associated vegetation. A practical index of interspecific competition, and quantitative models predicting conifer performance from such an index are particularly needed. To meet this need, neighborhood models of interspecific competition were developed for individual Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuqa menziesii Mirb. Franco) trees in the central Oregon Coast Range using a two-phase study. In the first phase, a retrospective analysis of two site-preparation experiments was used to develop preliminary models describing the relation between surrounding <b>non-coniferous</b> woody vegetation and the size of 4 - to 9 -year-old saplings. The importance of interspecific competition relative to other factors in the reforestation environment was examined. The second phase tested and refined these models by examining the growth of planted seedlings under a gradient of woody and herbaceous vegetation for 3 years. A systematic approach to evaluating the influence of the 1) abundance, 2) height, 3) distance, 4) azimuth, and 5) spatial arrangement of woody neighbors was used in both phases. The height and stem diameter growth of planted Douglas-fir were negatively correlated with all neighborhood measures of interspecific competition. Visual estimates of cover for woody species provided the best measure of neighbor abundance among 7 measures tested. Accounting for the height of the cover relative to the tree improved the models. Douglas-fir height growth was influenced primarily by woody neighbors that overtopped the tree, while stem diameter growth was influenced by all neighbors. Woody vegetation was more competitive than herbaceous vegetation. Results suggested that competitive influences on Douglas-fir height growth are one-sided or asymmetric, and more two-sided or symmetric on stem diameter growth. Light and soil water availability in the seedling environment were negatively correlated with neighbor abundance, and consistent with the best measures of interspecific competition predicting Douglas-fir growth. Seedling survival was not influenced by competition from woody or herbaceous vegetation...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} was analysed {{of factor}} {{demand in the}} Finnish {{pulp and paper industry}} to changes in relative factor prices and technical change. Factor demand equations were derived using neoclassical production theory, and factor demand was then analysed using annual time series data for 1960 - 86. The relations of factor demands and their prices were examined in terms of own price, cross price and substitution elasticities. It was assumed that the 'representative firm' in the pulp and paper industry minimizes its costs of production at a given output level. In addition, a number of other assumptions were made which enabled production technology to be represented by a cost function, in which the inputs are capital, labour, energy and raw materials. Ten data categories were used for pulp industry estimates, including roundwood input in million msuperscript 3 and roundwood stumpage price index, a weighted average (by cost shares) of prices for pine, spruce and <b>non-coniferous</b> pulpwood, and wood chips/particles; nine categories were used for paper industry estimates. From the cost function, the factor demand equations, i. e. the cost share equations, were derived by applying Shephard's lemma. The study differs from previous factor demand studies by applying the error correction model based on the Granger Representation Theorem and the results of the cointegration literature to model the dynamics of the factor demand. This approach provides a statistically consistent method for estimating the long-run static factor demand equations and the corresponding short-run equations. The results indicate that the error correction approach can be applied to estimations of the factor demands for the pulp and paper industry. In both industry sectors, the adjustment to short run disequilibrium (price shocks) appears to be fairly rapid. The factor demands of the pulp and paper industries clearly react to changes in factor prices and there are significant substitution possibilities between the different inputs. The absolute values of the elasticities are, on average, larger than have been obtained in previous studies...|$|E
40|$|How diverse are extreme sites? How diverse can the species, {{and their}} adaptations and life history stratgies be on extreme sites? How {{specialized}} do species need to be, which ecological amplitude can / must the species possess on extreme sites? The term,extreme site' is frequently used in current publications, but its delimitation and definition are not clear. In this paper, the above mentioned question shall be analysed with examples which are focussed on {{the ecology of}} trees. A definition of the term,extreme site' is found basing on the biological stress concept: resulting from cumbering climatic conditions, reduced nutrient availability, biological competition and damage, plants are subjected {{to a variety of}} strains for which the term stress is used. Extreme sites are therefore environments in which one or more factors are over- or underrepresented in a manner that the organisms can live there only if they possess special adaptations. These environments normally are represented by polar deserts, arid deserts, alpine environments or inselbergs which are not colonized by angiosperm trees. Ecosystems with extreme conditions where <b>non-coniferous</b> trees dominate, for example gallery forests in deserts and savannas, or mangrove forests along tropical coasts, normally represent forests with low diversity of species and a low variety of growth patterns. Amazonian floodplain forests show all the characteristics typical for a stressful extreme site: uninterrupted flood duration with high amplitudes, rapid changes of water levels, anoxic conditions in the rhizosphere, high sedimentation in várzea, nutrient scarcity in sediment-poor igapó, high mechanical stress, sometimes even drought contribute to make growth and establishment difficult for most organisms. Despite these strongly restricting environmental conditions, Amazonian floodplain forests are characterized by an extremely high diversity of species and life history stategies, even within phanerophytes. This diversity results {{from the fact that the}} stressors in this extreme site possess only a low level of restriction for tree life, and disturbances may even represent an enhancing factor for resistance and adaptive evolution. The high complexity of the system and the short but regular presence of factors favourable for tree growth allowed the evolution of highly diverse survival strategies. The species living there partly are highly specialized, but most have rather high ecological amplitudes. One may say, the ecological specialization of the trees is low enough to be able to react flexibly to changing environmental conditions and guarantee survival. On the other hand specialization is high enough to allow a high diversity and establish different species along hydric and edaphic gradients...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Selective {{suppression}} of crown and root sprouting of <b>non-coniferous</b> cover are {{the keys to}} effective forest vegetation management. This study 1) develops insight into mechanisms of controlling root suckering and top regrowth of bear clover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), and develops a broad data base for controlling broad groups of vegetation chemically. Finally, it develops a mangement guide for use of this technology to achieve certain management objectives. Four herbicides were evaluated {{for their ability to}} control post-treatment resprouting of bear clover. Sprouting was evaluated above and below ground by creating trenches to expose the rhizome network. Soil moistures were also studied to determine if their were differences due to varying levels of efficacy. They were marginally responsive in the top 60 cm of soil. Plant moisture stress measurements were obtained on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and were found considerably more responsive than surface soil water contents. Several application parameters including volume, dose, surfactant, dropsize and product were studied to determine their influence on herbicide efficacy and efficiency on several Pacific Coast species of shrubs and grass. Sites included the Oregon Coast Range, {{the east side of the}} Oregon Cascade Range and the west side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Growth regulator products were not suitable for long-term control. High levels of sprouting were observed above and below ground. Glyphosate led to control of above-ground sprouting as well as the rhizome system of bear clover. Sprouting was found to increase with increasing distance from healthy vegetation. Glyphosate was much less effective on other evergreen species. Herbicide treatments in April were more selective between evergreen shrubs and ponderosa pine than those in June. Surfactant increased pine damage while decreasing selectivity. Drop size was related to pine damage in general but degree of effect varied with geographic location. Dose was found to be the single most important factor contributing to response. Application parameters other than dose generally did not contribute to efficacy except that large drops enhanced growth regulator effects on manzanita on the east side of the Cascades, as indicated by a second order interaction between dose, surfactant and nozzle. The addition of surfactant to growth regulator products in April and to glyphosate in June also increased absolute efficacy on Sierran brush species. Soil residual products did not respond in important ways to application technology. Salmonberry also did not respond to dropsize or surfactant. The information obtained was incorporated into a management guide for efficient herbicide use...|$|E
40|$|Forests play three central {{roles in}} the carbon cycle. Forests act as sinks and sources of carbon. Second, {{harvested}} wood products (HWP) from forests store carbon over their life cycle. Third, wood products conserve fossil fuels through energy substitution and by their lower fossil-fuel usage during their manufacture. International governmental bodies have recognized these {{roles in the}}ir discussions. The current United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) methodology used to prepare national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories provides the suggested default assumption that all forest biomass harvested be recorded as an immediate source. Additionally, the convention also recognizes that the wood product sink can be included {{if it can be}} documented that existing stocks are increasing. Our study focuses on the second role [...] HWP and their function in forest carbon accounting. Past studies estimated carbon additions and emissions under alternate accounting approaches and analyzed their impacts using case studies. We calculated the emissions associated with three alternative approaches for 30 regions comprising the global forest sector and reported results for the globe and regions. We briefly investigated alternative methods to calculate the additions and emissions under alternate approaches by examining the sensitivity of alternative assumptions on landfill pools. We also investigated economic implications associated with the alternative approaches by imposing costs on the global forest products industry for national emissions of the forest carbon account. Three approaches to calculate stock changes and estimated emissions associated with HWP proposed by IPCC are the stock change approach, the production approach and the atmospheric flow approach. The stock change approach estimates the net annual change in carbon stocks in the forest and wood products pool within national boundaries. Briefly stated, stock changes in the forest pool are accounted for in the producing country. Stock changes in HWP pool are accounted for in the consuming country. The production approach also estimates net annual changes in the forest and HWP carbon stocks. Producing nations account for forest stock changes and the changes in carbon from HWP that came from domestic harvests including exported wood products. The atmospheric flow approach estimates carbon flows between the atmosphere and the forest and HWP pools within the national boundary. Producing nations account for forest growth carbon and consuming countries count emissions from wood and wood products. We examined the overall effect of the approaches on national emissions to compare the results to those obtained using the IPCC default. For sake of clarity, we divided the national account into the forest account and the HWP account. All that we were interested in the forest account was that portion of emissions calculated by measuring stock changes affected by the HWP accounting approaches. Within each accounting approach there may be more than one estimation method that can be applied with different levels of complexity, depending on data availability. Two examples are alternative assumptions on the fraction of wood product leaving the in-use pool every year and degrading half lives. We examined the sensitivity of IPCC good practice guidelines default assumptions changing the default parameters associated with half-lives of discarded products. Other sensitivities are possible given the data base created but not pursued for this study. We used an economic model of global forest sector to extend the calculations of carbon emissions under the different approaches to 2016. Economic equilibria to production, consumption, traded volumes and prices were calculated for coniferous and <b>non-coniferous</b> sawn wood and plywood. We maintained industrial roundwood material balances in the production of these products using estimated input/output coefficients such that equilibrium amounts produced, consumed and traded for saw logs were also calculated for the years 2004 to 2016. Projections of other panels and paper and paperboard products and their use of industrial roundwood were required as input by the economic model so as to maintain material balances at the roundwood level. Paper and paperboard projections were made using estimated income elasticities and gross domestic product (GDP) projections differentiated regionally. Scenario assessment was employed to examine the trade and competitiveness implications associated with alternative approaches. We imposed a cost in the country {{in the form of an}} emission tax. The tax level was determined by using the calculated forest sector removals/emissions for the default and three alternative approaches. The impact of the emission tax for each approach was then compared with the IPCC default approach. We chose to limit the analysis of economic impacts to the softwood lumber sector since other wood product sectors accounted for in the model do not use equilibrium methods to determine stock inflows in response to a cost increase. We investigated a carbon price of $ 10 and $ 35 per tonne of CO 2. We summarize our conclusions as follows. • Using available forestry data and IPCC accounting methods that consider carbon in HWP, it is demonstrated that HWP pools are increasing globally. By 2002, global carbon stocks in products in use had accumulated to approximately 4, 508 Tg C, and were increasing at a rate of 1. 2 % per year. Global carbon stocks in landfills were estimated to be 3, 447 Tg C and were increasing at 2. 4 % per year. • Different accounting approaches (i. e. the current IPCC default, stock change, production, and atmospheric flow) led to different national accounts of emissions. Compared to alternative approaches, the IPCC default approach resulted in higher national emissions for all nations, with the possible exception of a few regions where much of the harvest is used for fuel wood. The stock change approach produced lower emissions for large net importers of HWP. The production and atmospheric flow approaches led to lower emissions for large net exporters of HWP. • If the forest products industry became financially responsible for HWP carbon emissions, the selection of an accounting approach could significantly affect the industry. In particular, the current IPCC default approach could result in lower global industry output and higher lumber prices than the three alternatives (i. e. stock change, production, and atmospheric flow). The differences between the three alternative approaches, do not appear to be significant at the global level (differences in wood costs of $ 0. 25 per m 3 or less). In some countries, however, the differences between the three alternatives can be more than $ 10 per m 3 of wood. • The stock change approach can give rise to the elimination of accounted HWP emissions when import levels lead to increasing HWP pools that are greater than domestic harvest emissions. • Calculating the land-filled pool using alternative values of half-lives led to relatively small changes in emission accounts. These changes were relatively constant across accounting approaches. • The economic impact of emission changes depended on the level of these charges • High carbon prices led to persistent change in coniferous sawlog harvest levels and higher prices in softwood lumber markets. We expect similar responses in other forest product markets including pulp and paper. Their raw material costs would increase since the emission tax increases harvesting costs, and lower output by the softwood lumber sector reduces residual supply to pulp mills. • Low carbon prices led to higher price in these markets as consumption levels recovered. • Higher prices under both low and high carbon values could signal product substitution...|$|E
