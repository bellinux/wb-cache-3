50|$|Viewed as an {{information}} processing system, the natural immune system of organisms performs many complex tasks in parallel and distributed computing fashion. These include distinguishing {{between self and}} <b>nonself,</b> neutralization of <b>nonself</b> pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites), learning, memory, associative retrieval, self-regulation, and fault-tolerance. Artificial immune systems are abstractions of the natural immune system, emphasizing these computational aspects.

5000|$|Mark Blum speaks {{both of the}} fictitious discursive {{self and}} the real Self of the Buddha-nature. Commenting both on the non-Self and Emptiness teachings of the Nirvana Sutra, he states: For the Nirvana Sutra, <b>nonself</b> is treated like another {{negative}} expression of truth, emptiness. That is, <b>nonself</b> {{is a very important}} doctrine to be expounded when the listener is attached to his or her notion of selfhood or personality, because it deconstructs that object of attachment, revealing its nature as a fantasy. Emptiness likewise performs the function of deconstructing attachments to notions of identity in things or ideas. But both are merely tools, or upaya (skillful means) and not final truths in and of themselves. Regarding emptiness, we find a strong assertion of the sacred nature of nonemptiness ... and although the discursive, evaluating self is fiction, there does exist a genuine self and that, according to the sutra, is precisely the buddha-nature.|$|E

50|$|Developed {{through an}} earlier primary {{exposure}} that primed specific immunity to the <b>nonself</b> antigen, a transplant recipient can have specific antibody crossreacting with the donor tissue upon the transplant event, a secondary exposure. This is typical after earlier mismatching among A/B/O blood types during blood transfusion. At this secondary exposure, these crossreactive antibody molecules interact with aspects of innate immunity—soluble immune proteins called complement and innate immune cells called phagocytes—which inflames and destroys the transplanted tissue.|$|E

5000|$|Alloimmunity (sometimes called isoimmunity) is {{an immune}} {{response}} to <b>nonself</b> antigens {{from members of}} the same species, which are called alloantigens or isoantigens. Two major types of alloantigens are blood group antigens and histocompatibility antigens. In alloimmunity, the body creates antibodies against the alloantigens, attacking transfused blood, allotransplanted tissue, and even the fetus in some cases. Alloimmune (isoimmune) response results in graft rejection, which is manifested as deterioration or complete loss of graft function. In contrast, autoimmunity is an immune response to the self's own antigens. (The allo- prefix means [...] "other", whereas the auto- prefix means [...] "self".) Alloimmunization (isoimmunization) is the process of becoming alloimmune, that is, developing the relevant antibodies for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|PAMPs {{activate}} innate immune responses, {{protecting the}} host from infection, by identifying some conserved <b>nonself</b> molecules. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), endotoxins {{found on the}} cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria, {{are considered to be}} the prototypical class of PAMPs. LPSs are specifically recognised by TLR4, a recognition receptor of the innate immune system. Other PAMPs include bacterial flagellin (recognized by TLR5), lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan, and nucleic acid variants normally associated with viruses, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), recognized by TLR3 or unmethylated CpG motifs, recognized by TLR9. [...] Although the term [...] "PAMP" [...] is relatively new, the concept that molecules derived from microbes must be detected by receptors from multicellular organisms has been held for many decades, and references to an [...] "endotoxin receptor" [...] are found in much of the older literature.|$|E
5000|$|A {{family history}} of RA {{increases}} the risk around three to five times; as of 2016 {{it was estimated that}} genetics may account for between 40 and 65% of cases of seropositive RA, but only around 20% for seronegative RA. [...] RA is strongly associated with genes of the inherited tissue type major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen HLA-DR4 is the major genetic factor implicated - the relative importance varies across ethnic groups. [...] Genome-wide association studies examining single-nucleotide polymorphisms have found around one hundred genes associated with RA risk, with most of them involving the HLA system (particularly HLA-DRB1) which controls recognition of self versus <b>nonself</b> molecules; other mutations affecting co-stimulatory immune pathways, for example CD28 and CD40), cytokine signaling, lymphocyte receptor activation threshold (e.g., PTPN22), and innate immune activation appear to have less influence than HLA mutations.|$|E
50|$|Since NK cells {{recognize}} target cells {{when they}} express <b>nonself</b> HLA antigens (but not self), autologous (patients' own) NK cell infusions have not shown any antitumor effects. Instead, investigators {{are working on}} using allogeneic cells from peripheral blood, which requires that all T cells be removed before infusion into the patients to remove the risk of graft versus host disease, which can be fatal. This can be achieved using an immunomagnetic column (CliniMACS). In addition, because of {{the limited number of}} NK cells in blood (only 10% of lymphocytes are NK cells), their number needs to be expanded in culture. This can take a few weeks and the yield is donor-dependent. A simpler way to obtain high numbers of pure NK cells is to expand NK-92 cells whose cells continuously grow in culture and can be expanded to clinical grade numbers in bags or bioreactors. Clinical studies have shown it to be well tolerated and some antitumor responses have been seen in patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{different}} {{cells of}} the innate immune system express a myriad of CLRs which shape innate immunity {{by virtue of their}} pattern recognition ability. Even though, most classes of human pathogens are covered by CLRs, CLRs are a major receptor for recognition of funghi: nonetheless, other PAMPs have been identifies in studies as targets of CLRs as well e.g. mannose is the recognition motif for many viruses, fungi and mycobacteria; similarly fucose presents the same for certain bacteria and helminths; and glucans are present on mycobacteria and fungi. In addition, many of acquired <b>nonself</b> surfaces e.g. carcinoembryonic/oncofetal type neoantigens carrying [...] "internal danger source"/"self turned nonself" [...] type pathogen pattern are also identified and destroyed (e.g. by complement fixation or other cytotoxic attacks) or sequestered (phagocytosed or ensheathed) by the immune system by virtue of the CLRs. The name lectin is a bit misleading because the family includes proteins with at least one C-type lectin domain (CTLD) which is a specific type of carbohydrate recognition domain. CTLD is a ligand binding motif found in more than 1000 known proteins (more than 100 in humans) and the ligands are often not sugars. If and when the ligand is sugar they need Ca2+ - hence the name [...] "C-type", but many of them don't even have a known sugar ligand thus despite carrying a lectin type fold structure, some of them are technically not [...] "lectin" [...] in function.|$|E
50|$|The {{control of}} {{antibody}} response by the Mhc raised many question. The {{one on the}} top of immunologists’ agenda was: Why were some individuals carrying a certain H2 haplotype high responders to a given antigen, while others, carrying certain other haplotype were low responders or nonresponders? The phenomenon could be reproduced in vitro by the exposure to the antigen. Lymphocytes isolated from the high responder proliferated to a much higher degree than those isolated from a low responder individual. The assay required, in addition to the thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes, also “macrophages” or antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the same individual. In this set-up the question reduced itself to: Are the T lymphocytes or the APCs responsible for the difference in responsiveness? Many immunologists were inclined to put the blame on the APCs, but the Klein-Nagy group, in a series of elegant experiments, falsified this hypothesis and explained why T lymphocytes bearing different Mhc haplotypes might differ in their response to specific antigens. The receptors of the T lymphocytes recognize an antigen in association with their own Mhc molecules. The different specificities of the Tcrs born by the individual T cells are generated by a special mechanism during the lymphocyte development from precursor cells in the thymus. The generation is entirely random, so that receptors arise against all possible antigens, including those borne by the individual in which the differentiation takes place (the self-molecules). The cells with receptors for self-molecules must be eliminated to prevent an immune reaction against the individual’s own components. The eliminated Tcrs might, however, by chance have had the capability of recognizing certain foreign antigens (<b>nonself)</b> in association with the nonresponder’ ownMhc molecules. The T-cell repertoire thus has “blind spots”, making an individual nonresponsive not only to self but also against certain foreign antigens.|$|E
5000|$|In early development, a sensorimotor-enactive stage, {{relationships}} {{are dominated by}} concerns with need gratification and frustration. This stage, assumed {{to take place in}} the early months of life, results in the formation of boundary constancy, the awareness of a distinction between self and other, between self and <b>nonself.</b> According to Blatt, disruption in the representational boundary between self and other is a predominant feature of schizophrenia [...] and is expressed in cognitive, perceptual, and interpersonal disturbances including thought disorder, affective flattening, and interpersonal withdrawal. A second developmental achievement in this sensorimotor period occurs around 6 to 9 months of age, as the infant begins to establish recognition constancy by becoming emotionally attached to a particular person whom he or she recognizes as his or her most important emotional caregiver. Interpersonal schemas at this phase are based primarily on the predominant perceptual features of the person in question. The third achievement, evocative or object constancy, begins in the second year of life and is coincident with a concrete-perceptual stage, in which thinking is dominated by perceptual features and resemblances. Evocative or object constancy therefore involves the ability to maintain positive affective relationships with significant others during their absence (i.e., when they are not perceptually available) or during moments of negative affect. And as this capacity matures, it comes to involve the ability to maintain these same emotional ties in an environment involving significant emotional relationships with multiple figures. In the third year of life, as self-reflective capacity consolidates, as indexed by the capacity to recognize oneself in the mirror and therefore to regard oneself as an object who can be perceived by others, evocative constancy expands to include constancy of the self—that is, the maintenance of a consistent and coherent self-representation through time, space, and varying emotional states. Severe relational disturbances in evocative constancy, both of others and of self, are associated with borderline personality organization, with prominent dependence in anaclitically oriented individuals and with prominent paranoia and counterdependence in more introjective persons. Less severe disturbance during this concrete-perceptual developmental stage is often reflected in empty, rather than self-critical, depression or in a dependent personality style in anaclitic persons or in moderate to severe obsessive-compulsive disturbance, both symptom-focused and characterological, in more introjective individuals.|$|E
