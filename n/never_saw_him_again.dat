5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Lucy Taylor Johnson {{moved with}} the two Bunche grandchildren to the South Central {{neighborhood}} of Los Angeles, which was then mostly white. Fred Bunche later remarried, and Ralph <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
50|$|James's {{marriage}} {{was a happy}} one, and when Mary James died on January 29, 1882, his will to live seemed to die with her. His work on yet another volume flagged, and he fell {{into a state of}} indolence. He rallied briefly after visits from his sons, called to his side by his daughter, Alice. But he suffered a relapse after Henry Jr. and William left on excursions to Europe. His famous sons <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> alive <b>again.</b> He died on December 18, 1882, in Boston.|$|R

5000|$|In 1955, when Emmett was fourteen, {{his mother}} {{put him on}} the train to spend the summer visiting his cousins in Money, Mississippi. She <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> alive <b>again.</b> Her son was {{abducted}} and brutally murdered on August 28, 1955, after being accused of interacting inappropriately with a white woman. The following month, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam faced trial for Till's kidnapping and murder but were acquitted by the all-white jury after a five-day trial and a 67-minute deliberation. One juror said, [...] "If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long." [...] Only months later, in an interview with Look magazine in 1956, protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam admitted to killing Emmett Till.|$|R
25|$|In January 1836, Maria Isabella {{served as}} a godmother to her {{grandson}} Francisco, Duke of Calabria. In March that same year, the Prince of Capua contracted a morganatic marriage. Maria Isabella pleaded for her favorite son, but her efforts to obtain a pardon for him proved fruitless. Ferdinand II did not forgive his runaway brother: Capua went into permanent exile in England, and Maria Isabella <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eddy Merckx {{dominated}} world {{racing in}} both classics and stage races but couldn't win the Ronde. By 1969 {{he had not}} only frustration to contend with but rising resentment of other riders unhappy that he won so many races. He attacked early and half the field <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> The other half was reduced with each successive attack until he got clear alone. The chase was furious but ineffective and Merckx won by more than {{five and a half}} minutes over Felice Gimondi and more than eight minutes on the rest. The Ronde remained an unhappy race for him; it was another six years before he won again.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. He {{told them he}} was working on getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job and that he was researching cave diving with an eye toward getting that certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14â€“15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. They <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

6000|$|I dined {{last night}} with Mr. Trent, by his special desire. The dinner [...] was in his own rooms. Dinner sent in from the hotel. He would not [...] have any waiters at all, but made them send in the dinner all at [...] once, and we helped ourselves. As we were quite alone, we could talk [...] freely, and we got over {{a lot of ground}} while we were dining. He [...] began to tell me about Uncle Roger. I was glad of that, for, of [...] course, I wanted to know all I could of him, and the fact was I had [...] seen very little of him. Of course, when I was a small kid he was [...] often in our house, for he was very fond of mother, and she of him. [...] But I fancy that a small boy was rather a {{nuisance}} to him. And then [...] I was at school, and he was away in the East. And then poor mother [...] died while he was living in the Blue Mountains, and I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> [...] <b>again.</b> When I wrote to him about Aunt Janet he answered me very [...] kindly but he was so very just in the matter that I got afraid of [...] him. And after that I ran away, and have been roaming ever since; so [...] there was never a chance of our meeting. But that letter of his has [...] opened my eyes. To think of him following me that way all over the [...] world, waiting to hold out a helping hand if I should want it, I only [...] wish I had known, or even suspected, the sort of man he was, and how [...] he cared for me, and I would sometimes have come back to see him, if [...] I had to come half round the world. Well, all I can do now is to [...] carry out his wishes; that will be my expiation for my neglect. He [...] knew what he wanted exactly, and I suppose I shall come in time to [...] know it all and understand it, too.|$|R

500|$|According to Lori Haskell, {{the second}} man told the ticket agent: [...] "We need to get this man on the plane. He doesn't have a passport." [...] The ticket agent said nobody was allowed to board without a passport. The well-dressed man replied: [...] "We do this all the time; he's from Sudan." [...] Lori Haskell said {{the two men were}} {{directed}} down a corridor, to talk to a manager.

500|$|The San'a Institute {{obtained}} an {{exit visa}} {{for him at}} his request, and arranged for a car that {{took him to the}} airport on September 21, 2009 (the day his student visa expired), but the school's director said, [...] "After that, we <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> and apparently he did not leave Yemen". In October, Abdulmutallab told his father via text message saying {{that he did not want}} to attend business school in Dubai, and wanted instead to study Islamic law and Arabic in Yemen. When his father refused to pay for it, Abdulmutallab said he was [...] "already getting everything for free". He text-messaged his father, saying [...] "I've found a new religion, the real Islam", [...] "You should just forget about me, I'm never coming back", and [...] "Forgive me for any wrongdoing, I am no longer your child". The family was last in contact with their son in October 2009.|$|E
500|$|The most {{detailed}} account of Pitman's final fate in the war came from Robert G. Carter. In November 1862, Pitman was captured near Warrenton Junction on the march toward Fredericksburg, Virginia, during the weeks prior to the Battle of Fredericksburg. He had fallen behind the group because his feet had blistered and swollen due to the tightness of [...] "a pair of thin, high-heeled and narrow soled boots" [...] he had purchased. One of his comrades temporarily stayed behind to care for him but later decided {{to move on with}} the rest of the camp for fear of disciplinary consequences of falling out without authority. He was urged to move on, but without much success. Pitman's last words to his comrade were, [...] "I will be in camp by night, good by." [...] His fellow soldiers <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> and considered him missing. Shortly after he was left, a band of Confederate guerrillas under Colonel John S. Mosby captured the weary and defenseless soldier without a struggle. The inscription on his tombstone differs slightly from Carter's account, stating he was captured by J. E. B. Stuart's cavalry instead.|$|E

500|$|Through this {{marriage}} Sneyd became step-mother to Edgeworth's four surviving children {{by his first}} wife, Anna Maria, ranging from seven months to nine years in age; Richard, Maria, who became a writer in her own right, Emmeline and Anna Maria. On encountering her new family she observed that Maria, then aged five, was exhibiting behavioural problems, and expressed her views that speedy and consistent punishment were the keys to ensuring good behaviour in children, a view she proceeded to practice. However she believed that such discipline needed to be imposed [...] "before the age of 5 or 6", and was therefore rather late {{in the case of}} the older children, however she imposed a strict discipline. Following a period of ill health on Sneyd's part, Maria Edgeworth was sent away to boarding school in Derby (1775â€“1781), and later London upon the death of Honora Sneyd (1781â€“1782). Similarly, her older brother Richard was sent to Charterhouse (1776â€“1778) and then went to sea, and she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Later Richard Edgeworth would comment on how difficult the first two years were for Sneyd in her new role as stepmother to undisciplined children, a role her relatives had advised her against.|$|E
500|$|Tulloch's {{approach}} has undoubtedly resulted in outcomes {{that would not}} have been possible otherwise. In 1991, he presented Edith Brown Haisman, a 96-year-old survivor of the disaster, with her father's pocket watch which had been retrieved from the sea bed. She had last seen it on 15 April 1912 when he waved goodbye to his wife and daughter as they left aboard lifeboat 14. They <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> and he presumably went down with the ship. The watch was loaned to Haisman [...] "for life"; when she died four years later it was reclaimed by RMS Titanic Inc. On another occasion, a steamer trunk spotted in the debris field was found to contain three musical instruments, a deck of playing cards, a diary belonging to one Howard Irwin, and a bundle of letters from his girlfriend Pearl Shuttle. It was first thought that Irwin, a musician and professional gambler, had boarded the ship under a false identity. There was no record of him being among the passengers, even though a ticket had been purchased for him. It turned out that he had stayed ashore but his trunk had been brought aboard the ship by his friend Henry Sutehall, who was among the victims of the disaster. The fragile contents of the trunk were preserved due to the interior being starved of oxygen, which prevented bacteria from consuming the paper. Very few other shipwrecks have yielded readable paper.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Paris, they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming {{at the beach}} and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: [...] "They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination." [...] In Fitzgerald's, [...] "A Life in Letters," [...] Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler. He writes of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda's fidelity. The book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda's love, of courtship, break, restoration with financial success, and the Jozan betrayal: [...] "I feel old too, this summer... the whole burden of this novelâ€”the loss of those illusions that give such color {{to the world that}} you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory." [...] The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis; the typescript was sent to Scribners at the end of October. Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks, [...] "That September 1924, I knew something had happened that could never be repaired." ...|$|E

Baret gave the child up to the Paris Foundlings Hospital. He was quickly placed with a foster mother but died {{in the summer of}} 1765.

2500|$|In 1935, Bula Myrtle Williams invited 16-year-old Buddy McClure to {{live with}} her family. McClure had {{recently}} lost his mother and Bula was still grieving over the death of her son. Esther recounted in her autobiography that one night, {{when the rest of the}} family was visiting relatives in Alhambra, McClure raped her. She was terrified to tell anyone about the incident and waited two years before finally revealing the truth to her parents. Williams' mother seemed unsure about her story, claiming McClure was [...] "sensitive" [...] and was sympathetic towards him when he admitted his guilt.

2500|$|In 1914, Schiele {{glimpsed the}} sisters Edith and AdÃ©le Harms, {{who lived with}} their parents {{across the street from}} his studio in the Viennese {{district}} of Hietzing, 101 Hietzinger HauptstraÃŸe. They were a middle-class family and Protestant by faith; their father was a master locksmith. In 1915, Schiele chose to marry the more socially acceptable Edith, but had apparently expected to maintain a relationship with Wally. However, when he explained the situation to Wally, she left him immediately and <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> This abandonment led him to paint Death and the Maiden, where Wally's portrait is based on a previous pairing, but Schiele's is newly struck. (In February 1915, Schiele wrote a note to his friend Arthur Roessler stating: [...] "I intend to get married, advantageously. Not to Wally.") Despite some opposition from the Harms family, Schiele and Edith were married on 17 June 1915, the anniversary of the wedding of Schiele's parents.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{following}} morning August 5, we broke camp and started north, up {{the divide between}} the Republican and the Frenchman Rivers. Soon after leaving camp, Sky Chief rode {{up to me and}} extending his hand said, 'Shake, brother.' He recalled our little unpleasantness the night previous and said he did not believe there was cause for alarm, and was so impressed with the belief that he had not taken the precaution to throw out scouts in the direction the Sioux were reported to be. A few minutes later a buffalo scout signaled that buffaloes had been sighted in the distance, and Sky Chief rode off to engage in the hunt. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> He had killed a buffalo and was skinning it when the advance guard of the Sioux shot and wounded him. The Chief attempted to reach his horse, but before he was able to mount, several of the enemy surrounded him. He died fighting.

2500|$|Meanwhile, in {{the lead}} group, Sylvain Calzati had stormed {{away from the other}} five escapees with about [...] to go, only to be chased after {{somewhat}} later by Patrice Halgand and Kjell CarlstrÃ¶m. The other three riders mainly {{looked at each other and}} did not believe they could stay out of the peloton's grip. However, the peloton would catch up with those three non-believers, but the other three were not to be caught before the finish line. Sylvain Calzati proved to be too strong for the other two as they coÃ¶perated to get back to him but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> before Lorient, instead the gap only became bigger. In the end Sylvain Calzati scored his most beautiful professional victory of his career as he came over the finish line more than two minutes ahead of CarlstrÃ¶m and Halgand, who both just ended a few seconds before the peloton. In the peloton, Robbie McEwen again won the sprint, enlarging his lead in the standings for the green jersey over the other sprinters.|$|E
