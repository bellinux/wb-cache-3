5|$|Although {{formerly}} {{common in}} its range, the species {{was on the}} brink of extinction in Victoria by 1917. However, <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> built up again since the 1930–40s as it reestablished in its former territory. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as near threatened.|$|E
5|$|Over {{its first}} two years of {{operations}} income was £468 thousand (23%) lower than expected. Visitor numbers were 10 thousand lower than expected at 240 thousand. Visitor <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> continued to fall in subsequent years raising concerns over ongoing funding and long term viability.|$|E
5|$|The Amami rabbit {{also faces}} huge threats from the {{invasive}} predators, being {{a major cause}} for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{numbering}} system for steam locomotives comprised a class number and a serial number. The class <b>number</b> <b>had</b> two digits, the serial <b>number</b> <b>had</b> {{three to four}} digits.|$|R
25|$|Thus the first-order {{theory of}} real numbers and sets of real <b>numbers</b> <b>has</b> many models, {{some of which}} are countable. The second-order theory of the real <b>numbers</b> <b>has</b> only one model, however.|$|R
5000|$|The option also {{exists to}} replace the generic message with a {{customized}} message, as applicable, such as in cases where a subscriber's telephone <b>number</b> <b>has</b> changed, usually due to relocation. This service is known in America as Number Referral Service, and in Britain as Ceased Number Intercept. An example of a Number Referral Service intercept message is: The <b>number</b> you <b>have</b> reached, <b>number,</b> <b>has</b> been changed. The new number is number. Please make a note of it. <b>number</b> <b>has</b> been changed. The new number is number.|$|R
5|$|The American {{white pelican}} has {{increased}} in numbers, with its population estimated at over 157,000 birds in 2005, becoming more numerous east of the continental divide while declining in the west. However {{it is unclear whether}} its <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been affected by exposure to pesticides as it has also lost habitat through wetland drainage and competition with recreational use of lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM {{represented}} negative numbers using two's complement, as most computers still do. In that representation, {{the value}} of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus the range of numbers that could be held in each 32-bit word was −231 to +231−1 (decimal: −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647).|$|E
5|$|The {{worldwide}} {{population size}} and trends in population <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> not been determined, {{but is it}} believed that the Andean cock-of-the-rock is not threatened. The species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species despite habitat destruction. It is patchily distributed, but its range {{is large enough to}} sustain it at a Least Concern status.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of liberalized registration policies for the [...] domain, only 7000 names had been registered between 1992 and 2004. As of March 2010, the <b>number</b> <b>had</b> increased to over 610,000 domain names, with 60% of registrations coming from India, and the rest from overseas. [...] By October 2011, the <b>number</b> <b>had</b> surpassed 1 million domain names. As of March 2016 the <b>number</b> <b>has</b> more than doubled to over 2 million domain names.|$|R
5000|$|An irrational <b>number</b> <b>has</b> an {{infinite}} non-repeating representation in all integer bases.

50|$|Fixed-point <b>numbers</b> <b>had</b> a one-bit {{sign and}} a 35-bit value, with {{negative}} values represented in ones' complement format. Floating-point <b>numbers</b> <b>had</b> a one-bit sign, an eight-bit characteristic, and a 27-bit mantissa. Instructions had a six-bit operation code and two 15-bit operand addresses.|$|R
5|$|Today, {{there is}} a large number of organisations campaigning in favor of {{establishing}} a Third Spanish Republic; Data from 2006 suggest that only 25 per cent of Spaniards are in favor of establishing a republic; however, the <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> increased since Juan Carlos I abdicated.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> {{declined}} steeply {{in western}} Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} several {{historic}} religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup {{of the city is}} relatively homogenous. The Serbian Orthodox community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 Protestants. There once was a significant Jewish community in Belgrade, but following the World War II Nazi occupation of the city, and subsequent Jewish emigration, their <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> fallen from over 10,000 to just 295.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem of}} finding numbers {{that belong to}} three {{polygonal}} sets is more difficult. A computer search for pentagonal square triangular <b>numbers</b> <b>has</b> yielded only the trivial value of 1, though a proof {{that there are no}} other such <b>numbers</b> <b>has</b> yet to appear in print.|$|R
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E
5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. <b>Numbers</b> <b>have</b> increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E

5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Female {{students}} were {{admitted to the}} college {{for the first time}} in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain on college numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was unable to provide accommodation for all of its fresher students {{for the first time in}} its history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E
50|$|The {{generation}} of pseudo-random <b>numbers</b> <b>having</b> an approximately normal distribution is sometimes accomplished by computing {{the sum of}} a number of pseudo-random <b>numbers</b> <b>having</b> a uniform distribution; usually for the sake of simplicity of programming. Rescaling the Irwin-Hall distribution provides the exact distribution of the random variates being generated.|$|R
