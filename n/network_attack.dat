National leaders {{took steps to}} protect defense networks in 1998, creating a Joint Task Force for Computer Network Defense and assigning it to USSPACECOM. In April 2001, the task force's mission expanded to include computer <b>network</b> <b>attack,</b> and it was renamed Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations. The task force became part of USSTRATCOM in October 2002; it was renamed Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) in 2004. The <b>network</b> <b>attack</b> mission transferred in 2003 to a new organization, which evolved into the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW) in January 2005.|$|E

This technology which neutralized Syrian radars may be similar to the Suter airborne <b>network</b> <b>attack</b> system. This would make it possible to feed enemy radar emitters with false targets, and even directly manipulate enemy sensors. In May 2008, a report in IEEE Spectrum cited European sources claiming that the Syrian air defense network had been deactivated by a secret built-in kill switch activated by the Israelis.|$|E

The Stuxnet worm is a recent example {{of this kind of}} attack and shows the actuality of the increasing problem. This paper covers the questions of what the concepts of use of force and armed attack are generally considered to comprise, in international law, and the arguments in favour of or against applicability of the former concepts to computer <b>network</b> <b>attacks.</b> Computer <b>network</b> <b>attacks</b> constitute a new type of warfare, which poses new questions for the international community to handle. The main focus of this paper is when computer <b>network</b> <b>attacks</b> are used by one state to attack another state and how this may be handled in international law on resort to force, jus ad bellum. The discussion whether international law can cover computer <b>network</b> <b>attacks</b> between states is becoming more important and urgent as technology concerning computer <b>network</b> <b>attacks</b> is developing at high speed...|$|R

2500|$|An {{application}} layer DDoS attack (sometimes {{referred to as}} layer 7 DDoS attack) {{is a form of}} DDoS attack where attackers target the {{application layer}} of the OSI model. The attack over-exercises specific functions or features of a website with the intention to disable those functions or features. This application-layer attack is different from an entire <b>network</b> <b>attack,</b> and is often used against financial institutions to distract IT and security personnel from security breaches. As of 2013, application layer DDoS attacks represent 20% of all DDoS attacks. According to research by the company Akamai, there have been [...] "51 percent more application layer attacks" [...] from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014 and [...] "16 percent more" [...] from Q3 2014 over Q4 2014.|$|E

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) {{in terms of their}} functionality and possible attacks on them are described next. This work also describes principles of selected attacks against IDS. Further, obfuscation methods which can be used to overcome NBA are suggested. The tool for automatic exploitation, attack obfuscation and collection of this network communication was designed and implemented.

40|$|Abstract: Over the years, <b>network</b> <b>attacks</b> {{have evolved}} into {{more complex and}} {{sophisticated}} methods for network intrusion. As network domains become bigger in terms of size, the number of external users increases and thus the systems become more open and subject to security threats. Thus, the intrusion detection system was introduced to automatically detect <b>network</b> <b>attacks.</b> Commercial solutions however are generally centralized and suffer from scalability problems when applied in large networks. For this reason, in this paper, the distributed model was adopted to eliminate the scalability issues. Mobile agent combines with statistical methods based on the Wiener filter to collect and analyze the network data in order to detect anomalous behaviour in the network traffic. The algorithm was tested against four <b>network</b> <b>attacks</b> in both light and heavy traffic scenarios. Key words: Mobile agent • distributed network management • wiener filter • intrusion detection • MIB variable...|$|R
