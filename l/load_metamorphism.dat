40|$|Abstract. The process {{leading to}} the {{occurrence}} {{of the ocean and}} to its evolution toward an ophiolitic suture can be separated into four stages. The first is the pre-ocean continental rifting stage, during which within-plate dyke swarm complexes are engendered. The rifting process is going into the spreading process of the second stage, which leads to the opening of the ocean, during the evolution of which an ocean crust is generated. This crust is formed of ocean floor N-Type and E-Type MORB rocks and of scarce oceanic sedimentary deposits. During the third stage, the closing of the ocean takes place, which is determined by processes of subduction, which lead to the consumption of the ocean crust and the occurrence of the island arcs, engendering calc-alkaline igneous rocks. The volcanic arcs usually are associated with important masses of sedimentary deposits. A regional and a <b>load</b> <b>metamorphism</b> often occur during this stage, too. This stage ends with the manifestation of the thrust phenomena. During the fourth, post-collision, stage a disjunctive tectonics is active. There occur the epicontinental sedimentary basins and the manifestation of a collateral continental magmatic activity...|$|E
40|$|The age and {{composition}} of the 14 × 106 km 2 of Antarctica's surface obscured by ice is unknown except for some dates on detrital minerals. In remedy, we bring together proxies of Antarctic bedrock {{in the form of}} (1) detrital zircons analysed for U-Pb age, TDMC, εHf, and rock type, including five new analyses of Neogene turbidites, (2) erratics that reflect age, composition, and metamorphism, and (3) recycled microfossils that reflect age, facies, and metamorphism. Each sample is located in its ice-drainage basin for backtracking to the potential provenance. Gaps in age between sample and upslope exposure are specifically attributable to the provenance. This work indicates that the central Antarctic provenance about a core of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM) and Vostok Subglacial Highlands (VSH) contains a basement that includes igneous (mafic granitoids) and metamorphic rocks with peak U-Pb ages of 0. 5 - 0. 7, 0. 9 - 1. 3, 1. 4 - 1. 7, 1. 9 - 2. 1, 2. 2 - 2. 3, 2. 6 - 2. 8, and 3. 15 - 3. 35 Ga, TDMC 1. 3 - 3. 6 Ga, and εHf + 12 to - 40. Other modelled cratons with similar ages are set in a matrix of foldbelts of 0. 5 - 0. 7 Ga age. The basement in the core is surmounted by Permian red beds, at the periphery by Permian and Triassic sedimentary rocks unaffected by igneous heating or <b>load</b> <b>metamorphism,</b> and west of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) in the Wilkes Basin arguably by Late Cretaceous through Pliocene marine sediments. Erratics of undated red sandstone along the coast of Wilkes Land and George V Land indicate a red-bed provenance in the interior. The Prince Charles Mountains (PCM) provide an exposed example of a crust of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks and Permian and Triassic sedimentary rocks. 29 page(s...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Geology) Abstract: The Main Karoo Basin of South Africa, {{especially}} the Whitehill Formation of the Ecca Group is estimated as possessing shale gas reserve potential of between 368 bcm to 13734 bcm {{on a wide}} land area of over 183 000 km 2, thus placing South Africa as the 8 th largest potential shale gas resource in the world. However, this reserve could be overestimated due to the poorly studied thermal impact of voluminous magmatic intrusions into the basin strata. Jurassic-aged Karoo Large Igneous Province (KLIP) emplaced a myriad network of dykes and sills that takes up 0. 55 x 106 km 2 of the basin and up to 30 % of the total thickness. This could bring additional heat to the thermal evolution of the basin likely to create thermal over-maturation and/or disrupt the preservation of generated hydrocarbon of the Main Karoo Basin source rocks. Here organic-rich mudstones of the Ecca Group with mineralogical, mineral chemistry, organic geochemistry and Ar – Ar age dating proxies were analysed. Illite crystallinity and chlorite chemistry studies show thermal evolution controlled by diagenesis and regional metamorphism {{as well as local}} contact metamorphic overprints in the vicinity of dolerite sills. 13 Corg and TOC vary in proximity to the dolerite intrusions. Rock-Eval pyrolysis data show that the organic matters are mainly Type III gas-prone kerogens of mature to post mature thermal maturity. The source rocks are mainly over-mature, having poor generation potential which could reflect the thermal overcooking/exhaustion, probably accompanied by gas migration, driven by the thermal impact of dolerite intrusions. The clay mineral ages also show full and partial recrystallized ages in the metamorphic aureoles of dolerite sills. Overall, the finding of this research reveals that the shale gas potential of the basin could be much lesser than originally estimated. <b>Load</b> <b>metamorphism</b> and dolerite intrusions influenced organic matter transformation in the basin. The impact on the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon generation of the basin’s organic matter is greater around multiple to closely spaced thermal aureoles of intrusions. These findings correlate with results from other boreholes studied in the Main Karoo Basin and provide {{a better understanding of the}} thermal evolution of the Ecca Group organic rich mudstones and its shale gas potential...|$|E
40|$|The LeMay Group of Alexander Island, Antarctica, is a Mesozoic accretionary prism that {{contains}} slivers of ocean floor and ocean island material, accreted under {{a range of}} conditions and depths. It provides {{a rare opportunity to}} compare the deformation mechanism paths between oceanic and trench-fill lithologies during subduction and accretion by offscraping or underplating. Ocean floor slivers consist of a bedded basalt–volcaniclastite–chert rock association, overlain by trench-fill sedimentary rocks. The oceanic lithologies initially deformed by cataclasis, combined with particulate flow in the volcaniclastic rocks. At shallow levels the clastic trench-fill sedimentary rocks deformed by independent particulate flow, which changed to cataclastic flow at depth. At those depths crystal plasticity affected the cherts and jaspers. At the deepest levels achieved in the subduction zone, crystal plasticity was the dominant deformation mechanism in the clastic sedimentary rocks, whilst cataclasis continued in the lavas. Deformation was synchronous with metamorphism up to transitional greenschist–blueschist facies. All lithologies were affected by pressure solution after accretion, with the formation of a bedding-parallel or sub-parallel cleavage. The deformation mechanism paths indicate that (1) there is a crystal plastic deformation field at deep levels in the subduction zone, and (2) that the base of the pressure solution field is concordant with the decollement. A frontally accreted ocean island is exposed in the Lully Foothills, and consists of a basalt–volcaniclastite–tuff rock association. Deformation is represented only by a patchily distributed bedding-sub-parallel pressure solution cleavage in the tuffs and volcaniclastites, and is probably related to <b>loading.</b> <b>Metamorphism</b> does not exceed prehnite–pumpellyite facies. The accreted ocean island indicates that such features can be incorporated into accretionary prisms at shallow levels without significant segmentation...|$|R
40|$|A {{technical}} bending {{theory of}} beams accounting for nonlinearity due to damage and bimodularity of brittle rocks was proposed in Part I. In order {{to check the}} validity of the above theory, a series of three-point bending (3 PB) tests has been carried out using Dionysos marble beams that have been sampled from the same extracted block. Although the modeling of the 3 PB test is considerably more complicated than that of the four-point bending test, the experimental procedure in the former test is simpler than in the later test and most importantly, the location of the fracture is better controlled in the 3 PB test, Herein, it is demonstrated that the test results have very good repeatability and they support the above technical theory. The bending tests also indicate that Dionysos marble is characterized by different elastic modulus in compression (E-c) and in tension (E-t) at small loads, such that the relation m = E-c/E-t congruent to 0. 8 holds true. This relationship of elastic moduli for this type of marble is also supported independently by uniaxial compression and direct tension tests on test specimens cored from the same marble block. A plausible physical explanation for this type of marble anisotropy has yet to be made. This observed difference cannot be explained by considering the rock simply as a material with cracks. It may be attributed to pure micromechanical reasons such as the complex microstructure of this type of reck, characterized by a complex previous <b>loading</b> history (<b>metamorphism),</b> Until such an explanation is available, the apparent behavior can be used in analyzing the stress-strain behavior of rocks. Further, the 3 PB experiments indicate that fracture of marble starts always at the bottom fiber of the middle cross-section of the beam and the failure extension strain is the same with that occurring in the direct tension test. This last result {{is due to the fact}} that the central section of marble beam is almost under extensional strain, which in turn is caused by the combination of the concentrated load and Poisson's effects. The damage parameter that enters the direct tension stress-strain law was obtained independently from longitudinal strain measurements at the outermost compression and extension fibers, as well as, from bending curvature and deflection measurements. This value of the damage factor is in accordance with the damage measured from the direct tension tests. It is also demonstrated that a linear Timoshenko-type theory containing an intrinsic length scale is able to approximate the nonlinear deflection behavior of Dionysos marble beams. Finally, based on a suggestion by Ludwig Prandtl, the stress-strain relationships in unconfined compression and direct tension, as well as Poisson's ratio, of Dionysos marble were derived from bending tests.
