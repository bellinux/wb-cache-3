When we examine the state of mega projects today, we are faced with a real crisis. Companies, both client and contractor, are reporting significant cost and schedule overruns. Lack of project scope definition and planning are the primary characteristics of this problem. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach for the analysis of repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data.

The UPFC offers an effective means to enhance improvement in the power transfer capability of the tie-line. The main application of UPFC is to stabilize the frequency oscillations of the inter-area mode in the interconnected power system by the dynamic control of tie-line power flow. The Redox flow batteries, which are not aged to the frequent charging and discharging, have a quick response and outstanding function during overload conditions. In addition to <b>leveling</b> <b>load,</b> the battery is advantageous for secondary control in the power system and maintenance of power quality of distributed power resources. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of UPFC and the cost function of the two area power system along with the integral controller.

The disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the TPS has grown pragmatically since 1948 as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities.

5000|$|BASE {{was first}} {{developed}} {{by researchers at}} the Ford Motor Company, in the search for a storage device for electric vehicles while developing the sodium-sulfur battery. The NaS battery consists of sulfur at the positive electrode and sodium at the negative electrode as active materials, and sodium-conducting beta alumina ceramic as the electrolyte separating both electrodes.This sealed battery is kept at approximately 300 degrees Celsius and is operated under the condition that the active materials at both electrodes are liquid and its electrolyte is solid. It is only at temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius or more, that it is possible for the negative sodium electrode to completely coat, or [...] "wet," [...] the ceramic electrolyte. At lower temperatures, molten sodium has issues in covering the surface of the beta alumina ceramic. This causes sodium to curl up akin to a drop of oil in water, reducing surface area contact and making the battery less efficient. At such high temperatures, since both active materials have high surface area contact and internal resistance becomes low enough, the NaS battery shows excellent performance. As a secondary battery, which allows reversible charging and discharging, the NaS battery can be continuously used. Several commercial installations use this type of battery for <b>load</b> <b>leveling.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} that exist {{on behalf of}} energy storage appear to be nearly limitless {{and there is no}} exception to this in power systems. Energy storage can be used to flatten an electrical load by charging the storage when the system load is low and discharging the storage when the system load is high. This technique is known as <b>load</b> <b>leveling</b> and is the storage application of interest in this thesis. One of the biggest {{benefits that}} <b>load</b> <b>leveling</b> can yield is the elimination of expensive gas turbine generators. Gas turbine generators are used because they can react to drastic changes in the system load that other generators can’t. Their downfall however, is that they are more expensive than the other generators. But if the load is level enough, {{there is no need to}} use gas turbine generators because there aren’t any drastic changes in the load. <b>Load</b> <b>leveling</b> requires a storage device to have a very large capacity. In this thesis several different large storage types are studied to see which ones are best suited for the application of <b>load</b> <b>leveling.</b> Ultimately both NaS batteries and pumped hydro storage are chosen to use for this study and the results for each is compared. A theoretical double peak system load with a peak value of 1950 megawatts is used for this study. The load is leveled by discretizing the energy storage’s charging and discharging profiles and allocating the stored energy by means of dynamic programming. An economic analysis of both the original case and the case in which energy storage is used to level the load is carried out. This study shows that energy storage used for the application of <b>load</b> <b>leveling</b> can be economically beneficial depending on the type of storage that is used. Battery storage is not quite ready to be used for this application but with some improvements to the technology it could be soon. Pumped storage on the other hand is the cheapest form grid level energy storage and can generate a great deal of economic gain in today’s power systems. ...|$|E
