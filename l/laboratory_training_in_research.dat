30|$|Regarding {{the current}} <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> issues, the most {{commonly}} employed type is teaching of basics (such as statistics and publication rules) to all residents (mean mark 3.11). The currently most pronounced driver of research {{is considered to be}} health technology assessment (HTA, mean mark 3.62) and physics (3.56). Researchers are typically recruited during (3.63) and after (3.56) residency. The most prominent content of <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> is biostatistics (3.52), and {{the most commonly}} employed teaching method is presentations given by trainees (3.93). Flexibility of <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> is rated below average (2.57). Career planning is typically done by the researchers themselves (4.11), network building by the research groups (3.82) and funding by research groups (3.88). Success is measured by bibliometric data (3.71).|$|R

5000|$|The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College was a {{building}} of major importance to Queensland {{and among the}} most ambitious projects within the Forgan Smith Government's building program.

The University embraced the model for training health practitioners promoted by the American Medical Association which advocated increased <b>laboratory</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> basic medical sciences and the use of hospitals for clinical training. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College reflects this approach to health care <b>training</b> <b>in</b> its provision of specialist <b>laboratories</b> and a <b>training</b> hospital.
