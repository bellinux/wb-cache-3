50|$|To be a nuisance, {{the level}} of {{interference}} must rise above the merely aesthetic. For example: if your neighbour paints their house purple, it may offend you; however, it doesn't rise to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance.</b> In most cases, normal uses of a property that can constitute quiet enjoyment cannot be restrained in nuisance either. For example, {{the sound of a}} crying baby may be annoying, but it is an expected part of quiet enjoyment of property and does not constitute a nuisance.Nuisance distinguishes between cases where the conduct alleged to be a nuisance has caused material injury to property and the cases where it has caused “sensible personal discomfort”.|$|E
40|$|Background: Area-based health inequalities may partly be {{explained}} by higher levels of area disorder in deprived areas. Area disorder may cause safety concerns and hence impair health. This study assessed how, for whom and in what conditions the intervention Meeting for Care and Nuisance (MCN) {{had an impact on}} neighbour nuisance and area safety in four deprived districts in Arnhem, the Netherlands. Methods: Realist evaluation methodology was applied to uncover how, for whom, and under what conditions MCN was expected to and actually produced change. Expected change was based on action plans and scientific theories. Actual change was based on progress reports, media articles, interviews with district managers, and quantitative surveys. Results: Three levels of impact were distinguished. At the organisational level, partly as expected, MCN’s coordinated partnership strategy enabled role alignment, communication, and leadership. This resulted in a more efficient approach of nuisance households. At the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> households, as expected, MCN’s joint assistance and enforcement strategy removed many of the underlying reasons for nuisance. This resulted in less neighbour nuisance. At the district level, perceptions of social control and area safety improved only in one district. Key conditions for change included a wider safety approach, dense population, and central location of the district within the city. Conclusions: This realist evaluation provided insight into the mechanisms by which a complex area-based intervention was able to reduce neighbour nuisance in deprived areas.

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{strongly}} suggests that the neighbourhood in which people live influences their health. Despite this, investigations of ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk factors have focused mainly on individual-level characteristics. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate associations between neighbourhood-level environmental stressors (crime, housing density, nuisance from alcohol and drug misuse, quality of green space and social participation), and blood pressure (BP) and hypertension among different ethnic groups. Methods Individual data from the Amsterdam Health Survey 2004 were linked to data on neighbourhood stressors creating a multilevel design for data analysis. The study sample consisted of 517 Dutch, 404 Turkish and 365 Moroccans living in 15 neighbourhoods in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Results Amongst Moroccans, high density housing and nuisance from drug misuse were associated with a higher systolic BP, while high quality of green space and social participation were associated with a lower systolic BP. High <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> from drug misuse was associated with a higher diastolic BP. High quality of green space was associated with lower odds of hypertension. Amongst Turkish, high level of crime and nuisance from motor traffic were associated with a higher diastolic BP. Similar associations were observed among the Dutch group but none of the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion The study findings show that neighbourhood-level stressors are associated with BP in ethnic minority groups but were less evident in the Dutch group. These findings might imply that the higher BP levels found in some ethnic minority groups might be partly due to their greater susceptibility to the adverse neighbourhood environment in which many ethnic minority people live. Primary prevention measures targeting these neighbourhood stressors may have an impact in reducing high BP related morbidity and mortality among ethnic minority groups. </p...|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} from traffic {{is one of}} the main factors considered in the environmental appraisal of road schemes. Currently this appraisal concentrates on the emission and roadside concentration of those regulated pollutants which are potentially harmful to the health or well-being of human, animal or plant life, or to ecological systems. However, vehicle emissions, especially those from diesel vehicles, may also cause a number of aesthetic and nuisance problems, such as visibility reduction, urban soiling and physical irritation. A methodology to investigate the subjective nuisance effects of air {{pollution from}} road traffic on the public has been developed and tested. The data indicates that vehicle-derived air pollution was an issue of high relative importance to the public when compared to other major social issues. On a local level, the physical presence of road traffic and its associated pollution appeared to be the largest contributors to outdoor public environmental nuisance. Indoors, the public appeared to experience only minor disturbances from vehicle-derived pollution, with the average respondent being not very bothered by vehicle-derived smoke, fumes and odour, dust and dirt and general air pollution. Noise appeared to cause the greatest indoor traffic-related nuisance, although many respondents complained about soiling from dust/dirt. The surveys suggest that outdoor disturbance from vehicle-derived air pollution was fairly high, with smoke, fumes and odour causing the greatest annoyance. The main reason given for disturbance from outdoor smoke, fumes and odour and dust/dirt was concern that they would harm the public's health. Other important specific reasons included soiling and the smell of the fumes. The data also suggests that there can be significant differences in disturbance between sites in the same and different cities, between males and females and between different age groups. No significant differences in annoyance were noted between smokers/non-smokers and different socio-economic groupings. In addition, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> experienced by people in urban areas did not depend upon the proximity of their home/workplace to a road. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} that tsetse flies are the vectors of African trypanosomosis, causing sleeping sickness in man and nagana in cattle, {{occurred at the}} start of a rapidly expanding colonialism in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, the first research on the fly was largely taxonomic, coupled with a painstaking ecological approach to determine the identities and distribution limits of the different species. This was followed by closer attention to the physiology of the fly, both from the academic standpoint as related to its survival and reproduction in the field, and from the standpoint of its vectorial capacity. There are still conflicting hypotheses concerning the maturation of trypanosomes within the fly. Increasing concern for the environment led to a ban in the developed nations on the use of DDT as an insecticide which had been used successfully for tsetse control in Africa. This was followed by a ban on the use of organochlorine insecticides in general, and no doubt the next restrictions will be on the use of organophosphates and upon synthetic pyrethroids which have already been banned in the UK for the control of houseflies. Fortunately, research on the role of olfactory and visual stimuli of the tsetse, in the location of potential hosts, led to an improvement in methods for monitoring fly populations by means of traps and targets upon which the flies alight. So successful are such devices that, when treated with an insecticide, they can be used to sustain an increase in natural mortality in fly populations to such an extent that these populations decline to manageable levels. The techniques constitute an appropriate technology for the countries of Africa, and attention is now focused on replacing conventional insecticides with more environmentally acceptable compounds whose development is based on a sound knowledge of the physiology of the insect. Perhaps the next major step will be to understand the physiological basis of the acquisition and maturation of trypanosome infections in tsetse. Modern genetic techniques may then permit the engineering of flies which cannot transmit trypanosomosis and are therefore reduced to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> flies.

Like many other environmental problems, air traffic noise, continues to grow {{and has become a}} serious problem in many countries. Millions of people living or working around airport areas can suffer from noise exposure effects as for instance hearing loss, interference with communication, stress, sleep disturbance, psychological effects as well as a general reduction in quality of life and tranquillity. However, noise annoyance is a difficult issue to evaluate as it is open to subjective reactions. Fuzzy logic theory is the perfect tool to analyse and evaluate all that vague and imprecise concepts that contrary to many other concepts, like age, distance or time, can not be measured as easily. In this project, a fuzzy function has been developed to quantify the annoyance level that people living or working in areas near airports are suffering. The parameters that come into play in this feature are the noise <b>level,</b> time <b>of</b> day, the number of events per hour, and finally, if it is a residential or an industrial area.

This article reports on research undertaken to determine whether architects, designing shopping centres in the 1960 s and late 1990 s, were aware of the link between environmental design and criminal opportunity. It goes on to examine what relation that ignorance/awareness might have to criminal opportunity, nuisance behaviour, and fear of crime in users. The related issue of management/maintenance of centres is also examined. The design of two Portsmouth, England, shopping centres (the ?Tricorn??planned and built in the 1960 s and ?Gunwhaf Quays' ? planned and built in the late 1990 s) is compared. The research findings utilising interviews, questionnaires and examination of local newspaper reports suggest that users found the ?Tricorn? to be poorly designed, ill maintained, to attract crime and nuisance behaviour, and to make them feel unsafe whilst, in contrast, users felt that ?Gunwharf Quays' is well designed and maintained. Many feel that these factors may be connected to their feelings of safety, and to what they observed as low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> crime and <b>nuisance</b> behaviour.

40|$|Modern {{high-bypass}} turbofan engines produce high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> {{noise that}} has {{a significant impact on}} the environment near airports as well as the crew and passengers inside the aircraft. Significant research is being undertaken to understand the aeroacoustic noise source mechanisms and to accurately predict engine noise levels. High-performance computers and advanced numerical techniques are now taking an active role in this research area. In this work, a numerical solver is developed to accurately and efficiently predict noise radiation from ducts. The solver is based upon a hybrid methodology whereby only the acoustic near-field is solved using the developed numerical solver, with the resultant far-field directivity determined from an integral solution of the Ffowcs Williams - Hawking equation. Particular emphasis has been placed on the radiation of duct modes from a realistic bypass engine intake geometry. The performance of the numerical schemes employed in the solver is analysed, with particular attention to the dispersion and dissipation qualities. A study into the determination of a suitable non-reflecting boundary condition for duct acoustics is also undertaken. Using a novel formulation of the linearised Euler equations, the solver is applied to noise radiation from a realistic engine intake geometry with background mean flow. The accuracy of the scheme is validated by comparison with analytic solutions for the unflanged duct case. For the unflanged duct case the effect of an acoustic liner is modelled using a time-domain impedance boundary condition. The effect of a locally supersonic inflow on radiation from the engine intake is examined. Finally, the solver is extended to determine multimode radiation from generic engine intakes, with the possibility to incorporate swirling mean flows and asymmetric duct geometries.

40|$|Summary. Various anthropometric {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in the last decade in order to investigate how different physiological or behavioral human character-istics can be used as identity evidence to prove the individuality of each person. Some of these characteristics are: face, eyes, ears, teeth, fingers, hands, feet, veins, voice, signature, typing style and gait. Since the first biometric security systems appeared in the market, an increasing demand for novel techniques that will cover all different scenarios, has been observed. Every new method appears to outmatch some of its competitors but, at the same time, presents disadvantages compared to others. However, there is still no method that consists a single panacea to all dif-ferent scenarios and demands for security. This is the reason for which researchers are on a continuous effort for more efficient and generic biometric modalities {{that can be used in}} various applications. In this chapter, emerging biometric modalities that appeared in the last years in order to improve the performance of biometric recognition systems, are presented. The presented methods are divided in two major categories, intrusive and non-intrusive ones, according to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> user <b>nuisance</b> that each system sets off. ...|$|R
