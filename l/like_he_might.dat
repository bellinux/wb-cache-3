During his {{acceptance}} speech, he {{revealed that he}} had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have four more decades of life ahead of him.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's {{generally}} mixed reception, critics praised Sawa's {{performance as}} Alex. [...] Holden of The New York Times commented that [...] "The disaster and Alex's premonitions {{set up a}} heavy-handed fable about death and teenage illusions of invulnerability". David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked [...] "Sawa's personable turn as the hero is matched by a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with familiar faces (i.e. Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr, Tony Todd, etc)...," [...] while Leydon of Variety pointed out that [...] "Sawa is credible as the second-sighted Alex—unlike many other actors cast a teen protagonists, he actually looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> still be attending high school—but the supporting players are an uneven bunch". LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Sawa and Ali Larter's pairing, saying that [...] "Larter and Sawa, who becomes more scruffy and wild-eyed as the film progresses, make an appealing pair".|$|E
500|$|As {{the studio}} was {{simultaneously}} developing , limitations were set on which mutants {{could be used}} for cameo appearances in X-Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine. Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X-Men, but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and [...] "not be able to do him justice." [...] Kinberg reasoned, [...] "there just wasn't enough space", and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2, but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that [...] "there wasn't much left to do with the character. It also felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> tread {{a little bit on the}} terrain of Beast, in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy." [...] Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in [...] The introdutory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous X-Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a [...] "Days of Future Past"-inspired battle with a Sentinel. Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique, Madrox and Juggernaut, which Penn had previously envisioned for X2.|$|E

I should say he would not use this {{privilege}} (?) above five times, and some <b>he</b> <b>might</b> scorn to illustrate at all, so we may say fifty drawings. I shall come to the drawings next.|$|R

6000|$|When, I say, I reflect as I {{go up and}} set him a sum, that {{he could}} whop me in two minutes, double up Prince and the other assistant, and pitch the Doctor out of window, I can't but think how great, how generous, how magnanimous a {{creature}} this is, that sits quite quiet and good-natured, and works his equation, and ponders through his Greek play. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> take the school-room pillars and pull the house down if <b>he</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>He</b> <b>might</b> close the door, and demolish every one of us, like Antar the lover or Ibla; but he lets us live. He never thrashes anybody without a cause; when woe betide the tyrant or the sneak! ...|$|R

Kirsty McCormack from the Daily Express said Dyer [...] "looks like the ultimate East End hard man". Claire Hodgson from the Daily Mirror said Dyer was [...] "making a poor attempt at looking harder than his dog", while The List said that in the photo, Dyer looks [...] "smug and hard-nosed". Hello thought Mick {{and the rest of his}} family look like [...] "they're going to cause a stir" [...] and the Daily Mail noted the actor's smirk in the photo. Mick wears a peacoat and ASOS.com said he [...] "looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be the most stylish landlord of the Vic ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|In season two (2000–2001), Angel {{discovers that}} Wolfram & Hart has brought his sire and former lover Darla (Julie Benz) {{back from the}} dead in human form. Although Darla is intent on {{bringing}} back Angelus, Angel hopes to save her soul and help her seek redemption while she still has a chance. However, just as it looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> succeed, Wolfram & Hart bring in Drusilla to turn Darla back into a vampire. Embracing his dark side, Angel fires his employees, Cordelia, Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and Gunn (J. August Richards) (secretly to protect them from this dark territory, as he later revealed to Lorne (Andy Hallett)), and embarks on a vendetta against Wolfram & Hart; Angel allows Darla and Dru to massacre a group of lawyers. Losing faith in his mission, he has sex with Darla in the hopes of losing his soul. Instead, however, he experiences an epiphany and realizes that the good fight is still worth fighting. A disgusted Darla flees L.A. and Angel reconciles with his friends, who eventually forgive him. Angel also appears in Buffy season five's [...] "Forever", comforting Buffy after her mother's death.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Cotton {{has become}} one of EastEnders most renowned villains. His 'nastiness' was voted the 25th [...] "Greatest Soap Moment" [...] in a Five poll in 2004, and he has also been voted the 4th most villainous {{television}} character in a Channel 4 poll. The Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker has denied Nick's villainous characterisation however, writing: [...] "The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an Argos catalogue. Whereas [...] Jez Quigley looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, wondering when he last washed his hair." [...] The Timess Fiona McCade satirised the character when Altman appeared on the children's TV show Balamory, advising parents to: [...] "be prepared to cover your little ones’ eyes as the bad boy of soap strides into the colourful, fictional paradise, no doubt goosing Miss Hoolie, upsetting PC Plum and making Josie jump. I also fear for the safety of Archie, the chubby, cheerful posh boy who wears a pink kilt and lives alone in a big pink castle. With Nick in town, he doesn’t stand a chance." ...|$|E

In early 2015, Nichols said that even though <b>he</b> did not <b>like</b> her <b>he</b> <b>might</b> support her candidacy because he believed she was tough enough to combat Islamic terrorism.|$|R
60|$|At first Captain Folger refused this offer, but on {{consideration}} {{he allowed}} Jack to go, promising {{at the same}} time to keep as near to the shore as possible, so that if there was anything <b>like</b> treachery <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have a chance of swimming off.|$|R

6000|$|Judging {{from this}} example, I venture very humbly {{to think that}} any one who, even {{at the age of}} Cato, wants to learn Greek, should begin where Greek {{literature}}, where all profane literature begins--with Homer himself. It was thus, not with grammars in vacuo, that the great scholars of the Renaissance began. It was thus that Ascham and Rabelais began, by jumping into Greek and splashing about till they learned to swim. First, of course, a person must learn the Greek characters. Then his or her tutor may make him read a dozen lines of Homer, marking the cadence, the surge and thunder of the hexameters--a music which, like that of the Sirens, few can hear without being lured to the seas and isles of song. Then the tutor might translate a passage of moving interest, like Priam's appeal to Achilles; first, of course, explaining the situation. Then the teacher might go over some lines, minutely pointing out how the Greek words are etymologically connected with many words in English. Next, he might take a substantive and a verb, showing roughly how their inflections arose and were developed, and how they retain forms in Homer which do not occur in later Greek. There is no reason why even this part of the lesson should be uninteresting. By this time a pupil would know, more or less, where he was, what Greek is, and what the Homeric poems are <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> <b>might</b> thus believe from the first that there are good reasons for knowing Greek; that it is the key to many worlds of life, of action, of beauty, of contemplation, of knowledge. Then, after a few more exercises in Homer, the grammar being judiciously worked in along with the literature of the epic, a teacher might discern whether it was worth while for his pupils to continue in the study of Greek. Homer would be their guide into the [...] "realms of gold." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent awarded Born Villain {{their lowest}} rating of one star out of five. He criticized Manson's lyrics as being hate-filled and suggested: [...] "If {{he tried to}} find {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>liked,</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> actually make something worth listening to." [...] Conversely, a review by Simon Price for that publication's sister edition, The Independent on Sunday, gave the album their top score of five stars, saying that it [...] "features some of his finest lyrics yet and, musically, it often approaches the heyday of Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals. It is, then, something approaching the 'stunning return to form' of rock-crit cliché." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mehmed II invaded Italy in 1480. The {{intent of}} his {{invasion}} was to capture Rome and [...] "reunite the Roman Empire", and, at first, looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to}} do it with the easy capture of Otranto in 1480 but Otranto was retaken by Papal forces in 1481 after the death of Mehmed. After his death, he was succeeded by his son, Bayezid II.|$|E

50|$|She discovers Malcolm {{is still}} tormented {{by his mother}} Corinne's {{abandonment}} of him at age five, and believes {{it was her own}} plain looks and money that attracted him to her, since he mistrusts more conventionally beautiful women. While he is attracted to beauty and seems <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> consider an affair, it is obvious he lacks patience and true feeling enough for such an entanglement. Olivia feels betrayed and humiliated, but is still optimistic that things will change as they begin their life together.|$|E

50|$|Pantalone {{typically}} wore tight red {{pants and}} a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses.

50|$|After {{a strong}} run of {{form for the}} Coburg Tigers in the VFL, Newman made his debut for Richmond in Round 9 of the 2002 season. He was then to play every game except the Tigers' Round 22 game due to bad form for the {{previous}} month. He played every game though in the 2003 season and looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have {{a career in the}} big league. He excelled as the Richmond team struggled, kicking 5 goals for the season and averaging 13 disposals off half back. In 2004, he played yet another good year. He played 19 games, once again averaging 13 disposals and also kicking 2 goals.|$|E

The OUTFEST 2008 guide described it as : [...] "Daring and straightforward, DEVOTEE {{is the story of}} Hervé, an assertive 43-year-old man who was born without arms or legs. He meets a gorgeous young man online, a devotee (devoteeism (or acrotomophilia) is the sexual attraction to people with amputations) who seems <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be different. Their encounter proves Hervé’s difficulty in finding a true connection with someone who is interested in treating him like a person rather than a mere fetish."

He was known as Dr. Lanfear, but he was not at first known as her physician; he was conjectured her cousin or something <b>like</b> that; <b>he</b> <b>might</b> even be her betrothed in the peculiar American arrangement of such affairs. Personally people saw in him a serious-looking young man, better dressed and better mannered than they thought most Americans, and unquestionably handsomer, with his Spanish skin and eyes, and his brown beard of the Vandyke cut which was then already beginning to be rather belated.|$|R
