Here, we define the <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>magnetic</b> fields as the field components parallel and perpendicular to the tape axis, respectively. If the filament-bundle is twisted, it can couple to the AC <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field to generate the longitudinal magnetization loss. Furthermore, the AC transport current flowing spirally in the twisted filament-bundle possibly influences the longitudinal magnetization. The longitudinal magnetization loss was measured in a twisted multifilamentary Bi 2223 tape exposed to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field and carrying the transport current. The measured longitudinal magnetization loss in the twisted tape exposed to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is larger than that in another untwisted tape.

40|$|Abstract — Increasing {{recording}} {{track density}} by allowing overlap of adjacent tracks {{can lead to}} substantial increase in storage density for magnetic recording. However, track overlap may cause severe inter-track interference (ITI) and result in loss of performance. Sophisticated signal processing techniques must then be used to recover this loss. We study the use of joint equalization and decoding for magnetic recording with overlapping tracks. We present results for a scheme that uses minimum meansquared-error (MMSE) equalization in conjunction with error correction coding using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The recording process is simulated using a micromagnetic model for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording.</b> We use a three track system to study the track overlap. The outer two tracks are allowed to overlap on the middle track to simulate ITI. Bit error rate simulations show that the MMSE-LDPC decoding scheme incurs negligible loss when each of the outer tracks overlap 10 % on the middle track. By varying the recording parameters, the tradeoff between storage density and performance is also studied. We show that by a judicious choice of LDPC codes a recording with track overlap can have better performance than {{when there is no}} overlap. Hence, a higher storage density can be obtained without loss in performance.

This thesis presents the structure of hard drives, features, performance and reliability of hard drives and alternative data storage technologies. Particular emphasis is to develop technologies that contribute significantly to the reduction of magnetic domains on the plates, thereby increasing the surface density. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the development of hard disks over the years and the basic principles of their operation are examined. A detailed description of the structure of hard drives with all the components follows. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording,</b> which was used in the past, and perpendicular magnetic recording, which is used today, are presented.

Next the characteristics of hard disks are described, including the areal density and the record format on the hard disk. When talking about performance of hard drives, the emphasis is on the speed of data transmission, the average access time and the impact of cache on the hard disk performance.

First, a data-based approach is presented for modeling and controller design of a dual- stage servo actuator in a hard disk drive. Based on discrete-time models, different dual-stage track-following controllers were designed using classic and H-infinity loop shaping techniques. The controllers were implemented in real-time. Next, an input shaping algorithm based on convex optimization techniques is presented for closed- loop discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The proposed algorithm allows closed-loop signals {{to be subjected to}} linear constraints on amplitude and rate of change. As an illustrative example the seeking process in a hard disk drive is investigated and experimentally verified. To study the dependence of the read signal on cross-track and vertical motion, a straightforward analytical model for the read back signal is derived for perpendicular and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording.</b> The model captures the contribution of a single bit rather than the contribution of a bit transition which makes it applicable to patterned media as well as continuous media. In addition, a novel method of measuring the relative head -medium spacing based on the measurement of the read back signal from servo sectors is developed. The spacing measurement is tested experimentally on a spin stand where the flying height is varied using the resistance heater element in a thermal flying height control slider. In addition, voltage step response measurements were obtained for data based modeling. Finally, a dynamic model of the resistance heater in a thermal flying height control (TFC) slider is identified based on experimentally obtained step -input data. A generalized realization algorithm is used for identification of a discrete-time dynamic model of the resistance heater. Based on the identified model and convex optimization techniques, a computational scheme is proposed to obtain optimized feed forward input profiles to the heater element that minimize repeatable flying height variations. The optimized input signals were applied to the heater and greatly reduced flying height variations were observed in spinstand experiment...|$|E

40|$|Currently {{the data}} storage {{industry}} is facing huge challenges {{with respect to}} the conventional method of recording data known as <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording.</b> This technology is fast approaching a fundamental physical limit, known as the superparamagnetic limit. A unique way of deferring the superparamagnetic limit incorporates the patterning of magnetic media. This method exploits the use of lithography tools to predetermine the areal density. Various nanofabrication schemes are employed to pattern the magnetic material are Focus Ion Beam (FIB), E-beam Lithography (EBL), UV-Optical Lithography (UVL), Self-assembled Media Synthesis and Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL). Although there are many challenges to manufacturing patterned media, the large potential gains offered in terms of areal density make {{it one of the most}} promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives. ^ Thus, this dissertation contributes to the development of future alternative data storage devices and deferring the superparamagnetic limit by designing and characterizing patterned magnetic media using a novel nanoimprint replication process called 2 ̆ 2 Step and Flash Imprint lithography 2 ̆ 2. As opposed to hot embossing and other high temperature-low pressure processes, SFIL can be performed at low pressure and room temperature. ^ Initial experiments carried out, consisted of process flow design for the patterned structures on sputtered Ni-Fe thin films.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, educational and commercial institutions have driven the demand for cheap and efficient data storage. The storage medium known as magnetic recording media has remained the mainstay for most computer systems due to its large storage capacity per dollar. With the recording media's ever-increasing storage density has come reductions in the magnetic grain size per bit. At the recording bit's density threshold, the magnetic grains become more susceptible to thermal activation, which can render the storage medium unusable. An accurate characterisation of the recording layer's sub-granular structure is essential for understanding the magnetic and thermal mechanisms of high-density recording media. Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) studies have been performed to investigate the magnetic and physical properties of longitudinal and perpendicular recording grains. The SANS studies of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> media have probed the recording layer's magnetic grain size at a sub-nanometer resolution. In conjunction with these studies, SQUID magnetometry was used to characterise the recording grain's bulk magnetism. Measurements showed that the recording grain was composed of a ferromagnetic hard core (Co-enriched) and a weakly magnetic shell (Cr-enriched). These results provided important information on the grain's magnetic anisotropy, which determines the recording media's magnetic stability. The polarised SANS studies were used to characterise the recording layer's physical granular structure. It was shown that the physical grain size was comparable to its magnetic counterpart. These physical measurements provided insight into the recording grain's chemical composition. The magnetic properties of perpendicular magnetic recording media were studied using SANS and VSM measurements. The neutron scattering studies revealed that the recording grain was composed of a hard ferromagnetic centre enriched with cobalt. The VSM studies showed that the magnetic recording grains exhibited a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. These combined studies provided information on the recording grain's ferromagnetic composition and magnetic stability. The polarised SANS measurements showed the physical grain size to be slightly smaller than its magnetic counterpart. This size difference was attributed to the non-magnetic grain boundary composed of SiO 2. The boundary thickness determined the degree of inter-granular exchange coupling. Further polarised studies investigated the recording layers switching behaviour, which revealed more information on the grain's magnetic stability...|$|E
40|$|The ubiquity {{and high}} {{performance}} of hard disk drives for nonvolatile digital data storage cannot be denied. As the magnetic recording industry continues {{to develop new}} techniques for increasing storage density and reducing cost per bit, diagnostic and forensic tools for characterizing and interpreting the magnetic patterns recorded onto disk drive media become increasingly important. Therefore, this dissertation presents developments to the uniquely suitable spin-stand-based method of imaging magnetization patterns on media extracted from commercial hard disk drives. The emphasis of the presented research {{is placed on the}} following three areas: microscopy enhancement techniques for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> media, "drive-independent" characterization and reconstruction of disk data, and the exploration of spin-stand microscopy in the novel context of perpendicular magnetic recording. First, it is known that, while the spin-stand microscopy technique offers high-speed and massive scale imaging capabilities, the images obtained are corrupted by distortion due to the non-local sensing or finite spatial resolution of the imaging sensor. Two techniques for mitigating this distortion, one based on characterizing the head by means of its linear response function, and a new method based on spatial Hilbert transforms, are described and demonstrated. Furthermore, a two-dimensional extension of the Hilbert transform in the context of magnetic recording is derived based on physical arguments and its application to spin-stand imaging is demonstrated. Second, although magnetic media imaging is interesting in its own right, an extension of this capability is the identification of commercial hard disk drive write channels and the subsequent reconstruction of the data written to the associated disks in a "drive-independent" manner on the spin-stand. For fundamental and practical reasons, a multilayered encoding process is performed on digital data before it is written to the disk; the presented work details the theoretical and experimental results obtained in characterizing and reversing these codes. Finally, because perpendicular recording technology has recently come on the market in consumer disk drives, the spin-stand microscopy technique is extended to imaging the media employing this new mode of recording. In particular, the novel aspects of perpendicular recording are discussed and their impact on spin-stand microscopy is demonstrated...|$|E

Nonetheless, the lifetime of this newly adopted technology and other next generation alternatives including heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and bit patterned media (BPM) is comparably short. In order to defer the superparamagnetic limit substantially beyond 1 Tbits/in^ 2, {{it may be necessary}} to stack information in a third (vertical) dimension. This vertical stacking underlies the concept of multilevel (ML) three-dimensional (3 D) magnetic recording and memory. In 3 D magnetic devices, information is recorded, not only on one surface (as in all modern 2 D applications), but in the entire 3 D bulk of the recording media. As a result, substantially larger amount of data could be recorded on the same surface area (as compared to any 2 D alternative). This study addresses design configuration, media fabrication, and characterization techniques for a particular ML 3 D magnetic recording device. A newly developed ML 3 D magnetic recording media enables selective reading and writing of up to 4 distinct signal levels, in comparison to only two signals in conventional 2 D-based magnetic recording media. It is believed that at least over six layers (or over 2 ^ 6 = 64 signal levels) could be independently accessed in a ML 3 D magnetic recording device. Gallium ion implantation as a potential method to alter the magnetic properties of 3 D media is also discussed. Furthermore, with every emerging technology, both fabrication systems and characterization techniques must be developed. One of the most crucial characterization tools, which enable the direct visualization of the smallest bit of magnetic information, is Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM). MFM is thus an integral part of the development and characterization of ML 3 D magnetic recording devices. Nevertheless, the best lateral resolution conventional state-of-the-art probes can produce under ambient conditions is limited to about ~ 25 nm. In this study, newly developed fabrication techniques for MFM probes are presented. Specifically, plateau probes to enhance the overall capabilities of MFM and high lateral resolution (below 10 nm in ambient conditions) multi-domain MFM probe. The enhancement in MFM capabilities has the potential to facilitate the development of HAMR, BPM, and ML 3 D magnetic systems...|$|E

The {{results show that}} a weld joint with a good appearance, few defects and enough penetration can be obtained {{under the protection of}} helium-argon gas mixture, especially when the helium ratio is about 50 %. However, the weld quality is significantly decreased by adding additional CO 2 or N 2 in He-Ar gas mixture. The weld seam consisted of fine equiaxed grains which mostly grow in a certain direction were formed when a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is added, due to its electromagnetic stirring in weld pool. The grains of weld seam formed under the alternating current <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field are much finer than those under the direct current magnetic field. A weld joint with good formability and finer microstructure is obtained when the exciting voltage of AC <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is 20 V. The average microhardness of the corresponding weld joint is 68. 5 HV 0. 1, and its average tensile strength is 220 MPa which is up to 88 % of that of the base plate...|$|R

This paper reports {{the effects of a}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field on the vibration of a magnetically sensitive double single-walled carbon nanotube system (DSWNTS). The two nanotubes of the DSWNTS are coupled by an elastic medium. The dynamical equations of the DSWNTS are derived using nonlocal elasticity theory. The two nanotubes are defined as an equivalent nonlocal double-Euler-Bernoulli beam system. Governing equations for nonlocal bending-vibration of the DSWNTS under a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field are derived considering the Lorentz magnetic force obtained from Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s relation. An analytical method is proposed to obtain nonlocal natural frequencies of the DSWNTS. The influence of (i) nanoscale effects and (ii) strength of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field on the synchronous and asynchronous vibration phase of the DSWNTS is examined. Nonlocal effects with and without the effect of magnetic field are illustrated. Results reveal the difference (quantitatively) by which the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field affects the nonlocal frequency in the synchronous and asynchronous vibration modes of a DSWNTS.
