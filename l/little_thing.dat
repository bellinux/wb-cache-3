However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public. The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies.

500|$|Mercury {{played the}} piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, {{including}} [...] "Killer Queen", [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", [...] "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy", [...] "We Are the Champions", [...] "Somebody To Love" [...] and [...] "Don't Stop Me Now". He used concert grand pianos and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Queen guitarist Brian May claims that Mercury was unimpressed with his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time {{because he wanted to}} walk around onstage and entertain the audience. Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like [...] "Ogre Battle" [...] and [...] "Crazy <b>Little</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love" [...] were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.|$|E
500|$|... "Wear My Kiss" [...] is an uptempo pop song. David Balls of Digital Spy {{described}} it [...] "a fuzzed-up pop thumper". The song {{is composed of}} [...] "thick" [...] beats, [...] "sexy" [...] verses and [...] "raunchy" [...] lyrics. The chorus features a chanted 'da-da-da' hook, which according to Al Fox of BBC Music is evocative of the group's 2003 single [...] "Hole in the Head". Andy Gill of The Independent noted that the song sees the Sugababes [...] "effectively subjugated {{to the status of}} accessories"; lyrically, the singers compare themselves to a tie, watch and shoes of a man's outfit. During the pre-hook, group member Heidi Range sings, [...] "I"m just a pretty <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> / That'll make you wanna sing / Make you wanna buy a ring". [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] is reminiscent of songs performed by British girl group Girls Aloud and American recording artist Lady Gaga.|$|E
500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, [...] "I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy <b>Little</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|E
