5|$|On 17 September 2006, Given {{suffered}} a one-centimeter tear in his bowel after a tackle by West Ham United striker Marlon Harewood. Doctors likened the injury to one more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> {{in a car}} crash. Then-manager Glenn Roeder signed ex-Newcastle veteran Srníček as cover for Harper, and youth goalkeeper Tim Krul played a full match in Newcastle's 1–0 UEFA Cup win at Palermo on 2 November. Given returned on 18 November for Newcastle's 1–1 Premier League draw at Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the very}} few genera where the workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|With {{almost four}} years gone in his government's five-year term, in mid-1939 Mackenzie King {{considered}} an election and asked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in early August if he thought anything was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> on the international scene. Chamberlain warned of unsettled conditions on the German—Polish border; Britain had promised to assist Polish independence {{in the event of}} war. Mackenzie King decided to wait to hold an election. On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland. Mackenzie King recalled Parliament into session beginning 7 September, and Canada declared war on Germany. Before adjourning on 13 September, Parliament passed legislation creating a Department of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
5000|$|... "Today me, {{tomorrow}} thee." [...] English proverb The {{meaning of}} this proverb {{is that something that}} <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> a person, is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> eventually <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> another who observes it, especially if the two people are similar.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the body}} prepares for childbirth, the cervix softens, thins, moves forward {{to face the}} front, and may begin to open. This allows the fetus to settle or [...] "drop" [...] into the pelvis. When the fetus settles into the pelvis, this may result in pain in the sciatic nerves, {{increased}} vaginal discharge, and increased urinary frequency. While these symptoms are <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> after labor has already begun for women who have given birth before, they may <b>happen</b> approximately ten <b>to</b> fourteen days before labor in women experiencing the effects of nearing labor for the first time.|$|R
25|$|The report {{suggested}} that the collapse was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be the result of}} over-stressing of the natural rock on which the brick arch rings were founded. It was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> at some time in any event and there was insufficient evidence to say whether or not it had been triggered by the excavation.|$|R
5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will continue for up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> The moth lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> by accident anyway.|$|E
50|$|Mazzoni et al. {{also suggest}} a 3 {{processes}} {{model for the}} development of false memories through suggestions. The first process is to make people perceive the event as plausible, the second is to make people believe it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> them and the third step is to help people interpret thoughts and fantasies about the event as memories. Other factors influencing the likelihood of producing false memories include imagining the events and making a source-monitoring error, specifically reality monitoring.|$|R
2500|$|David Grinspoon, {{one of the}} {{scientists}} who in 2005 proposed that hypothetical organisms on Titan might use hydrogen and acetylene as an energy source, has mentioned the Gaia hypothesis {{in the context of}} discussion about Titan life. He suggests that, just as Earth's environment and its organisms have evolved together, the same thing is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> on other worlds with life on them. In Grinspoon's view, worlds that are [...] "geologically and meteorologically alive are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be biologically alive as well".|$|R
25|$|Predicted {{distribution}} models {{indicate that}} overall {{range in the}} last glacial period was broader or more southerly distributed, and inhabitations in waters where species presences lack in present situation, such as in southern hemisphere and south Asian waters and northern Indian Ocean were possible due to feasibility of the environment on those days. Range expansions due to recoveries and re-colonization {{in the future is}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>happen</b> and the predicted range covers wider than that of today.|$|R
25|$|Analyses {{from both}} private and central banks agreed with the Fed's {{assessment}} that reducing global imbalances was in everyones interests, saying also that various long term trends would make the reduction <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s {{many of the}} {{surrounding}} neighborhoods had been razed for road construction or extensively rebuilt through urban renewal programs.

25|$|In fast conditions, {{cognitive}} processes {{that result in}} a phonetic plan, fail {{to keep up with}} articulation, and thus, the articulation of the existing plan is restarted, resulting in the repetition of words which is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> but no more likely than fillers.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} {{proposal}} which I think is very correct to keep peace in the future of the world. We are all not sure what is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in the future, but what we know at least is what is most <b>likely</b> going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and what work we can do that if we do it we can avoid disaster. Based upon this logic, I find World Government is the most likely candidate which can save human life and keep the peace as I have discussed in the whole paper...|$|R

30|$|However, upon further {{inspection}} of the data, {{it is possible to}} find clues, pointing towards a distributed attack. The span between the first rollback and the start of the large attack a 4 is the time during which the alleged crowdsourced attack is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened.</b> Incidentally, it is also during this span that the behavior of users deviates most from the norm. This change in behavior is characterized by a high number of pileups, high user MPS and a low total number of moves.|$|R
25|$|Only {{a handful}} of thinkers, ranging from French President Charles de Gaulle to the Soviet {{dissident}} Andrei Amalrik, foretold the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union itself, and even they saw it as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> {{as a result of}} disastrous wars with China or pressures from the Islamic Soviet states of Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|While {{peak demand}} in 2006 was below total {{installed}} capacity, it lay slightly above firm capacity. According to {{supply and demand}} projections by the World Bank, new generation capacity to be commissioned in the period 2007-2010 {{will not be enough}} to meet demand growth, which means that an energy shortfall is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Wolf {{attacks are}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> when {{preceded by a}} long period of habituation, during which wolves {{gradually}} lose their fear of humans. This was apparent in cases involving habituated North American wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Vargas Island Provincial Park and Ice Bay, as well as 19th century cases involving escaped captive wolves in Sweden and Estonia.|$|E

25|$|The Ibrox {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} 2 January 1971 when large-scale crushing on a stairway exit at {{the culmination of}} the New Year's Day Old Firm game claimed 66 lives. An enquiry concluded that the crush was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> 10 minutes after the final whistle and to have been triggered by someone falling on the stairs. A benefit match to raise funds for the victims' families took place after the disaster, a joint Rangers and Celtic team playing a Scotland XI at Hampden, watched by 81,405 fans.|$|R
50|$|Sharon and Elsie is a British sitcom that aired for {{two seasons}} from 1984 to 1985. It starred Brigit Forsyth (best {{known for her}} role as Thelma Ferris in The <b>Likely</b> Lads/Whatever <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Likely</b> Lads?) and Janette Beverley.|$|R
25|$|If the lovina {{acquired}} a pool {{at a premium}} (>100), as is common for higher coupons, then they {{are at risk for}} prepayment. If the purchase price was 105, the investor loses 5 cents for every dollar prepaid, which may significantly decrease the yield. This is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> as holders of higher-coupon MBSs have a good incentive to refinance.|$|E
25|$|A {{second stage}} freeze is also <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> with the valve open, causing a free flow, which may {{precipitate}} a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the {{flow through the}} frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a shutoff valve, {{but if this is}} done, the first stage must be fitted with an overpressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an overpressure valve.|$|E
25|$|Pesticide {{leaching}} {{occurs when}} pesticides mix {{with water and}} move through the soil, ultimately contaminating groundwater. The amount of leaching is correlated with particular soil and pesticide characteristics {{and the degree of}} rainfall and irrigation. Leaching is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> if using a water-soluble pesticide, when the soil tends to be sandy in texture; if excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application; if the adsorption ability of the pesticide to the soil is low. Leaching may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or disposal areas.|$|E

50|$|The {{ethnic origin}} of the Abkhazians of African descent—and how Africans arrived in Abkhazia—is still a matter of dispute among experts. Historians agree that the {{settlement}} of Africans {{in a number of}} villages in the village of Adzyubzha in Abkhazia (then part of the Ottoman Empire) is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> in the 17th century. According to one version, a few hundred slaves were bought and brought by Shervashidze princes (Chachba) to work on the citrus plantations. This case was a unique, and apparently not entirely successful, case of mass import of Africans to the Black Sea coast.|$|R
50|$|On 7 June 1984, {{the day of}} {{the first}} Crimewatch UK appeal, two {{anonymous}} calls came in to say that they suspected a fairground worker called Martin Earley was responsible for Tildesley's disappearance. He had worked for Frank Ayers for eleven years and was at the Wokingham Fun Fair on the night Tildesley went missing. He was arrested and confessed to Tildesley's abduction, saying that he had raped and murdered him at his caravan nearby, which fitted in with what a hypnotist had said was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Tildesley. However, he changed his story so many times that it became unreliable and detectives worked out that they had in fact got the wrong man.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} growing overlap between the Vocational Education and Training (VET), {{organised}} under the National Training System, and Higher Education sectors in Australia. Courses are primarily taken by those aged over 18, however in some vocational and general academic courses a minority of students enter at the minimum school-leaving age of 16, although from May 2009 Federal Government policy calls {{for young people to}} be in education, gainful employment, or training until age 17 (Year 12 qualification) with tightening of income support payments to age 20 if not undertaking further training. This tends to happen particularly at Technical and Further Education colleges (TAFE), and is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> at a university or a private institution.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{province}} belongs to a semi-arid climate. It roughly goes along the coastal plain from La Vila Joiosa through the southernmost border (cities included here are, amongst others, Alicante, Elche, Orihuela and Torrevieja). Summers are very long, hot to very hot and very dry, winters are cool to mild and its most prominent feature is very scarce precipitation, typically below 300mm. per year and most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> during spring and autumn. The reasons for this lack of precipitation is mostly the marked rain shadow effect caused by hills {{to the west of}} the Alicante province (and, to a lesser degree, those in the northern part of {{the province}} which, in turn, enhance the inverse Orographic lift effect around Cap de la Nau). Most of its few rainy days happen during Autumn and Spring.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you see," [...] {{continued}} Rollo's father, [...] "that {{if these}} watches should get lost or injured in any way, {{the question whether}} the watchmaker {{would have to pay}} for them or not, would depend upon the degree of care it would have required to save them. For instance, if he locked them all up with special care, and particularly the repeater, and then the building were struck with lightning and the watches all destroyed, he would not have to pay for any of them; for this would be an inevitable accident, which all his care could not guard against. It would have been as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> my repeater, if I had kept it at home.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the age of}} three, {{children}} are generally able to distinguish fantasy and pretense from reality, {{but there are a}} number of reasons why children might confuse the two. In some cases, it appears as though {{children are}} unable to regulate their emotions, especially fear, and this leads to what may seem like confusion between reality and pretense, such as monsters hiding in their toy bin. Negative emotions such as fear and anger also seem to have a negative effect on children’s tendency to believe an event is either possibly real or fantasy and either more or less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>happen</b> in reality.|$|R
5000|$|Where Kumarajiva's {{work can}} be {{compared}} with an extant Indic manuscript [...] - [...] that is, in those rare cases where part or all of a text he translated has survived in a Sanskrit or Prakrit version [...] - [...] a somewhat surprising result emerges.
