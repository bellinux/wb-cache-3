40|$|This report {{begins with}} a focus on {{applications}} to charter schools. While much attention has been focused on charter school waitlists, waitlist data can be misleading. It includes duplicates, but also includes waitlists that have been rolled over from year to year and might be an unrealistic measure of demand. Instead, the authors investigate three factors related to demand: the yearly percentage of each {{middle school and high school}} class that applies to a charter in our lottery sample; the percentage of applicants that receive an offer from a charter school; and where students ultimately attend. This report also examines the demographic makeup of charter school enrollees and compare it to BPS. The next section follows the path of charter school students and report their performance in charters using the evidence from the <b>lotteries.</b> The <b>lottery</b> <b>sample</b> now covers many more charter schools. The 2009 report included findings from eight schools. This report includes MCAS results through 2012 from 12 schools and many more cohorts from the original schools, with additional newly opened schools contributing to the demand analysis. In addition to updating the test score results from the 2009 report, this report breaks down the test score effects by student subgroups. Trends are investigated over time in charter performance and by school groups. Finally, this report gives results using statistical controls, which allow the authros to estimate effects for attending charter schools that do not have sufficient lottery records for the more rigorous lottery based analysis.

The fact that urban charters are most effective for poor nonwhites and low-baseline achievers contributes to, but does not fully explain, these differences. We therefore link school-level charter impacts to school inputs and practices. The relative efficacy of urban <b>lottery</b> <b>sample</b> charters is accounted for by these schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to urban education.

Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, {{does not support the}} use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value {{in the event of a}} collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist. He also cautions against placing the recommendations of surgeons above other expert opinion in the debate, comparing it to drawing conclusions on whether it is worthwhile to buy <b>lottery</b> tickets by <b>sampling</b> only a group of prizewinners. The prominent UK-based cycling activist John Franklin is skeptical of the merits of helmets, regarding proactive measures including bike maintenance and riding skills as being more important. Cyclists' representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance.|$|R

40|$|People often {{attach a}} higher value to an object when they own it (i. e., as seller) {{compared}} with {{when they do}} not own it (i. e., as buyer) —a phenomenon known as the endowment effect. According to recent cognitive process accounts of the endowment effect, the effect is due to differences between sellers and buyers in information search. Whereas previous investigations have focused on search order and internal search processes (i. e., in memory), we used a sampling paradigm to examine differences in search termination in external search. We asked participants to indicate selling and buying prices for monetary lotteries in a within-subject design. In an experience condition, participants had to learn about the possible outcomes and probabilities of the <b>lotteries</b> by experiential <b>sampling.</b> As hypothesized, sellers tended to terminate search after sampling high outcomes, whereas buyers tended to terminate search after sampling low outcomes. These differences in stopping behavior translated into <b>samples</b> of the <b>lotteries</b> that were differentially distorted for sellers and buyers; the amount of the distortion was predictive of the resulting size of the endowment effect. In addition, for sellers search was more extended when high outcomes were rare compared with when low outcomes were rare. Our results add to the increasing evidence that the endowment effect is due, in part, to differences in predecisional information search...|$|R

Although developed countries are very much careful about the health in occupations it is quite neglected in the developing countries like India. Aims: To record PEFR in asymptomatic male workers exposed to chemical fumes for more than 2 years and compare the results with age matched unexposed, healthy male controls. Methods and Material: This was a comparative study between 50 asymptomatic male workers exposed to chemical fumes for more than 2 years in various industries located at Jeedimetla Industrial Area and 50 unexposed healthy male individuals from general population. The sampling was done by simple random <b>sampling</b> (<b>lottery</b> method). The data was collected in the Research Laboratory of Physiology. Anthropometry like weight, height, was measured and the PEFR test was performed in the standing position by taking a deep inspiration and then blowing out as hard and as quickly as possible with their nose closed. Data was analyzed by using SPSS package and was expressed in terms of mean ± SD. Results: It was observed that mean PEFR was statistically highly significant in cases (p = 0. 0001), and PEFR decreased with increase in duration of exposure. Conclusions: Thus, it can be concluded that apparently healthy individuals may also have abnormal PEFR findings. Hence, a regular check on these parameters will help them in reducing the chances of its manifestation at a future date...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{styles are}} divided into four types such as, visual, auditory, {{kinesthetic}} and tactile. Learning style can also be related to biological factors like biorhythms, sustenance and location, which are called biological differences. There are many students applying the biological differences in learning. Thus, this study had two purposes. First, {{the study was to}} find out the characteristics of the students’ preferences in applying biological differences, and second the study was to mention advantages and disadvantages of students’ biological differences in learning. The research design of this study was descriptive research. The population in this study was the second semester students of English Department of University of Muhammadiyah Malang consisting of nine small classes. The researcher took one class randomly by using <b>lottery.</b> The <b>sampling</b> technique used was cluster random sampling. Meanwhile, the instruments of this study were questionnaire and interview to collect the data. The researcher found many characteristics of the students’ preferences in learning based on their biological differences. First, biorhythms students. They prefered studying in specific time such as morning, afternoon, evening and night. Second, sustenance students. They needed food, drink and candy while they were learning. The last, location students. They were influenced by the environmental factors like lighting, sound, chairs and room. In terms of the advantages and the disadvantages of students’ biological differences, it was shown that one of the advantages on biorhythms students was they had schedule of study, so that they could study regularly based on the schedule of study. But, they felt bored studying in the same time everyday. Sustenance students felt energetic to study. In contrast, if the students ate too much in learning, they felt sleepy. Location students enjoyed and felt comfortable studying in their favorite places. But, they could get difficulties to decide the place, if they had to study together in a group. Based on this research it can be concluded that there were many characteristics of the students in applying biological differences in learning. So, the teacher should know the biological differences of their students in order to do the most appropriate treatment in learning. Each of the characteristics had advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages should be minimized, and the advantages should be maximized, by understanding and giving permission to the students to apply the biological differences in learning. ...|$|R

From the selected schools 120 student respondents were selected given equal fraction to each school. Members of the sample were students started grade one above seven years old, dropped out from school and/or repeated a grade level one or more than one time. The necessary data was collected through questionnaire, interview, focus group discussion and document review. These methods were implemented to collect primary and secondary data. The data collected through questionnaire from students were coded and entered to the SPSS software program. And the focus group discussion and interview were used in triangulating with the data collected through questionnaire from students. Generally, a descriptive data analysis system was adopted in this study. School distance became a determinant factor for students’ late entry to primary education than students drop out from the system. The study found age of the student, parent’s education level and motivation towards education as major obstacles to students’ completion of primary education.

K 4 K 5 2011 The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the challenges facing the implementation of SMASSE project in Kericho District, Kericho County. The study was guided by the following objectives: l. To identify the challenges faced by public secondary school principals as they facilitate the implementation of SMASSE project. 2. To investigate the challenges faced by mathematics and science teachers on the use of ASEIIPDSI concept in their lessons.. 3. To find out the effect of ASEIIPDSI approach on student attitude and participation in mathematics and science lessons. 4. To make suitable recommendations. The study was conducted using survey design. The target population for the study was 21 principals, 84 Mathematics and Science teachers and 1763 form 2 students. The study sampled 7 out of 21 public secondary schools using purposive simple random <b>sampling.</b> <b>Lottery</b> technique was employed to get samples from different categories of schools. 7 principals, 28 teachers and 210 students were sampled to participate in the study out which all the 7 principals, 25 teachers and 201 students responded to the questionnaires which were used to collect data in the study. 2 schools were randomly selected for piloting of the instruments. These schools were not part of the sample for the main study. Content validity of the instruments was ascertained by a panel of three district SMASSE- INSET trainers. Reliability of the instruments was tested during piloting using test-retest method. After the piloting and testing, the instruments were adjusted accordingly before the actual data collection. Having established the validity and reliability of the instruments, the researcher administered the questionnaires to the sampled respondents. After collection, the data was organized to facilitate analysis. The coded data was entered into the computer using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). Descriptive statistics was used to analyze data quantitatively. Data was analyzed using means, frequencies and percentages. Results were presented in form of frequencies, charts and percentages as they easily communicate the research findings to the majority of the readers. From the findings the main challenge faced by the principals was shortage of teachers in mathematics and science subjects. The teachers on the other hand listed low morale, lack of sufficient time, heavy workload, overloaded syllabus, large class sizes and pressure to cover the syllabus as major impediments to the application of ASEI-PDSI approach in teaching. Despite the challenges, use of ASEI- PDSI approach has contributed to students having a positive attitude towards Mathematics and Science subjects and increased their participation in learning activities. Follow-up visits on the project implementation by the Quality Assurance and Standards Officers were found to be minimal. These findings will be of great significance to CEMASTEA and District planning committees, Principals and teachers who are charged with implementation of the SMASSE project. From the study many students express a positive attitude and were satisfied with the teaching of mathematics and sciences. However performance in these subjects in the K. C. S.
