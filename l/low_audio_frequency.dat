The four frequency response functions that characterise the dynamic response of the MEMS block have been measured and used to simulate the closed loop response of the transducer.

Moreover at frequencies above the fundamental resonance frequency of the transducer, the output signal shows a - 90 o phase lag with reference to the base velocity.

The limitations of physical size on conventional circuits become important in this frequency range. It is necessary to consider selectivity ease of tuning, economy of components, and stability, in the comparison of various types of amplifiers which operate in the range below 20, 000 cycles per second. At radio frequencies, use of the parallel resonant circuit as a selective load impedance for a vacuum tube is highly satisfactory. (Figure 1) When the frequency of resonance is decreased, the product of the inductance and capacitance must be increased inversely as the square of the frequency. It becomes difficult to produce variable condensers with a large enough capacity to cover the range desired. In order to obtain the required value of inductance, iron cored inductors must be used.

The frequencies used (10 - 43 kHz) were scaled to be equivalent to <b>low</b> <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> with moderate seas. Although the coherent component of the transmitted acoustic intensity showed an exponential decrease with increasing values of the roughness parameter, R [= k 22 o 2 (c 2 /c 1 cos o 1 - cos o 2) 2, the decrease was greater than predicted. (Subscript 2 refers to propagation constant, speed and angle of transmission in water; subscript 1, in air.) This lack of agreement appeared to be caused by violation of the Kirchhoff require­ment, L/A 2 >> l.

The corrected theory appears to be valid for both coherent and incoherent components of intensity for all values of L/A 2 provided that oR < 4. 0.

Low sound velocity causes phase shift and sound pressure losses due to interference of adjacent {{parts of the}} membrane at audible frequencies. Therefore, loudspeaker engineers are searching for lightweight but extremely rigid materials to develop speaker membranes whose cone resonances are well above the audible range. With its extreme hardness, paired with low density and high velocity of sound, diamond is a highly promising candidate for such applications.

40|$|If {{you study}} {{transmission}} lines in college {{or from the}} ARRL Handbook, you will learn the classic equation for characteristic impedance. ZO = [L/C) ] 1 / 2 What {{most of us have}} long forgotten (and that few universities teach) is that this is the simplified form of the equation. In engineering classes, we make equations simpler by assuming certain conditions will be true for what we think will be the conditions when we use them. That’s fine as long as we don’t forget those assumption, but in this case, most of us have. The full equation for characteristic impedance is ZO = [(R+j 2 πfL) / (G+j 2 πfC) ] 1 / 2 At high frequencies (that is, f is large), (2 πfL) is much larger than R, and (2 πfC) is much larger than G. So at high frequencies, the equation becomes simply ZO = [j 2 πfL) / j 2 πfC) ] 1 / 2 and further simplifies to ZO = [L/C) ] 1 / 2 which is the familiar equation. But what if f is not large? Fig 1 shows the impedance of a typical coaxial cable at <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> using the full equation. Why the wide variation? Because at low frequencies, R is much greater than 2 πfL, and 2 πfC is much greater than G. Thus, at <b>low</b> <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the equation simplifies to ZO = [R/j 2 πfC] 1 / 2. Within the audio spectrum and for a decade or so above it, R in this equation is simply the DC resistance of the cable(per the same unit length as the L and C parameters). This causes the impedance to be quite high and predominantly capacitive near zero frequency. As frequency increases, L becomes significant, and ZO transitions to the familiar 50 - 100 ohm impedances at high frequencies. And the transition occurs {{right in the middle of}} the audio spectrum! Through the transition region, the "j " term causes ZO to be a combination of resistance and capacitance. [Although the data presented here is for coaxial cables, virtually all commonly used cables, including twisted pairs, exhibit these characteristics!] Above the audio spectrum, R begins to increase with skin effect as the square root of frequency, causing attenuation to increase...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three types}} of semi-active vibration absorbers, which are designed to control the response and sound radiation of a thin plate at <b>low</b> <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Semi-active control systems are used to tune the absorbers to the resonance frequencies {{of the first three}} flexural natural modes of the plate where they are mounted. The first configuration consists of three axial tune mass dampers, which are properly adjusted and distributed on the plate so that each of them controls one of the first three flexural modes of the plate. The second configuration consists of a single axial switching tune mass damper that can switch to different states characterised by discrete values of the suspension stiffness and mechanical damping. At each state the parameters are set to control one of the first three flexural modes of the plate. Finally the third configuration consists of a single three-axis tune mass damper whose mass oscillates axially and rotates around two cross axis. This device is also located and tuned to control the first three flexural modes of the plate. The simulation study shows that the three axial tune mass dampers reduce the flexural kinetic energy of the plate by about 17 dB around the first three resonance frequencies and about 8 dB around the fourth and fifth resonance frequencies. Thus large control effects are produced in the low frequency range between 30 and 150 Hz. The single axial switching tune mass damper produces about 14 dB reductions around the first three resonances and 3 dB and 7 dB around the fourth and fifth resonances respectively. Finally the single three-axis tune mass damper generates about 21 dB reductions around the first three resonance frequencies and about 9 dB reductions around the fourth resonance frequency. Thus the proposed single axial and single three-axis tune mass dampers produce comparatively similar results as the three axial tune mass dampers with the same total mass. In particular it is shown that the best location for the single three-axis tune mass damper should be chosen either in the centre or inner centre of the polygon defined by the border of the plate. The control performance of the single three-axis tune mass damper has also been compared with that produced by an active velocity feedback loop using an inertial electromagnetic actuator with equivalent proof mass. The simulation study shows that the activesystem outperforms the single three-axis tune mass damper only around the first resonance frequency, where it produces 7 dB larger reduction of the flexural kinetic energy. However this result is obtained with large feedback control gains and at the expenses of low frequency control spillover. When a smaller and more realistic control gain is implemented, the control effects become comparable to that of a single three-axis tune mass damper...|$|R
