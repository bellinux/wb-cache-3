5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> and energy are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting {{to find another}} place where we might have <b>liquid</b> <b>water.</b> But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E

At the cloud base, the concentration was 0grams of <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the cloud, where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of <b>liquids,</b> <b>water</b> in particular, at hard surfaces.

5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it.

5000|$|Being a {{wet process}} with an {{intended}} <b>liquid</b> result, the <b>water</b> promoted the chain reaction by {{serving as a}} neutron moderator, whereby neutrons emitted from fissioned nuclei are slowed so they are more readily absorbed by neighboring nuclei, inducing them to fission in turn. The criticality continued intermittently for about 20 hours. As the solution boiled vigorously, steam bubbles attenuated the <b>liquid</b> <b>water's</b> action as a neutron moderator (see Void coefficient&thinsp;) and the solution lost criticality. However, the reaction resumed as the solution cooled and the voids disappeared.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be <b>liquid</b> <b>water.</b> The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

40|$|Liquid-liquid {{two-phase}} systems {{formed by}} a hydrophobic ionic <b>liquid</b> and <b>water</b> find several useful ways of application in analytical chemistry. One {{of the most}} important properties of such two-phase systems is the mutual solubility of the IL and water. Recent advancements on this subject have been reviewed. The solubility of ionic <b>liquids</b> in <b>water</b> is related to the standard Gibbs energies of the transfer of ions constituting the ionic liquid from the ionic <b>liquid</b> phase to <b>water.</b> Although this single ionic property cannot be measured thermodynamically and also varies from one ionic liquid to another, the standard Gibbs energy of the ion transfer from a polar aprotic solvent, such as nitrobenzene and 1, 2 -dichloroethane, to water is a convenient measure for it. The solubility of an ionic <b>liquid</b> in <b>water</b> and the electrochemical properties at the interface between the two phases are intimately related with each other...|$|R

5|$|Several {{explanations}} for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed, including venting from a subsurface reservoir of <b>liquid</b> <b>water,</b> sublimation of ice, decompression and dissociation of clathrates, and shear heating, but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal power output of Enceladus {{has not yet been}} settled.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> as a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water {{is also more}} chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

30|$|By contrast, {{both the}} dilute acid (in 1.3 % H 2 SO 4 at 90  °C for 3  h) and <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> (in {{compressed}} water at 200  °C for 10  min) treatments largely reduced the hemicellulosic glycans, probably via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, and eventually enriched lignins and cellulosic glucans (Table  1); {{in the typical}} <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> process, cell wall-derived organic acids such as p-hydroxycinnamates, acetates, formates and glucuronic acids liberated in compressed hot water provoke acid-induced cell wall hydrolysis and condensation reactions [46]. It is, however, notable that lignin content of the acid and liquid hot water-treated cell walls evaluated by the Klason assay may be somehow overestimated by repolymerized polysaccharide degradation products (pseudo-lignins) (Table  1) [44, 50]. The mass recovery rate (Fig.  3) and the hemicellulose content data (Table  1) suggested that the <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> treatment was likely harsher and more effective in hemicellulose removal than the dilute acid treatment employed in this study. Notably, the OsC 3 ′H 1 -KD line showed significantly higher mass recovery rates than the other genotypes in both the dilute acid and <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> treatments (Fig.  3), {{which might have been}} due to the relatively low hemicellulose levels in the original cell walls from the OsC 3 ′H 1 -KD line compared with those from the other genotypes (Table  1). Despite the large increases in lignin content (Table  1), the total yields of thioacidolysis monomers expressed per total lignin content were largely depleted after the acid and <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> treatments for all the tested rice cell walls (Fig.  2 b and Additional file 1 : Table S 1), suggesting that lignins underwent acid-induced condensation reactions in both the dilute acid and <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> treatments. We again observed more pronounced monomer yield reductions after <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> treatment than after dilute acid treatment (Fig.  2 b and Additional file 1 : Table S 1). Particularly after the <b>liquid</b> hot <b>water</b> treatment, both H- and G-type thioacidolysis monomers were more drastically depleted than S-type monomers (Fig.  2 b and Additional file 1 : Table S 1). The result suggests that H- and G-lignins are more susceptible to acid-induced condensation reactions than S-lignins, possibly due to the higher reactivities of non- or less methoxylated H- and G-type aromatic rings than S-type aromatic rings in typical acid-catalyzed condensation reactions of lignins [51 – 53].|$|R
