The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining {{the shadows of the}} robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the <b>left,</b> <b>has</b> a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E

25|$|Thatcher's {{political}} and economic philosophy emphasised free markets and entrepreneurialism. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small nationalised company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly large response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and sold off most of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of privatisation, while anathema to many on the <b>left,</b> <b>has</b> become synonymous with Thatcherism.|$|E
25|$|The {{decoration}} includes stuccoes by Francesco Ferrari (c.1725), and a Cosmatesque pavement. The main altarpiece has a Madonna with Saints Andrew and Gregory (1734) by Antonio Balestra. The second altar on the <b>left</b> <b>has</b> a Madonna on a Throne {{with child}} and four Saints and Blesseds of the Gabrielli family (1739) by Pompeo Batoni. At {{the end of}} the nave, the altar of S. Gregorio Magno has three fine reliefs from {{the end of the}} 15th century by Luigi Capponi. Also interesting is the Salviati Chapel, designed by Francesco da Volterra and finished by Carlo Maderno in 1600: it includes an ancient fresco which, according to the associated tradition, spoke to St. Gregory, and a marble altar (1469) by Andrea Bregno and pupils. The chapel is used by Rome's Romanian community, which follows the Byzantine rite there.|$|E

On {{the other side of the}} tablet sits the only male figure among those on the lunettes who is intrinsically beautiful. This blonde young man, elegantly dressed in white shirt and pale green hose, with no jerkin but a red cloak, postures with an insipid and vain gesture, in contrast to the Ignudi which he closely resembles.|$|E

500|$|The lintel {{contains}} six reliefs {{from the}} New Testament of {{scenes from the}} Life of the Virgin. The first four, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Adoration of the Magi, are associated with motherhood and infancy. They are followed by the Resurrection and Pentecost. Above them, surmounting a [...] "cross flower", is the Coronation of the Virgin. The jambs {{on either side of}} the Virgin are adorned with statues, most likely of Old Testament prophets. Of these only David, second to the <b>left,</b> <b>has</b> been identified. The bearded man to David's left is probably Moses, the man in the cap to the right is most likely the [...] "weeping prophet" [...] Jeremiah. On the opposite side, the outer figures may be Zechariah and Isaiah.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplified}} forms {{have also}} been criticized for being inconsistent. [...] For instance, traditional 讓 ràng [...] "allow" [...] is simplified to 让, in which the phonetic {{on the right side}} is reduced from 17 strokes to just three. [...] (The speech radical on the <b>left</b> <b>has</b> also been simplified.) [...] However, the same phonetic is used in its full form, even in simplified Chinese, in such characters as 壤 rǎng [...] "soil" [...] and 齉 nàng [...] "snuffle"; these forms remained uncontracted because they were relatively uncommon and would therefore represent a negligible stroke reduction. [...] On the other hand, some simplified forms are simply long standing calligraphic abbreviations, as for example 万 wàn [...] "ten thousand", for which the traditional Chinese form is 萬.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy criticized Chang's {{accusation}} of [...] "Western indifference" [...] and [...] "Japanese denial" [...] {{of the massacre}} as [...] "exaggerated", commenting that [...] "the Western world in fact neither then nor later ignored the Rape of Nanking", [...] "nor is Chang entirely correct that Japan has obstinately refused to acknowledge its wartime crimes, let alone express regret for them." [...] Chang argues that Japan [...] "remains to this day a renegade nation," [...] having [...] "managed to avoid the moral judgment of the civilized world that the Germans were made to accept for their actions in this nightmare time." [...] However, according to Kennedy, this accusation has already become a cliché of Western criticism of Japan, most notably exemplified by Ian Buruma's The Wages of Guilt (1994), whose general thesis might be summarized as [...] "Germany remembers too much, Japan too little." [...] Kennedy pointed out that a vocal Japanese <b>left</b> <b>has</b> long kept the memory of Nanking alive, noting the 1995 resolution of Japan's House of Councillors that expressed [...] "deep remorse" [...] (fukai hansei) for the suffering that Japan inflicted on other peoples during World War II and clear apologies (owabi) for Imperial Japan's offenses against other nations from two Japanese Prime Ministers.|$|E

500|$|Grand Coulee Dam {{supports}} {{four different}} power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators. The original Left and Right Powerhouses contain 18 main generators and the <b>Left</b> <b>has</b> an additional three service generators for total installed capacity of 2,280MW. The first generator was commissioned in 1941 and all 18 were operating by 1950. The Third Powerplant contains {{a total of}} six main generators with a 4,215MW installed capacity. Generators G-19, G-20 and G-21 in the Third Powerplant have a 600MW installed capacity but can operate at a maximum capacity of 690MW which brings the overall maximum capacity of the dam's power facilities to 7,079MW. The Pump-Generating Plant contains six pump-generators with an installed capacity of 314MW. When pumping water into Banks Lake they consume 600MW of electricity. Each generator is supplied with water by an individual penstock. The largest of these feed the Third Powerplant and are [...] in diameter and can supply up to [...] The dam's power facilities originally had an installed capacity of 1,974MW but expansions and upgrades have increased generation to 6,809MW installed, 7,079MW maximum. Grand Coulee Dam generates 21 TWh of electricity annually. This means that the dam generates about 2,397 MW of power on average, which results in a total plant factor efficiency of 35%. In 2014, 20.24 TWh of electricity was generated.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{have two}} lungs, a right lung and a left lung. They are {{situated}} within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The right lung {{is bigger than}} the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh approximately , and the right is heavier. The lungs {{are part of the}} lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. The conducting zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the microscopic alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Together, the lungs contain approximately [...] of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has three lobes and the <b>left</b> <b>has</b> two. The lobes are further divided into [...] bronchopulmonary segments and lobules. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.|$|E
