On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire.

Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E

Many of the tourists who stayed at the hotel (of whom the majority were Swedes) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames.

5000|$|Life nets often {{failed to}} save people, and {{sometimes}} firefighters themselves were injured or killed by falling bodies. According to researcher and writer Cecil Adams, [...] "Leapers sometimes struck {{something on the}} way down, landed on a fireman, or missed entirely." [...] In November 1910, a fire swept through a factory in Newark, New Jersey, killing 25 people. Among them were four girls who held onto each other when they jumped into a <b>life</b> <b>net.</b> They tore the net apart and were killed. [...] In the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25, 1911, girls jumped into life nets from the ninth floor with their arms intertwined and the impact ripped the canvas and tore the springs from the frame, resulting in their deaths. [...] In all, 146 garment workers were killed in that fire. During the Hotel Polen fire in Amsterdam on May 9, 1977, firefighters could not successfully deploy a <b>life</b> <b>net</b> in a narrow, congested alley. When a <b>life</b> <b>net</b> was deployed in a more open area, some hotel guests threw their luggage into the net, and were then injured when they jumped.

40|$|Abstract Background Procurement and {{distribution}} of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in the African region has decreased from 145 million in 2010 to 66 million nets in 2012. As resources for LLIN distribution appear to stagnate, {{it is important to}} understand the users’ perception of the life span of a net and at what point and why they stop using it. In order to get the most value out of distributed nets and to ensure that they are used for as long as possible, programmes must communicate to users about how to assess useful <b>net</b> <b>life</b> and how to extend it. Methods Data were collected from 114 respondents who participated in 56 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and eight focus group discussions (FGDs) in August 2012 in eight regions in Senegal. Households were eligible for the study if they owned at least one net and had an available household member over the age of 18. Data were coded by a team of four coders in ATLAS. ti using a primarily deductive approach. Results Respondents reported assessing useful <b>net</b> <b>life</b> using the following criteria: the age of net, the number and size of holes and the presence of mosquitoes in the net at night. If they had the means to do so, many respondents preferred the acquisition of a new net rather than the continued use of a very torn net. However, respondents would preferentially use newer nets, saving older, but useable nets for the future or sharing them with family or friends. Participants reported observing alternative uses of nets, primarily for nets that were considered expired. Conclusions The results indicate that decisions regarding the end of <b>net</b> <b>life</b> vary among community members in Senegal, but are primarily related to net integrity. Additional research is needed into user-determined end of <b>net</b> <b>life</b> as well as care and repair behaviours, which could extend useful <b>net</b> <b>life.</b> The results from this study and from future research on this topic should be used to understand current behaviours and develop communication programmes to prolong the useful <b>life</b> of <b>nets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Indoor {{residual}} {{insecticide spraying}} (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) {{are commonly used}} together even though evidence that such combinations confer greater protection against malaria than either method alone is inconsistent. A deterministic model of mosquito life cycle processes was adapted to allow parameterization with results from experimental hut trials of various combinations of untreated nets or LLINs (Olyset, PermaNet 2. 0, Icon <b>Life</b> <b>nets)</b> with IRS (pirimiphos methyl, lambda cyhalothrin, DDT), in a setting where vector populations are dominated by Anopheles arabiensis, so that community level impact upon malaria transmission at high coverage could be predicted. Intact untreated nets alone provide equivalent personal protection to all three LLINs. Relative to IRS plus untreated nets, community level protection is slightly higher when Olyset or PermaNet 2. 0 nets are added onto IRS with pirimiphos methyl or lambda cyhalothrin but not DDT, and when Icon <b>Life</b> <b>nets</b> supplement any of the IRS insecticides. Adding IRS onto any net modestly enhances communal protection when pirimiphos methyl is sprayed, while spraying lambda cyhalothrin enhances protection for untreated nets but not LLINs. Addition of DDT reduces communal protection when added to LLINs. Where transmission is mediated primarily by An. arabiensis, adding IRS to high LLIN coverage provides only modest incremental benefit (e. g. when an organophosphate like pirimiphos methyl is used), but can be redundant (e. g. when a pyrethroid like lambda cyhalothin is used) or even regressive (e. g. when DDT {{is used for the}} IRS). Relative to IRS plus untreated nets, supplementing IRS with LLINs will only modestly improve community protection. Beyond the physical protection that intact nets provide, additional protection against transmission by An. arabiensis conferred by insecticides will be remarkably small, regardless of whether they are delivered as LLINs or IRS. The insecticidal action of LLINs and IRS probably already approaches their absolute limit of potential impact upon this persistent vector so personal protection of nets should be enhanced by improving the physical integrity and durability. Combining LLINs and non-pyrethroid IRS in residual transmission systems may nevertheless be justified as a means to manage insecticide resistance and prevent potential rebound of not only An. arabiensis, but also more potent, vulnerable and historically important species such as Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus...|$|R
