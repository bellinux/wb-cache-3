A Semisubmersible-type bucket <b>ladder</b> <b>dredge</b> is a possible candidate to satisfy the need of PT Timah (Indonesia tin mining company) to exploit tin deposits in water depths of 50 m and deeper. The existing vessel used by PT Timah, barge- type bucket <b>ladder</b> <b>dredge,</b> is only capable of operating in depths shallower than 30 m. In order to evaluate the dredging capability in 50 m water depth, a dynamic analysis of both semisubmersible-type and barge-type bucket ladder dredges was conducted. The proposed vessel, a semisubmersible-type, was designed by modifying an existing semisubmersible platform used in the oil and gas industry, while the barge-type used is from a conventional bucket <b>ladder</b> <b>dredge.</b> Hydrodynamic coefficients and response amplitude operators (RAOS) of both vessels were computed by using WAMIT (Wave Analysis MIT) software and AutoCAD RI") was used for design purposes. The response spectra of the vessels were obtained in head, quarter, and beam seas of sea state 4. The effect of mooring stiffness is also presented. Besides modeling the system with low stiffness, such as a catenary mooring, the dynamic analysis was also conducted for the free-floating condition. Finally, the motion performance between the two vessels was compared for various sea conditions, and it is shown that the semisubmersible-type bucket <b>ladder</b> <b>dredge</b> performs better with smaller responses in the selected sea conditions expected in deeper water depths (> 50 M) ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe deepening {{and maintenance of}} the world's ports and navigable waterways has been {{an integral part of}} the world economy for centuries. In recent years, cutterhead and draghead hydraulic suction dredges have performed a majority of the dredging work. The ongoing design and testing of hydraulic dredges is important for maintaining efficient dredging operations within the limits set by increasing environmental regulations. The high cost of building and operating a hydraulic dredge makes field testing of full-scale prototypes very expensive and time consuming. Moreover, the testing conditions are generally difficult to control, and the natural unpredictability of the sea can render experimental results inconclusive. These factors substantiate the need for laboratory model testing of hydraulic dredging operations. The usefulness of any hydraulic model depends on the degree of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic similarity between the model and its prototype. The primary challenge in establishing useful similitude criteria for model dredge studies is proper kinematic scaling of the suction inlet velocity, average particle settling velocity, dredge swing velocity, and cutter rotational speed. Despite the inherent challenges, model studies of hydraulic dredge equipment have proven useful for obtaining qualitative results. The new Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A&M University is equipped with model dredge testing facilities ideal for performing such experiments. The tow/dredge carriage has a fully adjustable <b>dredge</b> <b>ladder,</b> a 14. 9 kW (20 hp) cutter drive, and a 2. 54 cm (3 in) dredge pump. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) provides computer numerical control and real-time data collection and analysis during model dredging operations. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate scaling relationships for hydraulic dredge model studies and to design a model dredge carriage for the new laboratory facilities recently constructed at the Texas A&M University College Station campus. Pursuant to the design of the new dredge modeling facilities, a rationale for scaling the model dredge operating parameters based on previous model studies is put forward. Examples of model studies that could be performed with the proposed facilities are discussed as well as how the scaling methodology is applied to each experiment to allow the quantitative interpretation of experimental data.

40|$|Dredge cutting forces {{produced}} by {{the movement of the}} cutterhead through the sediment have been measured with the laboratory dredge carriage located at the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory. The sediment bed that was used for the dredging test was considered to be relatively smooth and the sediment used was sand with a d 50 = 0. 27 mm. Forces on the dredge carriage were measured using five 13. 3 kN (3000 lb) one directional load cells placed on the <b>dredge</b> <b>ladder</b> in various places so the transmitted cutting forces could be obtained. The objectives for this study are to determine the vertical, horizontal, and axial forces that are {{produced by}} the cutterhead while testing. So, to find these cutter forces, a static analysis was performed on the carriage by applying static loads to the cutterhead in the vertical, horizontal, and axial directions, and for each load that was applied, readings were recorded for all five of the load cells. Then, static equilibrium equations were developed for the <b>dredge</b> carriage <b>ladder</b> to determine loads in the five load cells. Also, equilibrium equations can be applied to a dredging test to find the cutterhead forces by taking the measured data from the five load cells and applying the known forces to the equations, and the cutterhead forces can be determined. These static equilibrium equations have been confirmed by using a program called SolidWorks, which is modeling software {{that can be used to}} do static finite element analysis of structural systems to determine stresses, displacement, and pin and bolt forces. Data that were gathered from the experimental procedure and the theoretical calculations show that the force on the dredge cutterhead can be determined. However, the results from the static equilibrium calculations and the results from the SolidWorks program were compared to the experiment procedure results, and from the comparison the procedure results show irregularities when a force of approximately 0. 889 kN (200 lb) or above is applied to the cutterhead in a north, south, west, or east orientation. The SolidWorks program was used to determine the results for displacements of the <b>dredge</b> carriage <b>ladder</b> system, which showed that large displacements were occurring at the location of the cutterhead, and when the cutterhead displaces it means that the carriage ladder is also moving, which causes false readings in the five load cells. From this analysis it was determined that a sixth force transducer was needed to produce more resistance on the ladder; and the cell # 1 location needed to be redesigned to make the ladder system as rigid as possible and able to produce good testing results. The SolidWorks program was used to determine the best location where the sixth force transducer would give the best results, and this location was determined to be on the lower south-west corner oriented in the direction east to west. The static equilibrium equations were rewritten to include the new redesigned cell # 1 location and the new location of the sixth load cell. From the new system of equations, forces on the cutterhead can be determined for future dredging studies conducted with the dredge carriage. Finally, the forces on the laboratory cuttersuction dredge model cutterhead were scaled up to the prototype 61 cm (24 in) cuttersuction dredge. These scaled up cutting forces on the dredge cutterhead can be utilized in the design of the swing winches, swing cable size, ladder supports, and ladder...|$|R
