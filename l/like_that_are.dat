25|$|Hinckley {{was founded}} in 1928 by Benjamin B. Hinckley after he {{purchased}} a small boatyard in Southwest Harbor, ME. In 1932 Benjamin’s son, Henry R. Hinckley, an engineering graduate from Cornell, {{took control of the}} company. A 36-foot “fisherman motorboat” dubbed “Ruthyeolyn” built in 1933 was Hinckley’s first boat. Five years later, in 1938, Hinckley came out with its first sailing vessel, a 28-foot Sparkman & Stephens sloop. Hinckley would go on to produce 20 of these sloops, making them the company’s first mass production line. Straying away from boatbuilding, Hinckley opened Manset Marine Supply Company in 1940 for which he designed many fittings for fuel tanks, stanchions, deck plates, and the <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> still utilized today.|$|E
500|$|After {{the final}} whistle Gillingham's {{temporary}} captain Adrian Pennock received the winners' trophy jointly with the team's usual captain, Paul Smith, {{who had come}} on as a substitute. [...] Peter Taylor commented that [...] "These players, especially {{the ones that were}} here last year, deserved it. [...] All season they've shown unbelievable character, and that's what they have done today. They never know when they are beaten." [...] John Benson, commenting particularly on the goal which Wigan felt they were denied, said that [...] "You feel cheated, but decisions <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> part of the game".|$|E

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2007, Jones became romantically {{involved}} with mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. They first met in 2005 when she appeared on Blue Peter {{and he was}} struck by how good she was with kids: [...] "You kind of think people <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> all going to be false, but she really wasn't at all, and I like that. She really is lovely, a typical Neath girl." [...] It was reported they met after Jenkins sang [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli on an episode of Strictly Come Dancing, broadcast on 21 October 2007. Jenkins's spokesman has said: [...] "They're old friends and they've been on several dates. But people shouldn't consider buying hats just yet." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{also played}} her the rap of stream of {{consciousness}} of [...] "Ghost" [...] {{during one of}} their early meetings inspired by an infuriating meeting with a record label. Beyoncé could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about {{the sound of her}} music. For the music of [...] "Ghost", Boots created a beat from [...] a [...] "dreamlike, hypnotic place" [...] working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician Aphex Twin. Boots said, [...] " [...] works <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling." [...] He also elaborated about its concept, [...] "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going. You're scared and you're not sure what to expect from it, but as the album unfolds, we take the blindfold off and you realize it's a surprise party for you." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer {{is eating}} doughnuts. One of them splatters onto the nuclear reactor core's {{temperature}} dial, which is nearing the red zone. Homer fails {{to see the}} warning and the plant approaches a nuclear meltdown. He {{seems to be the}} only person who can stop it, though he has no skills and cannot remember any of his training (due to being distracted and occupied with a Rubik's Cube at the time). In desperation, he chooses a button at random with a counting rhyme, which miraculously averts the meltdown. Springfield is saved and Homer is hailed as a hero. Mr. Burns names Homer [...] "Employee of the Month". Homer's family is also proud of him, especially Lisa, who starts to see him as a role model. Meanwhile, Homer himself is troubled by the fact that his so-called heroism was nothing but luck, and his gloomy mood deepens when he receives a congratulatory phone call from Magic Johnson, who tells Homer [...] "People <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> eventually exposed as the frauds they are".|$|E

500|$|In a {{cover story}} for Entertainment Weekly, Mars stated that the song [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was {{rejected}} by a [...] "music industry decision-maker" [...] (a person he won't name) because of his race. That experience made him feel like a [...] "mutant", {{and he says that}} was his lowest point. [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] {{was being}} showed to {{different}} [...] "music industry decision-makers", {{one of those}} individuals tried to give the song to a [...] "blue-eyed blonde" [...] artist instead of Mars, due to his race. That experience made the singer feel like a [...] "mutant", reaching his lowest point so far in his career. Mars concluded, [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> coming out of people's mouths. It {{made me feel like}} I wasn't even in the room." [...] According to American record producer Jim Jonsin, Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, wanted him to work on the track for Lupe Fiasco. However, Jonsin pressured Kallman to give the song to B.o.B. Lupe stated that Kallman told him his lyrics and performance on the record were [...] "wack". Lupe claimed that this repeated denigration from the label drove him to a breaking point, and to feel [...] "suicidal". Afterwards, his verses were removed and new ones were written by Mars and B.o.B. An unmixed version of the song with Fiasco's verses and Mars' vocals leaked later in the same year.|$|E

He did achieve his moments of success, such as taking 5 wickets for 35 runs for Durham against Somerset in the National League in 2003 and {{claiming}} 6 wickets for 16 {{runs in the}} same competition for Worcestershire against Glamorgan two years later, but he suffered from fitness problems, {{as well as a}} perception that he was less than interested in his task. This was particularly the case at Worcestershire: chairman John Elliott said [...] "Players <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> no good to our club. In fact, Akhtar has been no good for any club he's been at. He's a superstar and just does what he wants." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 1950s, Armstrong was {{a widely}} beloved American icon and {{cultural}} ambassador who commanded an international fanbase. However, a growing generation gap became apparent {{between him and}} the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins. The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong's vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and Uncle Tomism, [...] "[...] he seemed a link to minstrelsy that we were ashamed of." [...] He described [...] as [...] "Chinese music." [...] While touring Australia, 1954, he was asked if he could play Bebop. [...] "Bebop?" [...] he husked. [...] "I just play music.

As the boat lurches downward, we have to maneuver Drake upwards through hallways and staterooms that tilt sideways, climbing up through doors and over bed frames. Our horizontal axis turns vertical as a wall of water surges towards us and suicidal pirates continue to attack, forcing us to quickly adapt to this new perspective. Eventually we fall into a grand chamber whose skylight is fully submerged. The art deco decor, underwater lighting, and skewed angles recall both Bioshock and The Poseidon Adventure. Sadly there are no cameos from Red Buttons or Shelley Winters. Moments <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> what make Uncharted 3 great." ...|$|E

Only this time it won't be the same." [...] He noted {{that one of the}} crimes of which Manson had been convicted, killing a pregnant woman, did not allow Manson to rank very high in prison social structures (Bugliosi cited an informant whom he quoted as saying that [...] "it's like being a child molester...guys <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> gonna do hard time wherever they are") and that Manson's notoriety had become his own worst enemy, with any convict seeking a reputation being willing to attack, and kill, Manson. As noted below, in September 1984, at least one such convict did indeed so attack Manson, with intent to kill.|$|E
2500|$|The Annuario Pontificio {{lists for}} both men and women the institutes of consecrated life and the <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> [...] "of pontifical right" [...] (those that the Holy See has erected or {{approved}} by formal decree). For the men, it gives what it now calls the Historical-Juridical List of Precedence. The arrangement of the institutes for men of Latin Rite in this list dates back many decades. It is found, for instance, in the 1964 edition of the Annuario Pontificio, pp.807–870, where the heading is [...] "States of Perfection (of pontifical right for men)." [...] In the 1969 edition the heading has become [...] "Religious and Secular Institutes of Pontifical Right for Men," [...] a form it kept until 1975 inclusive. Since 1976, when work was already advanced on revising the Code of Canon Law, the list has been qualified as [...] "historical-juridical" [...] and still distinguishes [...] "orders" [...] from [...] "congregations" [...] in the case of Latin-Rite men, while not separating out [...] "orders" [...] and [...] "congregations" [...] in the case of the Eastern Catholic Churches and Latin-Rite women.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} tracks on the album include [...] "Bonsai People", which is a Red Hot Chili Peppers type funk metal song. The lyrics compare childlike people to bonsai trees {{in a way that}} they are tiny (humble, God-fearing) but as a strong breed they can endure the rending of wind (temptation) since their roots are deeply entrenched into soil (word of God). [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] on the other hand is a dark, melodic black metal type song which begins with oppressive clean guitaring. With a haunting voice a person whispers the words [...] "Hell is a totally cool site, so let's get there, all right?". This sentence is probably an attempt to describe the attitude of some of the black metal fans; the lyrics tell that those who say things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> under the 'spell of hell' which the devil uses to mislead people. Consecutively, it can be said that [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] was Deuteronomium's way of expressing their stance on the black metal movement which had at that time become very popular, with Emperor and likes being played on the Finnish metal radio program 'Metalliliitto', as the band members recall in an interview. [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] became Deuteronomium's best known song. The songs [...] "III" [...] and [...] "Northern Praise" [...] are also black metal influenced and present more worshipful lyrics, the forementioned is vocalized in Finnish and refers to the trinity of God. The latter is also a somewhat popular song as it is noted for being one of their best known songs. The self-titled song [...] "Street Corner Queen" [...] is a punk rock influenced death metal song about a prostitute, the lyrics tell that she sells love though deep inside she knows that it's not love at all, and that she seeks comfort from wrong ways. [...] "Druglord" [...] is another punk rock influenced death metal track. The lyrics are written from the perspective of a young person who suffers from drug addiction.|$|E
