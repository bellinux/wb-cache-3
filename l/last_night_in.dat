5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin.

500|$|English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> <b>in</b> Twisted River [...] "a very playful novel": it {{toyed with}} {{character}} and the [...] "fluidity of identity", suggesting that someone may [...] "perform [...] identity rather than be defined by it".

And the book cover of a wind-bent pine tree (photographed by Irving's son, Everett) is the same tree Danny and Irving see from the window of their writing shacks in Pointe au Baril Station in Ontario.|$|E
500|$|<b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> <b>in</b> Twisted River {{is a story}} {{within a}} story that shows, through Danny Angel, the {{development}} of a novelist and the writing process.

Danny and Irving's sixth books, East of Bangor and The Cider House Rules are both abortion novels set in a Maine orphanage which both later win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Danny and Irving's fiction are [...] "both autobiographical and not autobiographical at the same time", but <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> <b>in</b> Twisted River is Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
