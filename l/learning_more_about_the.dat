25|$|Hensleigh and Arad said in many {{interviews}} that Jane {{was the first}} and only actor to be asked to play the title role. Arad had previously pursued Jane for other roles in Marvel Studios films. He turned down The Punisher twice, as he did not see himself as a superhero actor. Jane said, when asked the second time to play the Punisher, that he became interested when Arad sent Tim Bradstreet's artwork of the character. After <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Punisher, he accepted. Jane went on to read as many Punisher comics he could find to understand the character, and became a fan of the Punisher in the process. Jane trained for six to seven months with the United States Navy SEALs and gained more than twenty pounds of muscle for the part.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{schools can}} have cafeterias which provide {{students}} with meals for the lowest price. They offer mostly croissants with the filling, but some have hamburgers, french fries and more. Some schools offer cooked meals, but their cost is much higher. Excursions (ekskurzija) are one- or two-day trips to places around Serbia and Europe and are organized by the particular school and only in primary and high schools. Supplementary education is carried out for students with aspirations of <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> particular subject, participate in competitions, earn scholarships and prepare for further education. Complementary education is carried out for students with bad grades. Its goals are to help students catch up with lectures, not with learning lesson only for the test, but also with remembering core part of that lesson for longer. It can also be attended by students with higher grades, especially as a preparation for the upcoming test.|$|E
500|$|In her 2009 {{study of}} the {{cultural}} and artistic reception of the bog bodies, Karin Sanders noted that she had first become interested in archaeology through reading a copy of Mosefolket in her primary school's library, near to Copenhagen. Proceeding to describe the book as [...] "a classic", she noted {{that even in the}} 21st century, it continued to offer the [...] "source book" [...] for artistic expressions of bog bodies. Proceeding to explore the influence of Glob's tome, she noted that many artists and writers had used it as a basis for <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bog bodies, to whom their works were dedicated, and that Glob himself had successfully blended an engaging narrative with archaeological information, and that he was [...] "profoundly influenced by the potentiality of interaction between fact and fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|At Herbertson's recommendation, in 1913 Crawford gained {{employment}} {{as an assistant}} on William Scoresby Routledge and Katherine Routledge's expedition to Easter Island. The expedition had the intention of <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> island's first inhabitants and its Moai statues. After the team departed from Britain aboard the schooner Mana, Crawford began quarrelling with the Routledges. Informing them that they had demonstrated an [...] "extraordinary lack of courtesy" [...] and [...] "appalling stinginess" [...] toward both him and other crew members, he left the ship at Cape Verde and returned to Britain. He then gained employment from the wealthy philanthropist Henry Wellcome, who sent him to Egypt to gain further training in archaeological excavation from G. A. Reisner. Wellcome then sent him to Sudan, where Crawford was given charge of the excavation of the Meroitic site at Abu Geili, remaining there from January to June 1914. On his return to England—where he was planning on sorting through the artefacts found in Sudan—he and his friend Earnest Hooton began excavation of a long barrow on Wexcombe Down in Wiltshire.|$|E

500|$|The team wrote each {{character}} to embody a game protagonist archetype; Michael embodies greed, Franklin ambition and Trevor insanity. Houser felt Michael and Trevor were written to juxtapose each other, with Michael [...] "like the criminal {{who wants to}} compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time" [...] and Trevor [...] "the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He considered that the three lead characters helped move the game's story into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising {{through the ranks of}} a criminal underworld. Ned Luke portrayed Michael, Shawn [...] "Solo" [...] Fonteno portrayed Franklin and Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor. Fonteno first became aware of the acting job through his friend DJ Pooh, who worked on San Andreas and was involved in Grand Theft Auto Vs music production. When Luke's agent advised him of the casting call, he initially did not want to audition for the part because it was in a video game. After reading the audition material and <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> project, he became interested. He reflected, [...] "I went immediately after reading the material from 'I'm not doing it' to 'nobody else is doing it'. It was just brilliant". During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Luke, which he felt helped secure them the roles. [...] "When [...] and I went in the room together we immediately had something", he explained. While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was not until they signed contracts that they learnt it was a Grand Theft Auto title.|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like this voice like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas was a {{freelance}} writer who submitted stories to magazines throughout the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Her friend Hervey Allen was an editor at Rinehart, responsible for the Rivers of America Series. Allen asked her to write a story about the Miami River, but Douglas did not find it very interesting, calling it only [...] "an inch long". She began <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Miami River though, and in her research, she instead suggested to her editor to write a story about the Everglades. Douglas spent five years researching the Everglades, consulting with Garald Parker of the US Geological Survey, who was studying the Everglades hydrology systems, and eventually wrote nearly 40 papers on the ecosystems in the Everglades.|$|E

2500|$|Creator Elizabeth Meriwether sees Nick, Schmidt and Winston [...] "on the weirder side of things". The {{producers}} stated <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> characters {{by seeing}} the actors' {{work and that}} [...] "We probably rely on them more than we should" [...] to define the characters. For example, the producers found more variety in Nick's character in season 1 and enjoyed Johnson's improvisations, so they relayed Coach's attributed rage issues to Nick. Nick is a childhood friend of Winston, has been best friends with Schmidt since his college days and becomes close to Jess, so his character connects the most with the other loftmates and is often part of their stories. Jake Johnson (Nick) noted the contrast to the original plans for his character, as season 1 turned Nick into [...] "an idiot, he's not keeping anyone together", {{and that he did}} not fully understand his character in season 1, partly because the character might not have figured himself out at the age of 30. Johnson felt that initially it seemed like Nick hated Schmidt for being a douchebag, but the show later teamed them up like The Odd Couple, showing their genuine friendship and simultaneous idiocy as they get into trouble. According to Johnson, he and Max Greenfield (Schmidt) [...] "couldn't be more different [...] and it's very much like Nick and Schmidt, but we both really {{get a kick out of}} the other guy" [...] on set.|$|E
2500|$|Presidents {{have also}} {{discussed}} {{the role of}} endowment, correlating a high ranking on the survey with institutional wealth. President of Muhlenberg College, Peyton Helm, argued that [...] "most of the other factors weighted by U.S. News in their rankings (in a secret formula they will not reveal, that is changed every year, and that independent researchers {{have been unable to}} replicate) are based, ultimately, on institutional wealth [...] A trustee once asked me what it would take for Muhlenberg to be ranked in the top five by U.S. News. My answer was simple: A check for $800 million placed directly in the endowment would do it -- even if we never changed another thing we were doing." [...] Helms also noted that, [...] "what you won't read in U.S. News {{is that most of the}} data they use is public information, readily available on the Web sites of most colleges and universities, as well as on the U.S. Department of Education Web site. There is no single formula for weighting these factors -- they will have different significance for different students and families. So, next year I and many other leaders of our nation's best colleges and universities will be working on a new and better Web-based tool for families engaged in the college search." [...] Millsaps College president, Frances Lucas, further noted that, [...] "she previously had paid little attention to the rankings debate because her own institution was rated highly in U.S. News. But after <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> magazine's methodology and discussing the issue with colleagues at this week's meeting, she concluded that the rankings were based too heavily on measurements determined by institutional wealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho {{states that}} {{as we continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were not like they are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E

The truth, once known to him, made him feel natural and fortified his confidence to meet the demands of an increasingly interesting position. He discovered, with a somewhat grim amusement, that a clergyman's experience in a church full of women had not been entirely useless.|$|E
