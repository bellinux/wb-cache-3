40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the low-frequency (<b>LF)</b> <b>noise</b> in submicron nMOSFETs under controlled transistor aging by hot-carrier stress. Both traditional, steady-state <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> {{as well as}} the <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> under periodic large-signal excitation were found to increase upon device degradation, for both hydrogen passivated and deuterium passivated Si–SiO 2 interfaces. As hot-carrier degradation is slower in deuterium- annealed MOSFETs, so is the increase of the noise in these devices. The noise-suppressing effect of periodic OFF switching is gradually lost during hot-carrier degradation, as the <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> under periodic large-signal excitation increases more rapidly than the <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> in steady-state...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the possible impact of low frequency magnetization fluctuations on the equivalent magnetic excess noise of GMI sensors, which we have recently shown to exhibit 1 /f noise. This noise component is not associated with the detailed measuring setup nor with the conditioning electronic noise sources, suggesting that it is intrinsic to the sensing element. Various intrinsic GMI noise sources {{might be able to}} explain this observation; these include magnetic domain wall motion, hysteresis loop losses, etc. Since GMI elements are excited by a high frequency current, it has been assumed that these low frequency (<b>lf)</b> intrinsic <b>noise</b> sources cannot interact with the carrier and the sensed signal. We recall that the GMI effect is based on an impedance variation, which is governed by magnetization angle variations. These are modulated by the sensed signal and the <b>lf</b> magnetization <b>noise,</b> which then appear as sidebands around the carrier frequency. Applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to the GMI model, we have related both the signal and noise to the magnetic susceptibility spectrum and thus quantified the equivalent magnetic noise of GMI sensors at lf.

From the <b>LF</b> drain <b>noise</b> behaviour versus gate and drain biases and temperature (90 K to 300 K), pseudomorphic devices are found to present lower drain current noise and less G-R contributions when compared to conventional HEMTs.

For a long time only a far-zone contribution of gravitational fields of the localized sources (plane-wave-front approximation) were a matter of theoretical analysis. We demonstrate how this analysis can be extended to take into account near-zone and intermediate-zone contributions as well. The formalism is used to calculate gravitational-wave corrections to the Shapiro time delay in binary pulsars and low-frequency (<b>LF)</b> pulsar timing <b>noise</b> produced by an ensemble of double stars in our galaxy. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} in The Netherlands there is an {{increasing}} attention to nuisance attributed to low frequency (<b>LF)</b> <b>noise.</b> In order to decide whether there is in practice a <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> problem and moreover to decide whether noise-reducing measures are necessary, {{there should be an}} objective criterion. Key question is whether it is possible to formulate a criterion that deals in an appropriate way with both the interests of the annoyed persons as well as the interests of the possible cause of the <b>LF</b> <b>noise.</b> There are some criteria that try to deal with the <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> problems but each criterion has its own characteristics and imperfections. Using some real cases as illustration the available criteria will be evaluated. Doing so, the requirements of an adequate assessment criterion will be discussed. One of the basic assumptions of the available criteria is the LF hearing threshold. Due to the fact that not many experimental data on hearing thresholds in the LF region are available, most of the mentioned thresholds are based on experimental data in the normal audible frequency band. The perception of <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> however differs from the perception of ‘normal sound ’ and therefore the ‘rules ’ of normal sound will not automatically apply for <b>LF</b> <b>noise.</b> It is for instance difficult to distinguish between the perception of airborne <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> and vibrations. Another difficulty of <b>LF</b> <b>noise</b> is that the perception is very individual. This hinders the make of a general criterion. 1...|$|E

40|$|Ground test {{measurements}} were {{made during the}} launches of Apollo 13 and 14 {{in an effort to}} better define the electrical characteristics of a large launch vehicle. Of particular concern was the effective electrical length of the vehicle and plume since this parameter markedly affects the likelihood of a lightning stroke being triggered by a launch during disturbed weather conditions. Since no instrumentation could be carried aboard the launch vehicle, the experiments were confined to <b>LF</b> radio <b>noise</b> and electrostatic-field measurements {{on the ground in the}} vicinity of the launch pad. The philosophy of the experiment and the instrumentation and layout are described. From the results of the experiment it is concluded that the rocket and exhaust do not produce large-scale shorting of the earth's field out to distances of thousands of feet from the launch pad. There is evidence, however, that the plume does add substantially to the electrical length of the rocket. On this basis, it was recommended that there be no relaxation of launch rules for launches during disturbed weather...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of higher}} {{harmonic}} control (HHC) of blade pitch to reduce blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise is examined {{by means of}} a rotor acoustic test. A dynamically scaled, four-bladed, articulated rotor model was tested in a heavy gas (Freon- 12) medium. Acoustic and vibration measurements were made for a large range of matched flight conditions where prescribed (open loop) HHC pitch schedules were superimposed on the normal (baseline) collective and cyclic trim pitch. A novel sound power measurement technique was developed {{to take advantage of the}} reverberance in the hard walled tunnel. Quantitative sound power results are presented for a 4 /rev (4 P) collective pitch HHC. By comparing the results using 4 P HHC to corresponding baseline (no HHC) conditions, significant midfrequency noise reductions of 5 - 6 dB are found for low-speed descent conditions where BVI is most intense. For other flight conditions, noise is found to increase with the use of HHC. <b>LF</b> loading <b>noise,</b> as well as fixed and rotating frame vibration levels, show increased levels...|$|R
40|$|Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has {{organized}} a competition {{to design a}} noise mitigating measure along the 'Polderbaan' runway. Its main goal {{is to reduce the}} low frequency (<b>LF)</b> ground <b>noise</b> from starting aircraft. The winning concept is a flexible parabolic shaped noise barrier positioned relatively close to the runway. There is a large distance between the runway and the city of Hoofddorp, so the meteorology and the ground have an important effect on the sound propagation. A numerical evaluation, using a PE model, predicts substantial attenuation for downwind conditions. For a typical downwind situation and a barrier height of 14 meters, a reduction of 6, 5 dB is expected in the 31 Hz octave band. TNO has conducted scale model experiments for comparison with the PE model results. The scale model experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel in order to account for the meteorological effects. It is concluded that the PE calculations match with the scale model results. Therefore the PE model is preferred over conventional models, which predict a substantially lower reduction, for the propagation and attenuation of ground noise in situations where meteorological effects are important...|$|R

40|$|The low {{frequency}} Schottky diode noise {{has been investigated}} in GaAs power MESFETs. For those devices, gate noise spectra are generally composed of 1 /f and shot noise contributions. We have observed an increase by two orders of magnitude of the noise level when MESFETs are submitted to rf life-test. The increase of the 1 /f noise {{can be explained by}} a modification of the gate space charge region extension. This interpretation is sustained by a reduction of the drain current transient magnitude and the inherent active trap density. A correlation is assumed between the increase of the shot noise level after rf life-test and a micro-plasma formation. Both 1 /f noise and shot noise evolution might originate in a local increase of the electric field {{in the vicinity of the}} gate in drain access region.

In the late 90 's we discovered that this noise can be reduced if you periodically switch the bias on and off.
