5|$|By 1991, {{development}} was behind schedule. Development slowed even more when <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory cancelled its {{order for the}} first machine, {{in favor of the}} C90. Several executives, including the CEO, left the company. The company then announced they would be looking for a customer that needed a smaller version of the machine, with four to eight processors.|$|E

[...] In order to investigate key aspects of the propagation, stability, and efficiency of laser energy coupling at full scale for high-gain MagLIF target designs, a single quad of NIF was used to deliver 30 kJ of energy to a target during a 13 nanosecond shaped pulse. Data return was very favorable and analysis is ongoing by scientific staff at <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> and Sandia <b>National</b> Laboratories.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1977 {{suggestion}} by Mikaélyan and {{his collaborators}} of using neutrino detection for nuclear monitoring, little work was pursued regarding implementation of the concept until researchers from the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> and Sandia <b>National</b> Laboratories constructed a prototype antineutrino detector using 0.64 ton of Gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator and placed it 25 m from {{the core of the}} San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in California. At an October 2008 meeting of the IAEA Novel Technologies group in Vienna, the results of the SONGS experiment were reviewed and found to demonstrate the potential for the approach. At that same meeting, participants in the Nucifer collaboration presented their proposal to construct a similar but improved detector. Their proposal included the results of extensive simulations illustrating the viability of the approach and is currently being evaluated by that body as a potential safeguard against nuclear weapons proliferation.|$|R
5|$|Ernest Orlando Lawrence (August 8, 1901– August 27, 1958) was a {{pioneering}} American nuclear scientist and {{winner of the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron. He {{is known for his}} work on uranium-isotope separation for the Manhattan Project, as well as for founding the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The culmination of this was working on the Ivy Mike nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|The launch customer, <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory, {{cancelled}} {{their order}} in 1991 {{and a number}} of company executives left shortly thereafter. The first machine was finally ready in 1993, but with no launch customer, it was instead loaned as a demonstration unit to the nearby National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. The company went bankrupt in May 1995, and the machine was officially decommissioned.|$|E
40|$|The BioBriefcase is an {{integrated}} briefcase-sized aerosol {{collection and analysis}} system for autonomous monitoring of the environment, which is currently being jointly developed by <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> and Sandia <b>National</b> Laboratories. This poster presents results from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) module of the system. The DNA must be purified after exiting the aerosol collector to prevent inhibition of the enzymatic reaction. Traditional solid-phase extraction results in a large loss of sample. In this flow-through system, we perform sample purification, concentration and amplification in one reactor, which minimizes the loss of material. The sample from the aerosol collector is mixed with a denaturation solution prior to flowing through a capillary packed with silica beads. The DNA adheres to the silica beads allowing the environmental contaminants to be flushed to waste while effectively concentrating the DNA on the silica matrix. The adhered DNA is amplified while {{on the surface of}} the silica beads, resulting in a lower limit of detection than an equivalent eluted sample. Thus, this system is beneficial since more DNA is available for amplification, less reagents are utilized, and contamination risks are reduced...|$|R

5|$|A 22milligram {{batch of}} berkelium-249 was {{prepared}} in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of tennessine at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days.

5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet. Brady claimed {{that they could have}} been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
5|$|ORNL resumed {{californium}} {{production in}} spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart {{during the summer}} and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium. During a September 2008 symposium at Vanderbilt (in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.) celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, he introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt; the team at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California, U.S., was soon invited to join.|$|E

5|$|The first {{decay of}} atoms of {{oganesson}} {{was observed in}} 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included American scientists of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory, California. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected {{a total of three}} (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project, {{developing}} the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and later as one of its commissioners. He was a consultant to a number of organizations, including the United States Air Force, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory. Along with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, and others, he worked out key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University {{aspires to}} become a top twenty-five public {{research}} university with at least one-third of its PhD programs {{ranked in the top}} 15 nationally.

5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later in 1974, {{researchers}} including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of 0.9±0.2seconds. The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The cross-section of the reaction observed, 0.3nanobarns, also agreed well with theoretical predictions. These bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium-263m.|$|E
