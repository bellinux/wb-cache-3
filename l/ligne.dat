5|$|To their left, the Union Brigade {{suddenly}} {{swept through}} the infantry lines, giving rise to the legend {{that some of the}} 92nd Gordon Highland Regiment clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge. From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th <b>Ligne.</b> The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, 45th <b>Ligne,</b> as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry. The Greys captured the eagle of the 45th <b>Ligne</b> and overwhelmed Grenier's brigade. These would be the only two French eagles captured by the British during the battle. On Wellington's extreme left, Durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.|$|E
5|$|D'Erlon's men {{ascended the}} slope and {{advanced}} on the sunken road, Chemin d'Ohain, that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined {{on both sides}} by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On {{the right of the}} French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the 45e Régiment de <b>Ligne</b> and followed by the 25e Régiment de <b>Ligne,</b> somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the 21e and 45e regiments. Opposing them {{on the other side of}} the road was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, the 92nd Gordons and the 44th Foot totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous <b>ligne</b> claire of Hergé. Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in {{two parts of the}} legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the button}} depends on its use. Shirt buttons are {{generally}} small, and spaced close together, whereas coat buttons are larger and spaced further apart. Buttons are commonly measured in <b>lignes</b> (also called lines and abbreviated L), with 40 <b>lignes</b> equal to 1 inch. For example, some standard sizes of buttons are 16 <b>lignes</b> (10.16 mm, standard button of men's shirts) and 32 <b>lignes</b> (20.32 mm, typical button on suit jackets).|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{standards}} were peculiar {{to a particular}} city, especially in Germany (which, before German Unification in 1871, consisted of many kingdoms, principalities, free cities and so on). In many cases {{the length of the}} unit was not uniquely fixed: for example, the English foot was stated as 11 pouces 2.6 <b>lignes</b> (French inches and lines) by Picard, 11 pouces 3.11 <b>lignes</b> by Maskelyne and 11 pouces 3 <b>lignes</b> by D'Alembert.|$|R
50|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Méchain and Delambre's result (443.296 <b>lignes)</b> was slightly too short for the meridianal definition of the metre. Arago and Biot extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806-1809, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31 lignes: later work increased the value to 443.39 <b>lignes.</b> The modern value, for the WGS 84 reference spheroid, is 1.000 196 57 m or 443.383 08 <b>lignes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dunkerque and Strasbourg {{formed the}} French Navy's 1ère Division de <b>Ligne</b> (1st Division of the Line) {{prior to the}} Second World War. The two ships searched for German {{commerce}} raiders {{in the early months}} of the war, and Dunkerque also participated in convoy escort duties. The ship was badly damaged during the British attack at Mers-el-Kébir after the Armistice that ended the first phase of France's participation in World War II, but she was refloated and partially repaired to return to Toulon for comprehensive repairs. Dunkerque was scuttled in November 1942 to prevent her capture by the Germans, and subsequently seized and partially scrapped by the Italians and later the Germans. Her wreck remained in Toulon until she was stricken in 1955, and scrapped three years later.|$|E
5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e <b>Ligne</b> burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
25|$|Lines 1 and 4 were {{conceived}} as central east-west and north-south lines. Two lines, <b>ligne</b> 2 Nord (line 2 North) and <b>ligne</b> 2 Sud (line 2 South), were also planned but line 2 South was merged with line5 in 1906.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the trend}} toward {{thinning}} the parcels was not universal. The vertical logic imposed by the formula of the East India Company was not immutable and rather quickly, {{in order to deal}} with demographic pressure, there started to appear horizontal boundaries cutting the original strips into several plots situated one above the other. In 1732, the surveyor Durongoüet was tasked with tracing four surveyors' lines parallel to the shore, at altitudes of 100, 200, 400 and 600 m. These lines, which correspond to the topographic notion of level curves, are still visible today, especially above the centre of Saint-Pierre, in the southern part of the island. Today these are navigable roads lined with houses that form evocatively named towns away from the centre: <b>Ligne</b> Paradis at around 100 m altitude, <b>Ligne</b> des Bambous at about 200 m, <b>Ligne</b> des Quatre-cents ("Line of the Four Hundreds") a little further and <b>Ligne</b> des Six-cents ("Line of the Six Hundreds") right at the top.|$|E

25|$|The RER plan {{initially}} {{included one}} east-west line and two north-south lines. RATP bought two unprofitable SNCF lines—the <b>Ligne</b> de Saint-Germain (westbound) and the <b>Ligne</b> de Vincennes (eastbound) {{with the intention}} of joining them and to serve multiple districts of central Paris with new underground stations. The new line created by this merger became lineA. The <b>Ligne</b> de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the SNCF and reach the new Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. This became lineB. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed all the most optimistic forecasts to the extent that line A is the most used urban rail line in the world with nearly 300million journeys a year.|$|E
