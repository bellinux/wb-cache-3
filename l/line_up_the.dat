5|$|The {{original}} Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation decoder wheel. After the title screen, a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line. The player was required to use the decoder wheel to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pictures, then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.|$|E

25|$|Dare is {{the third}} studio album from the Human League but differs greatly from their {{previous}} two, Reproduction and Travelogue. This {{is due to a}} split in the original <b>line</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> subsequent reformation of the band with new personnel and the difference in musical style under Philip Oakey's direction.|$|E
50|$|A {{nautical}} {{measured mile}} is a nautical mile which {{is marked by}} two pairs of towers. A mile is measure by sailing on a given bearing and <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pairs of towers. The start of the mile is recorded when the first pair of towers <b>line</b> <b>up</b> and <b>the</b> end of the mile recorded when <b>the</b> second pair <b>line</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the pro set places the backs offset toward one side (either strong or weak). This look is almost universally used with one fullback one halfback. <b>The</b> backs <b>line</b> <b>up</b> closer to <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage than in a standard pro set, about 3 yards deep. <b>The</b> fullback <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> directly behind <b>the</b> quarterback, in the spot he would normally <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> I-Formation. <b>The</b> halfback then <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> behind either <b>the</b> left or right tackle.|$|R

25|$|Kennedy {{called the}} congressional leaders to the White House in late October, 1963 to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{necessary}} {{votes in the}} House for passage. The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963, and referred to the Rules Committee, whose chairman, Howard W. Smith, a Democrat and avid segregationist from Virginia, indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Extensions to {{the line}} were {{proposed}} {{on a number of}} occasions, none of which saw any progress. Parliamentary authority was granted for a scheme in 1847, before the line was opened, which was costed at Â£56,000, however the powers lapsed in 1852 without any progress. One proposal was to extend the <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Holme Valley, tunnel under Holme Moss, and connect with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.|$|E
25|$|The cotton {{comes off}} of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine {{consists}} mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine {{in the form of}} a sliver; a large rope of fibres.|$|E
5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before <b>the</b> team <b>lines</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> quarterback <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> behind <b>the</b> center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|R
5000|$|Making the {{practice}} of a receiver declared ineligible <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> slot formation illegal; ineligible receivers must <b>line</b> <b>up</b> inside <b>the</b> tackle box. This {{was in response to}} the New England Patriots using this tactic in the 2014-15 NFL playoffs against the Baltimore Ravens.|$|R
50|$|If, for example, {{eight men}} <b>line</b> <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage, the team loses an {{eligible}} receiver. This can often happen when a flanker or slot receiver, {{who is supposed}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage, instead <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage between the offensive line and a split end. In most cases where a pass is caught by an ineligible receiver, it is usually because the quarterback was under pressure and threw it to an offensive lineman out of desperation.|$|R
25|$|The {{most famous}} semi-final came {{the next week}} against arch-rivals Parramatta Eels with Pay, Dymock, Smith and McCracken in their <b>line</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> Eels led 18-2 with 11 minutes {{remaining}} before Craig Polla-Mounter inspired a comeback. Canterbury scored three tries {{in the period of}} seven minutes to bring it back to 18-16 with Daryl Halligan landing a sideline goal to level up the scores before Polla-Mounter nearly snatched a win in regular time with a heart-stopping field goal just falling under the cross-bar. The Bulldogs got a 32-20 victory.|$|E
25|$|The Rimutaka Incline was difficult, {{costly and}} {{time-consuming}} to operate, {{but as the}} Wairarapa Line had become a secondary route since the acquisition of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway in 1908, its replacement was not a priority. Various alternate systems and routes were debated, with a tunnel chosen in 1936. However, the economic conditions left from the Great Depression followed by the impact of World War II meant that work on the tunnel did not start until 1948. The Incline and the <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{western side of the}} Rimutakas closed on 29 October 1955 and the tunnel opened on 3 November 1955.|$|E
25|$|Circles and squares {{form the}} unifying theme of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, from floor to ceiling, is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not <b>line</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Route6 remains {{parallel}} {{to the north of}} the freeway as I-84 begins an immediate climb away from the state <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Shawangunk Ridge, beginning an east-northeast slant in its direction that will continue for almost 30 miles (48km). The roadway crests at , its highest elevation in New York. Scenic overlooks on either side allow travelers to stop and take in the expansive view of Port Jervis, the lower Neversink valley and adjacent regions of Pennsylvania. On the descent, Route6 crosses under the interstate again, reachable by a short drive south on Mountain Road at exit2.|$|E
25|$|Often an {{incomplete}} cleft lip requires the same surgery as complete cleft. This {{is done for}} two reasons. Firstly the group of muscles required to purse the lips run through the upper lip. In order to restore the complete group a full incision must be made. Secondly, to create a less obvious scar the surgeon tries to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> scar with the natural lines in the upper lip (such as {{the edges of the}} philtrum) and tuck away stitches as far up the nose as possible. Incomplete cleft gives the surgeon more tissue to work with, creating a more supple and natural-looking upper lip.|$|E
25|$|Today, Aristotelous Square {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous places in all of Greece and almost synonymous with the city of Thessaloniki itself. The square plays an {{important}} role in the sociopolitical life not only of the city, but of the wider country as well. Numerous large rallies and political speeches have been organized in Aristotelous Square, such as the rally for Macedonia in 1992 (see further below). Additionally the square is used for many cultural events, such as festivals and the annual Christmas and carnival celebrations. It is an important tourist attraction for the city, and the numerous cafes and bars that <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> square make it popular with the younger generations.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB {{conducted}} a full {{investigation of the}} accident. It found that although the aircraft had encountered a crosswind during landing, the conditions were well within the safe capabilities of the aircraft. However, {{it was discovered that}} the first officer did not properly <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> plane before touchdown, nor did she slow the plane adequately before touchdown, so that the plane came down excessively hard. As the plane came down, due to the crosswind, the right wing suddenly lowered approximately six degrees. This was beyond the design capabilities for the right main landing gear, and it snapped as a result. The NTSB also cited the captain for failing to check the work of the first officer.|$|E
25|$|Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein {{shook up}} {{the team at}} the MLB trading {{deadline}} July 31, trading the team's wildly popular yet often hurt and disgruntled shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, to the Chicago Cubs, receiving Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins in return. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox also traded AAA outfielder Henri Stanley to the Los Angeles Dodgers for center fielder Dave Roberts. With valuable players like Cabrera, Mientkiewicz, and Roberts in the <b>line</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> club turned things around, winning twenty-two out of twenty-five games and going on to finish within three games of the Yankees in the AL East and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.|$|E
25|$|For simplicity, {{consider}} only {{numbers with}} three digits or fewer. To add {{a pair of}} numbers (written in Arabic numerals), write the second number under the first one, so that digits line up in columns: the rightmost column will contain the ones-digit of the second number under the ones-digit of the first number. This rightmost column is the ones-column. The column immediately to its left is the tens-column. The tens-column will have the tens-digit of the second number (if it has one) under the tens-digit of the first number (if it has one). The column immediately {{to the left of}} the tens-column is the hundreds-column. The hundreds-column will <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hundreds-digit of the second number (if there is one) under the hundreds-digit of the first number (if there is one).|$|E

25|$|Wagner's and Harker's men started {{climbing}} {{soon after}} Wood's brigades. Wagner got halfway up before {{he received an}} order {{that he was to}} stop {{at the base of the}} ridge. He ordered his men to pull back. As they did, they suffered heavy losses from the elated Confederate defenders. Wagner's brigade suffered more casualties, around 22%, than any other brigade in the assault. When Wagner and some of Harker's men returned to the rifle pits they saw that Wood's division on their left and units of their own division on the right were still moving uphill. Disgusted that a rival division was getting ahead, Wagner sent his second <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ridge. Sheridan soon ordered Harker back up also. To their right, Francis Sherman's brigade faced an entrenched line about one-half of the way up the ridge and had hard going. On the far right, Johnson's two brigades faced determined resistance at the rifle pits and were slow in starting up the ridge.|$|E
25|$|The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems â Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) {{defines a}} {{singularity}} as âa condition {{caused by the}} collinear alignment {{of two or more}} robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.â It is most common in robot arms that utilize a âtriple-roll wristâ. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robotâs wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to <b>line</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180Â° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a âwrist flipâ. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robotâs path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robotâs travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.|$|E
25|$|Colin Cowdrey {{arrived in}} Perth with {{the wives of}} the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a {{practice}} match and he was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia matching {{the record of the}} Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs. Frank Tyson, who had played with Cowdrey in the 1954-55 Ashes series and now commentating for the ABC was jokingly asked by fans if he would be recalled as well. The tour selectors were limited by the hand injuries to John Edrich and Dennis Amiss, but David Lloyd's finger had mended and he was called up to open the innings. Fletcher had a numb forearm after being hit by a Lillee bouncer in Brisbane and again by Alan Smith in the nets and was 'absent hurt' in the match against Western Australia, but had now recovered and kept his place. Peter Lever had a side strain and Mike Hendrick a fever and they were replaced by Chris Old and Geoff Arnold. More surprisingly Derek Underwood was replaced by the veteran Fred Titmus. Underwood had bowled some excellent balls in the First Test, but the WACA was a fast, true pitch with little turn and Titmus's ability to flight the ball was seen as an advantage, and his all-round ability would strengthen the fragile batting <b>line</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> task of the Australian selectors was easier as they kept the same XI from Brisbane, but exchanged the twelfth man Kerry O'Keeffe for the off-spinner Ashley Mallett. Like Titmus Mallett was able to flight the ball, so Terry Jenner was made twelfth man and Mallett played. Ian Chappell won the toss and took the extraordinary decision to field, believing that the England batsmen were still demoralised from their experience at Brisbane and that a dose of fast bowling on the quickest pitch in Australia might break them. Also there was some moisture in the air which would help his swing bowlers. Only twice had a captain put the opposition into bat and won in Australia, Johnny Douglas in the Fourth Test of the 1911â12 Ashes series and Richie Benaud in the Fifth Test of the 1958â59 Ashes series, both at the MCG.|$|E
