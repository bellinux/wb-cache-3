50|$|List of {{features}} of the Rapid Spaceback includes an optional false boot floor added. The false floor reduces the height difference between the <b>loading</b> <b>sill</b> and the boot floor and eliminates the step created when the rear seat backs are folded down. There is hidden storage space of up to 135 mm under the false boot floor.|$|E
50|$|The main {{structural}} component is an integrated welded steel main bean and floor, with <b>load</b> bearing side <b>sills.</b> The side walls are of corrugated metal, and {{the roof of}} the locomotive is removable. The structure is designed for loads of 3600 kN in tension and 2500 kN in compression. The couplers are designed for up to 4000 kN force.|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands {{are mostly}} {{influenced}} by storm surges and {{the occurrence of}} these surge waves havepromoted hydraulic research. Especially, the 1953 storm surge resulted {{in the decision to}} close off a num-ber of tidal branches in the South-West of the Netherlands: the DELTAPLAN. The least and most diffi-cult closure of the Oosterschelde in the Deltaplan is presented in this lecture, and a large number ofresearch subjects for the design of the storm surge barrier are explained: design philosophy, boundaryconditions, discharge capacity, foundation, wave <b>loads,</b> gate vibrations, <b>sill</b> stability, local scour, bed protec-tion, sedimentation and operations during construction...|$|R
40|$|An {{airtight}} {{building envelope}} {{is crucial in}} order to achieve an energy efficient building. Norwegian airtightness requirements have recently become stricter, leading to an increased interest in methods for ensuring airtight building envelopes. The joint between the basement wall and the wood frame wall is one of several key areas in this regard. This article discusses the air leakages associated with this joint, based on laboratory measurements done on a fullscale model. The results show that the shape of the basement wall top surface has a considerable impact on the airleakage, a planer surface generally leading to less air leakage. The <b>load</b> on the <b>sill</b> plate has little impact on the airtightness. Sealing materials have widely differing airtightness properties, malleable sealing materials giving better results than non-malleable ones. </p...|$|R
