5|$|In 1943–1944, the {{battalion}} fought in New Guinea, conducting an amphibious landing {{as part of}} operations to capture Lae in early September {{at the end of}} the Salamaua–Lae campaign, before participating in the follow-up <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> the Huon Peninsula as Japanese forces withdrew inland from Lae. In early 1944, {{the battalion}} was withdrawn to Australia for rest and reorganisation and a long period of inactivity followed before it returned to combat. Its final campaign came late in the war when it was committed to the fighting in Borneo in June 1945, <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> Brunei. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in early 1946.|$|E

5|$|There is an ‘occasional’ {{anchorage}} in Mingulay Bay {{sheltered from}} westerly winds. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> the beach {{may be difficult}} {{as there is a}} regular heavy swell and approaching the old landing place at Aneir may be easier. There is also a landing place at Skipisdale.|$|E
5|$|A {{positive}} {{development for the}} Allies during this time was the appearance of another Spanish force in the region. The Spanish Regency at Cádiz had sent General Joaquín Blake, with the two divisions of Zayas and Lardizábal, by sea to Ayamonte on {{the mouth of the}} Guadiana. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> 18 April, Blake's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the Spanish town of Xeres.|$|E

5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> the edge of Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the first}} stage of the Australian take over, Brigadier Raymond Sandover's 6th Brigade was {{directed}} to secure the Jacquinot Bay area. While the region was believed to be undefended, the initial landing was conducted by a combat-ready force comprising the reinforced Australian 14th/32nd Battalion protected by warships and with aircraft on standby. As expected, there was no opposition to the <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 4 November and work soon began on logistics facilities.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{landings}} on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> nearby Guadalcanal, with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E
