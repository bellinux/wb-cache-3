50|$|Some vehicle {{recovery}} tow trucks have flat beds {{and are able}} to winch a recovered vehicle entirely on board. They can then drive the vehicle away for repair without needing to tow it. This allows a faster journey, does not require a driver in the vehicle being towed, and allows a damaged vehicle to be recovered when it cannot be towed. As these flat beds usually slope gradually to the rear, unlike the level bed of a cargo flatbed, they are known as 'beavertails'. Some tow truck beds are demountable and may be lowered behind the truck for easy loading, then both bed and <b>load</b> <b>winched</b> back aboard as one.|$|R

5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy <b>loads.</b> One <b>winch</b> was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During <b>loading</b> operations, the <b>winches</b> were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|R

50|$|Battery {{isolators}} {{are commonly}} used on recreational vehicles, boats, utility vehicles, airplanes, and large trucks where one battery is dedicated to starting and running the engine and another battery or batteries run accessory <b>loads</b> (e.g., <b>winches,</b> radar, instruments, etc.). A battery isolator helps {{to ensure that the}} starting battery has sufficient power to start the engine and recharge the batteries if, for example, loads on the auxiliary battery (e.g., refrigerator or navigation lights) cause it to be drained, or if an auxiliary battery fails. Isolators are also used in vehicles with large, high-power car stereos and off road vehicles to accommodate high current loads such as a recovery winch.|$|R
50|$|Under good conditions, {{the ship}} could reach {{a speed of}} 20 kn. Her best 24-hour runs were 392 nm in 1908 on her voyage to Japan and 426 nm in 1904 in the South Pacific. The Preußen was manned by a crew of 45, which was {{supported}} by two steam engines powering the pumps, the rudder steering engine, the <b>loading</b> gear, and <b>winches.</b> English seamen estimate her the fastest sailing ship after the clipper era, even faster than her fleet sister Potosí. Only a few clippers were faster than Preußen, and they had considerably less cargo capacity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{nonlinear}} model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for a winch servo motor to overcome the sudden peak tension in the lifting wire caused by a lumped-mass payload {{at the beginning of}} a lifting off or a lowering operation. The crane-wire-payload system is modeled in 3 degrees of freedom with the Newton-Euler approach. Direct multiple shooting and real-time iteration (RTI) scheme are employed to provide feedback control input to the winch servo. Simulations are implemented with MATLAB and CaSADi toolkit. By well tuning the weighting matrices, the NMPC controller can reduce the snatch loads in the lifting wire and the <b>winch</b> <b>loads</b> simultaneously. A comparative study with a PID controller is conducted to verify its performance...|$|R
50|$|On {{arrival of}} the train {{at one of the}} {{approximately}} 60 different dumping grounds, a three-ton steel plow was put on the last car (or a car carrying the plow was attached as the last car) and a huge winch with a braided steel cable stretching the length of all cars was attached to the engine. The winch, powered by the train’s steam engine, pulled the plow the length of the dirt <b>loaded</b> train by <b>winching</b> up the steel cable. The plow scraped the dirt off the railroad cars, allowing the entire trainload of dirt cars to be unloaded in ten minutes or less. The plow and winch were then detached for use on another train. Another plow, mounted on a steam engine, then plowed the dirt spoils away from the track.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to consider roads network quantity by reviewing the effective factors and finally determining the optimal road density. Sangdeh forests of Farim Wood Company were selected for {{this research}} that located at Savadkouh region of Mazandaran province (in Iran). In this research it is assumed that the effective factors in costs can be determined by using the mathematical model, {{as well as by the}} help of graphical model, less costs of skidding and road construction can be obtained; therefore, optimal road density can be evaluated. Harvesting methods, different types of roads, the ratio of each road to the whole network, stand per hectare, slope, geological conditions, presence of sand mine for constructing surface of roads, capital interest rate, wood exit costs, type of skidding or yarding machinery, slope and length correction coefficient, routes, type and number of <b>load,</b> allowable <b>winching</b> distance, brush and underbrush, condition of the roots, silvicultural methods (cutting form), regional soil, regional height, direction of the slope and morphology of the forest are factors which have been mentioned in this research as affecting determination of roads network density. For this, the model of evaluation and calculation of the time of skidder movement, which determines the skidding costs under the existing conditions in Sangdeh Forest, is as follows: Y = - 25. 05 + 1. 20 X. For the forest region of Sangdeh with 353 cubic meters stand per hectare and skidding in contract method, the roads network density is 23 m in hectare and for skidding by the company, the roads network density is 19 meters in hectare; these numbers are the optimal ones...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{which are the}} most important characters governing mechanical resistance to rockfall and wind <b>loading,</b> static <b>winching</b> tests were carried out on three tree species: Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.),European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) in a mixed forest stand. Trees were winched to an angle of 0. 25 ° at the stem base, both up- and downhill in order to compare how the same individual reacts when tested in two different directions. Trees were then winched to failure. Strain gauges were attached to the stem and one up- and downhill lateral root {{in order to determine the}} distribution of strain within the tree during overturning. Root morphology was then measured for all trees which uprooted during failure. No significant differences were found in the force necessary to winch trees up- and downhill in any species, either to an angle of 0. 25 ° or to failure. Strain was significantly higher in lateral roots of Silver fir than in roots of Norway spruce and European beech when winched downhill. Downhill roots of Norway spruce were largely held in tension when trees were pulled downhill, whereas in Silver fir and European beech, they were held in compression. When trees were pulled uphill, no significant differences were found between species, and strain decreased along the lateral root of downhill roots only. European beech possessed a significantly greater number of roots than either Norway spruce or Silver fir. Norway spruce possessed a higher proportion of total root length near the soil surface, whereas European beech had the greatest proportion in the intermediate depth class and Silver fir had the highest maximal root depth. Norway spruce had a significantly lower proportion of oblique roots than the other two species, resulting in a plate-like root system which was less resistant to overturning than Silver fir or European beech...|$|R
40|$|Log {{bunching}} with winches {{is still}} popular in small scale forest operations, and where machine traffic {{is confined to}} widely spaced designated trails. Like all tree handling methods, winching has a potential to incur residual stand damage, especially when harvested trees need to be moved around a dense residual stand. Snatch blocks are special pulleys designed for changing the pulling direction, in order to maneuver the <b>winch</b> <b>load</b> around obstacles. This study was aimed at determining the effect of using a snatch block on stand damage and work productivity. Using a snatch block allowed reducing by one quarter the frequency of wounded trees, which dropped from 50 % to 36 %. The snatch block was especially effective in preventing damage to dominant trees. No significant difference was recorded for wound size and wound severity. Survival of advance regeneration was significantly higher when using a snatch block. When no block was used, {{almost half of the}} saplings were lost. In contrast, only one sapling out of four was lost when using a snatch block. Using a snatch block did not cause any significant change of work productivity. Lower incidence of hang-up delays and faster pulling fully offset the time required to rig the snatch block. The study did not include ergonomics, and could not indicate how operator workload was affected by adding the weight of a snatch block to that of the cable and chain rigging. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|This thesis {{contain the}} process of {{creating}} a modular and mechanical landmine clearing tool for NMBU`s agricultural robot, Thorvald 2. In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A <b>winch</b> lifts the <b>load</b> up and keeps it in the air. A clutch disconnects the drum {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a pulley wheel at the top. The scaffold and the pulley wheel are designed and placed so that the pulley wheel is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the <b>load</b> and the <b>winch</b> via the pulley wheel. The clutch is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox. Simulations done by FFI gives reason for optimism for the continuation of the project. A prototype is yet to be completed...|$|R
