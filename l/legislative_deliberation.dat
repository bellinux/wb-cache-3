5000|$|The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 may be {{the only}} recent federal Indian {{legislation}} that was, at all stages of <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberation,</b> supported by Indians. [...] This law required that only Indians be allowed to market their handicrafts as “Indian made” and be sold at Indian crafts fairs. This was to halt the economic loss to Indians due to questionable and fraudulent claims of this sort, which was estimated between $400 and $800 million a year. In the Act, Indian was described as “any individual {{who is a member of}} an Indian tribe; or for the purpose of this section is certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian tribe.” An Indian tribe was defined more broadly than just to tribes with federal recognition, but also to “any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.” [...] The broadness sought in part to protect the civil liberties of those who have Indian heritage and culture, but are not tribal members. However, the definition was not broad enough to avoid disallowing many artists whose Indian background was not in doubt, including well-known Cherokee painter, Bert Seabourn.|$|E

40|$|Legislative {{lawsuits}} are a recurring by-product of divided government. Yet the Supreme Court has never definitively resolved whether Congress may sue {{the executive branch}} over its execution of the law. Some scholars argue that Congress {{should be able to}} establish Article III standing when its interests are harmed by executive action or inaction just like private parties. Others, including most prominently the late Justice Antonin Scalia, argue that intergovernmental disputes do not constitute Article III “cases” or “controversies” at all. Rather, the Framers envisioned the political branches resolving their differences through nonjudicial means. This Article proposes a different approach to congressional lawsuits loosely derived from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s majority opinion in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission and the “equitable discretion” doctrine once utilized in the D. C. Circuit. Under what this Article terms the “Legislative Exhaustion” principle, Congress would be barred from federal court whenever it has nonjudicial means to obtain the remedy it seeks against the Executive. Conversely, when Congress has no way to directly overrule the Executive, such as when the Executive refuses to enforce a law based on constitutional objections, federal courts could resolve the constitutional dispute. Not only is such an exhaustion principle consistent with prudential doctrines, preserving judicial resources for cases that demand adjudication, but it also encourages the most important normative benefit the Framers hoped to achieve from interbranch disputes—namely, enhanced <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberation</b> concerning the merits of government policy. Thus, there is no single answer to whether Congress may sue the Executive. Rather, it depends {{on the nature of the}} claim and the nonjudicial remedies available to Congress...|$|E

40|$|Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Secretary of Labor is {{authorized}} to issue whatever standards are "reasonably necessary or appropriate" to provide safe or healthful places of employment. More {{than any other}} provision in federal regulatory law, this language is subject to a plausible nondelegation challenge, {{because it seems to}} ask the Secretary to choose among a wide array of "intelligible principles" for standard-setting. The constitutional challenge raises serious and unresolved questions for both regulatory policy and administrative law. In answering those questions, courts have three principal alternatives. The most aggressive approach would be to invalidate the statute in the hopes of encouraging, for the first time, sustained <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberation</b> about the proper content of occupational safety and health policy. The most modest approach, rooted in the Avoidance Canon, would be to construe the statutory language to produce floors and ceilings on agency action; that approach would require the Secretary to ban significant risks while forbidding the Secretary from regulating trivial or de minimis risks and also requiring the Secretary to show that any regulations are "feasible. " The third and preferable approach, also rooted in the Avoidance Canon, would be to construe the statute so as to require the agency to engage in a form of cost-benefit balancing. Such a construction would have the advantage of promoting greater transparency and accountability at the agency level. At the same time, it would raise difficult questions about the precise nature of such balancing in the context of occupational safety policy and also about legal constraints on agency assessment of both costs and benefits. Because of the distinctive nature of workplace safety, the best approach would give the agency considerable flexibility on questions of valuation while also permitting serious attention to distributional factors. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} global {{diffusion of}} formal democracy has gone {{hand in hand}} with the hollowing out of its substance. Ever more realms of domestic public policy are removed from the purview of national <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberation</b> and insulated from popular scrutiny. Rhetoric of accountability has accompanied the increasing unaccountability of international financial and trade organizations, transnational corporations as well as of states and NGOs. The new architecture of global governance characterized by legal plurality and overlapping sovereignties has facilitated a game of ‘passing the blame’ among these four actors. There is a curious ambivalence in current debates on globalization about the role of the state, which is conceived of as both central and marginal. Globalization is seen to be marked by the decline of both the external and the internal sovereignty of the state. Contrary to such a view, it will be argued here that the state is both an agent and an object of globalization. Although inadequate, the state remains indispensable as its laws and policies play a key role in transposing neo-liberal agendas to the national and local levels. If in the age of globalization and of economic Empire, political violence has been replaced by legal violence, resistance to it is also articulated in the language of law. This paper focuses on the dynamic of legal politics against impoverishment and dispossession caused by the new global designs of intellectual property protection, biodiversity conservation and privatization of the commons in India. The case studies in this paper point to the emergence of intertwined structures of rule, overlapping sovereignties and complex processes of legal transnationalization that have reconfigured the relations between law, state, and territoriality. If welfare states were concerned with the redistribution of risk and resources, cunning states seek to redistribute responsibility. Sensitivity to the history of colonialism would be an important corrective to the presentism and Westerncentrism of analyses of (legal) globalization...|$|E

40|$|This article {{adopts a}} novel {{separation}} of powers framework to analyze the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decisions under the Commerce Clause and Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. We demonstrate in historical terms how the Court 2 ̆ 7 s methods for assessing the constitutional adequacy of federal laws have changed dramatically since the mid- 1990 s, and we argue that these new methods are undermining {{the proper role of}} Congress and producing a significant shift in the balance of power between the Branches. We identify two distinct methodologies employed by the Rehnquist Court that have resulted in growing disrespect for Congress - the 2 ̆ 2 crystal ball 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 phantom legislative history 2 ̆ 2 approaches. Under the crystal ball approach, the Court has effectively penalized the enacting Congress for having failed to create a detailed legislative record, even though such a record requirement could not reasonably have been anticipated at the moment of <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberation</b> and enactment. Under the phantom legislative history approach, the Court has expressed interest in considering legislative history when assessing constitutionality, but then has established and applied a legal standard for review that even a detailed legislative record could not possibly satisfy. In Part I, we trace the development of this recent judicial activism in which disrespect for Congress is a fundamental element. In Part II, we describe the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents and United States v. Morrison as examples of the crystal ball approach, and discuss the implications of this methodology for the internal operations of Congress and for the exercise of federal legislative powers. In Part III, we consider Kimel and Morrison as also illustrating the phantom legislative history approach and discuss the significant implications of this methodology for the relationship between the courts and Congress. Finally, in Part IV we invoke these two methods to help explain the contrast between the Court 2 ̆ 7 s asserted interest in legislative recordbuilding in the constitutional law setting and its simultaneous disdain for legislative history when construing statutes in nonconstitutional settings. Part IV also addresses how the Court 2 ̆ 7 s legislative history approach, especially in the Section Five area, may actually threaten traditional federalism objectives regarding the role of Congress...|$|E
40|$|What {{kinds of}} {{information}} do state legislators consider in their <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations?</b> This article examines four dimensions {{of the content of}} the written information state representatives in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Oregon used in 1989 : whether it was policy or political information, one-sided or multisided, in agreement or disagreement with the position of the legislator using it, and whether it had any hard or soft scientific content. Legislators are found to use information heavily dosed with political preferences, and they tend to look only at one side of an issue- the one with which they agree. However, they also use a substantial amount of scientific information. It is useful to think of lawmaking in the United States as an &dquo;infor-mation processing system&dquo; (Porter 1974, 704). In a state legislature’s production of law, its input is not steel, wood, or chemicals but rather information about who is in favor of banning Aldicarb, how &dquo;Learn-fare&dquo; works in a neighboring state, or how many prisoners can live safely in a 8 ft by 10 ft cell.

This paper aims to clarify the characteristics of actual mechanism of Japan’s Diet {{in terms of both}} institutional settings and facts about legislative activities by making comparison both with French national parliament and Kochi prefectural parliament. The arguments of this paper can be summarized in three points. Firstly, in both national Diet and Kochi parliament, the activities and functions of plenary sessions have become extremely weak. One especially salient fact is the total lack of clause by clause type of <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations,</b> which are the universal norm of western democracies including France. Second argument is that in Japan’s two cases question-and-answer style is almost the only pattern within the legislative procedures, and discussions between parliamentarians are lacking, which in French case are normally carried out through amendment activities. Finally, despite the similarities, Japan’s national Diet has one very significant characteristics unseen in local parliament.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In October 1989, the Texas Public School System came under fire. At issue was the method of financing the public schools. Because Texas's school finance system relied heavily on locally levied property taxes, tax rates and financial resources varied across districts as widely as did the property values. The Supreme Court of Texas' decision in Edgewood v. Kirby set the agenda for education policy in Texas, as it ordered the Texas Legislature to find a new, more equitable way of financing Texas' public schools. This decision caused vehement debate and prolonged negotiations, as the Legislature struggled to reach a consensus on an alternative finance system that would satisfy the Court. This thesis examines the judicial and <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations</b> starting with Edgewood I in 1989 and going through to 1994, when the Supreme Court, in Edgewood IV, ruled the Legislature's third attempt at reform a success.

Consequently, this compromise is often a major source of law in democratic countries. But what exactly does it mean “to reach a compromise” and, more impor- tantly, how does this phenomenon affect the quality of the regulations issued by a democratic body? Do the regulations issued as a result of compromise differ importantly from those resulting of a unanimous deci- sion? And if so, is the difference perceivable only at a purely linguistic level or does it entail further consequences? Shall we then avoid compro- mise or rather resort to it as often as possible? Finally, is compromise a source of interpretation? This paper is an attempt to provide at least a partial answer to most of the questions posed above. The answer seems not only a riddle at the theoretical level, but also has numerous practical consequences. It can affect the quality of the regulations issued as well as the level of legal certainty (or predictability) in a particular society, especially in those governed by continental (positivist) legal systems. Let us start this analysis with an attempt to define this complex and myste- rious notion of legislative compromise. There exists numerous definitions of what compromise could be, but there is one that seems particularly interesting: let us take a closer and critical look on Andrei Marmor’s definition...|$|R
40|$|As the number, cost, and {{complexity}} of federal regulations have grown {{over the past twenty}} years, there has been growing interest in the use of analytic tools such as risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to improve the regulatory process. The application of these tools to public health, safety, and environmental problems has become commonplace in the peer-reviewed scientific and medical literatures. Recent studies prepared by Resources for the Future, the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution, and the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis have demonstrated how formal analyses can and often do help government agencies achieve more protection against hazards at less cost than would otherwise occur. Although analytic tools hold great promise, their use by federal agencies is neither consistent nor rigorous. The 103 rd, 104 th, 105 th and 106 th Congresses demonstrated sustained interest in the passage of comprehensive legislation governing the employment of these tools in the federal regulatory process. While legislative proposals on this issue have attracted significant bipartisan interest, and recent amendments to particular enabling statutes have incorporated some of these analytical requirements, no comprehensive legislation has been enacted into law since passage of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946. The inability to pass such legislation has been attributed to a variety of factors, but a common substantive concern has been uncertainty and controversy about how such legislation should address judicial review issues. For example, the judicial review portion of The Regulatory Improvement Act (S. 981), the 105 th Congress 2 ̆ 7 s major legislative initiative, was criticized simultaneously as meaningless (for allegedly offering too few opportunities for petitioners to challenge poorly reasoned agency rules) and dangerous (as supposedly enabling petitioners to paralyze even well-reasoned agency rules). Thus, a significant obstacle to regulatory improvement legislation appears to be the conflicting opinions among legal scholars and practitioners about how judicial review issues should be addressed in such legislation. The Clinton Administration and the authors of S. 981 believe they have crafted a workable compromise, one that accommodates the need to bring more rigor and transparency to an agency 2 ̆ 7 s decisional processes without imposing excessive judicial review. Nevertheless, it is clear that their agreement on this subject, if included in future <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations,</b> will be scrutinized and contested. Recognizing the importance of the judicial review issue to this and, indeed, any effort to improve the regulatory process, the Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health convened an invitational Workshop of accomplished legal practitioners and scholars to discuss how judicial review should be handled in legislation of this kind. The full-day Workshop was conducted in Washington, D. C. on December 17, 1998. Its purpose was to discuss principles, experiences, and insights that might inform future public debate about how judicial review should be addressed in legislative proposals that entail use of risk assessment and/or cost-benefit analysis in agency decision-making (whether the proposals are comprehensive or agency-specific). In order to provide the Workshop a practical focus, participants analyzed the provisions of S. 981 (as modified {{at the request of the}} Clinton Administration). An exchange of letters between S. 9812 ̆ 7 s chief sponsors and the Clinton Administration defining the terms of the agreement was examined as well.

Participants in the study included 536 farm residents, 221 open-country nonfarm residents, and 324 city residents. Factors hypothesized to be important determinants of support for farm animal welfare legislation were age, education, gender, residence, environmentalism, moral orientation toward animals, perception of a farm animal welfare problem, and support for the animal welfare movement. These arguements were tested using a linear structural relationship (LISREL) model, with multiple indicators of the key variables;Residence was found to be an important predictor of farm animal welfare attitudes, while age, education and gender contributed relatively little to this explanation. Urban residence was associated with a moral orientation toward animals, perception of a farm animal welfare problem, and support for farm animal welfare legislation. The next highest levels on these attitudinal dimensions were from open-country nonfarm respondents.

The key contents of the EU's climate leadership towards the climate conference are assessed, such as the - 20 % by 2020 reduction target, the effort sharing agreement and reforms of the European Trading Scheme. EU climate leadership is both based on strong public support and economic features such as a lower energy intensity of production than the U. S. The EU and Danish strategy converge in promoting {{the concept of a}} 'low-carbon economy', based on first-mover advantage exports in renewables technology, such as wind power. The contents of the 'Danish example' are assessed; decoupling economic growth and emissions within a 'lowcarbon economy'-storyline. U. S. and EU policies diverged under the Bush administration that favored voluntary domestic measures towards industries and unilateral technology-based partnerships. The factors influencing the next President's climate policy such as increased support in public opinion, bottom-up developments among states, cities and in the business community are assessed, and so are factors that constrain a national climate policy, such as a high domestic reliance on coal. The dominant policy alternatives in the U. S. debate are evaluated. Ideas such as a carbon tax, emissions trading, a techno-optimist 'Manhattan Project on Climate Change' and a 5 - 10 x spending scenario in energy R&D are explored in terms of their political feasibility. The analysis indicates that a national cap-and-trade could emerge, but the <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations</b> to establish such a policy could protract beyond COP- 15.

Scholars have argued that an international framework for R&D in clean energy are needed, as past R&D efforts in clean energy has reduced the costs of electricity from solar panels. The section then discusses current energy R&D trends in the U. S. and in the OECD. Lowering the cost of key technologies could help to speed up diffusion of non-fossil-fuel sources, and would be a new form of directional leadership in climate policy, to be undertaken by the Annex-I countries...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} three separate {{issues related to}} representation, institutional rules, and policy outcomes in the states. Two of the three papers focus on a state-by-state comparison and measure how states differ in policy outcomes and descriptive representation. The final paper digs deeper to consider the individual-level behavior of representatives and the characteristics that drive those behaviors. First, {{in the study of}} interstate policy choices, political science scholars highlight the importance of variables such as divided government, regionalism, and even neighboring effects. I argue that the literature ignores campaign contribution laws that vary from state to state. I examine previous theories along with these campaign contribution laws and find that states with lax campaign contribution laws are less likely to act on the regulation of payday lenders. More specifically, states with lax rules act more leniently and are less likely to enact regulation of payday lenders. In addition, previous theories also prove influential in the policy choice of regulation within and across the states. Second, while one can easily imagine that larger minority populations produce more descriptive representation, what other state characteristics drive a state toward higher numbers of Black and Latino legislatures? This article responds to a debate in the literature over the role of professionalism in the percentage of minority legislators within a state. I hypothesize that states with higher levels of professionalism attract greater numbers of qualified Black and Latino legislators and help these candidates win more spots within state legislatures. The results of the analysis support this theory. Along with higher percentages of minorities within a state, higher levels of professionalism also influence the percentage of Black and Latino legislators within a state. Finally, the third paper focuses on representation, payday lending legislation, and the influence of religion in <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations.</b> The paper focuses the dependent variable on roll-call votes and speaking time in favor of regulation. The main hypotheses revolve around a representative’s religion. While I hypothesize that a representative’s professed religion influences a representative’s willingness to speak in favor of regulation and vote for regulation, the results do not support the hypothesis. I speculate on the reasons why the analysis shows no results for religion. Instead, variables such as campaign contributions, committee membership, the electoral safety of a district, and party all influence a representative’s time spent speaking in favor of regulation...|$|R

These new mandates take {{a variety of forms}} but have one central feature: they permit the national government leaders to claim credit without paying for the costs of their own initiatives. This article examines intergovernmental relationships and the various forms of mandates including direct-order mandates, grants, pre-emptions, and tax policy.

40|$|The Growth Management Consensus Project (GMCP) was an 18 -month {{effort from}} the time the {{participation}} of stakeholders was first sought, in which representatives of virtually all the major interests came together to build consensus on basic features for statewide legislation on growth management. The group achieved a remarkable amount of mutual understanding and agreement among most of the players in view of the complexity of the issues, the range of highly adversarial interests, and the short 10 months of actual meetings. The project produced a 28 -page report 2 outlining {{a wide range of issues}} and principles on which there was substantial agreement among most players. These “emerging” agreements helped to shape participants’ views and the positions of the interest groups they represented, both during and after the process. While the group produced no specific legislative recommendations a number of the “emerging” agreements they reached were incorporated into pending legislation. The participants also influenced <b>legislative</b> and executive <b>deliberations</b> as they testified in public hearings and as their staff lobbied in the following year. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{essay is}} {{inspired}} by a research project about the concept of rationality in law/rationality and law, and deals with how criminal law forces itself to contain drifts of irrationality as in committing crime as in imposing punishment. By a ‘genealogic’ approach, the author analyzes {{the circumstances under which}} the rationality principle is appeared in the controversial history of criminal law, and observes two main areas whereas the clash rationality/irrationality became hardier. First, much of the criminal law is characterized by the conflict between formalistic and antiformalistic perspective, that is by the question how space is to be accorded to judicial power in the production of the criminal rules. Second, the law enforcement raises the problem about how many and which are the real goals of the punishment, and if the punishment is really able to achieve these goals, in according to a instrumental vision of the penal sanction like a way to fulfil social aims. This article discusses the problematic features of <b>legislative</b> and judicial <b>deliberation</b> regarding the current compliance to the civil law principle of the ‘statutory reserve’. Many extraneous considerations, economic too, often enter in, and certain inherent features of these bodies make them especially problematic. Probably, the criminal law fate is to accept that its instrumental rationality is bounded, and it’s important for the legislator and the judge acknowledge these imperfections, and they adopt a results orientation instilled by the humility of ignorance, due to serious effect {{for the life of the}} persons involved in the criminal justice system decisions...|$|R
5000|$|While section 24 of {{the interim}} Constitution {{applies to the}} {{exercise}} of powers delegated by a council to its functionaries, the court {{in the present case}} found it difficult to see how it can have any application to by-laws made by the council itself. The council is a deliberative legislative body whose members are elected. The legislative decisions taken by them are influenced by political considerations for which they are politically accountable to the electorate. Such decisions must, of course, be lawful, but the requirement of legality exists independently of, and does not depend on, the provisions of section 24(a). The procedures according to which legislative decisions are to be taken are prescribed by the Constitution, the empowering legislation and the rules of the council. While this legislative framework is subject to review for consistency with the Constitution, the making of by-laws and the imposition of taxes by a council in accordance with the prescribed legal framework cannot appropriately be made subject to challenge by [...] "every person" [...] affected by them on the grounds contemplated by s 24(b). Nor, the court found, are the provisions of s 24(c) or (d) applicable to decisions taken by a deliberative <b>legislative</b> assembly. The <b>deliberation</b> ordinarily takes place in the assembly in public, where the members articulate their own views {{on the subject of the}} proposed resolutions. Each member is entitled to his or her own reasons for voting for or against any resolution and is entitled to do so on political grounds. It is for the members, not the Courts, to judge what is relevant in such circumstances. Sections 24(c) and (d) cannot sensibly be applied to such decisions. The enactment of legislation by an elected local council in accordance with the Constitution is, in the ordinary sense of the words, a legislative and not an administrative act.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, lawmakers have been {{responding}} to several highly publicized child abduction, assault and murder cases. While such cases remain rare in Iowa, the public debates they have generated are having far-reaching effects. Policy makers are responsible for controlling the nature of such effects. Challenges they face stem from the need to avoid primarily politically-motivated responses {{and the desire to}} make informed decisions that recognize both the strengths and the limitations {{of the criminal justice system}} as a vehicle for promoting safe and healthy families and communities. Consensus was reached by the Task Force at its first meeting that one of its standing goals is to provide nonpartisan guidance to help avoid or fix problematic sex offense policies and practices. Setting this goal was a response to the concern over what can result from elected officials’ efforts to respond to the types of sex offender-related concerns that can easily become emotionally laden and politically charged due to the universally held abhorrence of sex crimes against children. The meetings of the Task Force and the various work groups it has formed have included some spirited and perhaps emotionally charged discussions, despite the above-stated ground rule. However, as is described in the report, the Task Force’s first set of recommendations and plans for further study were approved through consensus. It is hoped that in upcoming <b>legislative</b> <b>deliberations,</b> it will be remembered that the non-legislative members of the Task Force all agreed on the recommendations contained in this report. The topics discussed in this first report from the Task Force are limited to the study issues specifically named in H. F. 619, the Task Force’s enabling legislation. However, other topics of concern were discussed by the Task Force because of their immediacy or because of their possible relationships with one or more of the Task Force’s mandated study issues. For example, it has been reported by some probation/parole officers and others that the 2000 feet rule has had a negative influence on treatment participation and supervision compliance. While such concerns were noted, the Task Force did not take it upon itself to investigate them at this time and thus broaden the agenda it was given by the General Assembly last session. As a result, the recently reinstated 2000 feet rule, the new cohabitation/child endangerment law and other issues of interest to Task Force members but not within the scope of their charge are not discussed in the body of this report. An issue of perhaps the greatest interest to most Task Force members that was not a part of their charge was a belief in the benefit of viewing Iowa’s efforts to protect children from sex crimes with as comprehensive a platform as possible. It has been suggested that much more can be done to prevent child-victim sex crimes than would be accomplished by only concentrating on what to do with offenders after a crime has occurred. To prevent child victimization, H. F. 619 policy provisions rely largely on incapacitation and future deterrent effects of increased penalties, more restrictive supervision practices and greater public awareness of the risk presented by a segment of Iowa’s known sex offenders. For some offenders, these policies will no doubt prevent future sex crimes against children, and the Task Force has begun long-term studies to look for the desired results and for ways to improve such results through better supervision tools and more effective offender treatment. Unfortunately, much of the effects from the new policies may primarily influence persons who have already committed sex offenses against minors and who have already been caught doing so. Task Force members discussed the need for a range of preventive efforts and a need to think about sex crimes against children from other than just a “reaction- to-the-offender” perspective. While this topic is not addressed in the report that follows, it was suggested that some of the Task Force’s discussions could be briefly shared through these opening comments. Along with incapacitation and deterrence, comprehensive approaches to the prevention of child-victim sex crimes would also involve making sure parents have the tools they need to detect signs of adults with sex behavior problems, to help teach their children about warning signs and to find the support they need for healthy parenting. School, faithbased and other community organizations might benefit from stronger supports and better tools they can use to more effectively promote positive youth development and the learning of respect for others, respect for boundaries and healthy relationships. All of us who have children, or who live in communities where there are children, need to understand the limitations of our justice system and the importance of our own ability to play a role in preventing sexual abuse and protecting children from sex offenders, which are often the child’s own family members. Over 1, 000 incidences of child sexual abuse are confirmed or founded each year in Iowa, and most such acts take place in the child’s home or the residence of the caretaker of the child. Efforts to prevent child sexual abuse and to provide for early interventions with children and families at risk could be strategically examined and strengthened. The Sex Offender Treatment and Supervision Task Force was established to provide assistance to the General Assembly. It will respond to legislative direction for adjusting its future plans as laid out in this report. Its plans could be adjusted to broaden or narrow its scope or to assign different priority levels of effort to its current areas of study. Also, further Task Force considerations of the recommendations it has already submitted could be called for. In the meantime, it is hoped that the information and recommendations submitted through this report prove helpful...|$|R
