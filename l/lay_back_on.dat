500|$|Around this time, Silver {{composed}} {{music for}} a television commercial for the drink Tab. Early in 1964, Silver visited Brazil for three weeks, an experience he credited with increasing {{his interest in}} his heritage. In the same year, he created a new quintet, featuring Joe Henderson on tenor saxophone and Carmell Jones on trumpet. This band recorded most of Silver's best-known album, Song for My Father, which reached No. 95 on the Billboard 200 in 1965, and {{was added to the}} Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Recordings and personnel changes – sometimes expanding the band to a sextet – continued in the mid-1960s. In 1966, The Cape Verdean Blues charted at No. 130. The liner notes to the album Serenade to a Soul Sister (1968) included lyrics (written but not sung), indicating a new interest for Silver. His quintet, by then including saxophonist Bennie Maupin, trumpeter Randy Brecker, bassist John Williams, and drummer Billy Cobham, toured parts of Europe in October and November 1968, sponsored by the U.S. government. They also recorded one of Silver's last quintet albums for Blue Note, You Gotta Take a Little Love. The Penguin Guide to Jazzs retrospective summary of Silver's main Blue Note recordings was that they were of a consistently high standard: [...] "each album yields one or two themes that haunt the mind, each usually has a particularly pretty ballad, and they all <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a deep pile of solid riffs and workmanlike solos." ...|$|E

60|$|So Madame <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her pillow, submissively pursing the {{thermometer}} between {{her lips and}} watching Alvina with black eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Small told Aunt Ann at once, who, {{smiling as}} she <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her pillows, {{said in her}} distinct, {{trembling}} old voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I flit from {{branch to}} branch," [...] {{continued}} Hewet. [...] "The world is profoundly pleasant." [...] He <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the bed, upon his arms.|$|E
50|$|Just after {{exiting the}} night club, Al, who still has hangover, decides to <b>lay</b> his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a lightpost. Momentarily, a hefty man comes and greets him. Figuring he {{has lots of}} cash, the hefty man invites and takes Al to the latter's buddies.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here," [...] {{interrupts}} Mrs. Sampson, [...] "I reckon I've {{got something}} to say in this consultation. That flaxseed done me more good than anything I ever tried." [...] And then she raises up her head and <b>lays</b> it <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my arm again, and says: [...] "Put some in the other eye, Sandy dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|Both the brothers' brows clouded at once. Amyas, as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the pebbles, {{said quietly}} to the gulls over his head--"I {{wonder what the}} Frenchman whose head I cut off at the Azores, thinks by now about all that." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{certainly}} did amuse him, for he <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the hay and laughed so heartily that his merriment scared the squirrel {{on the wall}} and woke Dulce.|$|E
60|$|Yet, {{the next}} moment, {{she bit her}} lips as if the {{expression}} had unwittingly escaped her; and with a reckless shrug of her shoulders she <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her pillow.|$|E

50|$|CHORUS: In {{a little}} red barn on a farm down in Indiana,Let me <b>lay</b> my <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a stack of new mown hay.'Round the {{barnyard}} where the farmyard folks are pally,Let me dilly-dally all the live-long day.I'm a Hoosier who's blue, thru and thru, and my heart is piningFor the sycamore trees where the Wabash breezes play.What's more, I'm pining for a yellow moon that's shiningOn {{a little red}} barn on a farm down Indiana way.|$|R
6000|$|They {{rested on}} a bed of boughs which they had cut and {{arranged}} alongside a huge log. For hours Joe lay awake, he could not sleep. He listened to the breeze rustling the leaves, and shivered at the thought of the sighing wind he had once heard moan through the forest. Presently he turned over. The slight noise instantly awakened Wetzel who lifted his dark face while he listened intently. He spoke one word: [...] "Sleep," [...] and <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> again <b>on</b> the leaves. Joe forced himself to be quiet, relaxed all his muscles and soon slumbered.|$|R
60|$|At length Gerald <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> inert <b>on</b> the carpet, {{his breast}} rising in great slow panting, whilst Birkin kneeled over him, almost unconscious. Birkin {{was much more}} exhausted. He caught little, short breaths, he could {{scarcely}} breathe any more. The earth seemed to tilt and sway, and a complete darkness was coming over his mind. He {{did not know what}} happened. He slid forward quite unconscious, over Gerald, and Gerald did not notice. Then he was half-conscious again, aware only of the strange tilting and sliding of the world. The world was sliding, everything was sliding off into the darkness. And he was sliding, endlessly, endlessly away.|$|R
60|$|Aynsley left them, and Clay {{was silent}} for a moment or two. He <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the pillows with his eyes closed, and when he spoke it seemed to be with an effort.|$|E
60|$|She <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her {{bed with}} closed eyes whilst Licinia kissed {{her hands and}} feet, re-arranged the {{embroidered}} coverlet and the downy cushions, {{and after a while}} shuffled out of the room.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of Mission sheep {{under the}} Mission olive trees in San Diego(?), 1930. The sheep keep their heads {{down by the}} dry grass and crowd {{underneath}} {{the shade of the}} olive trees on the right. One sheep with the letter "M" <b>on</b> the <b>back</b> <b>lays</b> <b>on</b> the ground behind the other sheep towards the left. Several black sheep stand apart in the <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the left and the trees in the background continue into the distance...|$|R
60|$|The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was {{conveyed}} out, {{with the}} book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.|$|R
60|$|When I {{entered the}} room I found Jessie leaning back languidly in her largest arm-chair, {{watching}} the raindrops dripping down the window-pane. The unfortunate box of novels was open by her side, and the books were lying, for the most part, strewed about {{on the ground at}} her feet. One volume <b>lay</b> open, <b>back</b> upward, <b>on</b> her lap, and her hands were crossed over it listlessly. To my great dismay, she was yawning--palpably and widely yawning--when I came in.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I think. I {{know just what}} I feel,--nobody else seems to. Eva used to, but she is gone!" [...] and Marie <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her lounge, and began to sob disconsolately.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll not let 'em," [...] replied Jarwin, with pathetic sincerity, {{and then}} began to sing in such a {{touching}} strain, that his master <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his couch and rolled his large eyes in rapture.|$|E
6000|$|... "That must be {{the smoke}} from Bill Hobson's place," [...] {{announced}} the old lumberman, and then {{he closed his eyes}} once more and <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the litter, for the pain he was suffering was great.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Salient was a German {{defensive}} position {{built in}} 1915 on the Somme in France, during the First World War, opposite {{the village of}} Authuille which contained the Leipzig Redoubt on its west face. The position was to the south-west of the later Thiepval Memorial, north-east of the La Boisselle-Authuille and Thiepval-Aveluy crossroads. The German front line bulged around a quarry, which the Germans fortified and enclosed with Hindenburg Trench, which had been dug further back across the chord of the salient. The [...] Redoubt (Wonderwork to the British) <b>lay</b> further <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a reverse slope. Nab Valley lay on the east side, Thiepval was to the north, with the fortified Mouquet Farm and the village of Pozières to the north-west.|$|R
50|$|On October 28, 2005, Pueblo County police deputies {{were called}} about a {{possible}} drunk driver {{near the city of}} Pueblo, Colorado around 3AM. After pulling the driver over, police found Nathaniel Steed Allred driving the SUV and Seth <b>laying</b> in the <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a mattress. Once authorities realized who Seth was, they obtained a search warrant to search the SUV. In the car officials found $140,000 USD in cash, numerous letters addressed to Warren, cell phones and $7,000 in prepaid debit cards.|$|R
60|$|He <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his <b>back,</b> <b>on</b> a heap {{of fresh}} straw, in a close and filthy mud-built hut. Under his aching neck a wooden pillow or prop of native make {{supported}} his head. Two women and a man bent over him and smiled. Their faces, though black, were far from unkindly. They were pleased to see him stare about with such meaning in his eyes. They were friendly, no doubt. They seemed really to {{take an interest in}} their patient's recovery.|$|R
60|$|The cry of {{the wolves}} rose on the still winter air and floated round the castle walls in long-drawn {{piercing}} wails; the old woman <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her couch {{with a look of}} long-delayed happiness on her face.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke the}} verses aloud {{from the first}} lines till the music and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing them; then <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his bolster.|$|E
6000|$|While the boy rowed {{steadily}} on and {{the boat}} rushed fast over the water, the jolly King, who never could be sad or serious for many minutes at a time, <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his embroidered cushions and sang as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stayed at}} Meran two years, till I'd learnt all I could there, then a brother of my mother's {{helped me to}} get to Vienna; I {{was lucky enough to}} find work with a man who used to {{decorate}} churches. We went about the country together. Once when he was ill I painted the roof of a church entirely by myself; I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> my <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the scaffold boards all day for a week--I was proud of that roof." [...] He paused.|$|R
6000|$|... “You haven’t {{used the}} right kind of argument, I expect. Now, if every time one of your letters was opened you <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> your <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the dining-table during dinner and had a fit, or roused the entire family {{in the middle of the}} night to hear you recite one of Blake’s ‘Poems of Innocence,’ you would get a far more respectful hearing for future protests. People yield more {{consideration}} to a mutilated mealtime or a broken night’s rest, than ever they would to a broken heart.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Since Cassidy was 6' 9" [...] (2.06 m) tall, using him {{to depict}} Thing caused great {{technical}} difficulties {{on the set}} of The Addams Family. In many scenes he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a wheeled trolley, below the line of sight of the cameras, and inserted his arm through the bottom of the box. Thing was usually a right hand, but Cassidy sometimes played it as left, simply to see if anyone would notice. Thing is credited as [...] "itself" [...] {{at the end of each}} episode.|$|R
