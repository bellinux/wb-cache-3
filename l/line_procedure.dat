50|$|The {{most common}} {{symptom of the}} {{papillary}} tumor is a headache. Because headaches are so common, most people think nothing of it. This is why brain tumors are so dangerous. There are {{not a lot of}} symptoms that go along with them so people tend to wait a long time before seeking medical help. Most of the time people will go see a doctor when their headaches become consistent and start to never go away. This symptom however occurs secondary to hydrocephalus, which is a result from compression of the cerebral aqueduct. The cerebral aqueduct is a narrow channel in the midbrain, which connects the third and fourth ventricles. When a tumor blocks the pathway of the cerebrospinal fluid, this will cause headaches in the patient. Often when hydrocephalus occurs, a shunt is put in place in order to alleviate the pressure. In one case study, an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed as a first <b>line</b> <b>procedure</b> to treat the hydrocephalus and also for diagnostic purposes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{probabilistic}} model for acoustic source localization with known but arbitrary {{geometry of the}} microphone array. The approach has several features. First, it relies on a simple nearfield acoustic model for wave propagation. Second, {{it does not require}} the number of active sources. On the contrary, it produces a heat map representing the energy of a large set of candidate locations, thus imaging the acoustic field. Second, it relies on a heavy-tail alpha-stable probabilistic model, whose most important feature is to yield an estimation strategy where the multichannel signals need to be processed only once in a simple on- <b>line</b> <b>procedure,</b> called sketching. This sketching produces a fixed-sized representation of the data that is then analyzed for localization.

40|$|Mediastinal {{widening}} is {{a frequent}} radiological finding in the emergency department patient. The causes of mediastinal widening {{can be divided into}} traumatic and nontraumatic mediastinal widening. An important association of moderate to high velocity trauma is the mediastinal haematoma. It {{may be the result of}} traumatic transsection of the aorta, or it may be due to bleeding from other mediastinal vessels. Before the era of multidetector spiral CT, angiography was the gold standard for the evaluation of patients with a widened mediastinum. Meanwhile, angiography as a risk-carrying invasive examination has widely been replaced by MDCT. However, conventional radiography remains an important diagnostic tool; so does angiography, especially in the context of interventional radiology. Multidetector spiral CT plays an important role (Alkadhi et al., Radiographics 2004; 24 : 1239 - 1255), but usually as a second <b>line</b> <b>procedure.</b> This article discusses the radiological signs of traumatic mediastinal widening.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{improvements}} in propositional satisfiability techniques (SAT) {{made it possible}} to tackle successfully some hard real-world problems (e. g., model-checking, circuit testing, propositional planning) by encoding into SAT. However, a purely Boolean representation is not expressive enough for many other real-world applications, including the verification of timed and hybrid systems, of proof obligations in software, and of circuit design at RTL level. These problems can be naturally modeled as satisfiability in linear arithmetic logic (LAL), that is, the Boolean combination of propositional variables and linear constraints over numerical variables. In this paper we present MATHSAT, a new, SAT-based decision procedure for LAL, based on the (known approach) of integrating a state-of-the-art SAT solver with a dedicated mathematical solver for LAL. We improve MATHSAT in two different directions. First, the top-level <b>line</b> <b>procedure</b> is enhanced and now features a tighter integration between the Boolean search and the mathematical solver. In particular, we allow for theory-driven backjumping and learning, and theory-driven deduction; we use static learning {{in order to reduce the}} number of Boolean models that are mathematically inconsistent; we exploit problem clustering in order to partition mathematical reasoning; and we define a stack-based interface that allows us to implement mathematical reasoning in a...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveBone marrow {{stimulation}} (BMS) {{has been}} regarded as a first <b>line</b> <b>procedure</b> for repair of articular cartilage. However, repaired cartilage from BMS {{is known to be}} unlike that of hyaline cartilage and its inner endurance is not guaranteed. The reason presumably came from a shortage of cartilage-forming cells in blood clots derived by BMS. In order to increase repairable cellularity, the feasibility of autologous bone marrow-derived buffy coat transplantation in repair of large full-thickness cartilage defects was investigated in this study. MethodsRabbits were divided into four groups: the defect remained untreated as a negative control; performance of BMS only (BMS group); BMS followed by supplementation of autologous bone marrow buffy coat (Buffy coat group); transplantation of autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOTS) as a positive control. ResultsRepair of cartilage defects in the Buffy coat group in a rabbit model was more effective than BMS alone and similar to AOTS. Gross findings, histological analysis, histological scoring, immunohistochemistry, and chemical assay demonstrated that supplementation of autologous bone marrow buffy coat after BMS arthroplasty effectively repaired cartilage defects in a rabbit model, and was more effective than BMS arthroplasty alone. ConclusionSupplementation of autologous bone marrow-derived buffy coat in cases of BMS could be a useful clinical protocol for cartilage repair...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lymph nodal {{involvement}} {{is an important}} clinical-pathological sign in primary cutaneous lymphoma (PCL), as it marks the transformation/evolution of the disease from localized to systemic; therefore the surveillance of lymph nodes {{is important in the}} staging and follow up of PCL. Fine needle cytology (FNC) is widely used in the diagnosis of lymphadenopathies but has rarely been reported in PCL staging and follow-up. In this study an experience on reactive and neoplastic lymphadenopathies arisen in PCL and investigated by FNC, combined to ancillary techniques, is reported. METHODS: Twenty-one lymph node FNC from as many PCL patients were retrieved; 17 patients had mycosis fungoides (MF) and 4 a primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PBL). In all cases, rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) was performed and additional passes were used to perform flow cytometry (FC), immunocytochemistry (ICC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess or rule out a possible clonality of the corresponding cell populations. RESULTS: FNC combined with FC, ICC, and PCR identified 12 cases of reactive, non specific, hyperplasia (BRH), 4 dermatopathic lymphadenopathy (DL), 4 lymph nodal involvement by MF and 1 lymph nodal involvement by cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: FNC coupled with ancillary techniques is an effective tool to evaluate lymph node status in PCL patients, provided that ROSE and a rational usage of ancillary techniques is performed according to the clinical context and the available material.
