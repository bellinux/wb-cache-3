5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on <b>lathes,</b> milling machines, screw machines or Swiss <b>lathes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Churchill-Redman Ltd {{bought the}} Longfield foundry in Halifax to provide extra {{production}} capacity and leased {{a part of}} the Vickers Armstrong Admiralty works in Scotswood, Newcastle. It was intended that the Newcastle site concern itself with a range of <b>lathes</b> intended for the motor industry, Austin and Vauxhall in particular; the Halifax operation would focus on manufacture of Fay <b>lathes</b> which were still being licensed from the US.|$|E
5|$|BuroHappold's early {{projects}} {{ranged from}} designing giant fabric umbrellas for Pink Floyd concerts to the Munich Aviary and the Mannheim Multihalle, both with Frei Otto, an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures. The Mannheim Multihalle was a timber gridshell of 50 by 50mm <b>lathes</b> of hemlock of irregular form, {{depending on the}} elasticity of spring washers at the joints for its flexible form. It {{was one of the}} first major uses of structural gridshells.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the action}} of the pole <b>lathe</b> and the skills {{required}} are similar to those employed on a modern power <b>lathe,</b> a requirement is that the timber used on a pole <b>lathe</b> is freshly felled and unseasoned, i.e., green. The angle that the tools are ground is closer to that of a carpenter's chisel than that of a power <b>lathe</b> tool. Using power <b>lathe</b> tools on a pole <b>lathe</b> is safe, but hard work. Using a pole <b>lathe</b> chisel on a power <b>lathe</b> risks serious injury, since the forces are such that the blade is likely to break.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan <b>lathes,</b> the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M. By the financial year ending March 1962 it reported a group net profit of £575,352 and a dividend of 22.5%. Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of total output. Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951. Information regarding Churchill-Milnes is lacking but a business called Henry Milnes manufactured <b>lathes</b> in the Bradford area {{for many years and}} it may be that this was the target of a take-over.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine <b>lathes,</b> drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E

5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on <b>lathes</b> were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E

25|$|Forstner bits, {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to}} the wood grain. They can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or <b>lathes</b> rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|E

25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC <b>lathes,</b> CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E
25|$|However the use {{of glass}} engraving, usually using a wheel, to cut {{decorative}} scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of hardstone carvings, appears {{as early as the}} first century AD, continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome, and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament. It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with <b>lathes.</b> As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and {{it seems likely that the}} engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.|$|E
25|$|Most English {{counties}} were {{subdivided into}} smaller subdivisions called hundreds. Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire {{were divided into}} wapentakes (a unit of Danish origin), while Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were divided into wards, areas originally organised for military purposes, each centred on a castle. Kent and Sussex had an intermediate level between their major subdivisions and their hundreds, known as <b>lathes</b> in Kent and rapes in Sussex. Hundreds or their equivalents were divided into tithings and parishes (the only class of these divisions still used administratively), which in turn were divided into townships and manors. In the 17th century the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex was further divided into four divisions, which replaced {{the functions of the}} hundred. The borough and parish were the principal providers of local services throughout England until the creation of ad-hoc boards and, later, local government districts.|$|E
