5|$|The mythical 80's Swansea power pop band The Pooh Sticks {{was named}} {{as both a}} homage to the game, and as a {{description}} of the factual or habitual sticky qualities of <b>lowercase</b> pooh.|$|E
5|$|The scheme, {{consisting}} of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is <b>lowercase</b> and documents that specify schemes must do so with <b>lowercase</b> letters. It {{is followed by a}} colon (:). Examples of popular schemes include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.|$|E
5|$|Strings of data octets {{within a}} URI are {{represented}} as characters. Permitted characters within a URI are the ASCII characters for the <b>lowercase</b> and uppercase {{letters of the}} modern English alphabet, the Arabic numerals, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde. Octets represented by any other character must be percent-encoded.|$|E
25|$|Most Unicode {{software}} uppercases ı to I and <b>lowercases</b> İ to i, but, unless specifically configured for Turkish, it <b>lowercases</b> I to i and uppercases i to I. Thus uppercasing then <b>lowercasing,</b> or vice versa, {{changes the}} letters.|$|R
5000|$|The fluid {{forms of}} both the upper- and <b>lowercases,</b> {{combined}} with an even weight of stroke, have made Kaufmann popular in neon sign fabrication.|$|R
5000|$|Smart {{derives from}} {{cooperation}} with Swatch and Mercedes: Swatch Mercedes ART. In its branding, the company <b>lowercases</b> its logotype and the logo incorporating a [...] "c" [...] and an arrow for [...] "compact" [...] and [...] "forward thinking" [...] respectively.|$|R
5|$|The iPhone5S (marketed with {{a stylized}} <b>lowercase</b> 's' as iPhone5s) is a {{smartphone}} {{that was designed}} and marketed by Apple Inc. Part of the iPhone series, the device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. It was released on September 20, 2013, along with its lower-cost counterpart, the iPhone 5c.|$|E
5|$|Uppercase and <b>lowercase</b> prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the {{quantities}} 1mW and 1MW represent two different quantities; {{the former is}} the typical power requirement of a hearing aid (1milliwatt or 0.001watts), and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train (1megawatt or watts).|$|E
5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in <b>lowercase,</b> as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the system {{developed by the}} team of the National University of Singa-pore for English to Spanish machine trans-lation of News Commentary text for the WMT 09 Shared Translation Task. Our approach is based on domain adaptation, combining a small in-domain News Com-mentary bi-text and a large out-of-domain one from the Europarl corpus, from which we built and combined two separate phrase tables. We further combined two language models (in-domain and out-of-domain), and we experimented with cognates, im-proved tokenization and recasing, achiev-ing the highest <b>lowercased</b> NIST score of 6. 963 and the second best <b>lowercased</b> Bleu score of 24. 91 % for training without us-ing additional external data for English-to-Spanish translation at the shared task. ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 4: Rule 3. For {{franchise}} {{or business}} names beginning with ki-, {{the letter that}} precedes the prefix ki- is often uppercased while the prefix itself is <b>lowercased.</b> Although, there is an exception if the prefix ki- appears {{in the beginning of}} a phrase or enunciation point.|$|R
5000|$|The purple, <b>lowercased</b> [...] "sgi" [...] logo {{can be seen}} at the {{beginning}} of the opening credits of the HBO series Silicon Valley, before being taken down and replaced by the Google logo as the intro graphics progress. Google leased the former SGI buildings in 2003 for their headquarters in Mountain View, CA until they purchased the buildings outright in 2006.|$|R
5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies <b>lowercase</b> names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone4S (retroactively stylized with a <b>lowercase</b> 's' as iPhone 4s as of September 2013) is a {{smartphone}} {{that was}} designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fifth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4 and preceding the iPhone 5. Announced on October 4, 2011 at Apple's Cupertino campus, its media coverage was accompanied by news {{of the death of}} former Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs on the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in <b>lowercase.</b> Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to these differences in shape of letters, italic <b>lowercases</b> usually lack serifs at the bottoms of strokes, since a pen would bounce up to continue the action of writing. Instead they usually have one-sided serifs that curve up on the outstroke (contrast the flat two-sided serifs of a roman font). One uncommon exception to this is Hermann Zapf's Melior. (Its outstroke serifs are one-sided, but they don't curve up.) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of speed generally demanded by a computer game, files are indexed in a hash table using a quick, low-collision hashing algorithm. The index of a specific file within the hash table is the hash of the <b>lowercased</b> filename modulo the size of the hash table, allowing for quick verification of a file's existence within the archive. If multiple files within the archive have the same hash, colliding entries will follow each other in increasing index order (forming a colliding hash cluster). In order to identify the exact entry for the requested file within a colliding hash cluster, each hash table entry stores 2 additional hashes of the <b>lowercased</b> filename, each using the same hashing algorithm but with a different seed value, as well as a locale code and platform code. The end of a colliding hash cluster is detected either by encountering an empty hash table entry or by traversing the entire hash table (including the modulo loopback) back to the initial hash table index.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{language model}} is evaluated on the Wall Street Journal {{portion of the}} Penn Treebank which is preprocessed by <b>lowercasing</b> words, removing punctuation and replacing numbers with the ‘N’ symbol. Sections 00 - 20 (930 K words) are used as training sets, sections 21 - 22 as validation sets (74 K words), and sections 23 - 24 as test sets (82 K words). The vocabulary size is 10 K, including a special token for unknown words.|$|R
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in <b>lowercase.</b> Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E
25|$|A <b>lowercase</b> đ {{appeared}} {{alongside a}} <b>lowercase</b> retroflex D in a 1982 {{revision of the}} African reference alphabet. This revision of the alphabet eliminated uppercase forms, {{so there was no}} conflict between ɖ and đ.|$|E
25|$|Proper names {{may become}} common names, {{and in this}} case they are written in <b>lowercase</b> (e.g. röntgen ‘x-ray’) and even their derived {{compounds}} may become <b>lowercase,</b> losing the hyphen (e.g. ádámcsutka rather than *Ádám-csutka ‘Adam’s apple’).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} memory-based named entity {{recognition}} system {{that participated in}} the MSM- 2013 Concept Extraction Challenge. The system expands the training set of annotated tweets with part-of-speech tags and seedlist information, and then generates a sequential memory-based tagger comprised of separate modules for known and unknown words. Two taggers are trained: one on the original capitalized data, and one on a <b>lowercased</b> version of the training data. The intersection of named entities in the predictions of the two taggers is kept as the final output...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of climatic {{conditions}} (a: mean annual temperature; b: annual precipitation) between the Chinese and North American locations of Ulmus pumila. Wilcoxon rank sum tests {{were used to}} test for differences between both ranges. Mean annual temperatures are significantly higher for locations from the U. S. (W = 7, p < 0. 05). Annual precipitation is marginal higher in the invasive populations compared to the native populations (W = 9, p = 0. 05). Significant differences are symbolized by different <b>lowercases</b> above the boxes...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{approach}} is to indicate word boundaries using medial capitalization, called [...] "CamelCase", [...] "Pascal case", and many other names, thus rendering [...] "" [...] as either [...] "" [...] or [...] "". This convention is commonly used in Pascal, Java, C#, and Visual Basic. Treatment of acronyms in identifiers (e.g. the [...] "XML" [...] and [...] "HTTP" [...] in [...] ) varies. Some dictate that they be <b>lowercased</b> (e.g. [...] ) to ease typing and readability, whereas others leave them uppercased (e.g. [...] ) for accuracy.|$|R
25|$|Gene {{symbols are}} italicised and all letters are in <b>lowercase</b> (shh). Protein designations {{are the same}} as the gene symbol, are not italicised; the first letter is in {{uppercase}} and the remaining letters are in <b>lowercase</b> (Shh).|$|E
25|$|The <b>lowercase</b> {{first letter}} in these chunks {{indicates}} {{that they are}} not needed for the PNG specification. The <b>lowercase</b> last letter in some chunks indicates that they are safe to copy, even if the application concerned does not understand them.|$|E
25|$|Georgia, in the past, used {{uppercase}} Series D with {{a custom}} <b>lowercase</b> alphabet on its freeway guide signs; the most distinctive {{feature of this}} typeface {{is the lack of}} a dot on <b>lowercase</b> i and j. More recent installations appear to include the dots.|$|E
5000|$|While Nomic is {{traditionally}} capitalized as the proper {{name of the}} game it describes, it has also sometimes been used in a more informal way as a <b>lowercased</b> generic term, nomic, referring to anything with Nomic-like characteristics, including games where the rules may be changed during play as well as non-gaming situations where it can be alleged that [...] "rules lawyers" [...] are tinkering with the process used to amend rules and policies (in an organization or community) in a manner akin to a game of Nomic.|$|R
40|$|Automatic segmentation, {{tokenization}} and morphological and syntactic annotations of raw {{texts in}} 45 languages, generated by UDPipe ([URL] together with word embeddings of dimension 100 computed from <b>lowercased</b> texts by word 2 vec ([URL] For each language, automatic annotations in CoNLL-U format {{are provided in}} a separate archive. The word embeddings for all languages are distributed in one archive. Note that the CC BY-SA-NC 4. 0 license applies to the automatically generated annotations and word embeddings, not to the underlying data, which may have different license and impose additional restrictions...|$|R
5000|$|Snake case (or snake_case) is the {{practice}} of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually <b>lowercased</b> within the compound and the first letter either upper or lower case—as in [...] "foo_bar" [...] and [...] "Hello_world". It is commonly used in computer code for variable names, and function names, and sometimes computer filenames. [...] At least {{one study found that}} readers can recognize snake case values more quickly than camel case.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the Division used all-uppercase Series E Modified for button-reflectorized {{letters on}} ground-mounted signs and mixed-case legend (<b>lowercase</b> letters with Series D capitals) for {{externally}} illuminated overhead guide signs. Several Eastern turnpike authorities blended all-uppercase Series E Modified with the <b>lowercase</b> alphabet for destination legends on their guide signs.|$|E
25|$|Capital and <b>lowercase</b> {{letters were}} not {{distinguished}} in old manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{variants}} are usually found in <b>lowercase.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the system presented for the English-Spanish translation task by the collaboration between CEU-UCH and UPV for 2011 WMT. A comparison of independent phrase-based translation models interpolation for each available training corpora were tested, giving an improvement of 0. 4 BLEU points over the baseline. Output N-best lists were rescored via a target Neural Network Language Model. An improvement of one BLEU point over the baseline was obtained adding the two features, giving 31. 5 BLEU and 57. 9 TER {{for the primary}} system, computed over <b>lowercased</b> and detokenized outputs. The system was positioned second in the final ranking. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} simple text preprocessing decisions (particularly tokenizing, lemmatizing, <b>lowercasing</b> and multiword grouping) {{on the performance of}} a state-of-the-art text classifier based on convolutional neural networks. Despite potentially affecting the final performance of any given model, this aspect has not received a substantial interest in the deep learning literature. We perform an extensive evaluation in standard benchmarks from text categorization and sentiment analysis. Our results show that a simple tokenization of the input text is often enough, but also highlight the importance of being consistent in the preprocessing of the evaluation set and the corpus used for training word embeddings.

5000|$|The changes {{included}} a new corporate color palette, small {{modifications to the}} GE logo, a new customized font (GE Inspira) and a new slogan, [...] "Imagination at work", composed by David Lucas, to replace the slogan [...] "We Bring Good Things to Life" [...] used since 1979. The standard requires many headlines to be <b>lowercased</b> and adds visual [...] "white space" [...] to documents and advertising. The changes were designed by Wolff Olins and are used on GE's marketing, literature and website. In 2014, a second typeface family was introduced: GE Sans and Serif by Bold Monday created under art direction by Wolff Olins.|$|R
