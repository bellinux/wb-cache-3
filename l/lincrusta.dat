[...] These include multicoloured marbled floors, staircases, handrails, panelling, columns and dado rails; <b>lincrusta</b> wallpaper; gilded ceilings in a Moorish style; stained glass in various styles; ostentatious chimneypieces, including one by Doulton and others with [...] "riotous swirling motifs"; an overmantel made of Venetian glass; decorative light fittings depicting cherubim and serpents; ceramic tiles by Arts and Crafts designer Walter Crane; and a Rococo-style former ballroom.|$|E
2500|$|The bogie {{carriages}} were {{distinctive and}} 'American' in style. The six were {{built by the}} 'Bristol Carriage and Wagon Works', two as [...] Third Class (one also being a thirdbrake) and four as [...] composites for 40 Third and 10 First Class passengers. The carriages were exceptionally wide compared with those used by major railway companies and this led to increased congestion for non-railway traffic when trains were at Bideford Quay. Entry was from either end by a metal fenced platform with steep steps. Later the open ends of these carriages were totally enclosed against the elements. Lighting was by acetylene gas, with ventilators above. Each carriage had its own clock. The seats could be turned around and the carriages had a central gangway. Third Class seats were upholstered with 'rep' and First Class with 'American' leather. They had a polished teak exterior {{with the name of}} the company in full beneath the windows, and the arms of Bideford as a medallion on the side. Buffer beams and shanks were bright red. Interiors were of polished oak, with teak mouldings and the ceilings of the First Class sections were covered in pale green <b>Lincrusta,</b> picked out with gold leaf. In August 1900 the carriages had been delivered, crossing Bideford Bridge with wheels and springs being taken over first and the bodies after.|$|E

This house, {{where he had been}} born and sheltered, had never seemed to him so warm, and rich, and cosy, as during this last pilgrimage to his father's room. It was not his taste; but in its own substantial, <b>lincrusta</b> way it was the acme of comfort and security. And the night was so dark and windy; the grave so cold and lonely! ...|$|E
60|$|But seriously, Robbie, {{if people}} stayed with me, {{of course they}} would pay their pension at the hotel. They would have to: except {{architect}}s. A modern architect, like modern architecture, doesn't pay. But then I know only one architect and you are hiding him somewhere from me. I {{believe that he is}} as extinct as the dado, of which now only fossil remains are found, chiefly in the vicinity of Brompton, where they are sometimes discovered by workmen excavating. They are usually embedded in the old <b>Lincrusta</b> Walton strata, and are rare consequently.|$|E
60|$|And {{among other}} right and proper possessions, this Mr. Morris {{had a wife}} and children. They were the right sort of wife, and the right sort and number of children, of course; nothing imaginative or highty-flighty about any of them, so far as Mr. Morris could see; they wore {{perfectly}} correct clothing, neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way, but just sensible; and {{they lived in a}} nice sensible house in the later Victorian sham Queen Anne style of architecture, with sham half-timbering of chocolate-painted plaster in the gables, <b>Lincrusta</b> Walton sham carved oak panels, a terrace of terra cotta to imitate stone, and cathedral glass in the front door. His boys went to good solid schools, and were put to respectable professions; his girls, in spite of a fantastic protest or so, were all married to suitable, steady, oldish young men with good prospects. And when it was a fit and proper thing for him to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was of marble, and, without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription, quietly imposing--such being the fashion of his time.|$|E
60|$|The Clandon's {{sitting room}} in the hotel. An {{expensive}} apartment on the ground floor, with a French window leading to the gardens. In {{the centre of the}} room is a substantial table, surrounded by chairs, and draped with a maroon cloth on which opulently bound hotel and railway guides are displayed. A visitor entering through the window and coming down to this central table would have the fireplace on his left, and a writing table against the wall on his right, next the door, which is further down. He would, if his taste lay that way, admire the wall decoration of <b>Lincrusta</b> Walton in plum color and bronze lacquer, with dado and cornice; the ormolu consoles in the corners; the vases on pillar pedestals of veined marble with bases of polished black wood, one {{on each side of the}} window; the ornamental cabinet next the vase on the side nearest the fireplace, its centre compartment closed by an inlaid door, and its corners rounded off with curved panes of glass protecting shelves of cheap blue and white pottery; the bamboo tea table, with folding shelves, in the corresponding space on the other side of the window; the pictures of ocean steamers and Landseer's dogs; the saddlebag ottoman in line with the door but on the other side of the room; the two comfortable seats of the same pattern on the hearthrug; and finally, on turning round and looking up, the massive brass pole above the window, sustaining a pair of maroon rep curtains with decorated borders of staid green. Altogether, a room well arranged to flatter the occupant's sense of importance, and reconcile him to a charge of a pound a day for its use.|$|E
50|$|Anaglypta is a {{range of}} {{paintable}} textured wallcoverings made from paper or vinyl. It is produced on traditional paper and paste-the-wall substrates. Anaglypta is similar to <b>Lincrusta,</b> except it is made of cheaper materials (<b>Lincrusta</b> is made from a gelled paste of linseed oil and wood flour). Because of this, Anaglypta is considerably lighter and more flexible than <b>Lincrusta.</b> However, it is less durable, especially since <b>Lincrusta</b> gets harder over time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lincrusta</b> is now {{produced}} in Morecambe, Lancashire using traditional methods. Heritage Wallcoverings Ltd acquired the <b>Lincrusta</b> operating assets in July 2014.|$|E

50|$|Other {{products}} {{devised by}} Walton included Linoleum Muralis in 1877, which became {{better known as}} <b>Lincrusta.</b> Essentially a highly durable linoleum wallcovering, <b>Lincrusta</b> could be manufactured to resemble carved plaster or wood, or even leather. It was very successful, and inspired a much cheaper imitation, Anaglypta, originally devised by one of Waltonâ€™s showroom managers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lincrusta</b> is {{a deeply}} {{embossed}} wallcovering. A British invention, it {{was the brainchild of}} inventor Frederick Walton who earlier (1860) patented linoleum floor covering. <b>Lincrusta</b> was launched in 1877 and was used in a host of applications from royal homes to railway carriages. The linseed gel continues to dry for many years, so the surface gets tougher over time. Many examples over a hundred years old can still be found throughout the world.|$|E

50|$|Frederick Edward Walton (13 March 183416 May 1928), was an English {{manufacturer}} and inventor whose invention of Linoleum in Staines was patented in 1860. He also invented <b>Lincrusta</b> in 1877.|$|E
50|$|The first {{production}} of <b>Lincrusta</b> in the United States was in 1883 in Stamford, Connecticut. There were also factories built in 1880 at Pierrefitte, near Paris, France and by 1889 at Hannover, Northern Germany.|$|E
50|$|Both {{oil-based}} and {{water-based paint}} can be successfully applied to <b>Lincrusta,</b> {{and it can}} therefore provide a base for effects from simple colour washes or marbling, scumbling, and glazing, to more elaborate gilding and ver de mer treatments.|$|E
5000|$|Many fine details {{inside the}} home remain {{original}} and intact, including its ornate fireplace and Anaglypta wallpaper {{in the dining room}} as well as the <b>Lincrusta</b> dado in the entry and along the internal staircase. The house was featured on the cable HGTV program [...] "Restore America".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lincrusta</b> is {{made from}} a paste of gelled linseed oil and wood flour spread onto a paper base. [...] It is then rolled between steel rollers, one of which has a pattern {{embossed}} upon it. [...] It was originally manufactured in Sunbury-on-Thames until 1918 when the manufacturing was moved to Darwen, Lancashire.|$|E
50|$|A central {{hall with}} pressed-metal ceilings, <b>lincrusta</b> wall {{coverings}} and flat-paneled wainscoting opens {{up from the}} entrance vestibule. A finely crafted staircase goes up from the side, its landing lit by a stained glass window. There are Greek Revival moldings in every room on the first floor, and Italianate marble fireplace surrounds in the parlors.|$|E
50|$|Seeing this as {{a threat}} to <b>Lincrusta,</b> Walton decided not to {{progress}} it, so Palmer patented the product, parted from Walton, moved to Lancaster. There he began production of Anaglypta in partnership with Storey Bros. in 1887. The partnership was ordered to be dissolved in 1893 by the courts, following a dispute concerning profit sharing.|$|E
50|$|Cassagnes {{was born}} outside Paris, France, on September 23, 1926. His parents owned and {{operated}} a bakery, where {{he worked as a}} teenager. An allergy to flour forced him to seek another line of work, and he became an electrician for the <b>Lincrusta</b> Company, a French manufacturer which produced picture frame covers using an aluminum powder.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{of the house is}} largely mauve Ohio brick and is trimmed with Lake Superior sandstone. The interiors are tastefully done in lavish materials, as was the style at the time. There is Circassian walnut paneling in the French Parlor room, and embossed and polychromed <b>Lincrusta</b> Walton wallpaper in many rooms on the first floor.|$|E
5000|$|Commonly {{found in}} Victorian {{properties}} and restoration projects, <b>Lincrusta</b> is also frequently used in commercial {{projects such as}} hotel foyers, bars, restaurants and casinos. Notable installations included six staterooms on the Titanic, the White House, the Winchester Mystery House [...] and Roseland Cottage in Woodstock, Connecticut, {{where it has been}} completely restored and is on view to the public.|$|E
50|$|Anaglypta and <b>Lincrusta</b> came {{together}} again in 1931 {{when they were}} merged to form the Relief Decorations branch of Wallpaper Manufacturers (WPM) and manufactured in Darwen, Lancashire. After a period of stability Relief Decorations was sold to Reed International in the 1960s and with considerable investment the first duplex product made entirely of wood pulp was launched - this is now marketed as Anaglypta Original.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the house}} remains in {{excellent}} historic condition, with original Gothic furniture and embossed <b>Lincrusta</b> Walton wall decoration. The house, {{known locally as}} The Pink House, is currently painted coral pink, and located on Woodstock Hill Common. Roseland's parterre garden contain twenty-one flowerbeds with more than 4,000 annuals bordered in boxwood, in their original 1850 pattern, and now form part of Connecticut's Historic Gardens.|$|E
5000|$|The mansion's Italianate {{exterior}} is limestone and Ohio sandstone. [...] Although elegant, the restrained {{design of}} the faÃ§ade belies the wealth of detail found within. The house's interiors are decorated with {{a large amount of}} marble (17 types, giving it the nickname of the [...] "Marble Palace"), onyx, alabaster, carved and inlaid wood, glazed and patterned tiles by Minton Hollins & Co. and J. & J. G. Low Art Tile Works, mosaics, and <b>Lincrusta.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During {{the colonial}} period in the United States, {{embossed}} leather panels were occasionally used as an accent, as a dado, on a screen, or above a chimney. In {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century, leather panels were revived and used in select rooms of mansions such as libraries. Introduced in the 1860s as [...] "oil leather papers", the coverings later became known as [...] "leather paper" [...] and were offered in catalogs from Paul Balin in Paris' Birge in Buffalo, New York; and Jeffrey & Co. and Woollams & Co.. They included embossing, gild and painted finishes designed to imitate leather wallpaper and were used to line furniture and cabinets. Their use continued in fancy homes of the late 19th and early 20th century decorating <b>Lincrusta</b> and Anaglypta were competing products [...] Leather papers were often made up of a series of paper laminates which were forced into shape with a mold, while <b>Lincrusta</b> is a patented composite material, and Anaglypta is a simthat were not designed to look like leather wallpaper. Rottman, Strome & Co. became a major producer based in England with manufacturing in Japan. Lutson Goudleder made the imitation leather coverings in southern France and they were also made in Poland.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of Anaglypta {{can be traced}} back to the invention of <b>Lincrusta</b> in 1877 by Frederick Walton. It became an instant success because it was the first washable wallcovering and appealed to the Victorians because of its sanitary properties as well as its durability and ornate effects. Originally made on a linen backing, it was however, quite rigid. Because of this, an employee called Thomas John Palmer invented a similar product which, being made from wood pulp and cotton, was lighter and more flexible. This was to become Anaglypta (from the Greek words 'Ana' (meaning raised) and 'Glypta' (meaning Cameo)).|$|E
50|$|This area {{is given}} a {{decorative}} treatment different from that for {{the upper part of}} the wall; for example panelling, wainscoting or <b>lincrusta.</b> The purpose of the dado treatment to a wall is both aesthetic and functional. Historically, the panelling below the dado rail was installed to cover the lower part of the wall which was subject to stains associated with rising damp; additionally it provided protection from furniture and passing traffic. The dado rail itself is sometimes referred to misleadingly as a chair rail, though its function is principally aesthetic and not to protect the wall from chair backs.|$|E

5000|$|The Etch A Sketch toy {{was invented}} in the late 1950s by AndrÃ© Cassagnes, an {{electrician}} with <b>Lincrusta</b> Co, who named the toy L'Ecran Magique (The Magic Screen). In 1959, he took his drawing toy to the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, Germany. The Ohio Art Company saw it but {{had no interest in}} the toy. When Ohio Art saw the toy a second time, they decided {{to take a chance on}} the product. L'Ecran Magique was soon renamed the Etch A Sketch and became the most popular drawing toy in the business. After a complex series of negotiations, The Ohio Art Company launched the toy in the United States in time for the 1960 Christmas season with the name [...] "Etch A Sketch". Ohio Art supported the toy with a televised advertising campaign.|$|E
50|$|India Mill is {{now home}} to many companies, {{including}} Brookhouse (producers of aeroplane parts) and Capita Group, which runs TV licensing. Since the 1950s, the textile industry has strongly declined in the region, although many industrial buildings from the period survive, now used for other purposes. India Mill and its famous chimney have been sold in a Â£12 million deal. Among Darwen's other famous industries are Crown Paints, formerly Walpamur Paints, the earliest British paint manufacturer, which actually named one of its paints 'Darwen Satin Finish'. Crown Wallpaper manufactured wallpaper, <b>Lincrusta</b> and Anaglypta in the town. ICI Acrylics (now called Lucite International) was where acrylic glass (Perspex for windows and signage, and Sani-ware or Lucite used for the manufacture of baths and shower trays) was invented; it is still manufactured in two separate plants within the town. Spitfire canopies and (later) coloured polythene washing-up bowls were first made here.|$|E

The Hallam Tower Hotel, owned by Trust Houses Group Ltd, opened on 24 March 1965 and at opening boasted 136 bedrooms over its eleven stories, employed nearly 150 staff members and covered a three and a half acre site. The hotel included facilities such as the Vulcan Room restaurant which featured a colour scheme of [...] "orange, yellow, pale wrapping paper brown and sour green", the Sheffield Plate Grill (a quick service buttery), decorated with [...] "a series of Sheffield trade signs, none of them later than 1910 and most of them mid-19th century" [...] and a colour scheme of pink, red, black and white, and the Downstairs Bar, described in the original press release for the hotel thus; [...] "A dark intimate room with a club-like atmosphere enlivened by turquoise blue upholstery.

50|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{trade between}} Europe and Britain evaporated, {{resulting}} in the gradual decline of the wallpaper industry in Britain. However, {{the end of the}} war saw a massive demand in Europe for British goods which had been inaccessible during the wars, including cheap, colourful wallpaper. The development of steam-powered printing presses in Britain in 1813 allowed manufacturers to mass-produce wallpaper, reducing its price and so making it affordable to working-class people. Wallpaper enjoyed a huge boom in popularity in the nineteenth century, seen as a cheap and very effective way of brightening up cramped and dark rooms in working-class areas. It became almost the norm in most areas of middle-class homes, but remained relatively little used in public buildings and offices, with patterns generally being avoided in such locations. In the latter half of the century <b>Lincrusta</b> and Anaglypta, not strictly wallpapers, became popular competitors, especially below a dado rail. They could be painted and washed, and were a good deal tougher, though also more expensive.|$|E
50|$|The Isham-Terry House {{occupies}} a prominent and highly visible location {{just north of}} Interstate 84 outside downtown Hartford, at {{the northwest corner of}} High and Walnut Streets, and adjacent to the city's police department headquarters. It is a roughly cubical painted brick structure, two stories in height, with a low-pitch roof. A three-story tower projecting from its southwest corner adds visual prominence. The roof eaves are deep, with decorative Italianate brackets for support. Windows are on the two main floors are set in rectangular openings, with narrow oblong windows in the attic level of the main block. On the street-facing facades, the second-floor windows are topped by gabled or segmented-arch pediments with brackets on either side. The first floor of the facade facining Walnut Street is sheltered by a porch supported by slender clustered columns, with round-arch openings that have carved woodwork in the spandrels, and a low spindled balustrade. A similar porch shelters the main entrance facing High Street, and balconies on the tower share similar features. The building interior is well preserved, with <b>lincrusta</b> wall covering, ornate woodwork, and glass chandeliers.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} estate {{came into the}} {{possession}} of private owners. From 1824 until 1857 the silk trader Johann Carl Jouanne lived in the manor year-round with his family, and rebuilt the whole house to suit his requirements. Nearly all of the older baroque decorations were destroyed and only some paintings of Rode survived. Also around 1840, the buildings of the farmyard were given their present appearance {{in the style of}} Italian country mansions following the example of the Bornstedt Crown Estate(Krongut Bornstedt) near Potsdam. Under Jouanne the first brewery was built on the farmyard to produce hard liquor from potatoes (Kartoffelschnaps). From 1880 to 1883 under the last private owner of the manor Wilhelm A. J. Wrede, a trader and producer of sugar and hard liquor, the manor house was given its final and current appearance as a little castle or chÃ¢teau {{in the style of the}} Neo-Renaissance. The Berlin architect Carl Busse reshaped the house into a representative upper-class home with a new bath, stair tower, and a magnificent new interior in the new styles of the German elite. Today in the rooms of the museum, one can see furniture and objects from this time, like an original <b>lincrusta</b> wallpaper, which is rare in Germany and one of the few remaining Victorian crystal perpetual table fountains produced by J.
