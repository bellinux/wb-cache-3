The availability of channels for secondary users is determined in the spectrum sensing phase by energy detection.

40|$|Ultrasound imaging is a well-established, noninvasive and {{relatively}} low cost method {{for assessing the}} cardiac function. By providing dense image volumes in real-time, three-dimensional echocardiography could improve and automatize the diagnostic by professionals. But the limited speed of sound still prevents the acquisition of large fields of view at frame rates sufficient to assess the complex dynamics of a beating heart. To increase the frame rate, parallelizations of both the transmission and reception processes is being proposed. In this thesis, the challenges of Multi-Line Transmission (MLT) and two Synthetic Transmit Aperture (STA) techniques for imaging the heart in real-time 3 -D when an optimal image quality is required are addressed across four scientific publications. When transmitting multiple focused ultrasound pulses in parallel, interactions between the simultaneous beams are prone to generate artifacts, aka. MLT crosstalks. Cross-talks appear as additional clutter in the image, notably at every location where the edge waves of one beam overlap with the main-lobe of another beam, both on transmission and reception. To isolate the parallel beams, we propose to combine MLT with the <b>low</b> transmit <b>side-lobe</b> levels of second harmonic imaging. 10 to 15 dB reductions of transmit cross-talks are observed both in vitro and in vivo. Beam isolation may also be achieved using 3 -D dispositions. When aligning the beams along the transducer transverse diagonal, reductions of up to 30 dB of both transmit and receive cross-talks are observed in simulations backed-up by water tank measurements. This allow a potential increase of the frame rate by a factor five without visible image degradation. Using parallel receive beams with STA focusing, the coherent combination of data acquired over successive transmit events allow to recover the spatial resolution and contrast while maintaining higher frame rates. However, {{the success of this}} combination is no longer guaranteed in presence of rapid displacements such as observed in the myocardium or the blood. The influence of motion is studied for STA applications combining two or many transmit events: Synthetic Transmit Beamformation, both in 2 -D and 3 -D, and Coherent Plane Wave Compounding. In presence of significant axial motion, lateral image shifts and deteriorations of the focusing capability are observed, resulting in losses of contrast and SNR. Motion compensation algorithms based on cross-correlation are introduced to correct for the axial motion component. Such algorithms are robust, computationally inexpensive and their necessity is demonstrated through both simulations and in vivo experiments. PhD i medisinsk teknologiPhD in Medical Technolog...|$|R

The unblocked aperture results in increased aperture efficiency and lower side-lobe levels compared to a traditional on-axis configuration. The <b>low</b> <b>side-lobe</b> level reduces the noise contribution due to ground pick-up but also makes the antenna less susceptible to ground-based RFI sources. The addition of extra shielding on the sub-reflector provides a further reduction of ground pick-up. The optical design of the SKA 1 -Mid reflector antenna has been tweaked using advanced EM simulation tools in combination with sophisticated models for sky, atmospheric and ground noise contributions. This optimal antenna design in combination with very low noise, partially cryogenic, receivers and wide instantaneous bandwidth provide excellent receiving sensitivity in combination with instrumental flexibility to accommodate {{a wide range of}} astronomical observation modes...|$|E
40|$|A compact, dual-frequency, dual-polarization, wide-angle-scanning {{antenna system}} has been {{developed}} {{as part of an}} airborne instrument for measuring rainfall. This system is an upgraded version of a prior single-frequency airborne rain radar antenna system and was designed to satisfy stringent requirements. One particularly stringent combination of requirements is to generate two dual-polarization (horizontal and vertical polarizations) beams at both frequencies (13. 405 and 35. 605 GHz) {{in such a way that}} the beams radiated from the antenna point in the same direction, have 3 -dB angular widths that match within 25 percent, and have low sidelobe levels over a wide scan angle at each polarization-and-frequency combination. In addition, the system is required to exhibit low voltage standing-wave ratios at both frequencies. The system (see figure) includes a flat elliptical scanning reflector and a stationary offset paraboloidal reflector illuminated by a common-aperture feed system that comprises a corrugated horn with four input ports one port for each of the four frequency-and-polarization combinations. The feed horn is designed to simultaneously (1) under-illuminate the reflectors 35. 605 GHz and (2) illuminate the reflectors with a 15 -dB edge taper at 13. 405 GHz. The scanning mirror is rotated in azimuth to scan the antenna beam over an angular range of 20 in the cross-track direction for wide swath coverage, and in elevation to compensate for the motion of the aircraft. The design of common-aperture feed horn makes it possible to obtain the required absolute gain and <b>low</b> <b>side-lobe</b> levels in wide-angle beam scanning. The combination of the common-aperture feed horn with the small (0. 3) focal-length-to-diameter ratio of the paraboloidal reflector makes it possible for the overall system to be compact enough that it can be mounted on a DC- 8 airplane...|$|E
40|$|Interference in {{radio-relay}} links {{caused by}} multipath propagation {{can be reduced}} {{by the use of}} receiving antennas with adaptive beam orientation. High-performance radio-relay antennas with low sidelobes and high polarization purity frequently consist of dual-offset reflectors with low edge illumination and feeds with low cross-polarization level. A simple means for achieving beam scanning with an antenna is the use of a dual-feed, which consists of two corrugated horns penetrating into each other. Measurements of such a feed were done with a 3 m offset Gregorian antenna (''shell antenna'') in the frequency band 9 - 11 GHz. It results that the phase centres of the dual-feed are not located as close as it would correspond to their geometrical distance. For this reason, the cross-over level of the two main beams of the antenna was by 2. 5 dB lower than expected. This effect can be compensated for by filling the feed horns partially with a dielectric foam. With an axial distance of 38 mm (corresponding to 1. 27 wavelengths) a cross-over level of - 2. 5 to - 3 dB was achieved. The <b>low</b> <b>side-lobe</b> level in the horizontal antenna pattern remains unchanged. However, the near-in sidelobes in the vertical pattern are increased. The maximum cross-polarization level amounts to - 27 dB (in comparison: - 31 dB for a single-feed horn) in the investigated frequency region. The cross-polarization can be diminished by enlarging the axial distance of the two horns, resulting in a decreased cross-over level. Another method for diminishing the cross-polarization level is the use of a feed with a larger beamwidth. But in this case, the sidelobes rise in the horizontal pattern. Moreover, the cross-over level is by 0. 2 dB to 0. 5 dB lower than {{in the case of the}} dual-feed with lower edge illumination. (orig.)
