5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of <b>light.</b> <b>Color</b> images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A <b>light</b> <b>color</b> scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

25|$|A rare {{variety of}} natural sapphire, known as color-change sapphire, {{exhibits}} different colors in different <b>light.</b> <b>Color</b> change sapphires are blue in outdoor light and purple under incandescent indoor light, or green to gray-green in daylight and pink to reddish-violet in incandescent <b>light.</b> <b>Color</b> change sapphires {{come from a}} variety of locations, including Thailand and Tanzania. The color-change effect is caused by the interaction of the sapphire, which absorbs specific wavelengths of light, and the light-source, whose spectral output varies depending upon the illuminant. Transition-metal impurities in the sapphire, such as chromium and vanadium, are responsible for the color change.|$|E
25|$|Although the IUCN said {{both males}} and females are not dimorphic and have the same color pattern, other sources say the male is black with <b>light</b> <b>color</b> {{in the back of the}} body and the female is gray with black while the {{juvenile}} is yellow and black.|$|E

25|$|Red is {{the most}} used color on Japanese {{emergency}} vehicles. The Japanese police uses light bars mounted on a raised (mechanical) platform {{to make them more}} visible over congested streets. Rotating lights are most commonly used. But some newer vehicles have LED light bars installed. Vehicles with any other <b>light</b> <b>color</b> than red are security or engineers. Wig-wag headlights are not used.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts {{are highly}} dynamic—they {{circulate}} and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally pinch {{in two to}} reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like <b>light</b> <b>color</b> and intensity. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, contain their own DNA, which {{is thought to be}} inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.|$|E

25|$|For {{the best}} quality, yields {{need to be}} kept in check as the vine is notably {{vigorous}} and prone to overproduction. In Chianti, most quality conscious producers limit their yields to 3 pounds (1.5 kg) of fruit per vine. Wine made from high-yielding vines tend to produce wines with <b>light</b> <b>color,</b> high acidity, and less alcohol, which are likely to oxidize ("brown") prematurely due to a lower concentration of tannins and anthocyanins (anti-oxidants). Fully developed grapes are typically 19mm long x 17mm wide, with an average weight of 3 grams.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{made from}} Sangiovese tend to exhibit the grape's {{naturally}} high acidity {{as well as}} moderate to high tannin content and <b>light</b> <b>color.</b> Blending can have a pronounced effect on enhancing or tempering the wine's quality. The dominant nature of Cabernet can sometimes have a disproportionate influence on the wine, even overwhelming Sangiovese character with black cherry, black currant, mulberry and plum fruit. Even percentages as low as 4 to 5% of Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm the Sangiovese if the fruit quality is not high. As the wine ages, some of these Cabernet dominant flavours can soften and reveal more Sangiovese character.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designers}} sometimes select filters {{by color}} temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using discharge type lamps produce a {{light of a}} considerably higher color temperature than do tungsten lamps, using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with HID lamps, commonly producing light of 6000–7000K, are fitted with 3200K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like <b>light.</b> <b>Color</b> temperature {{may also be a}} factor when selecting lamps, since each is likely to have a different color temperature.|$|E

25|$|Today's LIRR {{signal system}} {{has evolved from}} its legacy Pennsylvania Railroad-based system. The {{railroad}} utilizes a variety of wayside railroad signals including position <b>light,</b> <b>color</b> light and dwarf signals. In addition, much of the LIRR {{is equipped with a}} bi-directional Pulse code cab signaling called automatic speed control (ASC), though portions of the railway still retain single direction wayside only signalling. Unlike other railroads which began using color light signals in the 20th century, the LIRR did not begin using signals with color lights on its above ground sections until 2006. Some portions of the railway lack automatic signals and cab signals completely, instead train and track car movements are governed only by timetable and verbal/written train orders.|$|E
25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple <b>light.</b> <b>Color</b> temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E
500|$|The breed's coat {{pattern is}} that of a ticked tabby. That is, {{individual}} hair strands have alternating sections of dark and <b>light</b> <b>color,</b> typically two dark bands separated by two light bands, with a dark color at the tip. The underside, including the chest, muzzle and chin, takes the color of the light bands. The Singapura is recognized by cat registries in only one color, the sepia agouti, described as [...] "dark brown ticking on a warm old ivory ground color".|$|E

Goodridge, aged forty when she completed the miniature, depicts breasts which appear imbued with a [...] "balance, paleness, and buoyancy" [...] by the harmony of <b>light,</b> <b>color,</b> and balance. The surrounding cloth draws the viewer to focus on them, leading to the body being [...] "erased".|$|E
500|$|Morchella frustrata was {{described}} as new to science in a 2012 publication by Michael Kuo and colleagues. The report resulted from the Morel Data Collection Project, which aimed to clarify aspects of the biology, taxonomy and distribution of North American Morchella, and described 14 new morel species. The type locality was in Placer County, California. The morel was previously referred to as phylogenetic species (i.e., defined by DNA sequence rather than morphological characteristics) Mel-2 in a study the year before, and informally as the [...] "mountain blond morel". Despite its <b>light</b> <b>color,</b> M.frustrata belongs to the Elata clade along with other black morels, including M.tomentosa and M.angusticeps. The specific epithet frustrata refers to the [...] "frustrating combination of black and yellow morel features that characterize the species." ...|$|E
