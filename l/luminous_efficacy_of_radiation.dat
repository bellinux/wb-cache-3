To revolutionize general lighting to reduce its energy consumption, high-efficiency, high-quality light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are necessary.

The initial precursors for the synthesis were used in oleate form rather than in powder form, resulting in a nearly defect-free photoluminescence (PL) emission. The change in Zn/In ratio tunes the percentage incorporation of Cu in CNCs. These highly monodisperse Cu-doped ZnInS CNCs having variable Zn/In ratios possess peak emission wavelength tunable from 550 to 650  nm in the visible spectrum. The quantum yield (QY) of these synthesized Cd-free CNCs increases from 6.0 to 65.0 % after coating with a ZnS shell. The CNCs possessing emission from a mixed contribution of deep trap and dopant states to only dominant dopant-related Stokes-shifted emission are realized by a careful control of stoichiometric ratio of different reactant precursors during synthesis. The origin of this shift in emission was understood by using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy studies. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, these blue excitable Cu-doped ZnInS/ZnS CNCs have been integrated with commercial blue LEDs to generate white-light emission (WLE).

Additionally, the variation of Zn/In ratios in the core synthesis tunes the emission spectrum from 550 to 650  nm of visible spectrum and has a considerable effect on percentage contribution of different emission pathways. It has been realized that the successful incorporation of Zn ions into the core of quatenery CNCs during the shell growth procedure completely eliminates the zinc vacancy-related emission and, therefore, leads to highly efficient and dominant dopant-induced Stokes-shifted emission. Based on detailed optical studies, the recombination mechanism for these Cu-doped ternary CNCs has been proposed and explained.

40|$|Recently, a group {{including}} the present authors {{developed a new}} color rendering (fidelity) measure, approved by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and henceforth {{referred to as the}} IES Rf, that has two major updates with respect to the general color rendering index Ra of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). First, it proposes an update to the more perceptually uniform CAM 02 -UCS color space. Secondly, instead of using only a small number (8) of moderately saturated samples to determine a general color fidelity index, the IES method proposes using a set of 99 samples uniformly distributed in color space. In addition to the latter, the sample set has one other important property: spectral uniformity. This ensures the sample set is not wavelength biased: all wavelengths contribute equivalently to the general color fidelity score. This paper explores the importance of these two updates for color fidelity evaluation. It shows how the color space update results in a substantial spread of the new color fidelity scores relative to the old CIE Ra values and how the sample set update results in an overall reduction of color fidelity scores for most light source spectra with high CIE Ra (≥ 80) and high LER (<b>luminous</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation)</b> values, especially those with narrowband or spiked spectral features. It is shown that calculated color fidelity scores are affected by the degree of sample set spectral uniformity and that, in the absence of sample set spectral uniformity, light source spectra can be tuned to yield anomalously high CIE Ra values without necessarily yielding an increase in actual perceived color fidelity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The CIE color {{rendering}} (fidelity) index (CRI) has remained unchanged for over four decades. Most, if not all, of its components could be updated to more state-of-the-art methods. One {{of the most}} critical components of any {{color rendering}} (fidelity) metric is the test sample selection. This article therefore addresses the importance of uniform sampling of wavelength space to avoid selective optimization— that is, taking advantage of the unequal contributions of different wavelength regions to the general color rendering score—of light source spectral power distributions. It summarizes the development of a mathematical sample set with undistorted spectral sensitivity, the HL 17 set. The set is used in a recently proposed update, the CRI 2012 general color rendering index. To assess the impact of the spectrally uniform sample set on color fidelity scores, the CRI 2012 index values for each of a set of 139 lamps were compared with those of the CIE CRI. In addition, the impact of updating the other components was investigated. A mean and maximum absolute difference of respectively 5. 9 and 21. 8 index units were found between the CRI 2012 and CIE CRI, although the largest part—respectively 4. 03 and 19. 7 index units—was shown {{to be the result of}} updating the color difference engine and the switch to the CIE 10 ◦ observer. The analysis also indicated possible past spectral selective optimization of some warm-white tri-band fluorescent sources for high <b>luminous</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> (LER) and (just) sufficient CIE Ra values by taking advantage of the spectral nonuniformity of the CIE reflectance set.

By considering {{most of the}} lighting sources to rely on fluorescent lamps today, solid-state lighting has a great potential especially with recent advances on efficiency and color quality of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). One {{of the most promising}} approaches for the current white LED technology is based on the use of color-conversion materials. In recent years semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) have arisen as an important class of color-convertors because of their tunable and superior optical properties and today there are various prototypes and commercial products. Recently, a new material system involving macrocrystals of NQDs has been introduced. In this thesis, different types of NQD macrocrystals are developed and studied for the white LED application. These macrocrystals of NQDs are produced by forming ionic salts in the presence of water soluble NQDs. This enhances the stability of NQDs wrapped in salt solids and allows for high integration capability in powder form to current LED technology employing commercial encapsulants.

40|$|For {{high-quality}} general lighting, a {{white light}} source {{is required to}} exhibit good photometric and colorimetric performance along {{with a high level}} of electrical efficiency. For example, a warm white shade is desirable for indoors, corresponding to correlated color temperatures ≥ 4000 K, together with color rendering indices ≥ 90. Additionally, the <b>luminous</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> optical <b>radiation</b> (LER) should be high, preferably ≥ 380 lm/W opt. Conventional white LEDs cannot currently satisfy these requirements simultaneously. On the other hand, color-conversion white LEDs (WLEDs) integrated with quantum dots (QDs) can simultaneously reach such high levels of photometric and colorimetric performance. However, their electrical efficiency performance and limits have been unknown. To understand their potential of luminous efficiency (lm/Welect), we modeled and studied different QD-WLED architectures based on layered QD films and QD blends, all integrated on blue LED chips. The architecture of red, yellow and green emitting QD films (in this order from the chip outwards) is demonstrated to outperform the rest. In this case, for photometrically efficient spectra, the maximum achievable LE is predicted to be 327 lm/W elect. Using a state-of-the-art blue LED reported with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 81. 3 %, the overall WLED PCE is shown to be 69 %. To achieve LEs of 100, 150 and 200 lm/Welect, the required minimum quantum efficiencies of the color-converting QDs are found to be 39, 58 and 79 %, respectively. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R
40|$|Recently the {{photometric}} {{conditions for}} ultra-efficient solid-state lighting {{have been discussed}} [1 - 2]. These studies show that a <b>luminous</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> optical <b>radiation</b> at 408 lm/Wopt and a color rendering index (CRI) of 90 at a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3000 K are achievable at the same time. For this purpose light emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting in blue, green, yellow, and red colors at 463, 530, 573, and 614 nm with relative optical power levels of 1 / 8, 2 / 8, 2 / 8, and 3 / 8, are required, respectively [1 - 2]. Although InxGa 1 -xN material system is capable to cover the whole visible by changing the In composition (x), it is technically extremely challenging to obtain efficient green/yellow light emitting diodes especially at those wavelengths (i. e., at 530 nm and 573 nm, respectively) due to reduced internal quantum efficiency [2 - 4]. Furthermore, by using the (Al xGa 1 -x) 1 -yInyP quaternary alloy {{it is also possible}} to cover from 650 nm to 580 nm. However, the efficiencies significantly decrease towards green. Therefore, there exists a significant gap in the green-yellow spectral regions (known as "the green gap") to make efficient light emitting diodes. To address this green gap problem, we propose and demonstrate proof-of-concept nanocrystal (NCs) hybridized green/yellow light emitting diodes that rely on both radiative energy transfer and nonradiative energy transfer (i. e., FRET-Förster resonance energy transfer) for color conversion on near-ultraviolet (near-UV) LEDs...|$|R
