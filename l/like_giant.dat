25|$|Just before daybreak at {{the depth}} of the dark and rain, the waiting women {{and all the rest of}} the wakefull town heard the great crash as the booms burst, and the cry of the whistle {{signaled}} the men's defeat. Logs from thousands of trees boiled over the broken dams, smashed together in a grinding roar and surged on down the current <b>like</b> <b>giant</b> toothpicks tossed by some elemental energy.|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That {{is the key to}} why animals <b>like</b> <b>giant</b> tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Severan Dynasty in 235 the Empire {{entered into}} 50-year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were {{numerous}} putsches by generals who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions - Britain, Spain and North Africa - were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more <b>like</b> <b>giant</b> raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The Persian Empire in the East invaded several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.|$|E

One of the great debates in advance of the impact was whether the effects of the impact of such small bodies would be noticeable from Earth, apart from a flash as they disintegrated <b>like</b> <b>giant</b> meteors. [...] The most optimistic prediction was that large, asymmetric ballistic fireballs would rise above the limb of Jupiter and into sunlight to be visible from Earth.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time alongside Sugarland front woman Jennifer Nettles, at the ACM Awards held by the Academy of Country Music on April 3, 2011. She was also a special guest star on the tenth season of American Idol on April 14, 2011. The performance featured Rihanna in a floor-length, heavily textured rose-colored gown, which she adorned as she appeared from behind flowing ceiling height curtains. Kara Warner of MTV News complimented the performance, saying [...] "the 23-year-old rocked the house with an ethereal performance of her ballad 'California King Bed. A writer of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "It's a classy, laid-back performance with Rihanna in a lovely gown, backed up by interpretative dancers caressing large pieces of fabric that are probably meant to evoke bed sheets, but look a bit more <b>like</b> <b>giant</b> strips of toilet paper hanging from the ceiling. But either way, this is quite nice." [...] In March 2011, Rihanna was appointed spokeswoman for the [...] "100 Years of Skin Care" [...] Nivea Commercial campaign, which featured [...] "California King Bed" [...] as the song used in the commercials. As part of promotion for the campaign, Rihanna {{performed the}} song at private events in several European cities in May 2011, including Hamburg, Milan and Paris. The song was also performed on NBC's Today show on May 27, 2011, as part of their Summer Concert Series. The set also featured Rihanna performing her previous US Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits from Loud; [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", [...] "What's My Name?" [...] and [...] "S". The song is included on the set-list of the Loud Tour (2011).|$|E

[...] Instead the river was divided into reaches known as the lower, middle, and upper Columbia, each one separated by {{a long stretch of}} essentially unnavigable rapids.

2500|$|To an extent, Mahagonny is {{an opera}} that satirizes operas. Brecht said that [...] "t attacks {{the society that}} needs operas of such a sort" [...] and Weill said that it [...] "pays {{conscious}} tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and Mahagonny in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the deus ex machina tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free {{to do what they}} want, and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around <b>like</b> <b>giant</b> slabs of meat and the [...] "love" [...] is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The [...] "Mandalay Song" [...] also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In Mahagonny, operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.|$|E

60|$|It is {{the spring}} of 1582-3. The gray March skies are {{curdling}} hard and high above black mountain peaks.
