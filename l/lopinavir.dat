However, a systematic review of the safety of efavirenz use in humans during the first trimester found no increase in birth defects among women using the drug.

40|$|Nonlinear mixed-effects {{modeling}} {{was applied}} to explore the relationship between <b>lopinavir</b> and ritonavir concentrations over 72 h following drug cessation and also to assess other <b>lopinavir</b> and ritonavir dosing strategies compared to the standard 400 -mg– 100 -mg twice-daily dose. Data from 16 healthy volunteers were included. Possible covariates influencing <b>lopinavir</b> and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were also assessed.

The model was evaluated {{by means of a}} visual predictive check and external validation. A maximum-effect model in which ritonavir inhibited the elimination of <b>lopinavir</b> best described the relationship between ritonavir concentrations and <b>lopinavir</b> clearance (CL/F). A ritonavir concentration of 0. 06 mg/liter was associated with a 50 % maximum inhibition of the <b>lopinavir</b> CL/F. The population prediction of the <b>lopinavir</b> CL/F in the absence of ritonavir was 21. 6 liters/h (relative standard error, 14. 0 %), and the apparent volume of distribution and absorption rate constant were 55. 3 liters (relative standard error, 10. 2 %) and 0. 57 h− 1 (relative standard error, 0. 39 %), respectively. Overall, 92 % and 94 % of the observed concentrations were encompassed by the 95 % prediction intervals for <b>lopinavir</b> and ritonavir, respectively, which is indicative of an adequate model.

The purpose of this thesis was to characterize the factors limiting placental passage and fetal exposure to <b>lopinavir.</b> These factors include <b>lopinavir</b> plasma protein binding and uptake, cellular binding, and efflux of <b>lopinavir</b> in the placental trophoblast cells. First, we determined the unbound fraction of <b>lopinavir</b> in cord blood and characterized the binding of <b>lopinavir</b> to α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA), and displacement by ritonavir. Serum was obtained from cord blood from placentae obtained after cesarean section of healthy non-HIV infected women (n= 4). The unbound fraction of <b>lopinavir</b> in serum obtained from this cord blood was 0. 02 ± 0. 01. The unbound fraction of <b>lopinavir</b> in separately obtained maternal serum samples (n= 4) was 0. 009 ± 0. 001, which was not significantly different from that observed with cord serum samples. Varying concentrations of <b>lopinavir,</b> AAG, and HSA in buffer solutions were then used to characterize the <b>lopinavir</b> binding. The data were fit to obtain the number of binding sites (N) and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). Binding of <b>lopinavir</b> to AAG (7 - 23 µM) was saturable with KD of 5. 0 ± 1. 1 µM and N of 1. 2 ± 0. 2. At low HSA concentrations (15 - 152 µM), <b>lopinavir</b> binding KD was 24. 3 ± 8. 7 µM and N was 1. 1 ± 0. 4; however at 758 µM, <b>lopinavir</b> binding was essentially unsaturable. Additionally, <b>lopinavir</b> binding to AAG and HSA was not sensitive to ritonavir within the range of therapeutic concentrations. Next, we examined <b>lopinavir</b> uptake, binding and efflux using the BeWo human trophoblast cell culture model. BeWo cells were treated with 3 H-lopinavir in the absence or presence of inhibitors of ATP- Binding Cassette transporters. The radioactivity was then measured in the buffer and the cells after incubating for different time intervals and at two temperatures. Verapamil (100 µM) stimulated apparent efflux of 3 H <b>lopinavir</b> by two fold, possibly due to ABCC 2. In addition, this efflux process was 75 % inhibited by reduced temperature (4 °C). Ritonavir (10 µM) also stimulated 3 H-lopinavir efflux, whereas GF 120918 (1 µM) had no effect. Reduced temperature (4 °C), verapamil (100 µM) or ritonavir (10 µM) individually did not significantly affect the binding of 3 H-lopinavir to cell homogenates. However, slight but significant binding displacement by verapamil at 4 °C was observed. 3 H <b>lopinavir</b> uptake was not sensitive to verapamil, bromosulfophthalein, taurocholate or to reduced temperature suggesting uptake involves diffusion rather than Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide transporters.

Regression analyses were used to determine associations between plasma <b>lopinavir</b> concentrations and fasting and 2 hour plasma glucose, fasting cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations. RESULTS: There were 84 participants (72 women) with a median age of 36 years. The median blood pressure, body mass index and waist: hip ratio were 108 / 72 mmHg, 26 kg/m 2 and 0. 89 respectively.

Regression analyses were used to determine associations between plasma <b>lopinavir</b> concentrations and fasting and 2 hour plasma glucose, fasting cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations. Results There were 84 participants (72 women) with a median age of 36 years. The median blood pressure, body mass index and waist: hip ratio were 108 / 72 mmHg, 26 kg/m 2 and 0. 89 respectively. The median CD 4 count was 478 cells/mm 3. Median duration on <b>lopinavir</b> was 18. 5 months. The median (interquartile range) <b>lopinavir</b> concentration was 8. 0 (5. 2 to 12. 8) μg/mL. Regression analyses showed no significant association between <b>lopinavir</b> pre-dose concentrations and fasting cholesterol (β-coefficient − 0. 04 (95 % CI − 0. 07 to 0. 00)), triglycerides (β-coefficient − 0. 01 (95 % CI − 0. 04 to 0. 02)), fasting glucose (β-coefficient − 0. 01 (95 % CI − 0. 04 to 0. 02)), or 2 -hour glucose concentrations (β-coefficient − 0. 02 (95 % CI − 0. 09 to 0. 06)). <b>Lopinavir</b> concentrations above the median were not associated with presence of dyslipidaemia or dysglycaemia. Conclusions There was no association between <b>lopinavir</b> plasma concentrations and plasma lipid and glucose concentrations. </p...|$|E
