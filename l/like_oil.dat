25|$|Overglaze decorations of earthenware, Faience or {{porcelain}} were traditionally {{made with}} carefully outlined designs that were then colored in. Later designs represented flowers, landscapes or portraits with little overpainting or blending of the colors. In the 20th century china painting techniques became more <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> painting, with blended colors and designs in which attention to light gives three-dimensional effects. More recently a style more like watercolor painting {{has become more}} common.|$|E
25|$|Launching {{materials}} from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies {{could come from}} the Moon, a near-Earth object (NEO), Phobos, or Deimos. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no atmospheric drag on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> shale), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and kerogen hydrocarbons, {{as well as some}} nitrogen compounds.|$|E
25|$|Some form critics posit {{conflicting}} {{descriptions of}} manna as derived from different lore, with the description in Numbers being from the Jahwist tradition, and the description in Exodus being from the later Priestly tradition. The Babylonian Talmud {{states that the}} differences in description were due to the taste varying depending on who ate it, with it tasting like honey for small children, like bread for youths, and <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> for the elderly. Similarly, classical rabbinical literature rectifies {{the question of whether}} manna came before or after dew, by holding that the manna was sandwiched between two layers of dew, one falling before the manna, and the other after.|$|E

25|$|Churchill was {{influenced}} in these reforms by the (then-retired) Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher, {{who had been}} for many years a driving force for innovation in the Royal Navy. The two men had become very close at Biarritz in April 1907. In 1909, Fisher had been First Sea Lord and {{on the opposite side}} to Churchill in the debates over the Naval Estimates. However this was a temporary tension, and the friendship persisted. Fisher remained in close touch with naval affairs after his retirement from the Admiralty in January 1910, and Churchill consulted him almost instantly upon taking up the office of First Lord. Many of the ideas Churchill took up, <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> propulsion and ever-bigger battleships with ever-bigger guns, were causes Fisher backed.|$|E
25|$|At their peak, the {{railways}} {{in and around}} King's Lynn employed hundreds of people, but Britain's extensive railway cutbacks in the late 1950s and the following decades badly affected King's Lynn's railway services. The 1959 closure of the former M&GN's lines resulted in the closure of South Lynn railway station on 28 February that year, depriving King's Lynn of services to Norwich and Spalding. The dubious safety of a bridge over the Ouse, a very short way north-west of South Lynn station, was allegedly {{a significant factor in}} the closure of the whole route, and was demolished later that year. A section of this line about half a mile long was left open for freight into the 1990s, transporting materials <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> and limestone to the sugar beet factory (since closed).|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E

The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia. Other neighbouring countries include Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's third highest level of biodiversity. The country has abundant natural resources <b>like</b> <b>oil</b> and natural gas, tin, copper and gold. Agriculture mainly produces rice, palm oil, tea, coffee, cacao, medicinal plants, spices and rubber.

50|$|Vegetable {{fats and}} oils are what are most {{commonly}} called vegetable oils. These are triglyceride-based, and include cooking <b>oils</b> <b>like</b> canola <b>oil,</b> solid <b>oils</b> <b>like</b> cocoa butter, <b>oils</b> used in paint <b>like</b> linseed <b>oil</b> and oils used for industrial purposes. Pressed vegetable oils are extracted from the plant containing the oil (usually the seed), using one of two types of oil press. The most common is the screw press, which consists of a large-diameter metal screw inside a metal housing. Oil seeds are fed into the housing, where the screws mash the seeds, and create pressure which forces the oil out through small holes {{in the side of}} the press. The remaining solids, called seed cake, are either discarded or used for other purposes. Oil presses can be either manual or powered. The second type of oil press is the ram press, where a piston is driven into a cylinder, crushing the seeds and forcing out the oil. Ram presses are generally more efficient than screw presses.|$|R
2500|$|Critics {{said the}} bill unfairly {{targeted}} the Chinese-American community because it only restricts {{the sale of}} shark fins, which are used almost exclusively in Chinese cuisine.
