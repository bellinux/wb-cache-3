50|$|Pork ribs are {{a common}} {{alternative}} to the two most common types of North Carolina barbecue {{and a variety of}} festivals and competitions, such as the Twin City RibFest, are held annually.Baby Back Ribs, sometimes called top <b>loin</b> <b>ribs,</b> are short, succulent, well-marbled ribs cut from the center section of the loin. Spareribs come from lower down the rib cage (from the sides and upper belly of the pig). Larger and longer than baby backs, they contain more connective tissue, so are a little tougher, but more flavorful.|$|E
5000|$|Baby back ribs (also back ribs or <b>loin</b> <b>ribs)</b> {{are taken}} {{from the top of}} the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and {{sometimes}} meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in and the longest is usually about 6 in, depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher. A typical commercial rack has 10-13 bones. If fewer than 10 bones are present, butchers call them [...] "cheater racks".|$|E

40|$|Eleven Angus, 12 Friesian and 12 Hereford steers {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the degree of accuracy and usefulness of primal cut tissues in predicting side composition. The criteria used for evaluating the cuts were: (a) {{standard error of estimate}} of the equation, (b) homogeneity of ‘b’ values among breeds, (c) appreciable bone content in cut to allow the prediction of side bone, and (d) the absence of major difficulties in the replication and dissection of cuts. Simple and multiple regression analyses showed that the most accurate predictors of carcass composition, in descending order, with standard errors of estimate of muscle, fat and bone percentages respectively, were: hindquarter plus rib cut (0. 37 %, 0. 47 %, 0. 30 %); hindquarter (0. 73 %, 0. 87 %, 0. 49 %); <b>loin</b> plus <b>rib</b> cut (0. 84 %, 0. 88 %, 0. 48 %); rib cut (1. 13 %, 1. 26 %, 0. 59 %); loin (1. 24 %, 1. 21 %, 0. 72 %). The most useful of four easily obtained carcass variables in improving the prediction accuracy of carcass components from multiple regression proved to be primal cut weight and fat thickness at the 12 th rib, particularly the former. Both significantly reduced the standard errors of estimate of muscle, fat or bone in equations based on <b>loin,</b> <b>rib</b> cut and <b>loin</b> plus <b>rib</b> cut, but not in equations based on hindquarter plus rib cut and hindquarter. Kidney plus pelvic fat weight was of limited value, resulting only in a slight improvement in the prediction of side bone percentage using the equations based on bone percentage of the hindquarter.

40|$|Twenty-five adult {{crossbred}} goats, {{divided in}} two groups, were fed {{over a period}} of 16 months with diets based on Tifton hay and concentrate feed with (DCO) or without (WDCO) detoxified castor bean meal as a substitute for soybean meal. Throughout 480 days, blood samples were taken to measure lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea, albumin and creatinine. The animals were euthanized, and the anatomical components (lungs, heart, spleen, liver, kidneys, tongue, empty stomach, empty intestines, omentum, cardiac and renal adipose tissue), carcass and commercial cuts (shoulder, ham, <b>loin,</b> <b>ribs</b> and neck) were weighed. Thereafter, an anatomic dissection of the loin was performed, separating the muscle, adipose and bone tissues. On the muscular part of the loin, longissimus dorsi, the proximate composition, fatty acid profile and the expression of SEW- 1, IGF-I and IGF-II were analyzed. A higher incidence of bone tissue was observed in the anatomical dissections of the loin and a lower incidence of fat in the proximate composition of the longissimus dorsi of the DCO group compared to the WDCO group (p< 0. 05). The expression of the IGF-II and SEW- 1 genes was higher (p< 0. 001 for each) in the muscle tissue of the DCO animals. Thus, using detoxified castor bean meal for long periods does not produce significant changes in the anatomical composition of the loin or the proximate composition of the longissimus dorsi. However, the differences in gene expression suggest the need for new investigations and care when using this product for animal feeding. ...|$|E

5000|$|Dry-aged beef is beef {{that has}} been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is {{slaughtered}} and cleaned, it is hung as a full or half carcass. Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such as strip <b>loins,</b> <b>rib</b> eyes, and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, {{also known as a}} [...] "hot box". This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture.|$|R

Calcularam-se as relações músculo:osso e músculo:gordura, o índice de musculosidade da perna (IMP) e a área de olho-de-lombo (AOL). O aumento de 30 para 60 % de concentrado na dieta elevou os rendimentos de carcaça quente e carcaça fria, assim como o rendimento biológico. Os crescentes teores de concentrado na dieta não afetaram a porcentagem de músculo na perna, mas proporcionaram maior deposição de gordura e maior área de olho-de-lombo. Eighteen lambs {{averaging}} initial {{body weight}} (BW) of 15 kg were allotted to six {{groups of three}} animals (one lamb per diet) and were fed diets with following forage:concentrate ratios (F:C) : 1) 40 F: 60 C; 2) 55 F: 45 C; or 3) 70 F: 30 C. Lambs of each group were slaughtered when the animal fed the diet with the highest concentrate level reached 25 kg of BW. Animals were slaughtered after 16 h of fasting (feed and water). After obtaining the slaughter body weight (SBW), animals were anesthetized by electric discharge and killed by bleeding of the carotid arteries and jugular veins. Blood was then collected and weigthed. Soon after evisceration, skin, head and extremities of the fore and rear members were removed. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was emptied, weighted and the value added to that of blood to obtain the empty body weight (EBW), which was calculated by subtracting SBW from GIT + blood weights. The carcasses were weighted and stored at 4 °C within a 24 -hours period. The empty body (EBW), hot carcass (HCW) and cold carcass weights (CCW) were all {{used to calculate the}} biological (BY), hot carcass (HCY) and cold carcass yields (CCY) as well as the weight loss by cooling process (CWL). The carcass was divided in five cuts (leg, <b>loin,</b> <b>ribs,</b> shoulder clod and neck) that were weighted for calculation of cut yields. The leg was dissected in muscle, bone and fat, and weights of these tissues were expressed in absolute weight and in percentage of leg weight. The muscle:bone and muscle:fat ratios, index of leg muscularity (ILM) and the loin eye area (LEA) were also calculated.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that subcutaneous (s. c.) adipose tissue would differ in monounsaturated (MUFA) and {{saturated fatty acid}} (SFA) composition among different depots throughout a beef carcass. To test this, 50 carcasses {{from a variety of}} breed types and backgrounds were sampled. External fat samples were collected from eight different carcass locations: round, sirloin, <b>loin,</b> <b>rib,</b> chuck, brisket, plate and flank. Samples were used to provide information on slip points, fatty acid composition and MUFA:SFA ratios. Lipids were extracted from s. c. adipose tissue by a modified chloroform:methanol procedure, and fatty acid composition and slip points were measured. The brisket was significantly lower in palmitic (16 : 0) and stearic (18 : 0) acid than the other seven sampling sites (P = 0. 001). The brisket demonstrated the highest values of MUFA (P = 0. 001) with the exception of possessing the lowest value of transvaccenic (18 : 1 t 11) acid (P = 0. 002). There were also significant differences in the amounts of PUFA among the eight sampling sites. The lowest values were from the brisket with a mean of 25. 1. The flank had the highest slip point with a mean of 39. 0 (P ? 0. 001). There was a high negative correlation shown between palmitoleic and stearic acid (R 2 = 0. 827). The brisket displayed the highest values for MUFA:SFA ratios (P = 0. 001), whereas the flank was the lowest. Due to the significant differences amongst fat depots within bovine carcasses in their fatty acid composition we conclude that substantial differences exist across fat depots...|$|R
40|$|This project {{involved}} three steps. First, we {{assembled a}} consolidated data set on prices, trade flow volumes, and transfer costs-the costs of moving product from one location to another-for feed grains (com and soybean meal), slaughter hogs, and {{fresh or chilled}} carcasses and primal cuts (bellies, hams, <b>loins,</b> <b>ribs)</b> among the eight main pork economies of the Pacific Rim (Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Taiwan, the United States), covering the years 1990 - 96. By making available {{for the first time}} comparable international data, we have helped resolve a major stumbling block to careful empirical analysis of factor and product markets in the pork industry. We are making these data available on the World Wide Web. Second, we developed an improved statistical method for establishing the relationship between spatially distinct markets. The new method we developed permits distinction between 2 ̆ 2 market integration, 2 ̆ 2 reflecting the tradability of products, and 2 ̆ 2 competitive market equilibrium 2 ̆ 2 in which extraordinary profits are exhausted by competitive pressures. These two concepts are conflated in traditional market analysis methods. Third, we applied this new method to the data assembled in the first stage. The estimation results reveal that while there have been extraordinary profit opportunities available in a few niche markets, these are generally highly competitive, well-integrated markets. The Pacific Rim is effectively a single market for pork producers today. Intermarket transfer costs are often substantial, with tariffs especially important, so further trade liberalization to reduce tariffs should further exports by and the competitiveness of U. S. producers...|$|R
50|$|Rib chops from a pig are {{cut from}} the loin, or {{the back of the}} pig. A rib chop has a thin layer of fat around the outside. Since it is center cut, it {{contains}} little connective tissue, which makes it good for fast, dry heat methods, such as grilling and panbroiling. Unlike the <b>loin</b> chop, a <b>rib</b> chop is almost one muscle, which makes it cook more evenly.|$|R
50|$|Many {{types of}} beefsteak exist. The more tender cuts of beef, from the <b>loin</b> and <b>rib,</b> are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are {{mechanically}} tenderized (e.g. cube steak).Beef steak can be cooked {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human illnesses are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|R
5000|$|Loin: This can {{be cured}} to make back bacon or Canadian-style bacon. The loin and belly can be cured {{together}} to make a side of bacon. The loin can also be divided up into roasts (blade loin roasts, center loin roasts, and sirloin roasts come from the front, center, or rear of the <b>loin),</b> back <b>ribs</b> (also called baby back ribs, or riblets), pork cutlets, and pork chops. A pork loin crown roast is arranged into a circle, either boneless or with rib bones protruding upward as points in a crown. Pork tenderloin, removed from the loin, should be practically free of fat. This high quality meat shows a very ordered arrangement of muscle cells that can cause light diffraction and structural coloration.|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} lean, {{subcutaneous}} fat, seam fat and bone {{of each of}} the four major primal cuts (round, <b>rib,</b> <b>loin</b> and chuck) were used in combination with yield grade to predict total side composition. The makeup of each primal is highly related to total carcass composition The decision of which primal to fabricate depends on the sex of the animal and which component (lean, subcutaneous fat, seam fat or bone) is of greatest interest...|$|R
