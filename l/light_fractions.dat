The fractions differed from {{one another in the}} following ways. (a) The isopycnic density of the heavy fraction was between 1. 15 and 1. 18 gm/ml and that of the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was 1. 14 gm/ml. (b) The heavy fraction was able to bind ribosomes; the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was not. (c) The <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and had a sedimentation constant, extrapolated to infinite dilution, of 153 s 20,w. The heavy fraction was grossly heterogeneous. (d) Both the amount of bacteriochlorophyll relative to protein and the ratio of bacteriochlorophyll to carotenoids were greater in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction.</b> (e) The spectra of the two fractions in the near infra-red were different. Comparisons of the chromatophore fractions from cells with different amounts of bacteriochlorophyll showed that the specific bacteriochlorophyll contents of the two fractions did not change to the same extent as did that of the whole cells. The amount of heavy fraction from pigmented cells was roughly independent of the cellular pigment content and was about equal to that from pigment-free cells. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> depended on the pigment content of the cells; no <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was obtained from cells devoid of bacteriochlorophyll.

30|$|Removal of {{the heavier}} THC {{fractions}} (C 12 –C 16 and C 16 –C 35) {{and the total}} THC followed the same trend (Fig.  1 a) and is likely due to more than 95  % total THC being found in these fractions. Even though large fluctuations were observed in the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions,</b> this {{did not affect the}} total THC removal as the initial concentrations were low. In general, higher removal efficiencies of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> (C 8 –C 10 and C 10 –C 12) were observed, in line with results of an EK study of diesel polluted soil, in which the highest degradation of the C 10 –C 16 fraction was reported (Kim et al. 2010). In the present study, degradation of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> appears to be related to stirring rate; the highest removal efficiencies observed at medium–high stirring rates (experiments 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12). In experiments 6, 7 and 10 removal efficiencies of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> were lower compared to the total removal. In experiments 6 and 7 the low stirring rates and low L/S ratios were applied indicating that not enough aeration was provided to remove the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions.</b> The difference in removal efficiencies between experiment 10 and the other 3 experiments conducted in the centre point of the continuous variables may indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of the oil pollution in the soil.|$|R

The occluded <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> had a slower turnover than the free <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> and the heavy fraction. Organic matter in the occluded fraction also showed a higher degree of decomposition. The results confirm that processes of soil organic matter occlusion in the typical "very fine strong granular" structure of the studied oxide-rich soil led to an intense transformation, selectively preserving stable organic matter. The small amount of organic material stored as occluded light faction, as well as its stability, suggests that this is not an important or manageable sink for sequestration of atmospheric CO 2...|$|R

By using the flotation method, generally two fractions are obtained from municipal post-consumer wastes: a <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> floating on water, {{and a heavy}} fraction. The former is essentially made of low and high density polyethylene - LDPE, HDPE - and polypropylene - PP, the heavy fraction is formed by poly(vinyl chloride) PVC - and poly(ethylene terephthalate) - PET. In this work, the recycling of a <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> from municipal post-consumer plastics has been studied, considering also the effect of filler type - glass fibres, calcium carbonate and wood fibres - and processing apparatus - discountinous mixer, single and twin screw extruder - on the properties. Although the similar chemical nature of the two main components, polyethylene and polypropylene of the <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> the mechanical properties of the recycled mixture are quite scarce, {{mainly because of the}} incompatibility and the possible presence of some heterogeneous particles. The recycling of the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> can significantly change the properties of the polymer system because of the thermomechanical stress and of the residence time during processing.

40|$|The slow {{development}} of microalgal biotechnology {{stems from the}} failure {{in the design of}} large-scale photobioreactors where light energy is efficiently utilized. Due to the light gradient inside the reactor and depending on the mixing properties, algae are subjected to certain light/dark cycles where the light period is characterized by a light gradient. These light/dark cycles will determine productivity and biomass yield on light energy. Air-lift reactors can be used for microalgae cultivation and medium-frequency light/dark cycles will be found in these systems. Light/dark cycles are associated with two basic parameters: first, the <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> i. e., the ratio between the light period and the cycle time and second, the frequency of the light/dark cycle.

40|$|The active {{fraction}} of soil organic matter, which includes organic debris and <b>light</b> organic <b>fraction,</b> {{plays a major}} role in nutrient cycling. In addition, particulate organic matter is a valuable index of labile soil organic matter and can reflect differences in various soil behaviors. Since soil organic matter bound to soil mineral particles has its density lower than soil minerals, we partitioned soil organic matter into debris ( 2. 0 g cm- 3), based on high density ZnCl 2 - sucrose solutions. Generally, partitioned organic bands were clearly separated, demonstrating that the ZnCl 2 - sucrose solutions are useful for such a density gradient centrifugation. The available gradient ranges from 1. 2 to 2. 0 g cm- 3. Although there was not a statistically meaningful difference in organic debris and organomineral fractions among the examined soils, there was a general trend that a higher content of organic debris resulted in a higher proportion of <b>light</b> organomineral <b>fraction.</b> In addition, high clay content was associated with increased <b>fraction</b> of <b>light</b> organomineals. Partitioning of soil organic carbon revealed that carbon content is reduced in the heavy fraction than in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> reflecting that the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> contains more fresh and abundant carbon than the passive resistant fraction.

Examining these differential soil C fractions in response to N enrichment is helpful for better understanding soil C changes under the predominantly increasing N deposition. In this study, we used a field N addition experiment in a grassland to explore the effects of various N enrichment levels on soil C fractions. We conducted a field manipulative experiment which used a Latin square design with six N addition levels of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) since 2003 in a semiarid grassland in northern China. Soil samples were collected in August (when plants have the greatest biomass), 2011. We measured C and N concentrations in soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> microbial biomass, extractable organic matter, heavy fraction, and total soil C and N. The results showed that total soil C and N, and heavy fraction C and N were not significantly affected by N addition after 9 years of treatments. In contrast, different N enrichment levels changed soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N, ranging from 4. 3 to 27. 7 % and 3. 3 - 30. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, both <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N had a nonlinear relationship with N addition rates, and the threshold for N-induced change in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N was near 16 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) in this semiarid grassland. Increases of soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N primarily resulted from changes in biotic (N-stimulated aboveground biomass) and abiotic (soil temperature, moisture and pH) factors under N enrichment. Soil microbial biomass exponentially declined with increasing N, but extractable organic C showed a positive linear response to N enrichment rates. Changes in microbial biomass C and extractable organic C were primarily due to the reduced soil pH under N addition.

In order to compare the compositions and distribution of organic carbon in constructed and natural river wetlands, sediments from the Xinxue River Constructed Wetland and the Xinxue River, China, were sampled at two depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 25 cm) in both upstream and downstream locations. Three types of organic carbon were determined: <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon, heavy fraction organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon. The results show that variations in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon are significantly larger between upstream and downstream locations than they are between the two wetland types; however, the opposite trend is observed for the dissolved organic carbon. There are no significant differences in the distribution of heavy fraction organic carbon between the discrete variables (e. g., between the two depths, the two locations, or the two wetland types). However, there are significant cross-variable differences; for example, the distribution patterns of heavy fraction organic carbon between wetland types and depths, and between wetland types and locations. Correlation analysis reveals that <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon is positively associated with <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> nitrogen in both wetlands, while heavy fraction organic carbon is associated with both heavy fraction nitrogen and the moisture content in the constructed wetland. The results of this study demonstrate that the constructed wetland, which has a relatively low background value of heavy fraction organic carbon, is gradually accumulating organic carbon of different types, with the level of accumulation dependent on the balance between carbon accumulation and carbon decomposition.
