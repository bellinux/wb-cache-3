5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims were also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes {{were more likely to have}} anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

They find that rapes committed after 1990 were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than rapes occurring before 1974. Aggravated rape continues <b>to</b> be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than simple rape, however, and this effect is sta-ble over time. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for evaluating the success of rape reform statutes...|$|R
50|$|Many crime victimization surveys, {{from many}} countries, do {{show that there}} is a {{correlation}} between the under-reporting of crime and the degree of intimacy between the victim and the offender. The degree of seriousness of offending also affects reporting, with less serious offending less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> police. Also the nature of the offending affects reporting, with sexual offenses far less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported,</b> even when they are serious.|$|R
25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of dairy foods. The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents {{are more likely to be}} obese as adults than those raised by their parents.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the extent to}} which type and labeling of harassment have an impact on reporting through official channels. Reinforcing earlier analyses, type of harassment impacted whether individuals reported incidents officially. Environmental harassment was far more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> through official channels. We speculate that “individualized ” forms of harassment (personal, frequently directly physical in nature, leaving little room for misinterpretation by the victim or the perpetrator) may create a negative organizational image and therefore be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be concealed. Since experiencing environmental harassment is strongly related to experiencing individualized harassment and is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> through official channels, it may be the real key to creating zero-tolerance for any type of sexual harassment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk factors among female street youths involved in prostitution and those with no history of prostitution. Youths aged 14 to 25 years were recruited into the Montreal Street Youth Cohort. Semiannually, youths completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Statistical analyses comparing characteristics and HIV risk factors for girls involved in prostitution and those never involved were carried out using paramet-ric and nonparametric methods. Of the girls, 88 (27 %) reported involvement in prosti-tution, and 177 girls reported no history of prostitution at the baseline interview. Girls involved in prostitution were two times and five times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>reported</b> bingeing on alcohol and on drugs, respectively. A history of injection drug use was four times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been <b>reported</b> by girls involved in prostitution. Further, these girls were 2. 5 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>reported</b> injected cocaine as their drug of choice. Girls involved in prostitution were younger the first time they had consen-sual sex and were twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>reported</b> anal sex. Consistent condom use for anal, vaginal, and oral sex was low for all girls. Girls involved in prostitution reported more risky sexual partners. In conclusion, girls involved in prostitution may be at increased risk of HIV infection due to their injection drug use and risky sexual behaviors. Unique intervention strategies are necessary for reducing HIV infection among female street youths involved in prostitution...|$|R

This was most often because more of a profit could be made while they were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> the crime to police. Among his more well-known victims included General John A.

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E

40|$|Sexual assaults {{are less}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> the police than {{physical}} assaults, while sexual assaults by a current partner {{are the least}} <b>likely</b> of all <b>to</b> be <b>reported,</b> even compared <b>to</b> other types of sexual assaults. Despite indications of a high prevalence rate of spousal sexual violence, {{there seems to be}} more reluctance on the part of victim/survivors <b>to</b> <b>report</b> or discuss spousal sexual violence compared to other types of sexual assaults. There is also reluctance to disclose sexual violence even when physical violence may be identified. This means that sexual assault may remain a hidden aspect of abuse in relationships, even where physical assaults are disclosed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics personal safety data also indicated that sexual assaults are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> the police than physical assaults, while sexual assaults by a current partner are the least <b>likely</b> of all <b>to</b> be <b>reported,</b> even compared <b>to</b> other types of sexual assaults...|$|R
