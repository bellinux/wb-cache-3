40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a <b>rejoinder.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rejoinder</b> is written in {{response}} to the commentaries provided by Saeed Samiee and Jean-Claude Usunier on the authors 2 ̆ 7 original research piece: 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 What? I thought Samsung was Japanese 2 ̆ 7 : accurate or not, perceived country of origin matters 2 ̆ 2. Design/methodology/approach - <b>The</b> <b>rejoinder</b> is organized into three separate sections. The first section identifies areas of agreement between the authors, and Samiee and Usunier. The second section responds directly to the empirical and conceptual criticisms levied by Samiee and Usunier and clarifies the authors 2 ̆ 7 contribution. <b>The</b> <b>rejoinder</b> concludes by identifying areas of future research that may help further advance the field. Findings - In addition to responding directly to the criticism of the original study, perhaps more importantly, the authors note several areas of common ground. First, there is agreement that future country-of-origin (COO) research designs must be careful to not artificially expose subjects to country cues that the consumer otherwise may not have considered. Second, in a globalizing world, brand origin perception appears to be more important than 2 ̆ 2 made in 2 ̆ 2 labels. Originality/value - The authors do not consider the COO field outdated or irrelevant, but rather that it is a vibrant field of considerable interest to both practitioners and researchers. There is much still to be learned, and the authors hope the original research study and the ensuing debate have sparked fresh ideas and will lead to a continued effort in this interesting research field...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I read Quentin Meillassoux’s {{critique}} of correlationism as truly {{a critique of}} transcendentalism and the transcendental method.

This reliance on adumbrations will be shown to be itself transcendentally implicated through Edmund Husserl’s Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology.
