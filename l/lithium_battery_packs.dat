50|$|Lithium {{batteries}} also prove {{valuable in}} oceanographic applications. While <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are considerably {{more expensive than}} standard oceanographic packs, they hold up to three times the capacity of alkaline packs. The high cost of servicing remote oceanographic instrumentation (usually by ships) often justifies this higher cost.|$|E
50|$|The mooring is held up in {{the water}} column with various forms of {{buoyancy}} such as glass balls and syntactic foam floats. The attached instrumentation is wide-ranging but often includes CTDs (conductivity, temperature depth sensors), current meters (e.g. acoustic Doppler current profilers or deprecated rotor current meters), biological sensors, and other devices to measure various parameters. Long-term moorings can be deployed for durations of two years or more, powered with alkaline or <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most oceanographic {{instruments}} use {{little power}} {{most of the}} time, and they require high currents only for short durations. Examples are instrument systems that telemeter data through Iridium, and acoustic modems (e.g. from Benthos or Link-Quest). ADCPs also require short pulses of high current to support high power acoustic transmissions. HLCs are the key that enable low current <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> to supply short pulses of high current. HLCs are actually rechargeable lithium cells that behave like huge capacitors over a narrow voltage range (Fig. 2).|$|E

50|$|Mounted on {{moorings}} {{within the}} water column or directly at the seabed, water current and wave studies may be performed. They can stay underwater for years at a time, the limiting factor is the lifetime of the battery pack. Depending {{on the nature of}} the deployment the instrument usually has the ability to be powered from shore, using the same umbilical cable for data communication. Deployment duration can be extended by a factor of three by substituting <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> for the standard alkaline packs.|$|E
5000|$|A High {{capacity}} oceanographic {{lithium battery}} pack {{is a type}} of battery pack used by oceanographers. Physical Oceanographers use high capacity <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> for long term deployments to extend the duration of the deployments and gather more data. Oceanographers often work in far away sites that are difficult to get to. The cost of getting to these remote sites, often by ship, can dominate the cost of an investigation. This motivates oceanographers to extend the duration of their deployments so that they can visit them less often. This means, among other things, increasing the capacity of their battery packs.|$|E
5000|$|Because oceanographers spend {{considerable}} {{time and money}} in long term deployments, then wait to see the results, oceanographers invest extraordinary efforts prior to deployments to ensure {{the success of their}} experiments. One of their concerns is battery failure. Doppler Ltd's Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) batteries [...] provide an example of <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> that an oceanographer can test prior to deployment. These battery packs are commonly used in RD Instruments Workhorse Sentinel and Long Ranger and in Nortek's AWAC. These lithium packs, based on Tadiran's PulsesPlus technology are designed considerably differently from typical alkaline battery packs.|$|E

With two <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> installed the range is doubled to 400 km. The car could attain speeds of between 120kmh and 170kmh. The cars aluminium honeycomb chassis was about one third the weight of a similar sized production car, and two engines are situated in the rear wheels.|$|R

5000|$|When possible, oceanographers use {{alkaline}} batteries {{because they are}} inexpensive and readily available. However, when {{alkaline batteries}} provide insufficient capacity, oceanographers turn to <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs,</b> which can supply three times the capacity. Battery packs based on lithium thionyl chloride chemistry cost more than alkaline battery packs, but they provide roughly three times the energy density at about 60% of the weight (both by volume). Lithium batteries have other advantages as well. They produce negligible gas, and what gas is produced is contained in hermetically sealed metal containers. The voltage {{over the life of}} the pack varies considerably less than the voltage of an alkaline pack. Low current lithium cells also have relative low self-discharge, losing less than 10% of their capacity in 10 years.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, two e-bike advocates {{completed}} the first 4000 mi transcontinental e-bike tour from New York to San Francisco {{to advocate for}} e-bikes in major cities across the U.S.Pedego Electric Bikes is the best selling brand in the U.S.Many e-bikes in the United States are standard bicycles converted using a kit. In general, the kits include the motor (the majority of which are hub motors built into the front or rear wheel), a speed controller, throttle (usually twist-grip or thumb throttle), necessary wiring and connectors, and a battery. Several U.S. companies offer conversion kits which also offer advanced <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b> Major manufacturers also offer complete e-bikes. Trek offers a line of e-bikes using the Bionx {{system in which the}} rider programs the controller to determine how much effort the motor will give in response to rider effort, from 25% up to 200% of the rider's power. This system ensures a minimum level of rider participation and is also used to comply with many European laws mandating partial human effort before the motor engages.|$|E
50|$|If {{overheated}} or overcharged, Li-ion batteries {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture. In extreme cases this {{can lead to}} leakage, explosion or fire. To reduce these risks, many lithium-ion cells (and battery packs) contain fail-safe circuitry that disconnects the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range of 3-4.2 V per cell. or when overcharged or discharged. <b>Lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs,</b> whether constructed by a vendor or the end-user, without effective battery management circuits are susceptible to these issues. Poorly designed or implemented battery management circuits also may cause problems; it is difficult to be certain that any particular battery management circuitry is properly implemented. Lithium-ion cells are very susceptible to damage outside the allowed voltage range that is typically within (2.5 to 3.65) V for most LFP cells. Exceeding this voltage range, even by small voltages (millivolts) results in premature aging of the cells and, furthermore, results in safety risks due to the reactive components in the cells. When stored for long periods the small current draw of the protection circuitry may drain the battery below its shutoff voltage; normal chargers may then be useless since the BMS may retain a record of this battery (or charger) 'failure'. Many types of lithium-ion cells cannot be charged safely below 0 Â°C.|$|E

Finally, the calibrated model is applied to investigate {{the performance of a}} thermal management system for a <b>lithium</b> ion <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> The results show that battery thermal management system (BTMS) with TEC can cool the battery in very high ambient temperature. It can also keep a more uniform temperature distribution in the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> than common BTMS, which will extend the life of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> and may save the expensive battery equalization system...|$|R

Relatively high rate, spirally wound (large surface area) sulfur oxychloride cells systems, such as Li/Thionyl or Sulfuryl chloride are considered.

40|$|The charge {{imbalance}} in <b>Lithium</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> {{is an important}} problem {{to deal with in}} the design of an energy storage system. The main imbalance sources are different series resistances and self-discharge rates of the cells constituting the battery, but also different working environments. This work {{is part of a larger}} project the purpose of which is to realize an energy storage system for electric off-road vehicles. The main aim of this thesis is to deal with the charge imbalance problem of a battery pack. First a battery characterization with a detailed study of Lithium-iron-phosphate cells has been carried out. Then the main functions of a Battery Management System have been developed, implemented and tested on a module of 4 series connected cells to guarantee the optimum utilization of the pack. In particular an innovative method for estimating capacities of series connected LiFePO 4 batteries based on charging characteristics has been proposed. The method brings to an effective approach to the imbalance problem and to an accurate individual cell state of charge estimation. A new definition of balanced battery and a new balancing method are proposed. Their aim is to keep the battery as far from an imbalance situation as possible. Finally, the strategies to balance the cells of a battery module and to balance modules each other are studied and characterized, to find the best algorithm. The complete system has been integrated and tested on a 4 batteries module BMS...|$|E
