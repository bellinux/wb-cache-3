Its {{goal is to}} determine, whether the current rules of international private law are applicable to the <b>legal</b> <b>relationships</b> resulting from e-business. The work consists of six chapters: Internet and E-business, E-business and International Private Law in the Czech Republic, Application of International Private Law rules to selected contract types, Contractual terms of selected e-business entrepreneurs, Specific rules applicable to non-contractual <b>legal</b> <b>relationships</b> and De lege ferenda.

In addition to sureties appointed for specific contracts, relatives {{might be expected to}} act as sureties in cases where they were not specifically bound. However, there is also evidence that most sureties were either relatives or lords of the contractor.|$|E

2500|$|It remains {{unsettled}} whether {{promissory estoppel}} may arise in pre-contractual relationships.

After the leases had been signed by the tenants, the landlord repaired the roof {{at a cost of}} £15,000. The landlord then claimed a contribution from the tenants towards the cost of the repairs. The tenants refused to pay because of the promise made. The landlord claimed that Carr could not rely on her promise since she had not acted on his promise because she would have entered into the lease without any such promise having been made. However, Lord Denning was of the view that promissory estoppel may arise from promise made by parties negotiating contracts. Similar views was expressed in Durham Fancy Goods v Michael Jackson [...] 2 QB 839, [...] where Donaldson J. held that contractual relationship is irrelevant provided that there is “a pre-existing <b>legal</b> <b>relationship</b> which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to liabilities and penalties”.|$|E

2500|$|Denmark was {{the first}} country to {{recognize}} a <b>legal</b> <b>relationship</b> for same-sex couples, establishing [...] "registered partnerships" [...] in 1989. This gave those in same-sex relationships [...] "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child". In 2001, the Netherlands became the first country to permit same-sex marriages. Since then same-sex marriages have been permitted and mutually recognized by Belgium (2003), Spain (2005), Canada (2005), South Africa (2006), Norway (2009), Sweden (2009), Portugal (2010), Iceland (2010), Argentina (2010), Denmark (2012), Brazil (2013), France (2013), Uruguay (2013), New Zealand (2013), Luxembourg (2015), the United States (2015), Ireland (2015), Colombia (2016), Finland (2017), Malta (2017) and Germany (2017). In Mexico, same-sex marriages are performed {{in a number of}} states and recognised in all thirty-one states. In Nepal and Taiwan, their recognition has been judicially mandated but not yet legislated. Furthermore, most jurisdictions of the United Kingdom have also legalised same-sex marriage, with the first being England and Wales in March 2014, followed by Scotland in December of the same year. Same sex marriage is not legal in Northern Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, PayPal is {{licensed}} as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis. But {{state laws}} vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses and money transmitters. [...] Although PayPal is not {{classified as a}} bank, the company is subject {{to some of the}} rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the <b>legal</b> <b>relationship</b> between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the reply}} by of the Swabian League, {{delivered}} on 27 February 1525, Ulrich Schmid justified the peasants' demands {{by referring to}} the [...] "Divine Law", the concept of which, {{as opposed to the}} Traditional (Old) Law, meaning the traditional legal norms, offered a completely new perspective in the <b>legal</b> <b>relationship</b> between lord and peasant. The political order had to be compared with the divine will as manifested in the Bible. By doing so, the peasant challenged the whole concept of traditional law. Ulrich Schmid, the representative of the Baltringer Haufen, rejected the traditional legal process through the Imperial Chamber Court to solve the complaints of the peasants. Theologians had to decide as to whether the peasants' demands were justified. Ulrich Schmid proposed that a group of men, learnèd and steeped in Christian lore, should decide what constitutes this [...] "Divine Law". The representatives of the Swabian League concurred and announced that they would also pray to God {{in order to ensure that}} these learnèd men would be chosen. Ulrich Schmid hoped that regarding this issue he would be helped in Memmingen where he managed to recruit Sebastian Lotzer, a journeyman furrier, to take on the role of clerk to the Baltringer Haufen. On 28 February 1525, the Baltringer Haufen officially declared its formation to the Imperial city of Ehingen in a missive composed by Lotzer. The wording of this missive seems to imply that there may already have been contacts between Lotzer, who resided in Memmingen and had been active as clerk to the Memminger peasants, and Schmid well before the end of February 1525.|$|E

A policeman actually stopped and watched them from the opposite kerb. Suppose him to come across and ask: [...] "Is that your bicycle, sir?" [...] Fight? Or drop it and run? It was a time of bewildering apprehension, too, going through the streets of the town, so that a milk cart barely escaped destruction under Mr. Hoopdriver's chancy wheel. That recalled him to a sense of erratic steering, and he pulled himself together. In the lanes he breathed freer, and a less formal conversation presently began.|$|E
