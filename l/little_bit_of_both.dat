2500|$|An {{alternative}} path {{by which}} A.sesquipedale could have evolved that differed with Darwin and Wallace's explanation was proposed by Lutz Thilo Wasserthal in 1997. According to Wasserthal, hawk moths could have evolved long proboscises as a predatory avoidance strategy from heteropodid spiders. Since such spiders {{have been known}} to jump at hovering moths in an attempt at eating them, hawk moths would be at risk when visiting flowers if such a spider was nearby. Based on this reasoning moths with longer tongues would be less at risk when pollinating flowers since they would be farther away and thus a more challenging target for jumping spiders. [...] As a result, nature would select for hawk moths with longer and longer probosces. The flowers of A.sesquipedale on the other hand would be evolving longer spurs since flowers with longer spurs are more likely to become fertilized by long tongued moths. In other words, the flowers evolve long spurs to fit the pollinators and not the reverse. It has also been observed that the moths will swing side to side when feeding, presumably to evade jumping spiders. Possible problems with this hypothesis is that active predation by spiders on hawk moths visiting flowers has not been observed. It has also been suggested that flying predators such as bats and birds are the more likely predators to hawk moths. Whether or not the pollinator shift model or the coevolution model, or even a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> are correct is currently the subject of debate.|$|E

There is surprisingly little research on this topic which should actually acquire a considerable urgency {{in the light of}} cyber security and threats. To understand non-cooperation, one has to define cooperation more substantively than it has been done. We approach non-cooperation {{on the basis of a}} rule-based, non-statistical, semantical approach, where meaning is viewed comprehensively, approximating human comprehension, at a practical grain size that humans used to communicate, rather than selectively on the basis of what is easy to formalize. To the extent the reader is new to or familiar with semantics, the paper can be read as a position paper or an implementation outline because, of course, most position papers are a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>both...</b>|$|E
