50|$|The {{tests on}} the fire {{behaviour}} of materials with different flame retardants revealed that halogen free flame retardants produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, {{with the exception of}} the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in styrenic polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> of halogen free and brominated flame retardants is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more flame retardants can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated flame retardants can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative flame retardants, the “design for environment” projects on flame retardants for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromo diphenylethers and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD).|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{large amounts of}} {{contaminated}} sediments have been dredged and spread out along rivers. The understanding of the fate and the behaviour of contaminants in dredged sediments is essential {{to deal with the}} management of contaminated sediments. Heavy metal <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> in dredged sediments of different ages since disposal, varying from 10 to 70 years, was assessed by pH(stat) leaching test and potentiometric titrations. Based on the pH(stat) titration results, two operationally defined pools of heavy metals, i. e., a labile and a slowly labile pool of heavy metals, were distinguished and quantified by mathematical description of <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The mathematical description of <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> during pH(stat) and potentiometric titrations allowed deduction of four groups of elements with a different type of <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Considering heavy metals, Zn, Cd and Ni displayed a <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> similar to acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), whereas the release of Cu, Pb and Cr was slower than ANC. However, no significant differences with regard to heavy metal <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> were found between sediments with different time since disposal on land. The elevated acid neutralizing capacity of the dredged sediments analysed in this study strongly decrease the risk of soil acidification with associated heavy metal leaching. The prediction of soil acidification {{over an extended period of}} time, together with the potential release of trace metals, was considered an important advantage of pH(stat) leaching tests compared to conventional leaching procedures.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of concrete production using different kinds of industrial wastes as “recycled aggregate”. The wastes studied in this work were: fly ashes and slags from Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel plant; foundry sands produced from foundry dies; slags from lead processing; Waelz slags; solid residues from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) plant (with mass-burning kiln and fluidized bed reactor); sludge from industrial wastewater treatment plants. Good compressive strength (similar to natural concrete) was achieved after 28 days of curing by concrete mixtures obtained with the partial replacement (from 7 % to 40 % by weight) of natural aggregates with slags from lead processing, foundry sands, Waelz slags and bottom ashes from MSW incineration.

Recent developments in the field are signposted from emergent technologies and the standardisation of solid recovered fuels. This work comparatively examines the fluidized bed combustion and gasification of a novel material; East London’s solid recovered fuel. Emphasis is given on the characterisation of the solid residues produced from the two thermal treatment techniques and chlorine partitioning, in particular. Chlorine mass balances are studied under steady state conditions for combustion and gasification. Furthermore, trace metals content, chlorobenzenes, major elements, crystalline structures, and <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviours</b> are compared in the two residues types. For the characterisation of these residues a series of analytical methods have been applied and compared for their efficiencies. Results indicate that gasification produces 5 - 6 times less HCI than combustion. Furthermore, gasification residues retain higher amounts of CI and in less water soluble forms. However, gasification residues have 3 - 8 times higher organochlorides load, expressed chlorobenzenes. This work generates novel data on the comparative characterisation of waste thermal treatment residues. These data contribute towards the technical confidence for further utilisation of solid recovered fuels, and the knowledge over the residues’ properties.

The results of the characterization of the leaching properties of primary and secondary raw materials generally show a good reproducibility of the chemical composition {{as well as of the}} leaching parameters. The studies have also shown that it is technically feasible to replace primary raw materials partially by secondary materials. In most cases, the technical requirements of the products were met. From the results of the standard leaching tests of granular materials and products it was found that the availibility test can be used as a first screening method for the determination of the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> of raw materials and products. The leaching of elements from raw materials and products (primary and secondary) depends strongly on the pH value present in the leaching system. Comparison of the results of the standard leaching test (small scale laboratory test) and the same test carried out in lysimeters (pilot-scale) shows the standard leaching test on laboratory scale to be a reliable test procedure in order to estimate the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> in at least the first 100 years.

In the present article, we report the results of laboratory and field experiments conducted to evaluate {{the influence of the}} saturating cation, the sorbent:herbicide ratio, and the type of preparation on the controlled release properties of organoclay-based formulations of the herbicide hexazinone. Two organoclays with different affinities for hexazinone (hexadecyltrimethylammonium-exchanged Arizona montmorillonite, HDTMA-SA, and phenyltrimethylammonium-exchanged Arizona montmorillonite, PTMA-SA), two herbicide loadings (10 % and 20 % AI), and three types of preparation were assayed. Laboratory experiments showed that hexazinone formulations based on HDTMA-SA displayed slow-release properties in water, retarded herbicide leaching through soil columns, and maintained a herbicidal efficacy {{similar to that of the}} currently available commercial hexazinone formulation (wettable powder). In contrast, PTMA-SA formulations released the herbicide instantaneously and did not display slow-release properties. High organoclay-herbicide ratios and the use of organic solvent made the interaction between HDTMA-SA and the herbicide more intimate and reduced the release rate of hexazinone, suggesting that a range of release and <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviours</b> can be achieved by selecting the type of preparation and the herbicide loading in the formulations.

40|$|Two ombrotrophic peat bogs (NC 2 and BL 2) from North Stradbroke Island, Australia, were {{precisely}} dated using 210 Pb {{and analyzed}} by scanning electron microscopy. Sub-samples were total digested and sequentially leached for trace and major elements concentrations using ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Total Pb concentrations in both profiles increased with the time. PAAS normalized REE patterns {{were characterized by}} relatively flat patterns, with slight enrichment in LREE, and a significant negative Eu anomaly. The temporal changes in metal concentrations, 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios, REEs, and ash content observed in the two profiles suggest three different periods with distinct conditions in terms of dust provenance and atmospheric pollution: (1) Pre-anthropogenic (pre- 1842); (2) Early industrial (from 1840 s to 1920 s); (3) Industrial (post- 1930 s). Ombrotrophic peat bogs may be reliable archives of environmental pollution, but also shows that adjacent sites may provide contrasting evidence. Despite their close proximity, the two sites show different trends in metal deposition. Metals in NC appear to be largely bound to minerals and inorganic materials, while in BL they are mainly organic-related. Indeed the peculiar behaviour of Pb in the BL profile suggests that biological process may cause Pb isotopic fractionation. Ash contents, texture, Pb isotopic compositions, Sb/Pb values, patterns of selected trace elements (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Co, Sb, Ni, Se, As, Be and Mo), and their <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviours</b> suggests that NC and BL are chemically different types of peat bogs. NC peat bog is an open sink for elements, {{and can be used}} to define regional anthropogenic impacts. In contrast, the BL site appears to be influenced by local natural and anthropogenic processes and activities, such as changes in land use. Furthermore, it demonstrated that only some of the environmental-related trace elements preserve their original depositional record. Arsenic, Be, Co, and Zn are highly mobile under weak acid conditions, and are therefore not suitable for assessing temporal trends of pollution. Cadmium, Ni, and V may also be highly mobile under certain conditions. In contrast, Pb, Cu, Cr, Mo, and Sb are not subject to vertical migration, and are useful for establishing the pollution record of ombrotrophic peat bogs...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of pH on the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{of air pollution}} control (APC) residues produced in {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) is addressed in this study. The residue is considered hazardous waste, and in accordance with their chemical properties, the leaching of contaminants into the environment is the main concern. Several leaching tests can be used for research studies or regulatory purposes, where a wide variety of conditions may be tested. Our work deals mainly with the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> of toxic heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu) and inorganics associated with soluble salts (Na, K, Ca, Cl). The main goal is to obtain an overview of the leachability of APC residues produced in a Portuguese MSWI process. Among the different variables that may have influence on the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour,</b> pH of the leachant solution is the most important one, and was evaluated through pH static tests. The acid neutralization capacity (ANC) of the residue was also determined, which is in the range of 6. 2 - 6. 8 meq g- 1 (for pH = 7) and 10. 1 - 11. 6 meq g- 1 (for pH = 4). The analysis of the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> is particularly important when the leaching is solubility controlled. The amphoteric behaviour of some elements was observed, namely for Pb and Zn, which is characterized through high solubilization at low and high pH and moderate or low solubility at neutral or moderate high pH. The solubility curves for Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Ni and Cu as a function of pH were obtained, which are very useful for predicting the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> in different scenarios. The solubility of K and Na reveals to be nearly independent of the solution pH and the released amount is mainly availability-controlled. Moreover, the pH static test showed that Cl- is the most pH-independent species. The APC residue {{turns out to be a}} hazardous waste because of the high leaching of lead and chloride. On the other hand, leaching of elements like cadmium, nickel and copper is limited by the high pH of the residue, and as long as the waste keeps its ANC, the risk of mobilization of these elements is lo...|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} treat {{contaminated}} land is stabilisation/solidification (S/S), which physically encapsulates and chemically stabilises the contaminants. The current knowledge on the behaviour of S/S systems {{is based upon}} scarce and incomplete data, mostly obtained from laboratory simulations or small scale trials of the technology. The field performance of S/S soils is largely unknown. The aim {{of this research was}} to improve the understanding of the long-term performance of S/S soils, by examining samples retrieved from eight full-scale remedial operations. The sites were selected to encompass a broad range of contaminants, binder systems, environmental exposures, and ages since the remediation. Conceptual models for each site were developed, based upon historical information from the literature. The models were used to identify the environmental loads, acting at the sites, and to predict their likely impact on the S/S soils. These impacts were considered by examining the microstructure, mineralogy, <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviours</b> and mechanical properties of the aged soils. Risk indicators for the performance of S/S soils were identified and they included reactions involving sulfates, carbonation, microcracking and the presence of weathered minerals. There was no link between the age of the S/S soils and degradation. The performance of the S/S soils was site specific and was influenced by the design of the remediation formulation, the implementation of the treatment and not least the environment of exposure. The behaviour of S/S soils is commonly compared to that of concrete. However, whilst the results suggested that some degradation mechanisms occur, properties such as permeability and unconfined compressive strength differed. The S/S soils were two orders of magnitude weaker and five orders of magnitude more permeable than normal concretes. Microstructural investigations revealed that although expansive phases developed with time in the SIS soils, there was no damage associated with them. According to their mechanical properties seven out of eight soils performed to their design criteria, up to 16 years after remediation. However, three sites failed to meet the limits following pass/fail leaching tests. This was {{due in part to the}} choice of leaching test carried out for the evaluation and the use of inappropriate remedial leaching limits, such as Drinking Water Quality values. However, the pH dependent leaching test showed that the contaminants were well immobilised in the old SIS soils and their release, at the natural pH of these soils did not exceed 1 mg/ 1. The acid resistance of the aged SIS soil was low to moderate and was mainly assured by the carbonates present. This fact will impact on the durability of SIS soils; however, estimates from the literature indicate that the acid resistance of carbonated materials would be exhausted in thousands of years. Based upon these results, the integrity of the soils had endured, and no obvious signs of impending failure were observed.

40|$|The {{minerals}} {{processing industry}} {{is by far}} the largest generator of mineral solid wastes, which are commonly stored in large scale landfill deposits. The potential environmental impact of these is directly linked to the time-dependent process of leachate generation within these deposits. Rainwater draining through the porous matrix of a deposit creates a slowly moving aqueous environment within the deposit. Heavy metal species that may be contained in trace amounts in the waste material can be mobilised into the aqueous phase by various chemical reactions and be transported by mechanisms of diffusion and convection {{to the base of the}} deposit and from there further into the surrounding environment. Laboratory assessment methods aim to provide indicators to the leachate generation potential of a particular waste material, often based on "worst case" assumptions, but generally fail to offer a meaningful appreciation of the time-dependent <b>leach</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the material in a full scale deposit. This is to a large part due to the lack of a thorough description - in terms of a rigorous mathematical model - of the leachate generation process itself. Such a model is developed in the present work, building on an existing model for heap leaching, which, conceptually, is very similar to the leachate generation process. The model is based on the continuity equation formulated for reaction-diffusion processes at the level of an individual porous particle and for convection-dispersion transport at the bulk level. This is combined with a number of reaction models, both kinetic rate expressions and thermodynamic equilibrium models, to describe the release process of individual species at the solid liquid interface and also within the aqueous phase. The model has been translated in the WASTESIM computer code within which waste iv Abstract material and disposal scenario are characterised by a number of parameters, such as those describing reaction modes and constants, particle size and pore diffusion effects as well as bed transport and saturation. The program was found to be a versatile tool for modelling a wide range of multi-species, multi-reaction deposit and batch leach scenarios. However, for modelling real waste materials the model parameters have to be established from a systematic laboratory investigation. An assessment methodology is proposed which aims to combine lysimeter studies with bench scale leach and physico- chemical characterisation experiments to enable determination of all model parameters entirely on the basis of laboratory experiments and validate them at this level against the results from independent lysimeter studies with the modelling tool. It is argued that, if all model parameters are validated at the laboratory scale in this way, modelling of full scale scenarios involving the same waste material can be conducted with some confidence. This approach has been put to the test with two waste materials from the ferro-alloy industry - a furnace emission control dust and a smelter slag. The contaminant species of particular interest for both these materials was chromium, especially Cr(VI), and therefore it was the release behaviour chromium on what much of the work presented herein has focused. The aqueous and environmental chemistry of chromium is extensively reviewed and, as a side aspect, the long-term atmospheric oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) has been positively identified by experimental work with a third chromium-containing waste material. The two test materials have been subjected to intensive characterisation in terms of column and batch leach experiments, adsorption studies, column tracer studies and physical characterisation experiments. The results are carefully interpreted with a view to establishing a complete set of parameters to simulate the leachate generation behaviour with respect to chromium species in a deposit scenario. It is demonstrated Abstract V that the modelling tool can in fact also be used for the interpretation of batch leach data through curve fitting exercises. For both materials the WASTESIM code, calibrated with parameters established entirely through the laboratory experimentation, has been used to simulate the leach curves of two independent lysimeter experiments, which are then compared to the measured data. In both cases the modelled and measured curves compared reasonably well and in most regards discrepancies can be explained by insufficient characterisation in the bench-scale experiments. The overall approach is therefore seen as valid in principle, but it is acknowledged that further experimental work and model development would be needed to take account of the remaining discrepancies. Two aspects were found to be particularly significant. The first relates to slow reaction mechanisms, which may go unnoticed in short-term laboratory experiments, but may become significant in full scale deposits given their long life-span. The slow atmospheric oxidation of chromium is a point in case. The second aspect relates to the hydro-dynamic characterisation of flow through unsaturated beds. Both model and laboratory assessment methods are insufficiently developed to account for effects such as dead pore diffusion and a distribution of flows. Recommendations for further development work should focus on these two aspects and on expansion of the approach to heavy metal species other than chromium. It is hoped that the modelling and assessment methodology will ultimately find welcome application in the environmental risk assessment of mineral processing waste disposal operations...|$|R

The generic disposal concept for high-level radioactive wastes (HLW) in Boom Clay is based on the Belgian supercontainer concept, where the extensive use of cementitious materials in the engineered barrier system will lead to highly alkaline post-closure conditions in the repository near field. The HLW inventory for the OPERA safety case comprises in particular vitrified wastes (HLW glass) from the reprocessing of light water reactor fuels from commercial nuclear reactors and spent research reactor fuels, besides spent uranium targets from molybdenum isotope production, and non-heat generating wastes such as compacted hulls and ends from fuel assemblies.

40|$|Zinc is a {{base metal}} present in several {{products}} of general use, and therefore found in numerous residues and end-of-life products. The two {{main sources of}} zinc containing wastes are spent Zn-MnO 2 portable batteries and electric arc furnace (EAF) dusts from steelmaking plants. The recovery of metals from these residues by appropriate recycling processes is mandatory due to environmental, economic and resource conservation issues. Concerning the similar composition of both residues, their simultaneous processing can be envisaged. The research herein described consists on the hydrometallurgical treatment of zinc bearing waste, where several leaching routes for solubilising metals, mainly zinc, are studied. The leaching of shredded batteries and EAF dusts was carried out using three different leaching solutions containing sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or ammonium chloride. The acid leaching of zinc in the oxide form (zincite) using both acids, was very efficient and quick, allowing the recovery of practically all Zn contained in batteries and about of 80 % of Zn in dusts. Regarding to the <b>leaching</b> media the <b>behaviour</b> of lead oxides present in dusts was different, being insoluble with H 2 SO 4 and partially soluble with HCl (40 - 90 % yield, depending on conditions). For battery waste stream, manganese is also other important metal, which oxides were only partially soluble in acid media, attaining a maximum leaching yield of 90 % Mn. Iron, considered a contaminant in both residues, was partially leached and required further purification steps. The use of an ammoniacal medium (NH 4 Cl) was very selective for zinc, being iron practically insoluble. However, the maximum zinc leaching yield attained for both residues was only near 60 %. Under these conditions, manganese contained in batteries was very insoluble while lead from dusts was leached up to 70 % due to the relative solubility of lead chloride. This research showed that hydrometallurgical treatment can provide versatile solutions for recycling metals from Zn waste. Ammoniacal leaching allows high selectivity for zinc but less recovery efficiency is attained, while acid leaching allows higher metal recovery yields but unwanted elements like iron are co-dissolved...|$|R
40|$|Antifouling {{coatings}} {{are crucial}} for protection of vessels’ hulls against marine biofouling. A range of technologies is available, although biocidal coatings - containing toxic or deterrent compounds – still represent {{a majority of}} the market. A long-term goal is the development of less environmentally harmful and persistent compounds; one of many potential avenues is that of synthetic analogues of natural products from marine organisms. The development of coatings using natural products has been hampered by poor performance in the field without sufficient work on their <b>leach</b> rates and <b>behaviour.</b> Furthermore, little work has been carried out on the leach rate of traditional organic biocides as used in modern coatings. Prediction of biocide diffusion is crucial to estimation of antifouling efficacy. However, diffusion in glassy polymers is a complex and oft-neglected topic; the chemically and physically changeable environment of the ocean and swelling of the polymer in such a ternary system also increase the complexity of models. A test matrix of antifouling paint coatings was composed, including polymethylmethacrylate (pMMA), an erodible rosin-based commercial binder and a novel trityl methacrylate/butylacrylate copolymer (pTrMA/BA) as binders. Copper (I) oxide and usnic acid, a natural product biocide of interest, were incorporated into the binders and the coatings were subjected to 10 months of natural immersion and 6 months of accelerated rotor immersion tests (17 knots, 25 °C). A novel application of fluorescence microscopy was developed, allowing quantification of the usnic acid content within the test coatings from both immersion schemes. This fluorescence technique and optical microscopy techniques were applied to these coatings before and after immersion, allowing quantification of the organic biocide and pigment distribution. Existing literature models for diffusion in glassy systems were adapted with a novel method for taking into account the presence of seawater as a diluent, to obtain effective diffusion coefficients for usnic acid. These have been integrated into mathematical models of diffusion to predict biocide lifetime. These data were compared with experimental data for biocide leaching from the long term immersions. The biocide leached completely from the p(TrMA/BA) binder during rotor testing, compared to 35 % from the pMMA binder. For pontoon immersions, 61 % of the additive was lost from the pMMA coating, and 53 % from the rosin-based binder. An accelerated loss of usnic acid occurred in the surface of the rosin-based binder, due to rosin depletion. In all samples, release of the biocide was inhibited beyond the cuprous oxide front, which was congruent with the leached layer in samples where cuprous oxide release occurred. The erodible binder was the only one which demonstrated synchronous depletion of both additives, and it demonstrated a good resistance to fouling in immersion trials. Results of the mathematical modelling of the biocide diffusion were in good agreement with the observed data in the case of pMMA, highlighting in particular the importance of water uptake with respect to biocide diffusion. However, there was poor agreement in the case of p(TrMA/BA), for which the model under-predicted the release rate by about three orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{management}} {{and disposal of}} huge volumes of coal combustion by products such as fly ash has constituted a major challenge to the environment. In most cases due to the inadequate alternative use of coal fly ash, the discarded waste is stored in holding ponds, slag heaps, or stock piled in ash dumps. This practice has raised concerns on the prospect of inorganic metals release {{to the surface and}} groundwater {{in the vicinity of the}} ash dump. Acceptable scientific studies are lacking to determine the best ash disposal practices. Moreover, knowledge about the mobility patterns of inorganic species as a function of mineralogical association or pH susceptibility of the dry disposed ash dump under natural weathering conditions are scarce in the literature. Fundamental understanding of chemical interactions of dry disposed ash with ingressed CO 2 from atmosphere, percolating rain water and brine irrigation within ash disposal sites were seen as key areas requiring investigation. The mineralogical association of inorganic species in the dry disposed ash cores can be identified and quantified. This would provide a basis for understanding of chemical weathering, mineralogical transformations or mobility patterns of these inorganic species in the dry ash disposal scenario. The current study therefore aims to provide a comprehensive characterisation of weathered dry disposed ash cores, to reveal mobility patterns of chemical species as a function of depth and age of ash, with a view to assessing the potential environmental impacts. Fifty-nine samples were taken from 3 drilled cores obtained respectively from the 1 year, 8 year and 20 -year-old sections of sequentially dumped, weathered, dry disposed ash in an ash dump site at Tutuka - a South African coal burning power station. The core samples were characterized using standard analytical procedures viz: X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) techniques, Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and Acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) test. A modified sequential extraction (SE) method was used in this study. The chemical partitioning, mobility and weathering patterns in 1 year, 8 year and 20 -year-old sections of the ash dump were respectively investigated using this modified sequential extraction scheme. The sequence of the extractions was as follows: (1) water soluble, (2) exchangeable, (3) carbonate, (4) iron and manganese and (5) residual. The results obtained from the 5 steps sequential extraction scheme were validated with the total metal content of the original sample using mass balance method. The distribution of major and trace elements in the different liquid fractions obtained after each step of sequential extraction of the 59 drilled core samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The data generated for various ash core samples were explored for the systematic analysis of mineralogical transformation and change in ash chemistry with ageing of the ash. Furthermore, the data was analyzed to reveal the impact of ingressed CO 2 from atmosphere, infiltrating rain water and brine irrigation on the chemistry of ash core samples. Major mineral phases in original ash core samples prior to extraction are quartz (SiO 2) and mullite (Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2). Other minor mineral phases identified were hematite (Fe 2 O 3), calcite (CaCO 3), lime (CaO), anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8), mica (Ca (Mg, Al) 3 (Al 3 Si) O 10 (OH) 2), and enstatite (Mg 2 Si 2 O 6). X-ray diffraction results show significant loss of crystallinity in the older ash cores. The presence of minor phases of calcite and mica in dry disposed ash cores are attributed to reduction in the pore water pH due to hydration, carbonation and pozzolanic reactions. The X-ray diffraction technique was unable to detect Fe-oxyhydroxide phase and morealuminosilicate phases in ash core samples due to their low abundance and amorphous character. X-ray fluorescence results of the original ash core samples showed the presence of major oxides, such as SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, while CaO, K 2 O, TiO 2, Na 2 O, MnO, MgO, P 2 O 5, and SO 3 occur in minor concentrations. The ratio of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 classified the original core samples prior to extraction as a silico-aluminate class F fly ash. The ternary plot of major elements in 1 -year-old ash core samples was both sialic and ferrocalsialic but 8 year and 20 -year-old ash core samples were sialic in chemical composition. It is noteworthy that the mass % of SiO 2 varies through the depth of the core with an increase of nearly 3 %, to 58 mass % of SiO 2 at a depth of 6 m in the 1 -year-old core whereas in the case of the 8 -year-old core a 2 % increase of SiO 2 to a level of 57. 5 mass % can be observed at levels between 4 - 8 m, showing dissolution of major components in the matrix of older ash cores [...] The Na 2 O content of the Tutuka ash cores was low and varied between 0. 6 - 1. 1 mass % for 1 -year-old ash cores to around 0. 6 - 0. 8 mass % for 8 -year-old ash cores. Sodium levels were higher in 1 -year-old ash cores compared to 8 year and 20 -year-old ashcores. Observed trends indicate that quick weathering of the ash (within a year) leached out Na+ from the ash dump. No evidence of Na+ encapsulation even though the ash dump was brine irrigated. Thus the dry disposal ash placement method does not result in a sustainable salt sink for Na-containing species over time. The total content of each of the elements in 1 year and 20 -year-old ash cores was normalised with their total content in fresh ash from same power station to show enrichment and depletion factor. Major elements such as K+, Mn showed enrichment in 1 -year-old ash cores whereas Al, Si, Na+, Ti, Ca, Mg, S and Fe showed depletion due to over time erosion. Trace elements such as Cr, Sr, P, Ba, Pb, V and Zn showed enrichment but Ni, Y, Zr showed depletion attributed to over time erosion. In 20 -year-old ash cores, major elements such as Al, Na+ and Mn showed enrichment while Si, K+, Fe, Mg and Ca showed depletion highlighting their mobility. Trends indicated intensive flushing of major soluble components such as buffering constituents (CaO) by percolating rain water. The 1 -year-old and 20 -year-old coal ash cores showed a lower pH and greater loss/depletion of the soluble buffering constituents than the 2 -week-old placed ash, indicating significant chemical weathering within a year. Based on ANC results the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviours</b> of Ca, Mg, Na+, K+, Se, Cr, and Sr were found to be controlled by the pH of the leachant indicating high mobility of major soluble species in the ash cores when in contact with slightly acid rain water. Other investigated toxic metals such as As, Mo and Pb showed amphoteric behaviour with respect to the pH of the leachant. Chemical alterations and formation of transient minor secondary mineral phases was found to have a significant effect on the acid susceptibility and depletion pattern of chemical species in the core ash samples when compared to fresh ash. These ANC results correlated well with the data generated from the sequential extraction scheme. Based on sequential extraction results elements, showed noticeable mobility in the water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate fractions due to adsorption and desorption caused by variations in the pore water pH. In contrast, slight mobility of elements in the Fe and Mn, and residual fractions of dry disposed fly ashes are attributed to the co-precipitation and dissolution of minor amount of less soluble secondary phase overtime. The 1 -year-old dry disposed ash cores were the least weathered among the 3 drilled ash cores. Therefore low concentration of toxic metals in older ash cores were ascribed to extensive weathering with slower release from residual mineral phases over time. Elements were found to associate with different mineral phases depending on the age or depth of the core samples showing greater heterogeneity in dispersion. For instance the average amount of total calcium in different mineral associations of 1 -year-old ash cores is as follows; water soluble (10. 2 %), exchangeable (37. 04 %), carbonate (37. 9 %), Fe and Mn (7. 1 %) and residual (2. 97 %). The amount of total Na+ in different mineral phases of 1 -year-old ash cores followed this trend: water soluble (21 %), exchangeable (11. 26 %), carbonate (2. 6 %), Fe and Mn (4. 7 %) and residual (53. 9 %). The non-leachable portion of the total Na+ content (namely that contained in the residual fraction) in the 1 -year-old ash core samples under conditions found in nature ranged between 5 - 91 %. This non-leachable portion of the Na+ showed the metastability of the mineral phases with which residual Na+ associates. Results showed older ash cores are enriched in toxic elements. Toxic elements such as As, B, Cr, Mo and Pb are enriched in the residual fraction of older ash cores. For instance As concentration in the residual fraction varied between 0. 0003 - 0. 00043 mg kg- 1 for 1 -year-old ash cores to around 0. 0003 - 0. 0015 mg kg- 1 for 20 -year-old ash cores. This suggests that the older ash is enriched in toxic elements hence dust from the ash dump would be toxic to human health. The knowledge of mobility and ecotoxicological significance of coal fly ash is needed when considering its disposal or reuse in the environment. The mobility and ecotoxicology of inorganic metals in coal fly ash are determined by (i) mineralogical associations of inorganic species (ii) in-homogeneity in the ash dumps (iii) long and short term exposure to ingress CO 2 and percolating rain water. Management issues such as inconsistent placement of ash in the dumps, poor choice of ash dump site, in-homogeneity in brine irrigation, no record of salt load put on the ash dumps and lack of proper monitoring requires improvement. The thesis provides justification for the use of the modified sequential extraction scheme as a predictive tool and could be employed in a similar research work. This thesis also proved that the dry ash disposal method was not environmental friendly in terms of overall leaching potential after significant chemical weathering. Moreover the study proved that the practice of brine co-disposal or irrigation on ash dumps is not sustainable as the ash dump did not act as a salt sink. South Afric...|$|R

Few studies based on mechanistic leaching models {{have been carried out}} so far. In this work, a coupled chemistry-mass transport model is developed for simulating the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> of inorganic (Cu, B) and organic (Tebuconazole) biocides from CBA-amine treated wood. The model is based on experimental investigations (lab-scale leaching tests coupled with chemical and structural analysis). It considers biocides' interactions with wood solid components and with extractives (literature confirmed reactions), as well as transport mechanisms (diffusion, convection) in different compartments. Simulation results helped at identifying the main fixation mechanisms, like (i) direct complexation of Cu by wood-phenolic and -carboxylic sites (and not via monoethanolamine; complex) on lignin and hemicellulose and strong dependence on extractives' nature, (ii) pH dependent binding of tebuconazole on polarized -OH moieties on wood. The role of monoethanolamine is to provide a pore-solution pH of about 7. 5, when copper solubility is found to be weakest. The capability of the developed model to simulate the chemical and transport behaviour is the main result of this study. Moreover, it proved that characterization leaching tests (pH dependency and dynamic tests), combined with appropriate analytical methods are useful experimental tools. Due to its flexibility for representing and simulating various leaching conditions, chemical-transport model developed could be used to further simulate the <b>leaching</b> <b>behaviour</b> of CBA treated wood at larger scales.

40|$|Metal {{and energy}} {{extractive}} industries play a strategic {{role in the}} economic development of Sweden. At the same time these industries present {{a major threat to}} the environment due to multidimensional environmental pollution produced in the course of ageing of ore processing tailings and waste rocks. In the context of valuable sulphide mineral recovery from sulphide ore, the complex chemistry of the sulphide surface reactions in a pulp, coupled with surface oxidation and instability of the adsorbed species, makes the adsorption processes and selective flotation of a given sulphide mineral from other sulphides have always been problematic and scientifically a great challenge. Invariably, the problems associated with acid mine drainage and selectivity in flotation are explained {{to be associated with the}} oxidation of metal sulphides. Although metal sulphides oxidation and galvanic effects were well known in flotation and leaching of sulphides, recent studies reveal the formation of reactive, oxidizing oxygen species and H 2 O 2 by sulphides due to the catalytic activity of sulphide surfaces. The inherent formation of H 2 O 2 by single and mixture of sulphide minerals during wet and dry grinding systems and in open and closed environments have been investigated. It was found that pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), sphalerite ((Zn,Fe) S), and galena (PbS) generated H 2 O 2 in pulp liquid during wet grinding in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in water and also when the freshly dry ground solids are placed in water immediately after grinding. Pyrite generated more H 2 O 2 than other sulphide minerals and the order of H 2 O 2 production by the minerals found to be pyrite > chalcopyrite > sphalerite > galena. The pH of water influenced the extent of hydrogen peroxide formation where higher amounts of H 2 O 2 are produced at highly acidic pH. The amount of H 2 O 2 formed also increased with increasing sulphide mineral loading and grinding time due to increased surface area and its interaction with water. The sulphide surfaces are highly catalytically active and capable of breaking down the water molecule leading to hydroxyl free radicals. Type of grinding medium on formation of hydrogen peroxide by pyrite and galena revealed that the mild steel produced more H 2 O 2 than stainless steel grinding medium, where Fe 2 + and/or Fe 3 + ions played a key role in producing higher amounts of H 2 O 2. In addition, the effect of mixed sulphide minerals, i. e., pyrite–chalcopyrite, pyrite–galena, chalcopyrite–galena and sphalerite–pyrite, sphalerite–chalcopyrite and sphalerite–galena on the formation of H 2 O 2 showed increasing H 2 O 2 formation with increasing the content of a nobler mineral or higher rest potential mineral in a mixed composition. The results of H 2 O 2 formation in pulp liquid of sulphide minerals and mixed minerals at different experimental conditions have been explained by Eh–pH diagrams of these minerals and the existence of free metal ions that are equally responsible for H 2 O 2 formation besides surfaces catalytic activity. The results also corroborate the amount of H 2 O 2 production with the rest potential of the sulphide minerals; higher is the rest potential more is the formation of H 2 O 2. Most likely H 2 O 2 is answerable for the oxidation of sulphide minerals and dissolution of non-ferrous metal sulphides in the presence of ferrous sulphide besides the galvanic interactions. Studies have also been carried out to build correlation between percentage of pyrite in the concentrate, grinding conditions and concentration of OH•/H 2 O 2 in the pulp and as well of controlling the formation of these species through known chemical means for depressing the generation of the oxidant. Flotation tests using a complex sulphide ore with the same reagent scheme that is being used at Boliden concentrator but with the addition of collector and depressant during grinding stage have been performed to judge the beneficial or detrimental role of H 2 O 2 on the selective flotation of sulphides. The results demonstrate that the selectivity of metal sulphides against pyrite increases with increasing generation of H 2 O 2 in the pulp liquid. This study highlights the necessity of revisiting into the electrochemical and/or galvanic interactions between the grinding medium and sulphide minerals, and interaction mechanisms between pyrite and other sulphide minerals in terms of their flotation <b>behaviour,</b> <b>leaching</b> and environmental degradation in the context of inevitable H 2 O 2 existence in the pulp liquid.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Dutch research programme into geological disposal of radioactive waste (OPERA - OnderzoeksProgramma Eindberging Radioactief Afval) {{is the development of}} initial conditional safety cases for generic repositories in the Tertiary Boom Clay and Zechstein rocksalt formations in the Netherlands. The generic disposal concept for high-level radioactive waste (HLW) in Boom Clay pursued within this context is based on the Belgian supercontainer concept [1]. In this concept, cementitious materials are extensively used in the engineered barrier system (i) as buffer within the waste container, (ii) as backfilling grout, and (iii) in the construction material for the disposal gallery linings. Thus the post closure conditions in the near-field will be governed by the interaction of Boom Clay porewaters with cementitious materials, leading to highly alkaline conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} emplaced wastes. The HLW inventory for the OPERA safety case comprises in particular vitrified wastes (HLW glass) from the reprocessing of light water reactor (LWR) fuels from commercial nuclear reactors and spent research reactor fuels, besides spent uranium targets from molybdenum isotope production, and non-heat generating wastes such as compacted hulls and ends from fuel assemblies. In this paper we present and discuss initial results of the evaluation of the corrosion behaviour of and the radionuclide release from vitrified HLW and spent fuel from research reactors under the disposal conditions encountered in a geological repository in Boom Clay in the Netherlands. The overall aim of this project is (i) to provide a coherent picture of the radionuclide release from HLW disposed in a generic repository in Boom Clay, (ii) to increase the understanding of waste form evolution (i. e. <b>leaching</b> and dissolution <b>behaviour</b> with time) and the radionuclide migration behaviour in the near-field, and finally (iii) to develop source terms for relevant radionuclides that are the main contributors to dose in the long-term in support of the post closure safety assessments. The results derived address directly the safety function "delay and attenuation of releases" relevant after the failure of the waste canisters when the waste forms come into contact with the near-field water. Due to the variability of the porewater composition encountered in the Boom Clay in the Netherlands and the generic nature of the OPERA safety case (i. e. without selection of a repository site), various scenarios regarding the composition of the near-field water resulting from the interaction of Boom Clay porewater with the cementitious materials and their evolution with time will be discussed. Vitrified HLW within the OPERA inventory comprise predominantly R 7 T 7 glasses from spent fuel reprocessing in La Hague, France, and, to a lesser extent, glasses from the reprocessing of fuels from the Dodewaard NPP in Sellafield, UK. The dissolution behaviour of the glasses depends on their composition (e. g. Mg-bearing glasses such as MW produced in the Sellafield vitrification plant exhibit generally a lower durability than the French R 7 T 7 glasses) as well as on the post closure conditions in the near-field. In general, HLW glass dissolution is expected to be more rapid at high pH in alkali-rich waters compared to waste emplacement in a non-cementitious, clay-based repository, leading to the formation of altered glass and secondary silicate phases, some of which may retain certain radionuclides (e. g. [2]). However, the presence of elevated calcium concentrations such as in evolved cement porewaters buffered by portlandite appears to reduce the glass dissolution rate (e. g. [3]), suggesting a favourable effect on HLW glass durability under high pH conditions. Thus the evolution of near-field chemistry and the extent of cement alteration resulting from the exchange with Boom Clay porewaters will directly impact the glass corrosion rates, the formation of glass alteration layers and secondary phases as well as radionuclide release with time. Research reactor fuels relevant within the OPERA safety case are plate-shaped dispersion type fuels consisting of uranium-aluminide (UAlx) or uranium-silicide (e. g. U 3 Si 2) fuel particles dispersed in an aluminium matrix that is metallurgicaly bonded to aluminium cladding, employing either high-enriched uranium (HEU, up to 80 to 95 wt. % 235 U) or low-enriched uranium (LEU, up to 20 wt. % 235 U). Corrosion data obtained for these types of fuels in salt brines, granite waters, or clay waters indicate a – with respect to the time scales relevant for geological disposal – practically instantaneous corrosion after coming into contact with groundwater (i. e. after failure of the waste canisters) [4, 5]. A similar behaviour is suggested under disposal conditions in a cementitious repository in Boom Clay, due to high aluminium corrosion rates under alkaline conditions leading to a fast disintegration of the fuels. The amount, nature and stability of potential secondary phases formed during the corrosion process (e. g. layered double hydroxide phases (LDH)) that may retain certain radionuclides depend on the near field conditions and is as such the degree of interaction of the Boom Clay pore waters with the cementitious materials and the stage of cement degradation at the time of the failure of the waste canisters. Uranium and some actinides are assumed to be solubility limited under the expected near-field conditions. References[1] Verhoef, E., Neeft, E., Grupa, J., Poley, A. 2011.
