5|$|The European Parliament {{has three}} places of work– Brussels (Belgium), {{the city of}} <b>Luxembourg</b> (<b>Luxembourg)</b> and Strasbourg (France).|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister of <b>Luxembourg</b> is {{the head}} of {{government}} in <b>Luxembourg.</b> His official residence and office is in the Hôtel de Bourgogne at 4 rue de la Congrégation in the city of <b>Luxembourg.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} <b>Luxembourg</b> for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for <b>Luxembourg).</b> The Council would also have to hold sessions in <b>Luxembourg</b> during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of <b>Luxembourg</b> for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in <b>Luxembourg.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Luxembourg's</b> {{impressive}} growth {{performance has}} been accompanied by regional specialization of production, high labor mobility, export-propelled growth, and the dominance of regional growth fluctuations. <b>Luxembourg's</b> public pension system faces the challenges of population aging and <b>Luxembourg's</b> small, open, and highly specialized economy. <b>Luxembourg's</b> labor market performance holds a seeming paradox, favorable labor market outcomes are coupled with rigid labor market institutions. The supervision of cross-border financial activities raises the difficult challenge of obtaining a complete, consolidated view of the operations of international banking institutions. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2000, <b>Luxembourg's</b> Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the UN was 0.81%, {{going beyond}} 0.7% GNP {{threshold}} {{set by the}} General Assembly. In 2012, the ODA rose to 1.09% of GNI, making <b>Luxembourg's</b> contribution the largest.|$|R
50|$|Leaving {{domestic}} politics, Mosar replaced Gaston Thorn as <b>Luxembourg's</b> European Commissioner in 1985, {{taking on}} the brief of European Commissioner for Energy. After {{four years in the}} job, he moved to bilateral diplomacy, becoming <b>Luxembourg's</b> Ambassador to Italy (1989-1992).|$|R
5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in <b>Luxembourg</b> with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to <b>Luxembourg</b> for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, <b>Luxembourg</b> attached a unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Luxembourg</b> {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, <b>Luxembourg</b> was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible in <b>Luxembourg</b> due {{to the order of}} succession being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E

5|$|The German {{occupation}} of <b>Luxembourg</b> in World War I {{was the first}} of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of <b>Luxembourg</b> by Germany in the twentieth century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, <b>Luxembourg</b> was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} are not concentrated {{in a single}} capital city: instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities, Brussels, <b>Luxembourg,</b> Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in Brussels, the Courts in <b>Luxembourg</b> and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in <b>Luxembourg,</b> while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its secretariat in <b>Luxembourg.</b> Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt while the European Council is based in Brussels (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).|$|E
5|$|To {{break the}} deadlock, Joseph Bech, then Prime Minister of <b>Luxembourg,</b> {{proposed}} that <b>Luxembourg</b> be made the provisional {{seat of the}} institutions (including the Council and High Authority) until a permanent agreement was reached.|$|E

5|$|As various {{agreements}} were reached, {{activities in}} <b>Luxembourg</b> gradually shifted to Brussels and the Parliament, although bound {{to remain in}} Strasbourg, also started to work in Brussels while the courts remained in <b>Luxembourg.</b> The final agreement in 1992 set up the present arrangement, including {{the division of the}} Parliament's work between the three cities. In 2002, the European Council, having previously rotated between different cities, decided to base itself in Brussels.|$|E

5|$|Due to his red card {{suspension}} in the World Cup, Gourcuff missed two call-ups to {{the national}} team in August and September. In October 2010, he was called back into the team by his former manager at Bordeaux Laurent Blanc for UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and <b>Luxembourg.</b> In the match against Romania, Gourcuff appeared as a substitute and scored the final goal in the team's 2–0 victory. He was inserted into the starting lineup against <b>Luxembourg</b> and responded by assisting on the opening goal scored by Karim Benzema and scoring the second goal in another 2–0 win.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for the second half}} of the season, Cancellara rode the Tour de <b>Luxembourg</b> and the Tour de Suisse. Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de <b>Luxembourg</b> and briefly held the overall lead because of the victory. After finishing the Tour de <b>Luxembourg,</b> he started the Tour de Suisse where he saw great success. Cancellara won the seventh and ninth stages through attacks in the closing kilometers of each stage. In addition to the two stage wins, he also won the points classification. Cancellara joined his team at the Tour de France. Cancellara proved to be a valuable asset to the squad as he helped his teammate Carlos Sastre to overall victory at the Tour. Cancellara was later awarded the stage win in the penultimate stage after the initial winner, Stefan Schumacher, tested positive for EPO.|$|E
