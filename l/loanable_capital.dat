In classical political economy, and for Marx, profit is conceptualised {{either as a}} fresh flow of value (profit from production) or {{as a share of}} existing flows of value (profit upon alienation or expropriation). This distinction is of critical importance in analysing financial profit, since the latter originates in both fresh and existing flows of value. The most complex form of financial profit relates to trading financial assets, and has a dual nature. In immediate terms, it arises from redistributing loanable capital; when mediated, it represents the accrual of future surplus value. If the mediation is incomplete, however, financial profit remains redistributed <b>loanable</b> <b>capital,</b> hence, a part of the existing flows of value. Thus, it is normally profit from production, but retains elements of profit upon alienation or expropriation. ...|$|E

It arose in the USA because of the enormous expansion of mortgage lending, including to the poorest layers of the working class. It became general because of the trading of debt by financial institutions. These phenomena are integral to financialisation. During {{the last three decades}} large enterprises have turned to open markets to obtain finance, forcing banks to seek alternative sources of profit. One avenue has been provision of financial services to individual workers. This trend has been facilitated by the retreat of public provision from housing, pensions, education, and so on. A further avenue has been to adopt investment banking practices in open financial markets. The extraction of financial profits directly out of personal income constitutes financial expropriation. Combined with investment banking, it has catalysed the current gigantic crisis. More broadly, financialisation has sustained the emergence of new layers of rentiers, defined primarily through their relation to the financial system rather than ownership of <b>loanable</b> <b>capital.</b> Finally, financialisation has posed important questions regarding finance capital and imperialism. ...|$|E
