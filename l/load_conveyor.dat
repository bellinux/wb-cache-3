40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the applicability of the tactile pressure sensors for the measurement of the dynamic pressure on a <b>loaded</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. Theoretical models have been developed to predict the dynamic pressure caused by the bulk material on the belt. However, there has been no satisfactory sensors or procedures for the direct measurement of the pressure. Recent advance in tactile sensing technology provides a potential. Using a tactile pressure sensor Tekscan 5315, we measured the normal pressure on a running belt in an in-situ belt conveyor facility with varied loading capacities. We conducted comparisons of measurements from the tactile pressure sensor and well-established independent instruments. The errors of measurements from the tactile pressure sensor were calculated. The pressure mapping on a loaded belt was presented. The study attests to the usefulness and potentiality of the tactile pressure sensors for measuring the dynamic pressure on <b>loaded</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} to {{quantify}} the pressure distribution caused by bulk material on a <b>loaded</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt using a tactile pressure sensor. The pressure distribution {{is important for the}} engineering design of conveyor belts, and the verification of theoretical models. Tactile pressure sensors have been proven to produce acceptable measurements of the pressure on loaded belts for scientific purpose. However, the accuracy of the measurements needs to be improved. A re-arrangement and post-process scheme is developed. Comparisons of the processed data and measurements from a conveyor scale shows that the scheme largely improves the accuracy We distinguish and compare the pressure on the wing belt sections and the centre belt section. The transversal distribution of the normal pressure in active and passive stress states are also presented and analyzed. The findings are applicable to analyze the belt load-bearing capability and to verify theoretical research on the pressure caused by the bulk material on a <b>loaded</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{machines}} generally use a front <b>loading</b> <b>conveyor</b> {{system that}} {{have the advantage of}} picking up any material that falls off the conveyor as milling progresses.Water is generally applied to the drum as it spins, because of the heat generated during the milling process.Additionally, water helps control the dust created.In order to control the depth, slopes, and profile of the final milled surface many millers now have automatic depth control using lasers, string-lines, or other methods to maintain milled surfaces to ±5 mm of the target height.|$|R
50|$|The {{area can}} be easily {{identified}} by passing motorists on US 101 by the sugar beet <b>loading</b> <b>conveyor</b> along the Union Pacific Railroad track. The conveyor is west of US 101. The feature appears {{on a variety of}} railroad maps from the 1930s to present and may have been a passenger train stop at some point in history. The area is named for James P.

50|$|The world's first {{chairlifts}} {{were installed}} on the resort's Proctor and Dollar Mountains {{in the fall of}} 1936. (Proctor Mountain is northeast of Dollar Mountain). The U.P. chairlift design was adapted by an engineer recalling banana <b>loading</b> <b>conveyor</b> equipment used for tropical fruit ships' cargo. Single-seat chairlifts were developed at the U.P. headquarters in Omaha in the summer of 1936. The chairlift went on to replace primitive rope tow and other adaptations seen at ski areas at the time. The original Proctor Mountain Ski Lift is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{behavior}} of mining crushed goods in chain scraper conveyors was examined using a special test stand. The characteristics resistance {{lines of the}} upper end-piece were determined for conveyor idle {{as a function of}} the determinative crushed good characteristics (granular structure, moisture content, type of goods) on the size of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>load,</b> on the <b>conveyor</b> construction and on the stopped time of the conveyor. Crushed goods with a narrow granular profile and sphere-like grains caused about 35 % greater resistance than fine coal and raw coal with broad granular profile. For goods containing water more than 10 % by weight, the solids friction retreated in favor of flow friction. The coefficient of resistance decreased considerably in the range of lower speeds and then increased with increasing conveyor speed. The conveyance of sandstone ore required about 280 % greater specific drive than the conveyance of raw coal. Resistance coefficients for coal and raw coal showed no dependence on the design of the <b>conveyor.</b> Start-up of <b>loaded</b> <b>conveyors</b> after longer stop times was simulated and the specific break-loose force was determined...|$|R
50|$|After the 4 person {{boats are}} loaded, they slide off the <b>loading</b> <b>conveyor</b> into the channel, where {{they make a}} gradual {{left-hand}} turn into the first tunnel, which crosses under the lift hill. After emerging from the tunnel, boats turn right and meander along, before turning right into the second tunnel. After emerging, boats make a left-hand turn, followed by a 180 degree turnaround onto the lift hill. As the boats ascend, the familiar click-clack of the anti-slide back device is heard. At the top, boats descend the drop, passing through an on-ride camera, before making a left hand u-turn into the station.|$|R

50|$|In {{agriculture}} {{the most}} common attachment for a tele-handler is a bucket or bucket grab, again {{the most common}} application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a 'conventional machine' {{which in this case}} is a wheeled loader or backhoe loadal.

5000|$|Backstopping {{prevents}} a <b>loaded</b> inclined <b>conveyor</b> {{from running}} {{back when the}} drive system is stopped. The outer race of the sprag clutch is fixed to the machine frame, usually via a torque arm. The inner race rotates freely in the forward direction of the conveyor drive.

40|$|This paper studies a {{scheduling}} problem arising in a beef distribution system where pallets {{of various types}} of beef products in the warehouse are first depalletized and then individual cases are <b>loaded</b> via <b>conveyors</b> to the trucks which deliver beef products to various customers. Given each customer's demand {{for each type of}} beef, the problem is to find a depalletizing and truck loading schedule that fills all the demands at a minimum total cost. We first show that the general problem where there are multiple trucks and each truck covers multiple customers is strongly NP-hard. Then we propose polynomial-time algorithms for the case where there are multiple trucks, each covering only one customer, and the case where there is only one truck covering multiple customers. We also develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm and a heuristic for solving the general problem. By comparing to the optimal solutions generated by the dynamic programming algorithm, the heuristic is shown to be c [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The single-mass, crank-and-rod exciters {{vibrational}} conveyers have a trough {{supported on}} elastic stands which are rigidly {{fastened to the}} trough and a supporting frame. The trough is oscillated by a common crank drive. This vibration causes the load to move forward and upward. The moving loads jump periodically and move forward with relatively small vibration. The movement is strictly related to vibrational parameters. This is applicable in laboratory conditions in the industry which accommodate a few grams of loads, up to those that accommodate tons of loading capacity. In this study I explore the transitional behavior across resonance, during the starting of a single degree of freedom vibratory system excited by crank-and-rod. A <b>loaded</b> vibratory <b>conveyor</b> is more safe to start than an empty one.
