40|$|We {{describe}} the clinicopathological {{features of a}} case of total anomalous pulmonary vein drainage (TAPVD) associated with atresia of the common pulmonary vein (ACPV). A male Japanese infant born at 37 weeks of gestation demonstrated apnea and severe respiratory acidosis immediately after delivery. The patient died of hypoxemic respiratory failure 6 days after birth despite the initiation of artificial ventilation and administration of a surfactant. Autopsy showed the bilateral inferior pulmonary veins joined with a blind confluence, representing ACPV, accompanied by atresia of the left superior pulmonary vein. Moreover, the anomalous and small right superior pulmonary vein drained into the superior vena cava, consistent with partial and supracardiac type TAPVD. A histological examination of the lungs exhibited diffuse dilation of the lymphatic channels in the peribronchial, interlobular, hilar and focally, subpleural areas. The channels were lined with flattened endothelium which was immunohistochemically positive for D 2 - 40. These findings conformed to a secondary form of pulmonary <b>lymphangiectasis</b> due to the congenital cardiovascular anomalies, including TAPVD and ACPV.

40|$|<b>Lymphangiectasis</b> {{of varying}} extent {{may be present}} in some cases of chronic {{pulmonary}} disease. Often the dilated lymphatic channels are not identified because pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema together with secondary inflammatory changes obscure the lymph vessel pathology. When chylothorax is associated with such chronic pulmonary pathology, attention may be drawn to the lymphatic system. The presence of a chylothorax is usually attributed to obstruction or injury of the thoracic duct, whereas in some cases chylous reflux into the lungs and pleurae via abnormal lymph channels in the lungs and pleurae {{as well as in}} the mediastinum may cause the chylothorax. In rare instances a patient may actually expectorate chylous fluid which seeps into the bronchi from the abnormal peribronchial lymphatics. A detailed analysis of reported cases together with some personal experience has demonstrated that pathological changes in the pulmonary and pleural lymphatic vessels are more common than is usually appreciated. The normal remarkable regenerative potential which is usually evident after experimental interruption of the lymphatics apparently is lacking in some humans due to genetic and other factors. Thus pathological changes, difficult to simulate experimentally, may be encountered. <b>Lymphangiectasis</b> is often found not to be limited to a single organ if complete studies of the lymphatic system are made...|$|E

Rats treated with 150 mg/kg demonstrated a dose-related dilation of lymphatics (<b>lymphangiectasis)</b> of the duodenum, jejunum, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Material within dilated lacteals stained positively for Oil Red O and Sudan Black, consistent with lipid.

The basic defect is not an intrinsic lung abnormality, but a developmental error of the lymphatic system resulting in a pulmonary lymphatic obstruction sequence. The cause of CPL is heterogeneous. Apparently, most cases are sporadic occurrences. We report the second instance of CPL in sibs. This indicates that some cases are genetically determined with autosomal recessive inheritance.

40|$|David G Levitt, 1,* Michael D Levitt, 2,* 1 Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of Minnesota, 2 Research Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA *These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work Abstract: Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) has been {{associated}} with more than 60 different conditions, including nearly all gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn’s disease, celiac, Whipple’s, intestinal infections, and so on) and a large number of non-gut conditions (cardiac and liver disease, lupus, sarcoidosis, and so on). This review presents the first attempt to quantitatively understand the magnitude of the PLE in relation to the associated pathology for three different disease categories: 1) increased lymphatic pressure (e. g., lymphangiectasis); 2) diseases with mucosal erosions (e. g., Crohn’s disease); and 3) diseases without mucosal erosions (e. g., celiac disease). The PLE with <b>lymphangiectasis</b> results from rupture of the mucosal lymphatics, with retrograde drainage of systemic lymph into the intestinal lumen with the resultant loss of CD 4 T cells, which is diagnostic. Mucosal erosion PLE results from macroscopic breakdown of the mucosal barrier, with the epithelial capillaries becoming the rate-limiting factor in albumin loss. The equation derived to describe the relationship between the reduction in serum albumin (CP) and PLE indicates that gastrointestinal albumin clearance must increase by at least 17 times normal to reduce the CP by half. The strengths and limitations of the two quantitative measures of PLE (51 Cr-albumin or α 1 -antitrypsin [αAT] clearance) are reviewed. αAT provides a simple quantitative diagnostic test that is probably underused clinically. The strong, unexplained correlation between minor decreases in CP and subsequent mortality in seemingly healthy individuals {{raises the question of whether}} subclinical PLE could account for the decreased CP and, if so, could the mechanism responsible for PLE play a role in the increased mortality? A large-scale study correlating αAT clearance with serum albumin concentrations will be required in order to determine the role of PLE in the regulation of the serum albumin concentration of seemingly healthy subjects.

40|$|Abstract. Lymphatic {{filariasis}} is {{a widespread}} infectious disease of children in endemic areas, but {{little is known about}} the early lymphatic damage in children and its evolution, either with or without treatment.

By ultrasound both were shown to have living adult worms in their enlarged inguinal nodes and had occult local lymphatic damage (<b>lymphangiectasis).</b> One girl spontaneously developed acute adenitis in the affected node prior to any intervention; this adenitis resolved within 10 days and was associated with the progressive disappearance over 45 – 90 days of all local abnormalities detectable by ultrasound. In the other child, after treatment with a single dose of diethylcarbamazine (DEC), the same clinical picture of transient adenitis and resolving abnormalities (detectable by ultrasound) occurred.

A 22 year old, Gravida- 1 Caucasian woman presented at 26 gestational weeks with bilateral pleural effusions and hydrops fetalis. Fetal ultrasound revealed rapidly expanding pleural effusions and hydrops fetalis. A throacoamniotic shunt was placed in the left pleural space at 27 gestational weeks. The patient eventually developed severe preeclampsia and non-reassuring fetal heart tones necessitating immediate cesarean delivery at 32 gestational weeks. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions were noted after delivery and chest tubes were immediately placed. Despite maximal ventilatory support, continued bowel rest and an octreotide drip, both chest tubes continued to drain a significant amount of chylous fluid. The neonate eventually developed multi-organ failure and expired on day of 19. Autopsy findings revealed diffuse CPL.

A thoracic computerized tomography scan showed abnormalities suggestive of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the left lung. In addition, echocardiography revealed a tetralogy of Fallot. A left thoracotomy was performed and the lower lobe of the left lung was removed. Despite intensive supportive therapy, pulmonary hypoperfusion resulted in severe hypoxemia and death. Gross and microscopic analysis of the resected lobe revealed a partly cystic and solid lesion with multiple bronchus-derived cysts and an exuberant multifocal proliferation of glandular tissue, resembling bronchial glands, mixed with heterotopic cartilage surrounding ducts. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of chromogranin A-reactive islet-like structures amidst exocrine tissue showing trypsin and chymotrypsin immunoreactivity, establishing the diagnosis of pulmonary pancreatic heterotopy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the gross and histo-pathological lesions caused by plastic bags in the rumen of sheep. Sixteen (16) castrated, one-year old Dorper sheep were used for the study. The animals were divided into 4 groups each consisting of 4 sheep (n =  4). Three of the groups had 129  g, 258  g and 387  g of plastic bags, respectively, introduced into the rumen through rumenotomy, while the fourth group, without implants served as control. All the animals were observed daily for 6  weeks following implantation. All animals were euthanized on day 42 and subjected to gross and histopathological examination. Gross changes observed at post mortem included; atrophy of the muscle and body fat, atrophy and fibrosis of the spleen, liver, kidneys and hydropericardium. Gross lesions in the rumen included stunting, atrophy, thinning and loss of ruminal papillae, erosion, ulcerations and nodular formation on the ruminal mucosa. Histopathological examination revealed atrophy, ulceration, erosion and disruptions of the stratified epithelial layer of the papillae. Other changes included parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, prominent rete pegs, oedema and severe hydropic degeneration of different parts of the mucosal layer. There was increased mononuclear cell infiltration, increase in the number of lymphatic vessels and <b>lymphangiectasis</b> in the submucosa and oedema in the muscularis and serosal layers.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A Caucasian girl aged ten years and six months had liquid diarrhea for five months, and a "distended belly". At the physical exam: weight of 20, 580 g (p< 3), length of 114 cm (p< 3), hydrated, anemic 2 +/ 4 + and conscious. The patient presented triangular facies, apparent ocular hypertelorism, antimongoloid position of the palpebral fissures, ears with low implantation, micrognathia, short neck and pectus excavatum. The abdomen was globular, flaccid and painless; the liver was 2 cm below the right costal margin. Lymphedema in right upper limb and lower limb edema was also noted. Laboratory exams showed microcytic and hypochromic anemia, deficit of total proteins, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a 5 -year delay in bone age. Abdominal ultrasonography showed the bowel slightly dilated. Due to lymphedema and chronic diarrhea, the initial hypothesis was intestinal <b>lymphangiectasis,</b> which was confirmed by a jejunal biopsy, which also showed celiac disease. The genetic evaluation revealed a 46 XX karyotype and a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. COMMENTS: Different autoimmune diseases can be associated.

40|$|Background: Biopsy of {{the small}} bowel is {{frequently}} obtained by endoscopic forceps instead of the classical suction capsule, yet reports from developing countries are scarce. Aim of the study: to report our experience on the diagnostic value of this procedure in our community. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of all endoscopic duodenal biopsies (EDB), performed on all patients below 18 years of age. Data retrieved from the records included age, gender, nationality, indication for biopsy, the endoscopic findings, {{and the results of}} histopathology. Results: From 1993 to 2002, 241 endoscopic biopsies were performed on 241 consecutive children. Most of the children (96 &#x 0025;) were Saudi nationals, the age range between six weeks to 18 years, and male to female ratio was 0. 7 : 1. All of the biopsy material was adequate for routine histopathology. The commonest indications for biopsy were short stature and chronic diarrhea in 116 / 241 (48 &#x 0025;) and 102 / 241 (43 &#x 0025;) of the children respectively. Refractory rickets accounted for 11 / 241 (5 &#x 0025;) of the indications. The prevalence of villous atrophy was highest in children presenting with chronic diarrhea (40 &#x 0025;), compared to short stature (22 &#x 0025;). Other less common, but important findings were villous atrophy in three unusual conditions (one refractory rickets, one unexplained anemia, and one polyendocrinopathy), two cases of intestinal Giardia lamblia infestation, three cases of intestinal <b>lymphangiectasis</b> and one case of Mycobacterium avium intracellulare. Unexpected endoscopic findings were documented in 34 / 241 (14 &#x 0025;) of the children. Conclusions: Endoscopic duodenal biopsy is adequate not only for the diagnosis of villous atrophy, but also for the detection of other gastroenteropathies.

The cyst had ruptured and more than a gallon of blood-stained fluid and clot was found free within the peritoneal cavity. The haemorrhage following the rupture ap-peared to have been responsible for death. The next case was not reported for over I 6 o years, until Rayer in I 837 described a haemor-rhagic cyst of the right adrenal bodyweighing about 4 lb. Between I 865 and I 9 o 6, six further cases were presented before the Patho-logical Society in London and the same num-ber of cases were described in European medical literature. These cysts varied in size from a marble (Ogle i 865) up to an enormous cyst containing 17 pints of altered blood which was successfully removed surgically, with re-covery of the patient (Pawlick I 898). During this period a case was described of a serious cyst in the cerebellum (Turner i 888). Two cases of a cyst-adenoma were described (Craw-ford I 899; Rolleston i 899), and the first cases of <b>lymphangiectasis</b> of the adrenal associated with one or more larger cysts were also re-ported (Obendorfer ' Igo; Marchetti I 903; Bossard I 906). The first attempt to classify the various cystic swellings of the adrenal was made by Henshaw in I 906, when he reviewed the literature and reported a fresh case. This classification with minor alterations is still applicable...|$|E
40|$|PHOTO 1 : Chylothorax is the {{accumulation}} of chyle from the thoracic duct in the thoracic cavity. The fluid contains triglycerides, lymphocytes, protein and fat soluble vitamins. The accumulation of chyle is due to abnormal pressure in the thoracic duct which leads to exudation of chyle from intact but dilated thoracic lymph vessels. The chylous effusion causes fibrosing pleuritis which interferes with {{the ability of the}} lungs to expand. On physical examination the heart and lung sounds are muffled, there are increased bronchovesicular sounds; cyanosis and pale mucous membranes can be seen. Traumatic chylothorax may occur if trauma causes the thoracic duct to rupture. Non traumatic chylothorax may be caused by generalized <b>lymphangiectasis,</b> inflammation or obstruction of lymphatic flow by neoplasia or increased venous pressure. Other causes of non traumatic chylothorax include mediastinal lymphoma in cats, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, right heart failure, lung lobe torsion and diaphragmatic hernia. Congenital chylothorax predisposes to chylothorax later in life. Traumatic events like surgery or being hit by a car can cause chylothorax in these animals. Clinical signs of chylothorax include respiratory distress, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and exercise intolerance. Thoracocentesis and fluid therapy are used to stabilise animals with chylothorax. PHOTOS 2 - 3 : A chest drain (thoracocentesis) may be necessary to stabilize an animal suffering from chylothorax. Chest drains may be required every 1 to 2 weeks in the initial stages of treatment. The length of intervals of thoracocentesis will depend on the owners’ observation of when the animal displays signs of increased respiratory effort or decreased activity. If the patient responds well to medical management the intervals of thoracocentesis can be gradually decreased. PHOTOS 4 - 9 : Pericardial tap or pericardiocentesis is the use of a catheter to remove a volume of pericardial effusion for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It is used when pericardial effusion causes cardiac tamponade and when a pericardial effusion of unknown aetiology is present. It may also be necessary to remove chyle from the pleural cavity in animals suffering from chylothorax. Ultrasound guidance prior to the procedure to locate an area of maximal pericardial effusion and minimal lung is useful. The animal is placed in left lateral recumbency and ultrasound is used to confirm that pericardial effusion is present in sufficient volume for centesis. The area is widely clipped and aseptically prepared. The site for centesis is again confirmed via ultrasound. The area is infused subcutaneously, intramuscularly and subpleurally with Lidocaine. A syringe-catheter-stylet combination is advanced while drawing back on the syringe plunger to create negative pressure. A flashback of effusion is seen in the syringe and the needle is advanced 2 - 3 mm further into the chest. The catheter is advanced a few centimetres further into the pericardial space. The effusion is withdrawn using a large volume syringe until the pericardium is empty. Once the effusion has been removed the catheter is withdrawn. The skin incision may be closed using tissue glue.
