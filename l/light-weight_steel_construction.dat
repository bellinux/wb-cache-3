40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} steady rising demand for {{thin-walled}} <b>light-weight</b> <b>steel</b> structures. But {{the shortage of}} relevant standards on their design and use taking into account Russian conditions leads to the current situation when thin-walled <b>light-weight</b> <b>steel</b> structures are used according to the recommended guidelines of thin-walled structures’ producers. The author performed numerical and experimental investigations on general stability and bearing capacity of members of different length which are made of C-shaped profile and C-shaped perforated profile. The main aim of the investigations was to receive a reliable engineering methodology of their calculation. The author developed the testing methodology and designed two test beds С- 12 (1200 mm/ 20 t) and В- 50 (2200 mm/ 50 t) to perform the experimental investigation. Numerical solution for stability of thin-walled member made of C-shaped profile was received during the numerical simulation done in PLM Femap 10. 1 Nastran. Subsequently the processing of research results will be continued {{in order to get}} the corresponding dependences for development of method for calculating thin-walled members under compression...|$|R

The benefits and drawbacks of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> in present-day building industry and construction design are introduced. The factors influencing <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> fire resistance increase are presented. The article shows that the most advanced and ideal {{for the protection of}} <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> is using the agents that expand and blow up under the temperature influence, forming thus a porous structure on the surface to be protected. The stages to receive the necessary indexes of predicted durability term of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings as well as methods to carry out climate tests both in the heated and unheated premises are described. For experimental determination of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings fire resistance it is suggested to use the method based on the experimental determination of the temperature of a steel plate with fire-resistant coating in the conditions of high temperatures typical of a fire, and on the solution of inverse and direct tasks of heat conduction for determination of thermal and physical characteristics of fire-resistant coatings and dependence of minimum coating thickness on the thickness of the steel plate, durability of fire impact and the steel critical temperature value. It is concluded that there is the necessity to develop the methodological support that makes it possible to estimate the coatings fire-resistance after or in the process of carrying out the accelerated climate tests as compared to the control examples. The list of problems that come into being while determining the <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings fire-resistance after the climate tests is distinguished as well as the purpose of the future researches and tasks that should be solve...|$|R

The main cause for failure of existing structural <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> under cyclic loading effects is material fatigue.
