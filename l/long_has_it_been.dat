[...] Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, {{rejected the}} nu metal label saying [...] "We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't {{going to be with}} them". As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, [...] "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan ? Thirty? How <b>long</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> since he lived with his parents?" [...] Davis responded saying, [...] "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood." [...] Moreno also said, [...] "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!". Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying [...] "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that." [...] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he [...] "never liked or condoned" [...] the term [...] "nu metal" [...] in any way, and said he does not understand [...] "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" [...] the nu metal genre. Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed [...] "were ever a nu-metal band to begin with".|$|E

60|$|They rode {{towards it}} in silence, Garnache's eyes set now upon the grey pile that crowned the hillock, a half-mile away, on the {{opposite}} bank of the stream. They crossed the bridge and rode up the gently rising, bare, and rugged ground towards Condillac. The place wore an entirely peaceful air, strong and massive though <b>it</b> appeared. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> encircled by a ditch, but the drawbridge was down, and the rust on its chains argued that <b>long</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> so.|$|R
60|$|Tublat was {{watching}} him as were others of the tribe. Of all the creatures of the wild, there was none Tublat so cordially hated as he did this hideous, hairless, white-skinned, caricature of an ape. But for Tarzan's nimbleness, and the zealous watchfulness of savage Kala's mother love, Tublat would <b>long</b> since <b>have</b> rid himself of this stain upon his family escutcheon. So <b>long</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> since Tarzan {{became a member of}} the tribe, that Tublat had forgotten the circumstances surrounding the entrance of the jungle waif into his family, with the result that he now imagined that Tarzan was his own offspring, adding greatly to his chagrin.|$|R
60|$|Little Manu, the monkey, scolding and {{chattering}} in {{the upper}} terraces of the forest, saw him pass. <b>Long</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> since he <b>had</b> thus beheld the great Tarmangani naked and alone hurtling through the jungle. Bearded and gray was Manu, the monkey, and to his dim old eyes came the fire of recollection of those days when Tarzan of the Apes had ruled supreme, Lord of the Jungle, over all the myriad life that trod the matted vegetation between the boles of the great trees, or flew or swung or climbed in the leafy fastness upward to the very apex of the loftiest terraces.|$|R

60|$|My {{sister is}} but and I am ben—I mean {{she is in}} the east end and I am in the west—tuts, tuts! let us get at the English of this by striving: {{she is in the}} kitchen and I am at my desk in the parlour. I hope I may not be disturbed, for to-night I must make my hero say ‘Darling,’ and it needs both privacy and concentration. In a word, let me admit (though I should like to beat about the bush) that I have sat down to a love-chapter. Too <b>long</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> avoided, Albert has called Marion ‘dear’ only as yet (between you and me these are not their real names), but though the public will {{probably}} read the word without blinking, it went off in my hands with a bang. They tell me—the Sassenach tell me—that in time I shall be able without a blush to make Albert say ‘darling,’ and even gather her up in his arms, but I begin to doubt it; the moment sees me as shy as ever; I still find it advisable to lock the door, and then—no witness save the dog—I ‘do’ it dourly with my teeth clenched, while the dog retreats into the far corner and moans. The bolder Englishman (I am told) will write a love-chapter and then go out, quite coolly, to dinner, but such goings on are contrary to the Scotch nature; even the great novelists dared not. Conceive Mr. Stevenson left alone with a hero, a heroine, and a proposal impending (he does not know where to look). Sir Walter in the same circumstances gets out of the room by making his love-scenes take place between the end of one chapter {{and the beginning of the}} next, but he could afford to do anything, and the small fry must e’en to their task, moan the dog as he may. So I have yoked to mine when, enter my mother, looking wistful.|$|E

40|$|How <b>long</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> {{since we}} knew that age-imposed changes in the circulatory milieu {{are to blame for}} the {{progressive}} attrition of organs and degenerative disorders that invariably accompany human aging? Some say, we've known for millennia, from the Ancient Greeks and Medieval stories of vampires. Others say that it was McKay’s 1950 s experiments, where old rats were sutured with young rats to establish parabiosis, aka, a joined blood circulation that suggested better health of largely non-cellular cartilage [2]. Yet, another answer is that it has been 10 years since the paradigm-shifting observations that in heterochronic parabiosis, the young systemic milieu rapidly and broadly rejuvenates organ stem cells in muscle, brain/hippocampus and liver, while the old systemic milieu rapidly and broadly ages myogenesis, liver regeneration and neurogenesis, with the responsible biochemical pathways being re-set to their young or old states ([1], and Figure 1). What paradigms have been shifted? Before this work, the prevalent theories of tissue decline in aging focused on cumulative cell intrinsic changes as culprits: telomere attrition, DNA damage, oxidativ...|$|E

40|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet {{in the solar system}} on which plate {{tectonics}} occurs today. When did plate tectonics start on Earth and how <b>long</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> in operation? Why do the the other terrestrial planets have single-plates and stagnant lids? Could they have had plate tectonics in the past? I present a literature review and overview of how Earth 2 ̆ 7 s plate tectonics operates and is measured today, how recent geodetic measurements (decade-scale) of plate motion compare to geologically determined (1 - 2 m. y.) ones, and how tectonics has likely evolved through Earth history. Complete melting and an early magma ocean (inferred; no record preserved), likely evolved into Archean vertical tectonics that produced sunken greenstone belts and diapiric TTG suites. The Meso-Proterozoic provides the first convincing record of rock products like passive margin sequences, blueschist, UHP rocks, and ophiolites that are easily related to modern plate tectonic processes. Thus, plate-like tectonics likely started in the Meso-Proterozoic, and Neo-Proterozoic and Phanerozoic Earth tectonics were probably much like modern plate tectonics...|$|E
40|$|Algorithmic bias {{presents}} a difficult challenge within Information Retrieval. <b>Long</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>been</b> known that certain algorithms favour particular documents due to attributes {{of these documents}} that are {{not directly related to}} relevance. The evaluation of bias has recently been made possible through the use of retrievability, a quantifiable measure of bias. While evaluating bias is relatively novel, the evaluation of performance has been common since the dawn of the Cranfield approach and TREC. To evaluate performance, a pool of documents to be judged by human assessors is created from the collection. This pooling approach has faced accusations of bias {{due to the fact that}} the state of the art algorithms were used to create it, thus the inclusion of biases associated with these algorithms may be included in the pool. The introduction of retrievability has provided a mechanism to evaluate the bias of these pools. This work evaluates the varying degrees of bias present in the groups of relevant and non-relevant documents for topics. The differentiating power of a system is also evaluated by examining the documents from the pool that are retrieved for each topic. The analysis finds that the systems that perform better, tend to have a higher chance of retrieving a relevant document rather than a non-relevant document for a topic prior to retrieval, indicating that retrieval systems which perform better at TREC are already predisposed to agree with the judgements regardless of the query posed...|$|E
