40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2015 Bat {{migration}} ecology is an important, yet understudied {{facet of}} natural history and conservation. We know little about the movement patterns of migrating bats and the physiological demands that bats experience in preparation for and during migration. This has particular relevance to tree bats (Lasiurus spp. and Lasionycteris noctivagans) that make the longest annual migrations across North America and have recently become subject to alarming fatality rates by wind turbines. As the absence of effective methods to study tree bat migration has made conservation efforts challenging, I investigated {{the potential for a}} non-lethal <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>method</b> (fine needle adipocyte aspiration). This method uses fatty acid signatures as an intrinsic geo marker potentially capable of answering questions about migration ecology. If fatty acid signatures remain stable throughout migration, they have the potential to indicate an individual???s diet at their origin. Samples taken during the resident period can tell us about the dietary shifts that may take place prior to migration. These samples can indicate the summer residence region of migrants sampled during migratory movement. Of 136 attempts, our <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>method</b> had a 72. 79 % success rate. I used fatty acid signatures produced from fine needle adipocyte aspiration to compare a group of resident and a group of migrant silver-haired bats. I used a multivariate statistical approach for our analysis and found significantly different fatty acid signatures between residents and migrants. It remains unclear whether geographic segregation or temporal shifts in diet are driving the separation of migrants and residents. However, I observed greater fatty acid signature dispersion in migrating individuals, which led to the conclusion that if geographic segregation caused the observed separation, then more than one unique resident group used the migration route where we captured and sampled bats. But if temporal shifts in diet caused the separation, then it may indicate that the bats began to exhibit varied individual dietary preferences during migration. However, the latter seems less likely; we expect the bats to form the majority of their fat deposits during summer residency, and we also expect that they would have a net depletion of fat reserves during migration. The results of this study provide a new non-lethal approach to studying bat migration ecology...|$|E

Depending on the hydrophobicity and {{the abundance of}} lipids, several alternative solvents such as hexane, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, and tert-butyl methyl ether {{can be used with}} similar extraction efficiency for major lipid classes but with varying effectiveness for the recovery of low abundance lipid classes [10].

One of the challenging tasks is the analysis of intact and underivatized lipids, which have various important functions in organism (energy storage, membrane building block, cellular signalling, precursor of relevant biomolecules etc.). The lipid composition consists of different, structural diverse lipid classes with several subclasses including numerous lipid species. These species vary in chain length, degree of saturation and/or kind of bonding of the attached fatty acid(s). Anomalous lipid compositions were correlated to different diseases like diabetes and many others.

Pulmonary surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse, is produced by type II pneumocytes within the lung.

40|$|Background: Biodiesel is {{the main}} liquid biofuel in the EU and is {{currently}} mainly produced from vegetable oils. Alternative feedstocks are lignocellulosic materials, which provide several benefits compared with many existing feedstocks. This study examined a technical process and its mass and energy balances to gain a systems perspective of combined biodiesel (FAME) and biogas production from straw using oleaginous yeasts. Important process parameters with a determining impact on overall mass and energy balances were identified and evaluated. Results: In the base case, 41 % {{of energy in the}} biomass was converted to energy products, primary fossil fuel use was 0. 37 MJprim/MJ produced and 5. 74 MJ fossil fuels could be replaced per kg straw dry matter. The electricity and heat produced from burning the lignin were sufficient for process demands except in scenarios where the yeast was dried for lipid extraction. Using the residual yeast cell mass for biogas production greatly increased the energy yield, with biogas contributing 38 % of total energy products. Conclusions: In extraction methods without drying the yeast, increasing lipid yield and decreasing the residence time for lipid accumulation are important for the energy and mass balance. Changing the <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>method</b> from wet to dry makes the greatest change to the mass and energy balance. Bioreactor agitation and aeration for lipid accumulation and yeast propagation is energy demanding. Changes in sugar concentration in the hydrolysate and residence times for lipid accumulation greatly affect electricity demand, but have relatively small impacts on fossil energy use (NER) and energy yield (EE). The impact would probably be greater if externally produced electricity were used...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological SciencesBiodiesel {{production}} from microalgae is generally conducted through light dependent growth. Though promising and technically feasible, it is logistically difficult {{to produce a}} high-density biomass of microalgae due to poor light penetration. Light dependency complicates cultivation process, increases cost and reduces production of desired products. Heterotrophic culture is an attractive alternative to this challenge. However, lipid accumulation and total lipid productivity remain low, increasing downstream processing cost. The current study avoids these issues by growing microalgae, Chlorella kessleri, in nutrient limited heterotrophic cultures supplemented with exogenous pure sugars or lignocellulose hydrolysate from Big Blue Stem. Lignocellulosic material is a readily available renewable source of carbon. Its economic feasibility makes it an attractive carbon source. In addition, we have explored strategies to increase lipid content of cells in this research. Growth of microalgae in stressful environment under low nitrogen conditions causes algal cells to synthesize more lipids. We studied effects of phosphorus and iron limitation on lipid accumulation. The supplemented sugar promotes biomass while phosphorus and iron limitation stresses cell altering its metabolism and generating high lipid densities within cell. Cell counting method and chlorophyll measurements measured heterotrophic growth of microalgae at different concentrations of phosphorus (0 mM- 5 mM) and iron (0 μM- 20 μM) each day until stationary phase was reached. Furthermore, Nile Red staining measured lipid content of cells at stationary phase. A modified Bligh and Dyer <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>method</b> was adapted to extract lipids from microalgae.

In Experiment 1, groups of 12 female red deer and sheep grazing ryegrass either received sunflower oil or no oil. Oil supplementation increased trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) concentrations in adipose tissues. Muscle had higher TVA and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) ratios [relative to stearic acid (CI 8 : 0) ] in sheep, and higher total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratios, including linoleic (CI 8 : 2) and linolenic (CI 8 : 3) acids, in deer. Different supplementation effects of species, and tissues suggested metabolic differences. In Experiment 2, groups of eight red deer stags and castrated sheep received grass hay and concentrate, supplemented with sunflower meal, sunflower oil or no supplement. The highest C 18 : 0 proportions (relative to total fatty acid levels) were found in tissues from sunflower meal-supplemented animals, possibly due to more biohydrogenation of lipidÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â· in sunflower meal than of oil. Tissue proportions of TVA and CLA were higher for oil-supplemented than meal-supplemented animals. In both experiments gut passage rates were higher in red deer than in sheep. In Experiment 3, incubation of buffered rumen liquor from red deer and sheep, with substrates of dried grass and grass' + sunflower meal, showed rapid biohydrogenation of fatty acids. Compared with sheep rumen liquor, deer liquor had higher contents of CI 8 : 0, CI 8 : 2, C 18 : 3 and CLA, and appeared to have a higher biohydrogenation capacity.,. The higher PUFA ratio in deer tissues compared with sheep may result from faster gut passage rate and other physiological differences. Sunflower seed supplementation can alter PUPA proportions in ruminant tissues and thus meat quality. Relatively high PUPA and low saturated fatty acid contents suggest venison as a healthy meat for human diets.

40|$|Lipids, lyso{{phospholipids}} and phospholipids in particular, {{have been}} shown to be biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for human diseases. While many <b>extraction</b> and analytical <b>methods</b> have been developed for quantitative analyses of these molecules, most of them are laborious and time-consuming, with associated issues of poor reproducibility. This becomes one of the critical bottle-necks to move lipid markers to clinics. In the current work, we have developed an extremely simple method for lysophospholipids and phospholipids extraction from human plasma or serum samples, which only utilizes a single methanol (MeOH) solvent and involves a single step of centrifugation. This method has been subjected to strict validation by comparing it with classical <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>methods.</b> This simple method will be extremely useful for the lipidomic, diseases marker, and lipid biochemistry fields not only for its potential wide applications associated with its simplicity and reproducibility, but also for its impact in moving lipid markers into clinics through high-throughput processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was aimed at {{creating}} a microwave assisted extraction system of microalgal lipid, to shorten the extraction time and improve the extraction efficiency. Moreover, through the automatic control reduced the extraction progress, the efficiency of extraction would be raised. This research using dried chorella sp. powder purchased from market was comprised of Soxhlet extraction experiment, comparison of the extraction methods using water bath treatment and microwave treatment, traces analysis of lipid and center point design experiment. The Soxhlet extraction experiment used AOAC 920. 39 C standard <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>method</b> to extract lipid of microalgal. The result using liquid-solid ratio at 150 times of organic solvent and dried microalgal powder weights had shown that the saturation of average lipid contents was about 1. 53 % of dry weight. The fatty acid analysis had also shown that microalgal used in this research were suitable to make the biodiesel oil. Water bath and microwave treatment testing with liquid-solid ratio at 6 times obtained that the best time for the microwave extracting time was 7 minutes, while the temperature at 72. 6 ℃, and the bottle still under the durable pressure. Moreover, the first extracting treatment reached 20. 71 % lipid extraction rate. But after extractions twice, the lipid extraction rate reached saturation at about 45. 24 %. However, water bath treatment obtained lower lipid content about only 10 % at extracting time between 3 and 7 min. The trace analysis was based on Bligh and Dyer Method to compare with the lipid content of microwave treatment, ultrasound treatment and control set treatment. The result had acquired that microalgal lipid reached a saturation level of at 11. 6 % of dry weight. The microwave treatment needed 75 sec, but 1200 sec by ultrasound treatment; it was 16 times of the microwave treatment. The observation using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that the fold of microalgal cell shrunk unevenly through the microwave treatment. It was due to the rapid temperature rise and pressure increase by microwave treatment and resulted in the sudden expansion and burst of the cell thus increasing the lipid extraction ability. The fatty acid composition analysis acquired from the three groups were not significantly different; this also indicated that the microwave assisted extraction broke the cell more effectively, and increased lipid content, but would not decompose the composition of fatty acid. The experiment proved that the microwave assisted extraction method was suitable for use in the micro-algae oil extraction. According to the result of the previous experiments, a microwave assisted extraction system of microalgal lipid was built. The optimal factor design center point design experiment was performed by using response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental results obtained that using extraction time 7 min and liquid-solid ratio 7 times, the best extraction rate at 44. 59 % could be held. However, the pressure rose in extractor due to the solvent heating from the microwave; the maximum temperature and pressure achieved were 14. 37 ℃ and 0. 38 kg/cm 2, respectively. The over temperature and pressure would make the system unstable, which was critical to ensuring safe operations. Further, the experiments with and without pressure increase had acquired that the extraction rate of extraction time 5, 6 and 7 min under pressure increase experimental group were 29. 22 、 40. 71 and 44. 59 %,and with normal pressure less experimental group were 29. 37 、 40. 78 and 44. 89 %, respectively. After the statistical analysis, there were no significant differences between these two groups. The experiment was set 7 min, liquid-solid ratio at 7 times and without pressure increase as the front experimental group to perform the path of steepest ascent experiment. The experimental results obtained that an extraction rate inflection point was 58. 67 % at extraction time 10 min and liquid-solid ratio at 8. 2 times. Based on the parameters of the previous experimental results, the center point design experiment was performed. The experiment found that the best extraction rate was 65. 78 % at extraction time 10 min 45 sec and liquid-solid ratio at 8. 3 times. Using these best results as the conditions of multi-stage extraction, the experiment obtained 94. 96 % of extraction rate at third extraction. It had the same total lipid content with Soxhlet extraction 12 hr. The extraction speed was 22 times of Soxhlet extraction. The results had shown that optimal microwave assisted extraction parameters could extract microalgal lipid efficiently. The final experiment was performed by combing the above experimental results to build an automatic microwave assisted extraction system. It had the central control unit to control the optimal parameters and held the function of sequential operation continuously such as input, extraction, and output to simplify the complicated extraction procedures and to improve the efficiency of lipid extraction to achieve the desired mass microalgal biodiesel production. 本研究旨在建立一微波輔助萃取微藻油脂系統，期能縮短微藻油脂萃取時間，並提高萃取效率，同時透過自動化控制簡化繁雜之萃取操作手續。研究是以市售乾燥之小球藻(chorella sp.) 粉分別進行索式油脂萃取試驗、水浴與微波比較試驗、微量油脂萃取試驗、中心複合設計油脂萃取試驗。其中索式油脂萃取試驗係依AOAC 920. 39 C (1990) 標準法萃取微藻中油脂，在有機溶劑與微藻乾重之液固比 150 倍下，結果獲致油脂含量達飽和狀態時，平均僅約為總乾物重之 1. 53 %，而脂肪酸分析結果則顯示本試驗所使用之微藻做為產製生質柴油之原料應為適合。水浴與微波比較試驗結果獲致在液固比 6 倍下 ，微波萃取時間設定以 7 min為佳，萃取液溫度為 41. 15 ℃仍在血清瓶可承受壓力範圍，且其單次油脂萃取率可達 20. 71 %，而在此萃取時間 7 min設定下，則萃取液經由 2 次萃取後，其萃取率即達飽和約為 45. 24 %，而水浴萃取組其萃取油脂效果不佳，於萃取 3 - 7 min，僅約為 10 %左右。微量油脂萃取試驗依Bligh and Dyer Method進行微波處理、超音波處理及未施與任何處理之對照組之含油量分析比較，結果獲致微藻油脂萃取達飽和狀態時含量為總乾物重之 11. 6 %，而微波處理組之處理時間為 75 sec，超音波處理組則需 1, 200 sec，萃取時間為微波處理組之 16 倍；試驗中以掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察結果獲致，經微波處理後之微藻細胞有不均勻收縮所造成之明顯皺摺，顯示細胞於微波作用下，會因細胞內部溫度急遽上升與壓力增大而膨脹破裂，有助於細胞油脂之萃取；而脂肪酸組成分析結果獲致三組皆無顯著差異，顯示微波輔助萃取法能有效破碎細胞，提高油脂萃取量，亦不會導致油脂中之脂肪酸分解，證實微波萃取方式適用於微藻油脂之萃取。 本研究依據上述萃取基礎試驗所獲致之相關萃取條件參數，建置一微波輔助微藻油脂萃取系統，其最佳化參數設計，即中心複合設計油脂萃取試驗，係利用反應曲面法(Response Surface Methodology, RSM) 進行試驗設計，試驗結果獲致當萃取時間為 7 min與液固比 7 倍時，可獲致較佳之油脂萃取率 44. 59 %。然而於萃取過程中加熱有機溶劑會使萃取器內部壓力上升，其最大溫度與壓力分別達 44. 67 ℃與 0. 38 kg/cm 2 ，過大的溫度與壓力易導致系統不穩定，亦有操作安全上之顧慮。進一步探討加壓與常壓二組對油脂含量影響，其試驗結果獲致於萃取 5 、 6 及 7 min，加壓組萃取率分別為 29. 22 、 40. 71 及 44. 59 %，而常壓組則為 29. 37 、 40. 78 及 44. 89 %，分析結果顯示並無顯著差異。試驗進一步以前述結果 7 min、液固比 7 倍與常壓下作為起始點，進行最陡上升試驗，結果獲致於萃取時間 10 min與液固比 8. 2 倍試驗組，其萃取率 58. 67 %趨於反曲點，即依此最陡上升試驗結果參數，進行中心複合設計試驗，試驗結果獲致試驗參數組合於萃取時間 10 min 45 sec，與液固比 8. 3 倍時可獲致最佳萃取率達 65. 78 %。當以此最佳操作參數進行多級萃取試驗，結果獲致第三次試驗即達 94. 96 %，與索式萃取 12 hr有相同之總油脂含量，其萃取速率約為索式萃取的 22 倍，顯示最佳化微波萃取參數組合，能有較高之萃取速率。 本研究最終係結合上述試驗所獲致之結果，建置一自動化微波輔助萃取系統，其以中央控制系統進行最佳參數之設定控制，並具連續順序進料、萃取及出料功能，可簡化繁雜之萃取手續及取代人力之操作，且在提高油脂萃取效率下，達到微藻大量萃取生產之目的。摘要	I Abstract	III 目錄	VI 表目錄	XI 圖目錄	XII 符號說明	XIV 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 2 - 1 產油藻種培養	 4 2 - 1 - 1 微藻培養與油脂累積	 4 2 - 1 - 2 微藻油脂及其應用	 5 2 - 2 微藻油脂萃取	 6 2 - 2 - 1 傳統萃取方式	 6 2 - 2 - 2 萃取溶劑選擇	 7 2 - 3 微波輔助萃取	 9 2 - 3 - 1 微波作用原理	 9 2 - 3 - 2 微波應用	 9 2 - 4 反應曲面法(RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY, RSM) 	 10 2 - 4 - 1 中心點設計(Center Point Design, CPD) 	 11 2 - 4 - 2 最陡上升法(Path of Steepest Ascent, PSA) 	 11 2 - 4 - 3 中心複合設計(Central Composite Design, CCD) 	 12 第三章 實驗材料與方法	 14 3 - 1 實驗設計與系統設計流程	 14 3 - 2 試驗材料	 15 3 - 3 試驗設備	 15 3 - 4 試驗方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 檢測方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 1 固液分離方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 油脂含量計算方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 3 掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 4 脂肪酸組成分析方法	 18 3 - 4 - 2 索式萃取試驗	 18 3 - 4 - 3 水浴與微波比較試驗	 19 3 - 4 - 3 - 1 萃取時間比較試驗	 19 3 - 4 - 3 - 2 微波萃取次數試驗	 20 3 - 4 - 4 微量分析方式比較試驗	 20 3 - 4 - 5 最佳化參數設計試驗	 21 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 中心點設計試驗	 21 3 - 4 - 5 - 2 常壓與加壓萃取比較試驗	 22 3 - 4 - 5 - 3 最陡上升試驗	 22 3 - 4 - 5 - 4 中心複合設計試驗	 23 3 - 4 - 6 多級萃取試驗	 23 3 - 4 - 7 自動化系統建置與試驗	 24 3 - 4 - 7 - 1 連續進料試驗	 25 3 - 4 - 7 - 2 微波輻射外洩值量測	 25 3 - 4 - 7 - 3 效益評估	 26 第四章 結果與討論	 27 4 - 1 索式萃取試驗結果	 27 4 - 1 - 1 索式萃取油脂含量結果	 27 4 - 1 - 2 索式萃取脂肪酸分析結果	 28 4 - 2 水浴與微波比較試驗結果	 29 4 - 2 - 1 萃取時間比較試驗	 29 4 - 2 - 2 微波萃取次數試驗結果	 31 4 - 3 微量分析方式比較試驗結果	 32 4 - 3 - 1 油脂含量分析結果	 32 4 - 3 - 2 掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察結果	 35 4 - 3 - 3 脂肪酸組成分析	 38 4 - 4 最佳化參數設計試驗結果	 39 4 - 4 - 1 中心點設計試驗結果	 39 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 中心點油脂萃取率試驗結果	 39 4 - 4 - 1 - 2 中心點萃取溫度試驗結果	 43 4 - 4 - 1 - 3 中心點壓力試驗結果	 44 4 - 4 - 2 常壓與加壓萃取比較試驗結果	 46 4 - 4 - 3 最陡上升試驗結果	 47 4 - 4 - 4 中心複合設計試驗結果	 49 4 - 4 - 4 - 1 油脂萃取率試驗結果	 49 4 - 4 - 4 - 2 脂肪酸分析結果	 52 4 - 5 多級萃取試驗結果	 55 4 - 6 自動化系統建置與試驗結果	 56 4 - 6 - 1 連續進料試驗結果	 56 4 - 6 - 2 微波輻射外洩值量測試驗結果	 57 4 - 6 - 3 效益評估	 57 第五章 結論與建議	 58 5 - 1 結論	 58 5 - 2 建議	 61 參考文獻	 6...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of fatty acids (FAs) {{is known to}} discriminate families within genera of bacteria, fungi, octocorals and algae. Here, we applied the more sensitive gas chromatographic (GC) analysis to investigate the taxonomic value of using FA composition to discriminate 15 species of lichen, including three chlorolichens (two Cladonia species and Stereocaulon scutelligerum), nine tripartite lichens (Stereocaulon species) and three cyanolichens (Lichina pygmaea, Collema cristatum, Peltigera membranacea). One macroscopic cyanobacterium (Nostoc sp.), corresponding to the photobiont partner of Peltigera and Collema cyanolichens, was included for comparison. Five <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>methods</b> were evaluated, using Stereocaulon scutelligerum. Shaking at 80 °C with chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) was the most efficient and reproducible method. The total FA {{composition of}} the 16 species was compared, using GC coupled with flame ionization detection or mass spectrometry. A statistical hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used to}} determine the similarity between the FA profiles, based on total, saturated, unsaturated and branched-chain FAs (BCFAs). The BCFA profile allowed a distinction between the Stereocaulon species and the cyanolichens, in contrast to all the other types of FAs. A detailed characterization of eight FA subclasses, provided by the GC analysis, suggested a preferential pathway for the biogenesis of unsaturated FAs through desaturases, which was especially favoured in the cyanolichens...|$|R
40|$|The {{constant}} {{reliance on}} fossil fuel energy resources is unsustainable, due to both depleting world reserves and increasing green house gas emissions {{associated with their}} use and thus there are dynamic research {{at the global level}} envisioned at developing alternative renewable and potentially carbon neutral solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels as alternative energy resources. The contemporary knowledge and technology predictions have proved that among the third generation biofuels especially those derived from microalgae are considered the best reasonable alternative energy resource compared to undeniable drawbacks of first and second generation biofuels. Moreover, its efficiency to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and industrial gases which can efficiently utilize the nutrients present in wastewater and industrial effluents. Therefore, culturing algae provide several benefits such as providing biomass for the production of biofuels to sequester the atmospheric carbon, removing the nutrients from the wastewater and is not competing with agricultural land, water resources and food crops.

40|$|Summary: It is {{postulated}} that lipid peroxidation {{plays a role}} in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. Efforts have therefore been made to develop reliable and practicable procedures for quantifying lipid peroxidation products such as lipid hydroperoxides in biological specimens. An iodometric cholesterol colour reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) can be used to measure lipid hydroperoxides in isolated low density lipoproteins without <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction.</b> This <b>method</b> has been validated with respect to its analytical performance and suitability for serum samples by comparing it with a high performance liquid chromatography technique.

40|$|Background The {{bioaccumulation}} {{potential of}} chemical substances is commonly determined in flow through fish tests {{according to the}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) technical guideline (TG) 305, aiming at the determination of bioconcentration factors (BCF). Investigations on aquatic organisms have shown a significant positive correlation between the accumulation of a chemical and the lipid content of organisms. Residue levels can thus differ between individuals, species, and size groups depending on their lipid content. BCF values can be normalized by lipid content; however, this {{requires the use of}} appropriate extraction techniques to ensure the complete <b>extraction</b> of total <b>lipids</b> from fish/tissue samples. The OECD TG 305 is currently under revision. A literature review was carried out to select preferred methods which shall be included in the updated OECD TG 305 along with a sampling schedule for lipid measurement in fish. Results An overview and appraisal of a broad range of <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>methods</b> is presented. <b>Extraction</b> procedures applied in bioaccumulation studies described in the literature and procedures currently used for such studies by governmental, academic, and industrial labs are surveyed. Possible impacts of unsuitable <b>extraction</b> techniques on <b>lipid</b> normalized BCF results were assessed. Default values for BCF normalization commonly used in bioaccumulation studies are described. The effect of differences in residue distribution over different organs and/or lipids on the normalization of BCF values is discussed. Conclusions A broad range of procedures for <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> are available. However, only the use of suitable extraction techniques guarantees the complete <b>extraction</b> of total <b>lipids</b> from fish samples in bioaccumulation studies which is required to ensure the correct lipid normalization of BCF values.

40|$|International audienceMembrane lipid {{molecules}} are a {{major component}} of planktonic organisms and this is particularly true of the microbial picoplankton that dominate the open ocean; with their high surface-area to volume ratios, the synthesis of membrane lipids places a major demand on their overall cell metabolism. Specifically, the synthesis of cell membrane phospholipids creates a demand for the nutrient phosphorus, and we sought to refine our understanding of the role of phospholipids in the upper ocean phosphorus cycle. We measured the rates of phospholipid synthesis in a transect of the eastern subtropical South Pacific from Easter Island to Concepcion, Chile as part of the BIOSOPE program. Our approach combined standard phosphorus radiotracer incubations and <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>methods.</b> We found that phospholipid synthesis rates varied from less than 1 to greater than 200 pmol P L - 1 h - 1, and that phospholipid synthesis contributed between less than 5 % to greater than 22 % of the total PO 4 3 - incorporation rate. Changes in the percentage that phospholipid synthesis contributed to total PO 4 3 - uptake were strongly correlated with the ratio of primary production to bacterial production, which supported our hypothesis that heterotrophic bacteria were the primary agents of phospholipid synthesis. The spatial variation in phospholipid synthesis rates underscored the importance of heterotrophic bacteria in the phosphorus cycle of the eastern subtropical South Pacific, particularly the hyperoligotrophic South Pacific subtropical gyre...|$|R
