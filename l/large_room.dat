The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single <b>large</b> <b>room</b> with a curtain to separate the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} schoolhouse in {{the churchyard}} {{was built in}} 1628; the school room {{was on the ground}} floor and the schoolmaster's accommodation was above. A <b>large</b> <b>room</b> was added to the rear in 1817, and in 1908 the building was restored and presented to the parish by LordStanley. It is now used as a parish hall and is listed GradeII*.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper floor}} of this {{building}} was the reredorter or latrine. It is a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> with a door conveniently leading into the monks' dormitory.

50|$|In the 1880s, small public {{rooms of}} the home with {{specific}} functions began {{to be replaced by}} <b>larger</b> <b>rooms</b> that would fulfill multiple uses, with the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms still being enclosed private spaces. <b>Larger</b> <b>rooms</b> were made possible by advances in centralized heating that allowed larger spaces to be kept at comfortable temperatures.|$|R
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from <b>large</b> <b>room</b> openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
5|$|Located {{near the}} retablo is a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> called the ante-sacristy, a storage room for church {{utensils}} and decorations. This room {{is connected to}} either the convent or the main sacristy which stores the church's liturgical vestments. Several wooden chests inside the sacristy carries the flaming heart, {{a symbol of the}} Augustinian order and okir motifs. The doors leading to both the ante-sacristy and sacristy is similar to the doors of another Jesuit church, the Maragondon Church. The sacristy was also built at that same time with the baptistry in 1852.|$|E

5|$|Opening onto Rue Saint-Honoré {{with a large}} portal, {{the south}} wing was the hotel's main building; like the east wing, it is well-preserved. To {{the left of the}} portal is an area which {{previously}} served as a stable. The ground floor has a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> opening onto the courtyard and another, smaller room. The first floor consists of three rooms: two small rooms and a garderobe. During the eighteenth century, it was recorded that the top floor had two chambres de bonne.|$|E
5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although it might have just been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{dates from}} the 17th century, and was originally used as a coaching inn. References to the Checkers Inn in Montgomery within the British Newspaper Archives appear {{as far back as}} 1855, when Rebecca Davies' annual ball was due to take place in the <b>large</b> <b>room</b> there. In 1870, the inn was run by Charles Williams. During the early 2000s, the building was operated as a hotel and pub,. with Eric Whittingham as landlord.|$|E

5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} shows a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the}} reign of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
5|$|Under {{articles}} XXII and XXIII of the Act of Union of 1707, Scottish peers {{were entitled}} to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish peers to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> decorated by eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet's portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus Mór to Charles II. The Lord Clerk Register would read out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re–read, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return {{being sent to the}} clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose.|$|E

5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} <b>large</b> <b>room</b> {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|The librarians {{sought a}} larger and more centrally-located space than the Briarcliff Farms building. On March 18, 1930, after {{invitation}} from the Briarcliff school district's Board of Education, the library was relocated again. It moved to a <b>large</b> <b>room</b> {{on the main floor}} of Briarcliff High School's extension to its Law Park school building. In August 1949, the school required more classroom space, so the Board of Education asked the library to relocate. The village board then provided the library with two rooms {{on the second floor of}} its recreation building near the village downtown on Old Route 100 (then part of NY Route 100). From the beginning, the recreation center rooms were too small to hold the library's collection (only holding about 7,000 of its 8,500 books), had insufficient room for tables and chairs, and no space for exhibits or displays. As well, the area was busy with traffic, due to its location at the intersection of two highways. It was also far from the village's public school buildings and had no sidewalks nearby, making it poorly-accessible and hazardous for children to visit.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a <b>large</b> <b>room,</b> and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E

5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather in the drawing room, which was the only <b>large</b> <b>room</b> in the house, and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E
