40|$|Abstract Background Tolerability and {{efficacy}} of the intestinal phosphate binder Lantharenol ® (<b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>octahydrate)</b> were tested in two prospective, randomized and negative controlled laboratory studies with healthy adult cats fed commercial maintenance diets non-restricted in phosphorus. In the first study, the maximal tolerated dose was determined. Starting from a dose of 0. 125 g/kg body weight mixed with the daily feed ration, the dose of Lantharenol ® was doubled every other week until signs of intolerability were observed (N = 10 cats compared to 5 untreated controls). In the second study, the effects of feed supplementation for two weeks with approximately 2, 6, and 20 % of the maximal tolerated dose on phosphorus excretion patterns and balance were assessed (N = 8 cats per group). Results Lantharenol ® {{was found to be}} safe and well tolerated up to the dose of 1 g/kg bodyweight, corresponding to a concentration of 84 g Lantharenol ® /kg complete feed, defined as dry matter with a standard moisture content of 12 %. Feed supplementation for two weeks with approximately 2 - 20 % of this dosage (i. e., 1. 6, 4. 8, and 16 g/kg complete feed) resulted in a shift from urinary to faecal phosphorus excretion. Apparent phosphorus digestibility was dose-dependently reduced compared to the control group fed with diet only (N = 8). Conclusions The feed additive was well accepted and tolerated by all cats. Therefore, Lantharenol ® presents a well tolerated and efficacious option to individually tailor restriction of dietary phosphorus as indicated, for instance, in feline chronic kidney disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (FOSRENOL ®) is an effective, well-tolerated {{phosphate}} binder. The {{ability of}} lanthanum to reduce serum phosphorus levels to ≤ 5. 5 mg/dL {{in patients with}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was assessed in a clinical practice setting. Methods A 16 -week, phase IV study enrolled 2763 patients at 223 US sites to evaluate the efficacy of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> in controlling serum phosphorus in patients with ESRD, and patient and physician satisfaction with, and preference for, <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> after conversion from other phosphate-binder medications. Patients received <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> prescriptions from physicians. These prescriptions were filled at local pharmacies rather than obtaining medication at the clinical trial site. Changes from serum phosphorus baseline values were analyzed using paired t tests. Patient and physician preferences for <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> versus previous medications were assessed using binomial proportion tests. Satisfaction was analyzed using the McNemar test. Daily dose, tablet burden, and laboratory values including albumin-adjusted serum calcium, calcium × phosphorus product, and parathyroid hormone levels were secondary endpoints. Results Serum phosphorus control (≤ 5. 5 mg/dL) was effectively maintained in patients converting to <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> monotherapy; 41. 6 % of patients had controlled serum phosphate levels at 16 weeks. Patients and physicians expressed markedly higher satisfaction with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> and preferred <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> over previous medication.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (Fosrenol(TM), Shire Pharmaceuticals) {{is a novel}} {{treatment}} for hyperphosphataemia. In this open-label study, we compared the effects of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> and calcium carbonate on bone in dialysis patients.

40|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> is a nonaluminum, noncalcium phosphate-binding agent, {{which is}} widely used in {{patients}} with end-stage chronic kidney disease. Until now, no significant side-effects have been described for the clinical use of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> {{and there are no}} available clinical data regarding its tissue stores. Here we report the case of a 59 -year-old patient who was admitted with confusional syndrome. The patient received 3750 mg of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> daily. Examinations were carried out, and the etiology of the encephalopathy of the patient could not be singled out. The <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were high, and the syndrome eased after the drug was removed. The results of our study confirm that, in our case, the lanthanum carbo-nate did cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> seems a safe drug with min-imal absorption, this work reveals the problem derived from the increase of serum levels of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> and the possibility that it may cross the BBB. Further re-search is required on the possible pathologies that increase serum levels of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> as well as the risks and side-effects derived from its absorption...|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} {{a new approach}} to prepare <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> via reactions between lanthanum chloride and NaHCO 3. In the reaction, small amount of NaHCO 3 solution was firstly added to the acidic lanthanum chloride solution to generate <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> nuclei and then NaHCO 3 is added to the lanthanum chloride at a constant speed. This approach makes both precipitation reaction and neutralization reaction take place simultaneously. Consequently, <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> is produced at low pH environment (pH below 4. 0) so that the risk of generating <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> hydroxide is reduced. The product of the above reaction is validated by EDTA titration, elemental analysis, and XRD characterization.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to compare the phosphate-binding efficacy of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> directly with other clinically used phosphate binders and to evaluate any potential adverse pharmacology. To examine the phosphate-binding efficacy, rats with normal renal function and chronic renal failure received <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, or sevelamer hydrochloride in several experimental models. <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> and aluminum hydroxide markedly increased excretion of [32 P]-phosphate in feces and reduced excretion in urine in rats with normal renal function (p < 0. 05), indicating good dietary phosphate-binding efficacy. In rats with chronic renal failure, <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> and aluminum hydroxide reduced urinary phosphate excretion {{to a greater degree}} and more rapidly than calcium carbonate, which in turn was more effective than sevelamer hydrochloride. The potential to induce adverse pharmacological effects was assessed systematically in mice, rats, and dogs with normal renal function using standard in vivo models. There was no evidence of any adverse secondary pharmacological effects of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> on the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, or gastrointestinal systems.

40|$|Objectives: The {{tolerability}} {{and efficacy}} of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> has not been studied in the Indian population. This study was, therefore, undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> with calcium acetate in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Design: A randomized open label two group cross-over study. Materials and Methods: Following Institutional Ethics Committee approval and valid consent, patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease were randomized to receive either <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> 500 mg thrice daily or calcium acetate 667 mg thrice daily for 4 weeks. After a 4 -week washout period, the patients were crossed over for another 4 weeks. Serum phosphorous, serum calcium, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum creatinine were estimated at fixed intervals. Results: Twenty-six patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. The mean serum phosphorous concentrations showed a declining trend with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (from pre-drug levels of 7. 88 &# 177; 1. 52 mg/dL- 7. 14 &# 177; 1. 51 mg/dL) and calcium acetate (from pre-drug levels of 7. 54 &# 177; 1. 39 mg/dL- 6. 51 &# 177; 1. 38 mg/dL). A statistically significant difference was seen when comparing the change in serum calcium produced by these drugs (P < 0. 05). Serum calcium levels increased with calcium acetate (from pre-drug levels of 7. 01 &# 177; 1. 07 - 7. 46 &# 177; 0. 74 mg dL), while it decreased with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (from pre-drug levels 7. 43 &# 177; 0. 77 - 7. 14 &# 177; 0. 72 mg/ dL). The incidence of adverse effects was greater with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate.</b> Conclusion: <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> and calcium acetate are equally effective phosphate binders with trends obvious in the first 4 weeks of therapy. The decrease in serum calcium levels with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> when compared to the increase in serum calcium levels due to calcium acetate is statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{short-term}} study {{assessed the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{in the treatment of}} hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients; here, we report a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Methods Men and women (n = 39) who had received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for chronic kidney disease for 6  months or more were enrolled in eight renal medicine departments in the United Kingdom. A 2 -week washout period was followed by a 4 -week dose-titration phase during which patients received <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> titrated up to 2250  mg/day. This was followed by a 4 -week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase during which patients continued to receive either <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> at the titrated dose, or a matched dose of placebo. The main outcome measure was control of serum phosphate levels (1. 3 - 1. 8  mmol/l) {{at the end of the}} parallel-group phase. Results Serum phosphate was controlled in 3 / 39 (8 %) patients at the beginning of the dose-titration phase (after washout) and in 18 / 31 (58 %) patients treated with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> at its end. After the parallel-group phase, 60 % of lanthanum carbonate-treated patients and 10 % of those receiving placebo had controlled serum phosphate. There was no difference in mean (95 % confidence interval) serum phosphate levels between groups at randomization: <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> 1. 57 (1. 34 - 1. 81) mmol/l; placebo, 1. 58 (1. 40 - 1. 76) mmol/l (p = 0. 96). However, a difference was seen at the end of the parallel-group phase: <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> 1. 56 (1. 33 - 1. 79) mmol/l; placebo, 2. 25 (1. 81 - 2. 68) mmol/l (p = 0. 0015). There were no clinically important changes in nutritional parameters and no serious treatment-related adverse events were recorded. Conclusions At doses up to 2250  mg/day, <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> is well tolerated and controls hyperphosphatemia effectively.

40|$|Hyperphosphatemia is {{recognized}} as a principal mineral disorder in chronic kidney disease (CKD) {{that leads to the}} development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Approximately 70 % of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and dialysis have hyperphosphataemia, which is associated with renal osteodystrophy, metastatic calcification and increased mortality and morbidity. Despite dietary restriction and dialysis, most patients will require a phosphate-binding agent to treat this condition. <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> is an new, potent, selective, no-resin, non-calcium phosphate binder that retains high affinity for phosphate over a wide pH range, does not bind bile acids or contribute to metabolic acidosis. Taken with food, it is well tolerated. It is poorly absorbed and does not require functioning kidneys to be removed from the body. There is no evidence from current studies that it accumulates to biologically significant levels in tissues. <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> has been shown in clinical studies of up to 6 years to be an effective, well-tolerated phosphate binder. <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> controls hyperphosphataemia without increasing calcium intake above guideline targets and has the potential to reduce pill burden and increase patient compliance compared with other phosphate binders. Reported adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal, and do not differ from those of calcium carbonate. The new phosphate binders, <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> and sevelamer, have increased the possibilities for serum phosphate control, at the expenses of significant increases in costs. The cost-effectiveness of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> has been assessed by three different studies. A recent analysis, conducted on the perspective of the UK NHS, shows it is cost-effective to follow current treatment guidelines and treat all patients who are not adequately maintained on calcium carbonate (serum phosphorus above 5. 6 mg/dl) with second-line <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate.</b> This is particularly the case for patients with serum phosphorus above 6. 6 mg/dl. A retrospective analysis, performed on IHCSI data base (USA), and a prospective study conducted in Spain show that <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> is cost-effective as compared with sevelamer, requiring less number of tablets, a fact that might improve adherence, and that probably explains better results with lower costs...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{peripheral}} arterial disease {{developed in}} a 54 -year-old {{woman who had been}} undergoinghemodialysis for six years for polycystic kidney disease. Upon diagnosis with peripheral aterial disease, she no longer qualified for the active waiting list for renal transplant. After successful treatment with percutaneous transluminal angio-plasty, she was re-evaluated for the active waiting list. The evaluation included computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed severe atherosclerotic calcifications in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. Multiple intense radiopaque structures of varying size were found in the small and large intestines (Figure 1). On further questioning, the patient reported that her doctor had changed her antiphosphate medication to <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate.</b> She reported no changes to her bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhea. <b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> is a novel nonaluminum, noncal-cium phosphate binder that has been increasingly used in clin-ical practice. 1 Oral administration of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> inhibits absorption of phosphate from food by forming insolu-ble lanthanum–phosphate complexes in the intestinal tract.

Lanthanum {{administration did not}} influence body or several organ weights and liver function. In rats administered lanthanum, a very small quantity of lanthanum was detected in several organs although the apparent absorption was almost zero. The highest lanthanum concentration was observed in the liver followed by the femur and kidney. Lanthanum was not clearly detected in the brain. Differences in organ lanthanum between 0. 45 % and 0. 90 % administration groups were not significant; lanthanum accumulation in the body is very low and may reach a plateau in a certain range of intake. Serum phosphorus was decreased and fecal phosphorus was increased by lanthanum administration dose-dependently. Urinary phosphorus excretion was significantly decreased by lanthanum. Since urinary phosphorus of rats fed 0. 45 % lanthanum diet decreased to near zero, the highest phosphorus balance was observed in rats fed 0. 45 % lanthanum diet. This high balance {{is considered to be}} adaptation to the low phosphorus status induced by <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate.</b> These results indicate that <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> can induce hypophosphatemia without any direct side effects and be used to examine the effect of removing phosphorus from the diet in animal nutritional studies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{recognized}} {{risks associated}} with hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 5 on dialysis, the achievement of target levels of serum phosphate is poor.

METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label trial, patients on a stable dialysis regimen were screened while receiving phosphate-binder therapy, then entered into a washout phase. Patients with serum phosphate > 1. 78 mmol/L after washout entered into the main 12 -week treatment phase (N = 367), during which they were treated to target [Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) ]: 1. 13 - 1. 78 mmol/L; 3. 5 - 5. 5 mg/dL) with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> monotherapy. Efficacy variables included serum phosphate levels and the percentage of patients with serum phosphate control. Safety and tolerability assessments were also conducted. RESULTS: Mean serum phosphate levels were significantly reduced following 12 weeks of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> monotherapy versus previous phosphate-binder therapy. The mean number of phosphate-binder tablets being taken per day at screening was 7. 6, but during treatment with <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> most patients were taking doses of up to 3000 mg/day, achievable with 3 x 1000 mg tablets per day (maximum of 6).

40|$|Background and objectives: Management of hyperphosphatemia, a {{predictor}} of mortality in chronic kidney disease, is challenging. Nonadherence to dietary phosphate binders, in part, contributes to uncontrolled serum phosphorus levels. This phase IIIb trial assessed the efficacy of increased dosages (3000 to 4500 mg/d) of reformulated <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (500 -, 750 -, and 1000 -mg tablets) in nonresponders to dosages of up to 3000 mg/d. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This 8 -wk study with a 4 -mo open-label extension enrolled 513 patients who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Patients who achieved serum phosphorus control at week 4 with < 3000 mg/d <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> entered cohort A; nonresponders {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 3000, 3750, or 4500 mg/d (cohort B). The primary outcome measure was the control rate for predialysis serum phosphorus levels at the end of week 8, among patients in cohort B. Results: At the end of week 4, 54 % of patients achieved serum phosphorus control at dosages < 3000 mg/d administered as one tablet per meal. Among patients who entered cohort B, control rates of 25, 38, and 32 % for patients who were randomly assigned to 3000, 3750, or 4500 mg/d <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> respectively, were achieved, with no increase in adverse events. Patients and physicians reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction with reformulated <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> compared with previous phosphate binders, partly because of reduced tablet burden with higher dosage strengths.

40|$|Abstract: Background. Hyperphosphataemia is a {{risk factor}} for {{arterial}} calcification contributing to the high cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Calcium-based phosphate binders can induce hypercalcaemia and are associated with progression of vascular calcification. Therefore, the effect of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate,</b> a non-calcium phosphate binder, on the development of vascular calcification was investigated in uraemic rats. Methods. Chronic renal failure (CRF) was induced by feeding rats an adenine-enriched diet for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, 1 % or 2 % <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> was added to the diet for 6 weeks. Calcification in the aorta, carotid and femoral arteries was evaluated histomorphometrically, biochemically and by ex vivo micro-CT. Chondro-/osteogenic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cells was also analysed in the rat aorta. Results. Treatment with 1 % <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (1 % La) did not reduce vascular calcification, but in the 2 % <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> (2 % La) group vascular calcium content and area% Von Kossa positivity were decreased compared with control CRF rats. The aortic calcified volume measured with ex vivo micro-CT was significantly reduced in rats treated with 2 % La. Although calcification was inhibited by treatment with 2 % La, the chondrocyte transcription factor sox- 9 was abundantly expressed in the aorta. Conclusion. Treatment of CRF rats with 2 % La reduces the development of vascular calcification by adequate phosphate binding resulting in a decreased supply of phosphate as a substrate for vascular calcification...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} PA 21, a novel iron-based and non-calcium-based {{phosphate}} binder, on hyperphosphatemia and its accompanying bone abnormality in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) were evaluated. Rats with adenine-induced {{chronic renal failure}} (CRF) were prepared by feeding them an adenine-containing diet for four weeks. They were also freely fed a diet that contained PA 21 (0. 5, 1. 5, and 5 %), sevelamer hydrochloride (0. 6 and 2 %) or <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> hydrate (0. 6 and 2 %) for four weeks. Blood biochemical parameters were measured and bone histomorphometry was performed for femurs, which were isolated after drug treatment. Serum phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels {{were higher in the}} CRF rats. Administration of phosphate binders for four weeks decreased serum phosphorus and PTH levels in a dose-dependent manner and there were significant decreases in the AUC 0 - 28 day of these parameters in 5 % PA 21, 2 % sevelamer hydrochloride, and 2 % <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> hydrate groups compared with that in the CRF control group. Moreover, osteoid volume improved significantly in 5 % of the PA 21 group, and fibrosis volume and cortical porosity were ameliorated in 5 % PA 21, 2 % sevelamer hydrochloride, and 2 % <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> hydrate groups. These results suggest that PA 21 is effective against hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone abnormalities in CKD-MBD as sevelamer hydrochloride and <b>lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> hydrate are, and that PA 21 is a new potential alternative to phosphate binders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{is a new}} non-aluminum- and non-calcium-containing {{phosphate}} binder {{that has}} re-cently become available {{for the management of}} hyper-phosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (FDA approval in 2004).
