6000|$|... 101. But, {{whatever}} their balance of body, {{or use of}} foot, the two birds just examined are, as I said, essentially connected with the running land birds, or broadly, the Plovers; and with the Sand-runners, or (from their cry) Sandpipers, which Mr. Gould evidently associates mentally with the Plovers, in {{his description of the}} plumage of the Dunlin; while he gives to them in his plates of that bird--the <b>little</b> <b>Stint,</b> and common Sandpiper--most subtle action with their fine feet,--thread-fine, almost, in the toes; requiring us, it seems to me, to consider them as entirely land-birds, however fond of the wave margins. But the next real water-ouzel we come to, belongs to a group with feet like little horse-chestnut leaves; each toe having its separate lobes of web. Why separated, I cannot yet make out, but the bird swims, or even dives, on occasion, with dexterity and force. These lobe-footed birds consist first of the Grebes, which are connected with fresh-water ducks; and, secondly, of the Phalaropes, which are a sort of sea-gulls. No bird which is not properly web-footed has any business to think itself either true duck or true gull; but as, both in size and habit of life, the larger grebes and phalaropes are entirely aquatic and marine, I shall take out of them into my class of dabchicks, only those which are literally dabblers in habit, and chickens in size. And of the Grebes, therefore, only the one commonly known as the Dabchick, the 'Little Grebe,' 'Colymbus Minutus' (Minute Diver), of Linnæus. A summary word or two, first, respecting the Grebe family, will be useful.|$|E

40|$|Both nest {{survival}} and incubation behaviour are highly variable among shorebirds (Charadrii), and we tested whether more conspicuous incubation behaviour increased {{the risk of}} nest predation. During 2000 - 2006, we monitored nest fate at 901 shorebird nests at three study sites across the circumpolar Arctic. Using miniature video recorders and nest temperature sensors, we obtained 782 days of behavioural data for 161 nests of 11 species. We related nest fate to the rate and duration of adults' nest absences or restless movements on the nest, {{as well as the}} total proportion of each day that adult birds engaged in these activities. Nest predation was positively related to the proportion of time that each species left the nest unattended. After controlling for species effects, the likelihood of a successful nesting attempt was lower for individuals that spent more time off the nest, but among failed nests, the number of days that a nest survived prior to depredation was not significantly predicted by measures of incubation behaviour. To control for weather or seasonal effects, we paired observations from nests that were ultimately depredated with observations from successful nests of the same species on the same day. In this paired sample (dominated by two species: red phalaropes, Phalaropus fulicarius, and <b>little</b> <b>stints,</b> Calidris minuta), both incubation recesses and restless movements were more numerous among failed versus successful nests. Our results suggest that more conspicuous incubation behaviour is indeed related to a higher risk of nest predation, and that this relationship may underlie patterns of nest survival within and among shorebird species.

50|$|Nearly 200 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in Swan bay. Birds of conservation significance for which the bay and its shore are internationally important include the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot as well as little tern, fairy tern, eastern curlew, Lewin's rail and white-bellied sea eagle. It also supports over 1% of the Australian population of four wader species: Grey plover, Pacific golden plover, double-banded plover and eastern curlew. Other birds found in the region include the Australian pelican, silver gull, royal spoonbill, Caspian and crested terns, white-fronted chat, sacred ibis, red-necked <b>stint,</b> <b>little</b> pied cormorant and pied oystercatcher. Some of these birds travel {{from as far away}} as Arctic Siberia and Alaska where they breed, to feed on the intertidal mudflats of Swan Bay.|$|R
50|$|The {{numbers of}} this species (and of <b>little</b> <b>stint)</b> depend on the {{population}} of lemmings. In poor lemming years, predatory species such as skuas and snowy owls will take Arctic-breeding waders instead.|$|E

50|$|Regular {{visitors}} to the reservoirs include green and common sandpiper, dunlin, redshank and lapwing, while less common species include ringed and little ringed plover, curlew, ruff, snipe, oystercatcher, wood sandpiper, whimbrel, golden plover and <b>little</b> <b>stint.</b>|$|E

50|$|These {{birds are}} very small waders, at 13.5 - 15 cm length. They are similar in size to the <b>little</b> <b>stint</b> (Calidris minuta) but shorter legged and longer winged.
