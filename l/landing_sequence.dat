25|$|The entry-descent-landing (EDL) system {{differs from}} those {{used for other}} {{missions}} in {{that it does not}} require an interactive, ground-generated mission plan. During the entire landing phase, the vehicle acts autonomously, based on pre-loaded software and parameters. The EDL system was based on a Viking-derived aeroshell structure and propulsion system for a precision guided entry and soft landing, in contrasts with the airbag landings that were used by the mid-1990s by the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions. The spacecraft employed several systems in a precise order, with the entry, descent and <b>landing</b> <b>sequence</b> broken down into four parts—described below as the spaceflight events unfolded on August 6, 2012.|$|E
25|$|Needing a {{location}} to shoot all takeoffs and landings for the 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High, including the spectacular B-17 Flying Fortress belly <b>landing</b> <b>sequence</b> {{early in the}} film, director Henry King selected Ozark since its dark runways more closely matched wartime bases in England {{as opposed to the}} light-colored runways at nearby Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, the primary shoot location. Since the field had been allowed to overgrow during its inactive status, it was also an ideal location for the character Harvey Stovall to post-war reminisce about his World War II service (which is seen {{at the beginning of the}} film) before the crew mowed and dressed the field to start the rest of shooting.|$|E
25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into subareas that scrolled either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory management controller chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a <b>landing</b> <b>sequence,</b> and a Breakout clone. One of the first raster-based platform games to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E

500|$|While {{preparing}} to film the Fireflash controlled <b>landing</b> <b>sequence,</b> Meddings {{was faced with}} the difficulty of having to build an extended, dynamic runway set in the limited shooting space available at AP Films Studios. His compact and cost-efficient solution was to isolate the basic set elements – the grass verge foreground, the sky background and the tarmac separating them – and construct separate loops of canvas, all painted to represent one element; these were fitted to rollers that, when run at speeds proportionate to their respective distances from the camera, simulated a continuous backdrop. This [...] "rolling road" [...] (or [...] "roller-road") technique marked a progression from the [...] "rolling sky" [...] that had been pioneered in previous Anderson series, such as Stingray.|$|E
500|$|A {{separate}} {{model was}} created for {{the exterior of the}} derelict alien spacecraft. Matte paintings were used to fill in areas of the ship's interior as well as exterior shots of the planetoid's surface. The surface as seen from space during the <b>landing</b> <b>sequence</b> was created by painting a globe white, then mixing chemicals and dyes onto transparencies and projecting them onto it. The planetoid was not named in the film, but some drafts of the script gave it the name Acheron after the river which in Greek mythology is described as the [...] "stream of woe"; it is a branch of the river Styx, and forms the border of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The 1986 sequel Aliens named the planetoid as [...] "LV-426", and both names have been used for it in subsequent expanded-universe media such as comic books and video games.|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot <b>landing</b> <b>sequence</b> look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

During the NASA Apollo programme, presenting on the Apollo 8 mission, he said that [...] "this {{is one of the}} great moments of human history", only to have his broadcast interrupted by the children's programme Jackanory. He was a presenter for the Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 missions, and a commenter, with Cliff Michelmore and James Burke, for BBC television's coverage of the Moon landing missions. Moore could not remember his words at the [...] "Eagle has landed" [...] moment, and the BBC has lost the tapes of the broadcast. A homemade recording reveals that the studio team was very quiet during the <b>landing</b> <b>sequence,</b> leaving the NASA commentary clear of interruptions. Some 14 seconds after [...] "contact" [...] Burke says [...] "They've touched". At 36 seconds he says [...] "Eagle has landed". Between 53 and 62 seconds he explains the upcoming stay/no-stay decision and NASA announces the T1 stay at 90 seconds after contact. At 100 seconds the recorded sequence ends. Thus any real-time comment Moore made was not broadcast live and the recording ends before Burke polls the studio team for comment and reaction. Moore participated in TV coverage of Apollo missions 12 to 17.|$|E

2500|$|Locations for {{creating}} the bomber airfield at RAF Archbury were scouted by director Henry King, flying his own private aircraft some 16,000 miles in February and March 1949. King visited Eglin AFB on March 8, 1949 and found an ideal location for principal photography several {{miles north of the}} main base at its Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 3, better known as Duke Field, where the mock installation with 15 buildings (including a World War II control tower) were constructed to simulate RAF Archbury. The film's technical advisor, Colonel John deRussy, was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama at the time, and suggested Ozark Army Air Field near Daleville, Alabama (now known as Cairns Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Rucker). King chose Cairns as the location for filming B-17 takeoffs and landings, including the B-17 belly <b>landing</b> <b>sequence,</b> since the light-colored runways at Eglin did not match wartime runways in England which had been black to make them less visible to enemy aircraft. When the crew arrived at Cairns, it was also considered as an [...] "ideal for shots of Harvey Stovall reminiscing about his World War II service" [...] since the field was somewhat overgrown.|$|E

A unique feature of the TMA is its graphical interface that allows the traffic manager to modify the computer-generated schedules for specific aircraft while allowing the automatic scheduler to continue generating schedules for all other aircraft. The graphical interface also provides convenient methods for monitoring the traffic flow and changing scheduling parameters during real-time operation...|$|R
50|$|While {{the orbiter}} {{performed}} the orbit insertion burn, both Surface Stations {{were to make}} a soft landing on Mars. Both <b>landing</b> <b>sequences</b> were identical. They began with the craft being slowed down by aerodynamic pressure. At an altitude of 19.1 km, a parachute would deploy, followed by heat shield separation at 18.3 km, and inflation of the airbags at 17.9 km. When the lander, cushioned by the airbags, hit the ground, the parachute would separate. The airbag would eventually roll to a stop. After which both airbags would separate revealing the lander. The four petals would open and the lander would signal the orbiter when it passed over the landing site.|$|R

50|$|The {{model of}} the Eagle used in filming was built in four scales: {{by the end of}} the series, there were three 44 in Eagle models, two 22 in Eagles, one 11 in Eagle, and a 5 in Eagle. The {{superstructure}} framework was composed of brass tubing on the larger-scale models and the command module was fiberglass, with landing gear pods made of a wooden core with Perspex cladding. Compressed freon streams were used to portray the vertical jets used in lift-off and <b>landing</b> <b>sequences</b> and, in Year Two, the exhaust from the main rockets.

40|$|Landing {{behavior}} {{is one of}} the most critical, yet least studied, aspects of insect flight. In order to land safely, an insect must recognize a visual feature, navigate towards it, decelerate, and extend its legs in preparation for touchdown. Although previous studies have focused on the visual stimuli that trigger these different components, the complete sequence has not been systematically studied in a free-flying animal. Using a real-time 3 D tracking system in conjunction with high speed digital imaging, we were able to capture the <b>landing</b> <b>sequences</b> of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) from the moment they first steered toward a visual target, to the point of touchdown. This analysis was made possible by a custom-built feedback system that actively maintained the fly in the focus of the high speed camera. The results suggest that landing is composed of three distinct behavioral modules. First, a fly actively turns towards a stationary target via a directed body saccade. Next, it begins to decelerate at a point determined by both the size of the visual target and its rate of expansion on the retina. Finally, the fly extends its legs when the visual target reaches a threshold retinal size of approximately 60 deg. Our data also let us compare <b>landing</b> <b>sequences</b> with flight trajectories that, although initially directed toward a visual target, did not result in landing. In these ‘fly-by’ trajectories, flies steer toward the target but then exhibit a targeted aversive saccade when the target subtends a retinal size of approximately 33 deg. Collectively, the results provide insight into the organization of sensorimotor modules that underlie the landing and search behaviors of insects...|$|R
