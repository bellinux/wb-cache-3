40|$|New {{symptoms}} of systemic mosaic on radish (Raphanus sativus) were noticed by {{farmers in the}} middle of Iraq in 2009. This led to think that the causal agent may be a new virus. An isolate of the causal agent has been isolated and characterized as a Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) from the infected Radish. Leaves from radishes showing systemic mosaic were collected from several locations that cultivate radish in Iraq in 2011. The virus was identified by symptoms on indicator plants, immunochromatography and the molecular weight of viral coat protein. The virus caused systemic severe mosaic on Cucumis sativus, Cucumis melo, Cucurbita pepo, mild systemic mosaic on Raphanus sativus, Nicotiana tabaccum and induced the formation of <b>leaf</b> <b>strip</b> and filliforme shaped on tomato mechanically inoculated by an extract from symptomatic radish leaves.

We asked if, in Arabidopsis, IAA-induced growth of excised <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> results from the wounding required to excise tissue and/or results from detachment from the plant and thus loss of some shoot or root derived growth controlling factors. We tested {{the effect of a}} range of exogenous IAA concentrations on the growth of intact attached, wounded attached, detached intact, detached wounded as well as excised <b>leaf</b> <b>strips.</b> After 24 h, the growth of intact attached, wounded attached, and detached intact leaves was inhibited by IAA concentrations as little as 1 µM in some experiments.

A research study to evaluate the adaptability of soybean varieties to intercropping under <b>leaf</b> <b>stripped</b> and detasselled maize was conducted at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (Thornpark Farm) during the 2006 / 2007 rainy season. The experiment was laid out as a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial with controls in a Randomized Complete Block Design. The three factors were; cropping system (sole maize, maize-soybean intercrop, sole soybean), soybean variety (Storm, Solitaire and Magoye) <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling (intact maize, four bottom leaves removed and tassel removed). In the intercrop, two soybean rows were planted between maize rows. <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling was done at 50 % silking. Weed counts were taken at 6 and 9 weeks after crop emergence (WACE) and at physiological maturity. Yield and yield components were determined at harvesting. There were significant differences (P < 0. 05) {{in the performance of}} the soybean varieties, Storm had the highest yield (1770 kg/ha) which was not significantly different from Solitaire (1496 kg /ha), but Magoye gave the lowest yield (837 kg/ha), which was different from either Storm or Solitaire. There was a significant difference in performance of soybean varieties under different cropping systems (P < 0. 05). The soybean varieties performed better as sole crop (1838 kg/ha) than under intercropping (maize (intact) -soybean: 868 kg/ha), maize (<b>leaf</b> <b>stripped</b> and detasselled: 950 kg/ha). <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling and cropping system had no significant effect on 1000 -grain weight and grain yield of maize. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) values of the various intercropping systems were all greater than 1 indicating the advantages of intercropping. Cropping system, soybean variety and <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling had no significant effect on total weed biomass at 6 and 9 WACE but had significant effect on total weed biomass at physiological maturity. Results suggest that intercropping reduces the yield of soybean but there is an advantage of intercropping since the LER values were greater than 1. The soybean crop can be considered as a bonus crop from which a farmer can reap additional financial and nutritional benefits as well as residual soil fertility. The stripped leaves from the maize can be fed to livestock. Magoye is not adaptable to intercropping...|$|R
40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} stresses influencing agriculture drastically decreasing the production of crop plants throughout the world. Due to salinity thousands of hectares of agricultural land are going out of production annually. To cope with the salinity problem, there is keen interest in the development of crop plants displaying resistance to the effects of salinity. A series of experiments was carried out under controlled environmental conditions to determine salt resistance in Rapid Cycling Brassica species (RCB's) at germination early seedling and late growth stage. The effect of increasing salinity concentration was determined in vivo using a compost based growing system and also in-vitro using adapted tissue culture techniques. At germination and during the early seedling stage, low salt concentrations (50 - 100 mM) stimulated germination and had no significant effect on growth in B. rapa and B. rapa appeared to have greater salt resistance than B. napus. There was no association between salt resistance at the early seedling stage and that at the adult stage. At later growth stages, salinity affected both the relative fresh and dry weights and tissue ion concentration with K: Na balance affected in favour of Na. The relative salt resistance in the six Brassica species was associated with the reduction in the total fresh weight of shoots of salt-treatment plants expressed as the percentage of control but was not associated with K., Na concentration or K/Na ratio in shoots. B. napus and B. carinata showed the greatest salt resistance, B. juncea, B. rapa and B. nigra were intermediate whilst B. oleracea was salt sensitive. Conventional selection for salt resistance was not successful in this study because B. oleracea, B. napus and B. carina/a were not able to complete either their vegetative or reproductive phases and died before completion of the first selection cycle. Whilst, ten percent of plants of B. rapa, B. nigra and B. juncea managed to complete the first selection cycle they failed to complete the second selection cycle. Although, callus induction and maintenance were successful for all 6 RCB's, regeneration of shoots from callus was poor. Also, callus-based selection for salt resistance was unsatisfactory and had variable results and it was concluded that this was not a promising avenue for improving salt resistance in RCB's A cauliflower curd meristem technique was adapted for in-vitro mutagenesis and selection. Mutagenesis was carried out using two mutagens N-nitroso-N-ethylurea or nitroso-methylurea at 1 mM and 2. 5 mM. 300 green shoots were recovered from more than 1, 000, 000 explants mutagenised in liquid medium supplemented with 3 mM hydroxyproline as a selection agent. Of eighty in-vitro shoots which where measured for proline content, twelve showed higher proline level than controls. <b>Leaf</b> <b>strip</b> assays of the twelve selected in-vitro shoots and in-vivo weaned plants exposed to a 3 mM and 10 mM hydroxyproline assay showed greater resistance than controls. A few selections also had cross-resistance to salt at 550 mM NaCl and to frost at - 7 °C. These results successfully indicated the existence of great opportunities for the production of stress resistance cauliflower plants via mutagenesis and hydroxyproline selection...|$|E

40|$|Keywords: Intercropping, narrow planting, precise {{fertilizer}} placement, radiation interception, <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping,</b> detasselling, Land Equivalent Ratio, maize, pumpkin, dry beans, reduced herbicide dosages In the tropics, weeds {{cause more}} crop losses and farmers spend {{more of their}} time weeding crops {{than in any other}} part of the world. Weeds form a major factor which contributes to the miserable quality of life of smallholder farmers, especially of women and children, in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The effects of maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercropping and, narrow row planting and precise basal fertilizer placement in monocrop maize, on crop and weed radiation interception (RI), crop yields, weed emergence, growth and fecundity were investigated in this study. The effects of <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> (removal of the lowest 2 - 6 leaves) and detasselling maize at anthesis on the radiant environment and crop yields in a maize monocrop and maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercrops were also studied to determine the impact of these interventions on yield of component crops. The aim of the studies was to generate technologies that could be integrated into the production practices of smallholder farmers to suppress weeds and alleviate the severe weeding burden faced by these farmers while ensuring high crop productivity. Maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercropping reduced weed biomass by 50 - 66 % when established at a density of 12, 300 plants ha - 1 for pumpkins equivalent to 33 % of the maize density (37, 000 plants ha - 1), and 222, 000 plants ha - 1 for beans. Lower densities of pumpkins than 33 % of the maize density failed to reduce weed biomass more than that achieved by sole maize. Sole maize crops were weeded twice or thrice to achieve the same weed biomass as intercrops weeded once showed that intercropping could reduce the weeding requirements of maize by 33 to 67 %. Maize grain yield was reduced by 20 % in one out of four seasons in the first study on maize-pumpkin intercropping. Maize grain yield was not reduced in three seasons when the maize-pumpkin intercropping treatments were <b>leaf</b> <b>stripped</b> and/or detasselled and the trend of <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling alleviating the effects of companion crop competition on maize grain was shown in the maize-bean intercrop experiments as well. Intercrop productivity increased with <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling as a result of greater penetration of radiation to the companion crop and their effects of increasing dry matter distributed to the maize cob (indicated by 1000 -grain weight, cob weight, and kernel weight cob - 1). <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> maize at anthesis focused on the removal of leaves that were beginning to senesce. If they would remain on the plant they would compete with the cob for assimilates as they senesce further, until necrosis. Detasselling is known to remove apical dominance and to increase radiation penetration to the middle leaves on the maize plant that produce most assimilates destined for the cob. <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> did not affect the ability of the intercrop to suppress weed growth and seed production. In maize monocrops more weed biomass and weed seeds were produced with <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling. Maize grain yield decreased with an increase in maize density from 30, 000 plants ha - 1 to 36, 000 and 42, 000 plants ha - 1 and weed growth suppression increased with an increase in maize density in a semi arid location in Zimbabwe. Planting maize using narrow row (60 cm × 45 cm) and (75 cm × 36 cm) spatial arrangements increased radiation interception by maize plants by 16 to 24 % and maize grain yields by 15 to 26 % compared to wide row (90 cm × 30 cm) spatial arrangement commonly used by smallholder farmers. Weed biomass was reduced by 20 to 80 %, dependent on weed species, in narrow row spatial arrangements compared to normal farmer planting patterns. The duration of the weed free period required to attain maximum yield increased from 6 weeks after emergence (WAE) in the 60 cm × 45 cm spatial arrangement to 9 WAE in the wider row spatial arrangements. It is, therefore, risky for smallholder farmers to increase maize density to suppress weeds as this will lead to maize grain yield reductions. The use of narrow rows proved to be a better option. Precise fertilizer placement (banding and spot placement) resulted in higher rates of early growth and by 4 WAE these treatments intercepted 20 % more of the incoming radiation than a broadcast placement method. Weed emergence, growth and seed production was higher in the broadcast placement treatment as a result of weeds intercepting more incoming radiation and greater access to applied fertilizer nutrients. High fertilizer rates of 225 kg ha - 1 of a compound fertilizer (8 % N, 14 % K 2 O, 7 % P 2 O 5), reduced maize grain yield by 15 % compared to 150 kg ha - 1 in a season characterized by drought. It was hypothesized that high concentrations of fertilizer around the root zone predisposed the maize plants to more severe effects of drought than lower fertilizer application rates. Reduced dosages of atrazine and nicosulfuron (25 % of the Label Recommended Dosages, LRDs) protected maize from weeds as well as the full LRDs of each herbicide. The reduced dosages suppressed weed competition during the critical period for weed control in maize. However, the tolerant weed species Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn., Setaria verticillata (L.) Beauv., Setaria homonyma (Stead.) Chiov. for atrazine and E. indica, Galinsoga parviflora Cav. and Portulaca oleracea L. for nicosulfuron, tended to escape the herbicide effects and survive as dosages were reduced. Reduced dosages of these herbicides have to be combined with hoe weeding or ox-cultivation to prevent the inadvertent selection of these species by the reduced dose strategy. Recalcitrant species recovering from tillage were shown to be more vulnerable to reduced herbicide toxicity in a greenhouse experiment. It was concluded that cultural weed management techniques that enhance radiation capture by the crop were effective in suppressing weed growth and seed production and increasing crop yields and should be incorporated into smallholder farmer's production practices in a systematic manner as part of Integrated Weed Management and cropping system design...|$|R

40|$|Boreal forest {{vegetation}} {{is likely to}} change in response to warming and associated changes in disturbance regimes. Recently, high severity fires have caused a shift from pre-fire mature black spruce stands to early assemblages of broadleaf trees. However, interactions between plants and animals may modify the outcomes of early forest succession. Selective herbivory by mammalian herbivores can alter the relative dominance of forest canopy species and influence successional pathways. However, woody plants have evolved multiple strategies to maximize chances of survival and long-term fitness after herbivory. In this thesis, I explore the dynamics of moose-tree interactions and their consequences for early succession in boreal forests of interior Alaska. I assessed the interaction of moose browsing and fire severity on tree growth and canopy composition and found that moose slow the rate of trembling aspen growth, but only in severely burned areas. Black spruce showed no direct or indirect growth responses to moose browsing, indicating that moose browsing on aspen did not alter the initial trajectory to an aspen-dominated canopy within my study area. In lightly burned areas, moose may benefit from longer durations of forage availability and accelerate {{the development of a}} mixed spruce-aspen canopy. Alaskan paper birch is the other dominant broadleaf species colonizing early post-fire forests and I determined saplings’ ability to tolerate simulated summer <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> by moose. I found decreases in woody growth and carbon-based defenses while individual leaf area increased in response to simulated <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping.</b> My results are consistent with the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis suggesting that the loss of growing points during <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> decreased competition for nutrients, which were then available for leaf regrowth. Birch saplings have the potential to compensate for herbivory, but resilience of individuals will depend on the intensity, season, and frequency of herbivory. I set up long-term exclosures to test if mammalian herbivores can alter patterns of canopy succession in early post-fire sites that ranged in broadleaf dominance. Removal of natural moose herbivory inside exclosures led to species-specific responses after two years. Alaskan paper birch (dominant broadleaf species) grew larger when safe from herbivores while the opposite was true for black spruce. However, impacts of natural moose browsing on the dominant birch were insufficient to eliminate the competitive hierarchies that supported birch dominance of the canopy and suppressed growth of black spruce in the understory. I conclude that even with the negative impacts of moose on broadleaf species growth, their tolerance to browse damage enables their persistence as the dominant canopy species after large and severe fires in the boreal forest of Alaska...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first issue}} in 1942 {{consisted}} of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought [...] "replacement notes" [...] of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 {{ushered in a}} 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories {{of going to the}} market laden with suitcases or [...] "bayong" [...] (native bags made of woven coconut or buri <b>leaf</b> <b>strips)</b> overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Potentilla kingii is a {{perennial}} herb which grows in matted clumps of glandular foliage. The leaves and thin, naked stems hang from their purchase on steep cliffs. Each <b>leaf</b> is a <b>strip</b> of oval-shaped green leaflets.|$|R
40|$|Protoplasts were {{isolated}} from {{leaves of the}} aquatic angiosperm Potamogeton lucens L. The leaves utilize bicarbonate as a carbon source for photosynthesis, and show polarity; that is, acidification of the periplasmic space of the lower, and alkalinization of the space near the upper leaf side. At present there are two models under consideration for this photosynthetic bicarbonate utilization process: conversion of bicarbonate into free carbon dioxide {{as a result of}} acidification and, second, a bicarbonate-proton symport across the plasma membrane. Carbon fixation of protoplasts was studied at different pH values and compared with that in <b>leaf</b> <b>strips.</b> Using the isotopic disequilibrium technique, it was established that carbon dioxide and not bicarbonate was the form in which DIC actually crossed the plasma membrane. It is concluded that there is probably no true bicarbonate transport system at the plasma membrane of these cells and that bicarbonate utilization in this species apparently rests on the conversion of bicarbonate into carbon dioxide. Experiments with acetazolamide, an inhibitor of periplasmic carbonic anhydrase, and direct measurements of carbonic anhydrase activity in intact leaves indicate that in this species the role of this enzyme for periplasmic conversion of bicarbonate into carbon dioxide is insignificant...|$|R
50|$|When closely {{arranged}} on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa (切り笹). These dividers prevent {{the flavors of}} neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (葉蘭 haran) and Sasa veitchii (熊笹 kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had {{the added benefit of}} releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.|$|R
40|$|Wounding initiates {{a strong}} and largely jasmonate-dependent remodelling of the {{transcriptome}} in the leaf blades of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). How much control do jasmonates exert on wound-induced protein repatterning in leaves? Replicated shotgun proteomic analyses of 2. 5 -mm-wide <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> adjacent to wounds revealed 106 differentially regulated proteins. Many of these gene products have not emerged as being wound regulated in transcriptomic studies. From experiments using the jasmonic acid (JA) -deficient allene oxide synthase mutant we estimated that approximately 95 % of wound-stimulated changes in protein levels were deregulated {{in the absence of}} JA. The levels of two tonoplast proteins already implicated in defense response regulation, TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1 and the calcium-V-ATPase ACA 4 increased on wounding, but their transcripts were not wound inducible. The data suggest new roles for jasmonate in controlling the levels of calcium-regulated pumps and transporters, proteins involved in targeted proteolysis, a putative bacterial virulence factor target, a light-dependent catalyst, and a key redox-controlled enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Extending the latter observation we found that wounding increased the proportion of oxidized glutathione in leaves, but only in plants able to synthesize JA. The oxidizing conditions generated through JA signaling near wounds help to define the cellular environment in which proteome remodelling occurs...|$|R
40|$|Drying {{tea tree}} leaf on the stem {{increased}} the oil content from 5. 8 % to 7. 4 % yield v/dw. This increase {{is not a}} result of changing moisture content but appears {{to be due to}} an active form of postharvest oil uptake or production. The value to oil producers of drying and storing leaf prior to distillation is a more efficient distillation system. At present, distillation occurs {{as close as possible to}} foliage harvest with the aim of reducing any chance of oil volatilization. These results show that the need for immediate distillation of cut foliage is unnecessary, as the delay would actually improve the yield rather than reduce it. For the industry these results could change the accepted methods of production. To date each producer had to have their own distillation plant as a way of avoiding distillation delays and the need for carting wet leaf material. Since drying leaves on the stems of the tree increases the oil yield and since the removal of leaves from the stem is easily accomplished when the leaves are dried, producers need only have storage and <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> facilities. This would enable pure leaf to be transferred cheaply to a central distillery when a sufficient load is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Light-dependent {{inactivation}} of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC) in pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves {{was further}} characterized, and this phenomenon {{was extended to}} several monocot and dicot species. The light-dependent inactivation of mtPDC in vivo was rapidly reversed in the dark, even after prolonged illumination. The mtPDC can be efficiently cycled through the inactivated-reactivated status by rapid light-dark cycling. Light-dependent inactivation of mtPDC was shown to be suppressed by inhibitors of photorespiratory carbon metabolism, including 2 -pyridylhydroxymethane sulfonate, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, and aminoacetonitrile, and by an inhibitor of photosynthesis, 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea. Glycine fed to pea <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> in the dark yielded partially inactivated leaf mtPDC, and this inactivation was blocked by inhibitors of glycine oxidation. It is concluded that the photorespiratory glycine to serine conversion that occurs in C 3 leaf mitochondria can provide the NADH to drive oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of mtPDC. Glycine oxidation also produces ammonium ion, which {{has been shown to}} enhance the inactivation of mtPDC in vitro by stimulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation (inactivation) of the mtPDC. Thus, light-dependent, photorespiration-stimulated inactivation of the mtPDC can regulate carbon entry into the Krebs cycle during C 3 photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the rice genotypes for {{oxidative}} stress tolerance. Induction of oxidative stress, by in vivo treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in rice genotypes to study the osmolyte accumulation pattern and antioxidant capacity was investigated. <b>Leaf</b> <b>strips</b> of uniform size from rice genotypes FL 478, IR 29,Co 43 and FR 13 A were subjected to various concentrations of H 2 O 2 (0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 mM). All the four rice genotypes exhibited varied responses to proline accumulation. FL 478 and Co 43 exhibited an increase in the accumulation of proline contents initially with low concentrations of H 2 O 2, and thereafter showed a sharp decline in proline contents with higher concentrations. Degradation of protein contents in rice leaves was observed in all the varieties and the protein contents decreased with increase in concentration of hydrogen peroxide treatment. A gradual increase in the activities of catalase and peroxidase were recorded under H 2 O 2 treatments. Significant upregulation of antioxidant enzyme systems and slow degradation of protein contents in the tolerant genotypes (FR 13 A and FL 478) play important roles in stress protection...|$|R
