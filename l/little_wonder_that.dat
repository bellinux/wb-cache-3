25|$|It is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> many desperate Devonians tried {{their luck}} abroad, with the sailing ship Elizabeth, Isabella and Margaret taking emigrants from Torquay Harbour to America and Canada. Those {{they left behind}} faced a bleak future of low pay in {{insecure}} employment with few rights. The basic diet of working-class families in those days consisted mainly of bread and whatever else could be had, usually cheese and a few vegetables, so when the staple food supply was scarce or too expensive to buy then just surviving was made even harder.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{the many}} signs and symptoms, the {{generally}} delayed diagnosis, {{and the possibility}} of residual complaints after treatment, it is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves' disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental problems. In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction. Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written off sick and 5% even had to take early retirement. In the same study, 34% of 400 questioned physicians reported treating patients with fully impaired earning capacity.|$|E

"On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rivers worked {{among the}} Todas {{for less than}} six months during 1901-02, {{communicating}} with his Toda informants only through interpreters and lodged in an Ootacamund hotel. Yet he assembled a stunning collection of data on the ritual and social lives of the Toda people. Almost all who have subsequently studied the Todas have been amazed at the richness and the accuracy of Rivers’s data. His book, [...] "The Todas", which came out in 1906, is still an outstanding contribution to Indian ethnography, “indispensable: still only to be supplemented rather than superseded”, as Murray Emeneau wrote in 1971. And it is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> so famous a champion of anthropological ﬁeldwork as Dr Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) declared Rivers to be his “patron saint of ﬁeld work”.|$|E

Pianists Clifford Curzon, Hans Richter-Haaser, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Julius Katchen each made fine records with Kertész, among which the Mozart concertos are particularly inspired. With his renditions of Kodály's big orchestral works, and given his precise yet passionate conducting style, Kertész was particularly well-suited to get the full orchestral swoop and swoon endemic to Psalmus Hungaricus and the Peacock Variations. The sonority Kertész managed to elicit from the LSO was expertly executed. <b>Little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Barry Tuckwell, the principal hornist of the LSO, spoke of the élan and enthusiasm Kertész could coax out of the orchestra, many of whose members Tuckwell regarded as [...] "old codgers not bloody likely to dance to any youngster's tune." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gambier {{was content}} with the blockading {{role played by the}} {{offshore}} squadron. Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey, who had commanded [...] "Fighting Temeraire" [...] at the Battle of Trafalgar, believed they had missed an opportunity to inflict further damage upon the French fleet. He told Gambier [...] "I never saw a man so unfit for the command of a fleet as Your Lordship." [...] Cochrane threatened to use his parliamentary vote against Gambier in retaliation for not committing the fleet to action. Gambier called for a court martial to examine his conduct. The court martial, on 26 July 1809 on Gladiator in Portsmouth, exonerated Gambier. Consequently, neither Harvey nor Cochrane were appointed by the Admiralty to command {{for the remainder of the}} war. The episode had political and personal overtones. Gambier was connected by family and politics to the Tory prime minister William Pitt. In Parliament, Cochrane represented the riding of Westminster, which tended to vote Radical. In the aftermath of Basque Roads, Cochrane and Gambier quarreled and Gambier resentfully excluded Cochrane from the battle dispatches. There is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Cochrane took the unusual move of standing in opposition to parliament's pro forma vote of thanks to Gambier.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions varied on {{what made}} the public {{thoroughly}} invested in the trial. Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and [...] "unremarkable" [...] family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch.

Psychologist Karyl McBride discussed how some mothers stray away from [...] "the saintly archetype" [...] expected of mothers. [...] "We want so badly to hang onto the belief system that mothers don't harm children," [...] she stated. [...] "It's fascinating that the defense in the Anthony case found a way to blame the father. While we don't know what is true and maybe never will, it is worth {{taking a look at the}} narcissistic family when maternal narcissism rules the roost. Casey Anthony is a beautiful white woman and the fact that the case includes such things as sex, lies, and videotapes makes it irresistible." ...|$|E

Damien McFerran praised Terry's design, saying that he is [...] "emanating so much coolness it’s <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> SNK otaku can always be seen wearing his trademark red cap". Dale Nardozzi from Reviews Teambox also praised Terry's distinct appearance. He further commented that his clothes {{is one of the most}} common cosplays at every convention with video game importance. Andrew Sztein from GamingExcellence commented that Terry was one of his favourite characters from the series. He mentioned that he liked his design because as [...] "he should be working at Petro Canada part time" [...] and added that his mispronunciation of English quotes are quite funny. IGN reviewer Ryan Clements also found preference over Terry from all the other characters in the Fatal Fury series, commenting he liked how the character played in each game. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer praised each part of Terry's appearance that makes him look cool. He also commented that Terry is one of the most popular characters from Fatal Fury although he is [...] "rather bland". UGO.com listed Terry's baseball cap thirteenth on their list of [...] "The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games", calling it [...] "completely badass" [...] despite its reading of [...] "Fatal Fury."
