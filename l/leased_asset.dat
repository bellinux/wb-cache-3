50|$|Most lessor {{accounting}} is not substantially changed between ASC 840 and ASC 842. The {{change from}} executory costs to nonlease components, discussed above, applies equally to lessors.

50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessor credits owned assets and debits a lease {{receivable}} {{account for the}} present value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or carrying amount of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called direct financing leases. A third type of lessor capital lease, called a leveraged lease, is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> is substantially financed by debt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how asset risk (i. e. the risk that the value of the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> loses unexpectedly most of its value at the end of the contract) is measured and hedged. Design/methodology/approach – The evaluation of the lease contract is achieved by applying the theory of option pricing as the lessor is the writer of a call option on the <b>leased</b> <b>asset.</b> A sensitivity analysis on some parameters is performed. Findings – The paper disentangles the components of the profit of a lease contract and allows to choose the optimal final purchase price. This lets the lessor hedge against asset risk. Research limitations/implications – The paper’s result can be extended by considering more complex options (such as American or exotic ones) into the lease contract. Practical implications – Results in the paper allow for a more flexible and efficient management of lease contracts where both parties benefit under an economic and a financial point of view. Originality/value – This is believed to be the first paper that applies derivative evaluation to the analysis of lease contracts. Keywords Assets management, Leasing, Pricing, Profit, Hedgin...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{financing}} role of leasing and secured lending. We {{argue that the}} benefit of leasing is that repossession of a <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending. However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our theory {{is consistent with the}} explanation of leasing by practitioners, namel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{develop a}} model of dynamic {{interactions}} between price variations in leasing and selling markets for automobiles. Our framework assumes a differential game between multiple Bertrand-type competing firms which offer differentiated products to forward-looking agents. Empirical analysis of our model using monthly US data from 2002 to 2011 shows that variations in selling (cash) market prices lead rapidly dissipating changes of leasing market prices in the opposite direction. We discuss the practical implications of these results by augmenting a standard leasing valuation formula. The additional terms represent the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> value changes that can be expected {{on the basis of}} past variations in automobile selling market prices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of leasing of {{productive}} assets. When capital is leased (or rented), it is more easily repossessed and hence leasing has higher debt capacity and relaxes financing constraints. However, leasing gives rise to an agency problem {{with regard to the}} care with which the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> is used or maintained. We show that this implies that more credit constrained firms lease capital, while less credit constrained firms buy capital. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing provided by leasing firms, namely that leasing “preserves capital, ” which is generally considered a fallacy in the academic literature. We provide empirical evidence that small and credit constrained firms lease a considerably larger fraction of their capital than larger and less constrained firms...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{business}} globalisation trend drives organisations to spread their busi-ness worldwide, {{which in turn}} generates vast asset demands. In this context, broader asset channels and higher financial capacities are required to boost the <b>asset</b> <b>lease</b> sector to meet the increasing asset demands [1, 2]. In this background, with the reli-able financial sources and extensive information channels, financiers are expected to take the pivot role in integrating world-wide asset information {{with the help of}} ad-vanced cooperative information systems [3, 4]. As reported by Leasing World [5], the mass market possesses vast <b>asset</b> <b>lease</b> demands that are unexplored by current lease industry.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{closed form}} solutions to price secured bank loans and financial leases subject to default risk. Secured debt fair credit spreads always {{increase in the}} debtor's default probability, whereas financial leasing fair credit spreads may well decrease in the lessee's default probability and even be negative. The {{reason is that the}} lessor, unlike the secured lender, can gain from the lessee's default, especially when the leasing contract envisages initial prepayments or the lessee's terminal options to either purchase the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> or to extend the lease maturity. This result, which critically depends on contractual and bankruptcy code provisions, can explain some of the empirical evidence and the use of financial leases as an alternative to secured bank lending to finance small, risky and relatively opaque firms. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{issue of}} leases {{includes}} the controversial {{areas in the}} IFRS and US GAAP convergence efforts. Especially the current principles applied to the recording and reporting of operating lease with a relatively longer period of lease are a subject of criticism. The development of methodological approaches for lease reporting especially {{on the side of}} lessee that would eliminate the main weaknesses of the current system of reporting based on the classification of lease contracts in connection with the lease term and the transfer of risks and benefits associated with the lease to the lessee should be the result of the convergence activities in this area. The evaluation {{of the impact of the}} newly proposed methodological approaches to lease reporting in the field of operating leases into the financial statements of lessee that will be affected by this change of methodology. Methodology/methods: The standard scientific methods were used to fulfill the defined aim. Analysis, synthesis and comparison were used in the theoretical part of the research. There was used a sample of lease contracts with various parameters (lease term in connection to useful life of <b>leased</b> <b>asset,</b> interest rate, options to extend the contract.). Based on the above mentioned sample, the impact into financial statements and selected indicators of financial analysis with a focus on indicators, in whose construction are used items of statements that are significantly affected by the change of the methodological approach is evaluated as well. Findings: Application of new methodologies leads to changes in values of selected items of financial statements (financial position statement and profit and loss statement). The paper focuses on the lease contracts, which, according to the existing methodology, are mostly classified as operating lease and according to the proposed methodology would be recognized as a lease type A or B. Conclusions: The proposed standard helps to a more faithful representation of <b>leased</b> <b>asset.</b> Classification of leases of the type A and B allows to take into account the differing nature of lease contracts. Classification of lease as type B can cause overvaluation of total assets arising from the lease contract. Other possible asymmetry cannot be excluded, for example such cases, when the lessor classifies lease as type B and lessee as type A...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} review {{of both the}} Basel Capital Adequacy Accord and the EU New Capital Adequacy Framework is now {{entering}} its final phase. Although leasing falls {{within the scope of}} the Basel Committee’s proposals for measuring appropriate capital requirements, little is known empirically about the credit risk associated with leasing. Many studies have recently been conducted in order to measure credit risk and assess the implications of the Basel Committee’s proposals, but none has considered certain distinctive characteristics of the leasing segment, such as physical collaterals. In this context, the present paper examines the credit risk associated with the lease portfolios of a major European financial institution. Furthermore, it analyses whether or not a capital allocation gain derived from a corporate/retail distinction (applied to the exposures of the portfolios) might exist. All the research has been conducted on the basis of data directly provided by the financial institution on a set of 40, 721 individual leases concerning two different kinds of <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> (automotive and equipment). The study first estimates and analyses credit risk and its components (probability of default...|$|E
40|$|A {{part of the}} {{literature}} (for example Bester 1987) points out that collaterals and guarantees could be a device available to debtors for signalling the ex-ante quality of investment projects. Therefore, if credit were properly contracted, borrowers with higher credit quality would subscribe contracts with higher collateralisation levels. The above argument, nevertheless, neglects an important fact of real world credit markets. If financial intermediaries have the capability of properly assessing risk components, they can try to control overall risk by managing LGD: an increase in PD may be offset by a commensurate decrease in LGD through higher collateralisation and/or more protective contractual structures. The argument should be true especially for the leasing market, in consideration {{of the nature of}} the specific credit contract where the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> is a sort of “internal collateral”. At this regard we can offer empirical evidence, based on two portfolios of leasing contracts, which indicate: a) the good ex-ante risk managing capability of intermediaries that are able to balance the probability of default and the loss given default case by case, using the proper contracts structures and choosing the necessary collateralisation level, b) their careful management of recovery procedures strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background. The term “public-private {{partnership}} ” (“partnership”) encompasses {{many different}} types of projects. Governments and government finance officers need to understand the different risks and rewards associated with various public-private partnership endeavors. Traditionally, the term “public-private partnership” has referred to private or public-private projects that involve the use of public resources or financing capabilities to promote local economic development. In those arrangements, the public entity is typically asked to provide some combination of tax incentives, public land or other assets, infrastructure investments or financing methods. In consideration of those public contributions, the private entity is asked to make capital investments, commit to provide jobs, contribute development expertise and assume financial risk. These “partnerships ” (which typically are not partnerships legally) can have short life spans covering only the construction period for the project, or longer life spans covering debt repayment or long-term operating agreements. The public-private partnership term has also been used to refer to transactions that are essentially privatization efforts, in which a state or local government enters into a long-term lease of a major asset (e. g., toll road, parking garage, airport, etc.) to a private-sector company and transfers the rights and responsibilities for the <b>leased</b> <b>asset</b> to the private company, or to transactions aimed at privatizing or outsourcing the provision of services that a governmental body had been providing directly.
