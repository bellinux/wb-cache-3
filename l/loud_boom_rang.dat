Perhaps as many as 20,000 Japanese military personnel were killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "A deep {{resonant}} {{sound is}} heard overhead; a second pull {{is followed by}} a second report, that rings as with shrill accompaniment down the very sides of the balloon. It is the working of the valve, which causes a <b>loud</b> <b>booming</b> noise, as from a sounding-board, as the springs force the shutters back.|$|R

50|$|Tunnel boom {{refers to}} a <b>loud</b> <b>boom</b> {{sometimes}} generated by high-speed trains when they exit tunnels. These shock waves can disturb nearby residents and damage trains and tunnel structures. The perception of this sound by humans {{is similar to that}} of a sonic boom from supersonic aircraft, but unlike a sonic boom, tunnel boom is not caused by trains exceeding the speed of sound. Instead, tunnel boom results from the fact that the structure of the tunnel prevents the air around the train from escaping in all directions. As a train passes through a tunnel, it generates compression waves in front of it. These waves coalesce into a shock wave that generates a <b>loud</b> <b>boom</b> when it reaches the tunnel exit. The strength of this wave is proportional to the cube of the train's speed so the effect is much more pronounced in faster trains.|$|R

5000|$|... "Electric Chair" [...] was {{recorded}} {{well before the}} album concept had begun, being cut in June 1988. Despite this, it fits well into {{the theme of the}} film and evokes the Joker's madness. The track blends hard rock and funk with a <b>loud,</b> <b>booming</b> drum machine pattern, and aggressive bass and lead guitar wailing throughout. The bridge combines a funky, percussive bass line with a meshed guitar synth phrase.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've {{gone before}} you, or they'll soon follow," [...] said a savage fiercely, as he raised {{her in his}} {{powerful}} arms, and hurled her overboard. A loud shriek {{was followed by a}} heavy plunge. At the same moment two of the men raised the captain, intending to throw him overboard also, when a <b>loud</b> <b>boom</b> arrested their attention, and a cannon-shot ploughed up the sea close in front of their bows.|$|R
50|$|Several {{offers to}} go abroad {{appeared}} and the player chose {{to move to}} Switzerland, signing a contract with FC Winterthur. Scoring 8 goals in 10 matches that season, he moved to Germany in 1996, signing for 1. FC Nuremberg. Despite the <b>loud</b> <b>boom</b> in Switzerland, Rimkus couldn't prove himself in Nurnberg, so he was given away to another German club - FC Erzgebirge Aue. 10 matches with no goals made him return to Latvia then.|$|R
5000|$|Garza's <b>loud,</b> <b>booming</b> {{drumming}} {{style has}} been often {{compared to that}} of John Bonham though in a 2009 interview he explained his sound is still his own. “Of course, my drumming doesn’t sound exactly like Bonham—it sounds like Josh Garza—but it’s from that same school. One of my secret weapons is to dig deep, find the cannon sound, turn it up, and not be scared. I think that’s paid off for me.” ...|$|R

[...] Immediately following this announcement, the drum line's bass drum players all play a single count, creating a <b>loud</b> <b>boom</b> that echoes inside the stadium. The Boom signals the beginning of the pregame routine.|$|R
50|$|It is a well-camouflaged, solitary brown {{bird that}} unobtrusively inhabits marshes and the coarse {{vegetation}} {{at the edge}} of lakes and ponds. In the breeding season it is chiefly noticeable by the <b>loud,</b> <b>booming</b> call of the male. The nest is built just above the water, usually among bulrushes and cattails, where the female incubates the clutch of olive-buff eggs for about four weeks. The young leave the nest after two weeks and are fully fledged at six or seven weeks.|$|R
50|$|The cross' demise {{was well}} known and publicized. On February 25, 1992, at 10 pm, local {{residents}} heard a <b>loud</b> <b>boom.</b> This boom was the explosion of Kay's Cross, which had been packed with explosives and blown into several large pieces. The police have never made an arrest {{in connection with this}} case. Some people still believe that the explosion was not man made, others believe the police did it themselves because they were tired of responding to calls to the remote location.|$|R
50|$|She {{was one of}} {{fourteen}} defense witnesses in the court proceeding in which Krauss was found guilty. Two of her fellow dancers, Muriel Lord and Jewel Southern, gave testimony which attested that each was properly clothed while performing. Sand chased a newspaper photographer up three flights of stairs at the New York City courthouse {{at the conclusion of}} the trial, because he had taken her photo. She stopped her pursuit only after someone hurled a used flashbulb at her feet, which exploded with a <b>loud</b> <b>boom.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{are almost}} entirely black, {{and have a}} {{conspicuous}} crest {{on the top of}} their head, vaguely resembling an umbrella (hence their common name). All have an inflatable wattle on the neck, which serves to amplify their <b>loud,</b> <b>booming</b> calls. This wattle may reach a length of 35 cm in the long-wattled umbrellabird, but it is smaller in the two remaining species, and covered in bare, bright red skin in the bare-necked umbrellabird. Females resemble males, but are noticeably smaller and have a reduced crest and wattle.|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{describes}} Li Jun {{as a man}} eight chi tall, {{with thick}} eyebrows, large eyes, a reddish face, wire-like whiskers and a <b>loud</b> <b>booming</b> voice. He is from Luzhou (蘆州; present-day Hefei, Anhui), but lives in Jieyang Ridge (揭陽嶺; {{believed to be in}} present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), near the Xunyang River, with his younger brother, Li Li. He is not only well versed in martial arts, but is also a powerful swimmer capable of performing many feats in the water. He is thus nicknamed [...] "River Dragon".|$|R
50|$|Armament {{consisted}} of four (but up to eight) Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns in front ring mounts and two <b>boom</b> <b>ring</b> mounts. Bombs were suspended in a bomb bay, {{which was a}} long and narrow container fixed to a lower wing. Photographs show at least four different arrangements {{with regard to the}} bombing nacelle.|$|R
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 12:08p.m., 32 {{minutes after}} they left the library, Dylan and Eric died next to each other. Both had committed suicide: Harris by firing his shotgun through {{the roof of his}} mouth; Klebold by shooting himself in the left temple with his TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun. It is widely believed that Patti Nielson overheard Harris and Klebold suddenly shout [...] "One! Two! Three!" [...] in unison, just before a <b>loud</b> <b>boom,</b> due to an article by The Rocky Mountain News. However, Patti Nielson has stated that she at no time has ever spoken with either of the writers of the article.|$|R
50|$|Originating {{from the}} {{province}} of Cavite, the device is made from a length of pipe of substantial diameter mated to a toy gun. Denatured alcohol (sometimes paint thinner or acetone) is squirted or sprayed into the pipe's breech end and ignited by the toy gun's trigger mechanism which is connected to a piezo igniter or by putting small fire. The combination of air and flammable fuel in the pipe's enclosed space when ignited by a spark from the trigger mechanism or by small fire causes the fuel-air mixture to combust, resulting in a <b>loud,</b> <b>booming</b> sound.|$|R
50|$|Riders {{start by}} {{turning into a}} dark tunnel with a siren and a <b>loud</b> <b>boom,</b> before {{shooting}} straight up the 110 ft vertical launch hill at 40 MPH, cresting, and then descending vertically {{down the other side}} of the tower at speeds reaching 55 MPH. Riders then go up and over a small airtime hill with a trim brake, before going up and quickly flipping around an Immelmann turn. The track levels out before sending riders up into a heartline roll. They then descend and then quickly pass around a small, shallow turn into the trim/safety brake.|$|R
50|$|The playfield {{displays}} {{your ship}} {{moving across the}} surface (displayed as a wavy line) and submarines moving across the screen. The target depth is set using a dial control (displayed as a dashed line). Depth charges are dropped by pushing the dial control. The speed of your ship is controlled using a speed lever control. Charges that miss make a low boom. Charges that hit make a <b>louder</b> <b>boom</b> and trigger an explosion sequence. Points are awarded for successful hits. The game is timed, so {{the goal is to}} sink or destroy as many submarines as possible before the time expires.|$|R
5000|$|Cheerleading {{is one of}} the few {{fields that}} still uses {{acoustic}} megaphones. Cheerleaders at the University of Minnesota are credited with first using acoustic megaphones in routines in 1898. Since then, cheerleaders have relied heavily on acoustic megaphones during performances at sporting events. Generally, female cheerleaders would use pom pons while male cheerleaders, with <b>loud</b> <b>booming</b> voices, would project cheers through megaphones. [...] Vocal projection is an important aspect for cheerleading, so experts recommend the use of acoustic megaphones not only to increase the volume of sound, but also to protect performers’ voices in the process.|$|R
