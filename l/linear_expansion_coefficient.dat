25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E

It is {{showed that the}} densities of the HfB 2 -HfC-SiC reach 98. 5 % of the theory density. The room temperature compressive properties of the HfB 2 -HfC-SiC are good, while those at high temperature decrease rapidly.

A significant cause of such errors is the shift in scale due to thermal expansion of the leveling rod. However, in our survey, we used spear invar rods to minimize thermal expansion. In addition, we made a correction for thermal expansion using the <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> of spear invar. We also took temperature measurements {{at the time of the}} leveling surveys in order to estimate the correction value. We additionally checked the influence using a case where the <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> had an uncertainty of 5.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 7 /°C, where the temperature difference was 10  °C and where the maximum relative height from benchmark BM 34 was approximately 350  m. A scale error of only 1.75  mm was estimated, and this value was considered sufficiently small as to not significantly affect the results. Therefore, we concluded that the results were accurate enough to detect a deformation of greater than a few millimeters.|$|E

40|$|Tensile and shear {{testing of}} large fiber-reinforced polymer {{composite}} (FRPC) specimens with circular cross-section to final failure {{has always been}} challenging. A major difficulty is that the local stress triaxiality near the gripping ends usually leads to premature failure at these locations, instead of the desired test gauge sections. Recently an alternative method using expansive grout materials has been proposed, {{but there have been}} no well-established design guidelines due to lack of understanding of the gripping pressure developed by the expansive grout material. In this study, an analytical solution has been derived to correlate the hoop strain on the outer surface of the confining pipe (caused by grout expansion in the pipe) to the grout elastic modulus and <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> By measuring the exterior surface hoop strains of two different steel pipes, the elastic modulus and <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> have been determined to be 4. 52 ± 0. 07 msi and 0. 158 ± 0. 008 % respectivly.
