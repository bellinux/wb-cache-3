25|$|Prior to the ban, some commentators, health {{professionals}} {{and community members}} expressed concerns about {{the long-term effects of}} the use of khat by Somalis in the UK, suggesting that excessive use has a negative social and health impact on the community. One review of studies of the effects of khat use by Somalis and other immigrants on their mental health suggested that there was a need for better research on khat-chewing and its possible link with psychiatric disorders; it also suggested that public discourse on the issue displayed elements of a moral panic. Some Somali community organisations also campaigned for khat to be banned. As a result of these concerns, the Home Office commissioned successive research studies to look into the matter, and in 2005, presented the question of khat's legal status before the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. After a careful review of the evidence, the expert committee recommended in January 2006 that the status of khat as a <b>legal</b> <b>substance</b> should remain for the time being.|$|E
500|$|The {{right of}} the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, {{independent}} of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at {{the outbreak of the}} Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from the Irish Free State and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration of 1926, declaring the Dominions to be [...] "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another" [...] within a [...] "British Commonwealth of Nations". This declaration was given <b>legal</b> <b>substance</b> under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. The Irish Free State distanced itself further from the British state with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{review of}} {{research}} on serial murder revealed that the 10 definitions frequently cited failed to adequately represent the totality of serial murder. This article reviews the evolution of these definitions in the professional literature. A more complete definition is proposed that encompasses all types of serial murder, not only those committed by roaming males who act out of lust. By being more inclusive, this definition is broad enough to include acts of multiple destructiveness committed {{by men and women}} for both instrumental and expressive purposes. *Dorothea Puentes, 59, was charged in 1989 with the murders of nine of her tenants in a Sacramento, California boarding house. The murders occurred over a four-year period and were alleged to have been overdose poisonings of <b>legal</b> <b>substances.</b> *Brian Rosenfeld was charged in 1992 with the murders of three, nursing home patients in St. Petersburg, Florida.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems {{from the use of}} <b>legal</b> <b>substances,</b> particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems).|$|R
25|$|In response, many {{communities}} began passing ordinances that either restricted or prohibited their sale outright. The head shops and other sellers of paraphernalia challenged them in court.
