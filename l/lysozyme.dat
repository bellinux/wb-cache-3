5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for <b>lysozyme,</b> an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965.

Enzymes such as <b>lysozyme</b> and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E

In the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.|$|E
40|$|Larvae of Lucilia sericata {{are used}} for maggot debri-dement therapy (MDT) because {{of their ability to}} remove {{necrotic}} tissue and eradicate bacterial patho-gens of infected wounds. So far, very few antibacterial factors have been fully characterized (eg lucifensin). Using a molecular approach, some other putative antimicrobial compounds, including three novel <b>lysozymes,</b> have been previously identified and pre-dicted to be involved in MDT. Nevertheless, data on <b>lysozymes</b> tissue origin and their functions have never been elucidated. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the expression of three <b>lysozymes</b> in L. sericata and confirm their antibacte-rial effects within MDT. Moreover, we characterized the eradication process of bacteria within the diges-tive system of maggots and determined the role of <b>lysozymes</b> in this process. We found that three <b>lysozymes</b> are expressed in specific sections of the L. sericata midgut. Recombinant <b>lysozymes</b> displayed comparable antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus. Furthermore, the majority of Gram-positive bacteria were destroyed in vivo within the particular section of the L. sericata midgut where <b>lysozymes</b> are produced. Larval ingestion and subsequent eradica-tion of wound pathogens during their passage through the intestine of maggots are due to, at least in part, antibacterial action of three midgut <b>lysozymes...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe mutant hen {{egg white}} <b>lysozymes</b> Ile 55 Thr and Asp 66 His, {{corresponding}} to human amyloidogenic mutant <b>lysozymes</b> Ile 56 Thr and Asp 67 His, respectively, were secreted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The amyloidogenic mutants (I 55 T and D 66 H) of hen egg white <b>lysozymes</b> were remarkably less soluble {{than that of}} the wild-type protein. To enhance the secretion of these mutants, we constructed the glycosylated amyloidogenic <b>lysozymes</b> (I 55 T/G 49 N and D 66 H/G 49 N) having the N-glycosylation signal sequence (Asn-X-Ser) by the substitution of glycine with asparagine at position 49. The secretion of these glycosylated mutant proteins is greatly increased in S. cerevisiae, compared with that of non-glycosylated type. Both the glycosylated mutants retained about 40 % enzymatic activity when incubated at pH 7. 4 for 1 h at the physiological temperature of 37 °C whereas the non-glycosylated proteins eventually lost all activity under these conditions. These results suggest that the glycosylated chains could mask the β-strand of amyloidogenic <b>lysozymes</b> from the intermolecular cross-β-sheet association, thus improving the solubility of amyloidogenic <b>lysozymes...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Lysozymes,</b> lymphocyte-derived mucous bacteriolytic enzymes with antibiotic-like characteristics, {{are widely}} {{distributed}} {{in nature and}} {{have been found in}} secretions such as mucous, saliva, and blood. <b>Lysozymes</b> dissolve acetyl-monopolysaccharides in the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria and show direct bacteriolytic action in gram-negative bacteria. In accordance with the complement and antibody supports, the bacteriolytic actions are also improved, which are complement-dependent. Therefore, <b>lysozymes</b> are closely related to the complement and {{become a part of the}} intrinsic defense mechanism against parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections in a number of animals (Ingram 1980; Lim et al. 2009). In this study, <b>lysozymes</b> did not show significant differences among the FSM supplement groups and the control group. However, <b>lysozymes</b> tended to increase, so it is possible that they are affected by the FSM. Vitamin C increases resistance to diseases in fish (Verlhac and Gabauda 19941997). Therefore, synergetic effects with the FSM supplement are also expected in the presence of long-term feeding.|$|R
5|$|The {{choice of}} poly(A) site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on {{the expression of the}} proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like <b>lysozyme</b> and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal.|$|E

The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to <b>lysozyme,</b> {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents of the outer shell are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme <b>lysozyme,</b> found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
40|$|Disruption of the calnexin gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae did {{not lead}} to gross effects on the levels of cell growth and {{secretion}} of wild-type hen egg white <b>lysozymes</b> (HEWL). To investigate the function of calnexin in relation to the secretion of glycoproteins, we expressed both stable and unstable mutant glycosylated <b>lysozymes</b> in calnexin-dis-rupted S. cerevisiae. The secreted amounts of stable mutant glycosylated <b>lysozymes</b> (G 49 N and S 91 T/G 49 N) were almost the same in both wild-type and calnexin-disrupted S. cerevisiae. In contrast, the secretion of unstable mutant glycosylated <b>lysozymes</b> (K 13 D/G 49 N, C 76 A/G 49 N, and D 66 H/G 49 N) greatly increased in calnexin-disrupted S. cerevisiae, although their secretion was very low in the wild-type strain. This indicates that calnexin may act in the quality control of glycoproteins. We further investigated the expression level of the mRNA of the molecular chaperones BiP and PDI, which {{play a major role in}} the protein folding process in the ER, when glycosylated <b>lysozymes</b> were expressed in wild-type and calnexin-disrupted S. cerevisiae.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) and <b>lysozymes</b> are {{the main}} effectors of the insect immune system, and {{they are involved in}} both local and systemic responses. Among local responses, midgut immune reaction {{plays an important role in}} fighting pathogens that reach the insect body through the oral route, as do many microorganisms used in pest control. Under this point of view, understanding how insects defend themselves locally during the first phases of infections caused by food-borne pathogens is important to further improve microbial control strategies. In the present study, we analyzed the transcriptional response of AMPs and <b>lysozymes</b> in the midgut of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a polyphagous pest that is commonly controlled by products based on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or baculovirus. First, we comprehensively characterized the transcripts encoding AMPs and <b>lysozymes</b> expressed in S. exigua larval midgut, identifying 35 transcripts that represent the S. exigua arsenal against microbial infection. Secondly, we analyzed their expression in the midgut after ingestion of sub-lethal doses of two different pore-forming B. thuringiensis toxins, Cry 1 Ca and Vip 3 Aa, and the S. exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV). We observed that both Bt toxins triggered a similar, wide and in some cases high transcriptional activation of genes encoding AMPs and <b>lysozymes,</b> which was not reflected in the activation of the classical systemic immune-marker phenoloxidase in hemolymph. Baculovirus ingestion resulted in the opposed reaction: Almost all transcripts coding for AMPs and <b>lysozymes</b> were down-regulated or not induced 96 hours post infection.

25|$|The {{first line}} of defense against invading parasites in {{vertebrates}} is the physical barrier of the tough and often dry and waterproof skin, as in reptiles, birds and mammals. Most microorganisms need a moist environment to survive. By keeping the skin dry, it prevents invading organisms from colonizing. Human skin also secretes sebum, which is toxic to most microorganisms. On the other hand, larger parasites such as trematodes detect chemicals produced by the skin to locate their hosts when they enter the water. Saliva in the vertebrate mouth prevents foreign organisms from getting into the body orally. The mouth also contains <b>lysozyme,</b> an enzyme found in tears and the saliva. This enzyme breaks down cell walls of invading microorganisms. Should the organism pass the mouth, the stomach with its hydrochloric acid, toxic to most microorganisms, is the next line of defense. Some intestinal parasites have a thick, tough outer coating which is digested slowly or not at all, allowing the parasite to pass through the stomach alive, at which point they enter the intestine and begin the next stage of their life. Parasites can also invade the body through the eyes. The lashes on the eyelids of mammals help to prevent microorganisms from entering the eye. Tears contain the enzyme <b>lysozyme,</b> which kills most invading microorganisms. Once inside the body, parasites must overcome the immune system's serum proteins and pattern recognition receptors, intracellular and cellular, that trigger the adaptive immune system's lymphocytes such as T cells and antibody-producing B cells. These have receptors that recognize parasites.|$|E
