5000|$|Chlorophane, also {{sometimes}} known as pyroemerald, cobra stone, and pyrosmaragd, {{is a rare}} variety of the mineral fluorite with the unusual combined properties of thermoluminescence, thermophosphoresence, triboluminescence, and fluorescence: it will emit light in the visible spectrum when exposed to ultraviolet light, when heated, and when rubbed; if heated, {{it will continue to}} emit light {{for a period of time}} after a heat source is withdrawn. The small amount of heat generated by being held in the hand has been reported as enough to induce <b>luminiscence,</b> though this may be the result of experimental error. [...] Although chemically very similar to fluorite, chlorophane has several impurities including magnesium, aluminum, manganese, and traces of iron and sodium (none of which occur in fluorite). [...] it was still not known which if any of these impurities imparts to chlorophane the luminescent properties that distinguish it from fluorite. [...] Some samples of chlorophane, particularly those exposed to high temperatures, will only <b>luminiscence</b> once or will do so with only weakened intensity over time. [...] A very bright luminescence can be achieved at between 200 C and 300 C, and mineralogists once believed that it would glow indefinitely at temperatures of just 30 C, meaning that when exposed on the ground in warmer climates, the mineral would glow year-round. This effect, which was reported many times without having been observed, was eventually attributed in part to a combination of both heat and light acting on the mineral.|$|E

40|$|Summary Components of the Par-complex, {{atypical}} PKC and Par 3, {{have been}} found to be downregulated upon activation of NF-κB in intestinal epithelial cells. To determine their possible role in pro-inflammatory responses we transduced Caco- 2 human colon carcinoma cells with constitutively active (ca) PKCι or anti-Par 3 shRNA-expressing lentiviral particles. Contrary to previous reports in other cell types, ca-PKCι did not activate, but rather decreased, baseline NF-κB activity in a <b>luminiscence</b> reporter assay. An identical observation applied to a PB 1 domain deletion PKCι, which fails to localize to the tight-junction. Conversely, as expected, the same ca-PKCι activated NF-κB in non-polarized HEK 293 cells. Likewise, knockdown of Par 3 increased NF-κB activity and, surprisingly, greatly enhanced its response to TNFα, as shown by transcription of IL- 8, GRO- 1, GRO- 2 and GRO- 3. We conclude that aPKC and Par 3 are inhibitors of the canonical NF-κB activation pathway, although perhaps acting through independent pathways, and may be involved in pro-inflammatory responses...|$|E
40|$|The cathodoluminescent {{behaviour}} of rudist {{shells and}} coral skeletal fragments from Ereño Urgonian limestones has been studied. Two different models of luminescence have been distinguished in rudist fragments. Whereas requieniid shells show luminescent patterns that moderately coincide with growth lines, the caprotinid ones exhibit more spread luminescent areas. The interprismatic lines control the lateral spreading out of luminescence. Since some caprotinid shells {{seem to have}} their interprismatic lines locally opened by tectonic deformation, luminescence progresses here more clearly. A complex cement stratigraphy has also been deduced, including vadose, meteoric and burial events. The cement sequence ranges from «dogtooth» non-luminescent calcite to yellow hair-line calcite to «blocky» calcite having a complex <b>luminiscence</b> pattern.

40|$|Winter {{dormancy}} is {{an adaptive}} mechanism that allows trees from temperate and cold regions {{to survive the}} harsh conditions of this season. This process is strongly influenced by daylength and temperature, which are signals that are integrated by the circadian clock. Low temperatures cause the disruption of the circadian clock in trees, which consists in a transcriptional activation followed by an arrhythmic expression. In this work we uncover winter-associated regulators of the circadian clock in poplar. We generated transgenic poplars that express a transcriptional fusion between the promoter of a circadian clock gene and the luciferase gene. Setting up a circadian <b>luminiscence</b> assay by which we register the luciferase activity from leaf discs with a luminometer, we have characterized the expression of this promoter under different photoperiods. Then, we carried out a Yeast One Hybrid (Y 1 H) screening with a library enriched in winter-associated factors using this promoter as bait.

40|$|The Quintanaloma Fm (Campanian-Maastrichtian) was {{deposited}} {{in a shallow}} marine environment and contains a lot of rudist shells (Hippuritidae and Radiolitidae), {{some of them in}} life position. From a diagenetic point of view, the Radiolitidae seem to be the more interesting, because their cellular microstructure («honeycomb») is-propitious for cement precipitation and mineral authigenesis. Taking into consideration that a pristine composition of the bivalve shells implies the lack of activators such as Mn++, the presence of luminescence in shells can be explained in terms of organic matter diagenetic alteration. Cathodoluminescence (CL) demonstrates that the more obscure and organic-rich a part of the shell, the more luminescent is. Luminescence in radiolitid shells is more evident just in the transition from {{the upper part of the}} walls to the base of the subsequent growth line. This could be explained as a result of a vital effect, when the organism needs to reinforce the epitelial mantle, or increase the secretion of extra-paleal liquids. The diagenetic alteration degree was not enough to homogenize the luminescence of the whole shell. From microscopic observations, diagenesis in radiolitid shells developes at two levels: 1) cement precipitation (intense-red dolomite rhombs; well-zoned A cements, some of them «dogtooth»-type; and blotchy/irregularly-zoned blocky calcite B cement); and 2) two phases of recrystallization, which sharply and indiscriminately eliminate the <b>luminiscence</b> of both shells and previous cement...|$|E
40|$|Methods were {{developed}} to study delayed light emission (<b>luminiscence)</b> and fluorescence changes in intact leaves of plants. Delayed light emission, detected from plants in darkness, was used to produce images of the plant leaves. The procedure was termed "phytoluminography". The use of the method is suggested for dia- nostic purposes at early stages of disturbances of the leaf tissues, not detectable with the naked eye. The delayed light emission {{is associated with the}} photochemistry of photosystem II and the light induced conversion and storage of energy in the thylakoid membrane system of chloroplasts. Fluorescence yield changes were induced by lowering temperature between 20 C and - 20 C. The temperature induced fluorescence changes in leaves parallel the temperature induced changes in isolated chloroplasts in reaction preparations mediating photosynthetic electron transport from endogenous water splitting to added NADP. At above freezing temperatures, lowering the temperature at a constant rate of 1 C per minute caused supressed electron transport and increased fluorescence yield which were linearely dependent on the temperature change in frost resistent plants. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles between 20 °C and - 20 °C induced variable fluorescence yield changes which were gradually depleated to F 0 or Fm when the electron transport was injuried on the oxidizing or on the reduzing side of photosystem II, respectively. The temperature induced fluorescence changes were used to characterize plants with different ability to withstand freezing temperatures. The method also discriminates between plants of different frost resistance, and the method was used in screening for frost tolerance. Diss.

40|$|Abstract. Greenstones {{were highly}} {{appreciated}} in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica. Most {{of the finest}} green artefacts were worked in jadeite and other minerals such as serpentine and nephrite. Jadeite {{is perhaps the most}} precious stone of the jade family in ancient Mesoamerica, and it was widely used and traded since the Preclassic Horizon (1500 B. C.). The main beds are located in the Maya region, in the Motagua area of Guatemala. In this work, three pieces of a necklace of greenstones from an offering discovered in an extensive excavation carried out in the palatial structure of Xalla, at Teotihuacan site, in the central highlands of Mexico, were studied using external beam PIXE. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the elemental composition of the greenstones and to establish the sourcing, trade and relationship between these regions. The offering corresponds to the early Miccaotli period (around 155 A. D.). The necklace is composed by eleven round pieces of green colors ranging from light to dark green. The analysis of three pieces was compared with several samples from Manzanal sources of Motagua. Green luminescence of high intensity was observed in the archaeological pieces but only in one case the luminescence was blue-violet. When comparing with the mineral samples of other green minerals, only the jadeite presented the green and violet luminescence. The corresponding spectra were obtained by proton induced luminescence in vacuum on the mineral samples. The comparison of the elemental composition of the archaeological items and the known mineral samples indicates that only one archaeological piece is related to the Manzanal source.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{a medical}} method {{combining}} the use of photodynamic active substance and light in presence of oxygen. It extends the treatment possibilities of tumor and non-tumor disorders. It complements surgical treatment, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. An increased accumulation of photosensitive substance in pathological focus is the base of PDT. Subsequent irradiation by light of suitable wavelenght evokes photodynamic reactions leading to formation of reactive oxygen species and to biological answer leading to tumor cells damage. The final effect depends on sensitizer type, its concentration in target tissue and on used source of radiation. Aim of the thesis is to prove photodynamic properties of newly developed photodynamic active substance phtalocyanin CIAIPcS 2 and possibilities of its usage to induce photodynamic phenomenon in melanom cells. Owing to absorption of light in sensitizer the formation of excited states happens, and then the excited form of sensitizer reacts directly with substrate. During this reaction free radicals of substrate form or transfer of energy from sentitizer to oxygen and formation of highly reactive singlet oxygen happen. Free radicals, especially radicals of lipid components of cell membranes, are the major cause of tumor destruction. Fruitfulness of PDT depends not only on type of sensitizer and level of oxygen in tumor cell but also on used light source. <b>Luminiscence</b> diodes (LEDs) were used {{as the source of}} light. Formation of ROS after PDT was detected with the help of fluorescent molecular probe CM-H 2 DCFDA on spectrofluorimeter Synergy HT and on fluorescent microscope Olympus IX 81 with image analysis. According to our results the production of ROS depends on concentration of sensitizer CIAIPcS 2 and the radiation dose. We proved that the sensitizer CIAIPcS 2 is suitable photodynamic active substance and evokes photodynamic phenomenon in tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{baculovirus}} {{expression system}} using the Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (AcNPV) has been extensively utilized for high-level expression of cloned foreign genes, driven by the strong viral promoters of polyhedrin (polh) and p 10 encoding genes. A parallel system using Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV) is much less exploited because the choice and variety of BmNPV-based transfer vectors are limited. Using a transient expression assay, we have demonstrated here that the heterologous promoters of the very late genes polh and p 10 from AcNPV function as efficiently in BmN cells as the BmNPV promoters. The location of the cloned foreign gene {{with respect to the}} promoter sequences was critical for achieving the highest levels of expression, following the order + 35 > + 1 > - 3 > - 8 nucleotides (nt) with respect to the polh or p 10 start codons.

Infection of BmN cell lines with recombinant BmNPV showed a temporal expression pattern, reaching very high levels in 60 - 72 h post infection. The recombinant BmNPV harboring the firefly luciferase-encoding gene under the control of AcNPV polh or p 10 promoters, on infection of the silkworm larvae led to the synthesis of large quantities of luciferase.

40|$|Background Winter {{dormancy}} is {{an adaptive}} mechanism that allows trees from temperate and cold regions {{to survive the}} harsh conditions of this season. Critical steps of this process are strongly influenced by environmental cues, mainly daylength and temperature. The mechanism that integrates these signals is the circadian clock. Despite {{the importance of the}} correct functioning of the clock for the healthy state of the plant [1], low temperatures cause the disruption of the circadian clock in trees, which consists in a transcriptional activation followed by an arrhythmic expression [2 - 5]. In this work we uncover winter-associated regulators of the circadian clock in poplar. Methods Firstly, we made a transcriptional fusion with the promoter of LHY 2, a circadian clock gene, and the luciferase gene. This construct was used to generate transgenic poplars (717 - 1 B 4, INRA clone). With these events we characterized the expression of this promoter under different conditions of photoperiod and temperature. To this aim we have set up a circadian <b>luminiscence</b> assay registering luciferase activity from leaf discs with a luminometer. Then we carried out a Yeast One Hybrid (Y 1 H) screening with a library enriched in winter-associated factors and using this promoter as bait. Candidate regulators are tested in vivo using Golden Braid technology [6] and transient assays in poplar, by which we overexpressed and silenced the candidate genes. Results and Conclusions Here we present the characterization of the Populus tremula x alba LHY 2 promoter under three different photoperiod conditions. Our results indicate the selected promoter region contains the circadian elements as well as the luciferase activity shows the expected expression under both long and short days. In the Y 1 H screening, we found several candidates that are classified either as transcription factors or chromatin remodelers.

We aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of the selective P 2 X 3 antagonist A- 317491 on visceral sensitivity under physiological conditions, during acute colitis and in the post-inflammatory phase of colitis. Trinitrobenzene sulphonic-acid colitis was monitored by colonoscopy: on day 3 to confirm the presence of colitis and then every 4 days, starting from day 10, to monitor convalescence and determine the exact timepoint of endoscopic healing in each rat. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by quantifying visceromotor responses to colorectal distension in controls, rats with acute colitis and post-colitis rats. A- 317491 was administered 30 min prior to visceral sensitivity testing. Expression of P 2 X 3 receptors (RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry) and the intracellular signalling molecules cdk 5, csk and CASK (RT-PCR) were quantified in colonic tissue and dorsal root ganglia. ATP release in response to colorectal distension was measured by <b>luminiscence.</b> Rats with acute TNBS-colitis displayed significant visceral hypersensitivity that was dose-dependently, but not fully, reversed by A- 317491. Hypersenstivity was accompanied by an increased colonic release of ATP. Post-colitis rats also displayed visceral hypersensitivity that was dose-dependently reduced and fully normalized by A- 317491 without increased release of ATP. A- 317491 did not modify visceral sensitivity in controls. P 2 X 3 mRNA and protein expression in the colon and dorsal root ganglia were similar in control, acute colitis and post-colitis groups, while colonic mRNA expression of cdk 5, csk and CASK was increased in the post-colitis group only. These findings indicate that P 2 X 3 receptors are not involved in sensory signaling under physiological conditions whereas they modulate visceral hypersensitivity during acute TNBS-colitis and even more so in the post-inflammatory phase, albeit via different mechanisms of sensitization, validating P 2 X 3 receptors as potential new targets in the treatment of abdominal pain syndromes...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was {{to detect}} (anti-) progestagenic {{activity}} in wastewater samples from the influent and effluent of six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in South Bohemia. Subsequently, {{the efficiency of the}} treatment process of this WWTPs was assessed from this point of view. The wastewater from WWTPs was transported to the laboratory and extracted oby solid phase extraction. The eluates were washed, evaporated and dissolved in DMSO. Detection of (anti-) progestagenic activity was performed by using the PR-CALUX in vitro bioassay. Transgenic cells were seeded on well plates and were exposed to ORG 2058, reference substance for progestagenic activity, or RU- 486, reference substance for antiprogestagenic activity, {{as well as a number}} of diluted wastewater extracts. After that, <b>luminiscence</b> of the cells was measured and it was was expressed in relative light units which were a measure of (anti-) progestagenic activity. (Anti-) progestagenic activity was reported in equivalent concentrations of the reference substance. Progestagenic activity in WWTPs influent ranged from below LOQ up to 1. 8 ng/l ORG 2058 eq. In effluent this activity ranged from below LOQ up to 0. 5 ng/l ORG 2058 eq. The elimination rate of progestagenic activity ranged from - 25 % to 100 %. Antiprogestagenic activity in WWTPs inffluent was below the LOQ up to 1 ng/l RU- 486 eq. In effluent this activity was below LOQ up to 9. 7 ng/l RU- 486 eq. The elimination rate of antiprogestagenic activity ranged from - 50 % to 100 %. (Anti-) progestagenic activity in waste water has been demonstrated by using the PR-CALUX in vitro bioassay. Negative removal efficiency of some WWTPs was also documented. This is probably caused by biotransformation of some substances which don´t have (anti-) progestagenic activity to substances which have this activity or it is caused by deconjugation of metabolits of compounds with (anti-) progestagenic activity. Antiprogestagenic activity may be more hazardous for organisms living in the aquatic environment than progestagenic activity because of concentrations in WWTPs effluent. However this activity should not be underestimated...|$|E
