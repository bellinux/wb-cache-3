The phonetic codes include：syllable code、 syllable time and syllable rhythm. There are the codes of the initial of syllable、the final of syllable、tone、phoneme with sensibility and sub-information of linguistics in syllable code. The user of the system can express the initial and find of a syllable、tone、feeding and other. Phonetic information by making a limbs movement towards input device. The designer of the system intends to let deaf-mutes input the Chinese phonetic code to phoneme-forming equipment to talk with others naturally, character input can be finished if the phonetic code input into world-processor.

40|$|One of the {{strategies}} of metacognitive introduced by the listening lecturers in listening comprehension III at STAIN Batusangkar is monitoring strategies. It is assumed that these strategies can help students solve their problem in listening comprehension in order to comprehend oral text correctly. The purposes of this research are to investigate what kind of students’ monitoring strategies are used and how they applied it in listening comprehension. The research method was descriptive qualitative. The participants of the research were English students who took listening comprehension III. 91 students were involved as the respondents to answer the questionnaire, and 12 students among them were selected to be interviewed using snowball sampling technique. The data of the research were collected by using questionnaire, interview, and observation. After analizing the data, {{it was found that}} most of students used monitoring strategies. These strategies include as: ask if it makes sense, selected attend, deduction, personalizing or contextualizing, taking note, using imagery, self talk, and cooperative strategy. They had applied these strategies in many ways but some of the them did not do it properly. Based on these findings, It can be concluded thatmonitoring strategies used by the students in listening comprehension need to enhance into the correct ways to get better comprehension in <b>listening.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Investigating, Metacognitive strategies, Monitoring strategies, Listening Comprehensio...|$|E

40|$|As we {{celebrate}} the 50 th {{anniversary of the}} publication of B. F. Skinner’s Verbal Behavior, it may be important to reconsider {{the role of the}} listener in the verbal episode. Although by Skinner’s own admission, Verbal Behavior was primarily about the behavior of the speaker, his definition of verbal behavior as ‘‘behavior reinforced through the mediation of other persons’’ (1957, p. 2) focused on the behavior of the listener. But because many of the behaviors of the listener are fundamentally no different than other discriminated operants, they may not appropriately be termed listening. Even Skinner noted that the behavior of the listener often goes beyond simply mediating consequences for the speaker’s behavior, implying that the listener engages in a repertoire of behaviors that is itself verbal. In the present article I suggest that listening involves subvocal verbal behavior. I then describe some of the forms and functions of the listener’s verbal behavior (including echoic and intraverbal behavior) and conclude that there may be no functional distinction between speaking and <b>listening.</b> <b>Key</b> words: listening, rule-governed behavior, speaking, subvocal behavior, Verbal Behavior, verbal behavior 2007 witnessed the 50 th anniversa-ry of the publication of Verbal Behavior by B.

Study of document becomes the technique of this research. This research also takes a qualitative method in analyzing data where the data is taken from book and the evaluators as a secondary data source to be analyzed in this research. There are some steps to analyze the data. The researcher is determining the instrument of evaluating of the course book, requesting the experts’ opinion about the result of analysis in evaluating the contents course book, then analyze the data, recalling them to the theories. The research has found some aspects for the sufficiency in teaching listening comprehension to EFL learners, the importance of diverging tasks in listening activities, guidance for designing learning objectives, and the importance of knowing the purposes of a listening task. Diverging tasks in listening activities is important in teaching listening. The purpose of the listening, together with the micro- and macroskills of listening comprehension help teachers to determine what tasks should be given to the students in listening classes.

40|$|Abstract Inclusive design aims at {{objects and}} environments that are accessible, useable and {{comfortable}} {{for all people}} throughout their entire lifespan.

So far, however, acoustics are rarely addressed in research on Inclusive Design.
