500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I {{was trying to help}} end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

[...] "Every one's been so kind--so very kind," [...] she said. Then she too went to bed.|$|E
5000|$|Sperber's roles grew {{larger in}} the wake of Back to the Future, and over the next decade she starred in the series Babes (a comedy about three zaftig women; her costar Susan Peretz also lost her fight with breast cancer a year earlier). In 1994, Sperber was cast in a major {{supporting}} part in the CBS-TV series Hearts Afire. By this time, she had lost a lot of weight. As far as acting roles were concerned, she preferred comedy. As she told TV Guide in 1990, [...] "I'm an actress who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> funny—everybody laughs and your job is done.” ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was asked}} to come again, to come often and {{take part in the}} counsels of all these people captivated by the sentimental {{enterprise}} of a declared love. On taking Miss Moorsom’s hand he looked up, would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but found himself voiceless, with his lips suddenly sealed. She returned the pressure of his fingers, and he left her with her eyes vaguely staring beyond him, an air of listening for an expected sound, and the faintest possible smile on her lips. A smile not for him, evidently, but the reflection of some deep and inscrutable thought.|$|R

I had a dream last night, and I dreamed that I saw my old father with a kind of night-shirt on him, something like these folks wear when they want to be in particular full-dress, and a bit of that feathery grass in his hand, which he may have gathered on the way, for I saw lots of it yesterday about three hundred yards from the mouth of this beastly cave.|$|E

[...] he asked, as if they had interrupted him; but he really wanted to gain time, so as to think up a story of some kind. The children were afraid to say anything, and the papa went on with freezing politeness: [...] "Because if you have, I might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> myself. This story is about a Prince and a Princess, but the thing of it is that they had names almost exactly alike. They were twins; the Prince was a boy and the Princess was a girl; that was a point that their fairy godmother carried against the wicked enchantress who tried to have it just the other way; but it made the wicked enchantress so mad that the fairy godmother had to give in to her a little, and let them be named almost exactly alike." ...|$|E

500|$|Ferreira {{was largely}} raised by her grandmother, {{who had been}} Michael Jackson's {{personal}} hairstylist for over 30 years. She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've never said anything [...] because I don't want it to define me, but I feel <b>like</b> it's appropriate <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> [...] People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|R

It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was <b>like,</b> I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> I need <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what I want <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and you guys have to help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{have told you}} more about this bygone age of ice. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you on the curious question--which is still an open one--whether there were not two ages of ice; whether the climate here did not, after perhaps {{thousands}} of years of Arctic cold, soften somewhat for a while--a few thousand years, perhaps--and then harden again into a second age of ice, somewhat less severe, probably, than the first. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have hinted at the probable causes of this change--indeed, of the age of ice altogether--whether it was caused by a change in the distribution of land and water, or by change in the height and size of these islands, which made them large enough, and high enough, to carry a sheet of eternal snow inland; or whether, finally, the age of ice was caused by an actual change in the position of the whole planet with regard to its orbit round the sun--shifting at once the poles and the tropics; a deep question that latter, on which astronomers, whose business it is, are still at work, and on which, ere young folk are old, they will have discovered, I expect, some startling facts. On that last question, I, being no astronomer, cannot speak. But I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have said somewhat on matters on which I have knowledge enough, at least, to teach you how much there is to be learnt. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> tell the student of sea-animals--how the ice-age helps to explain, and is again explained by, the remarkable discoveries which Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Wyville Thompson have just made, in the deep-sea dredgings in the North Atlantic. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> tell the botanist somewhat of the pro-glacial flora--the plants which lived here before the ice, and lasted, some of them at least, through all those ages of fearful cold, and linger still on the summits of Snowdon, and the highest peaks of Cumberland and Scotland. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have told the lovers of zoology about the animals which lived before the ice-- of the mammoth, or woolly elephant; the woolly rhinoceros, the cave lion and bear, the reindeer, the musk oxen, the lemmings and the marmots which inhabited Britain till the ice drove them out southward, even into the South of France; and how as the ice retreated, and the climate became tolerable once more, some of them-- the mammoth and rhinoceros, the bison, the lion, and many another mighty beast reoccupied our lowlands, {{at a time when the}} hippopotamus, at least in summer, ranged freely from Africa and Spain across what was then dry land between France and England, and fed by the side of animals which have long since retreated to Norway and to Canada. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> tell the archaeologist of the human beings--probably from their weapons and their habits--of the same race as the present Laplanders, who passed northward as the ice went back, following the wild reindeer herds from the South of France into our islands, which were no islands then, to be in their turn driven northward by stronger races from the east and south. But space presses, and I fear that I have written too much already.|$|R
6000|$|After Mrs. Hall {{had left}} the room, he {{remained}} {{standing in front of}} the fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr. Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to him, and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy. When he looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being constitutionally of a curious nature, he had removed the works--a quite unnecessary proceeding--with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood there, perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey's nerves. He felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another. Then Henfrey looked down again. Very uncomfortable position! One would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> Should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In Altruria {{there is}} no hurry, for no one wishes to {{outstrip}} another, or in any wise surpass him. We are all assured of enough, and are forbidden any and every sort of superfluity. If any one, after the obligatories, wishes to be entirely idle, he may be so, but I cannot now think of a single person without some voluntary occupation; doubtless there are such persons, but I do not know them. It used to be said, in the old times, that 'it was human nature' to shirk and malinger and loaf, but {{we have found that}} it is no such thing. We have found that it is human nature to work cheerfully, willingly, eagerly, at the tasks which all share for the supply of the common necessities. In like manner we have found out that it is not human nature to hoard and grudge, but that when the fear, and even the imagination, of want is taken away, it is human nature to give and to help generously. We used to say: 'A man will lie, or a man will cheat, in his own interest; that is human nature'; but that is no longer human nature with us, perhaps because no man has any interest to serve; he has only the interests of others to serve, while others serve his. It is in no wise possible for the individual to separate his good from the common good; he is prosperous and happy only as all the rest are so; and therefore it is not human nature with us for any one to lie in wait to betray another or seize an advantage. That would be ungentlemanly, and in Altruria every man is a gentleman and every woman a lady. If you will excuse me here for being so frank, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> by way of illustration which may be offensive if you take it personally." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the forward}} {{promenade}} of the Saguenay boat {{which had been}} advertised to leave Quebec at seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, Miss Kitty Ellison sat tranquilly expectant of the joys which its departure should bring, and tolerantly patient of its delay; for if all the Saguenay {{had not been in}} promise, she would have thought it the greatest happiness just to have that prospect of the St. Lawrence and Quebec. The sun shone with a warm yellow light on the Upper Town, with its girdle of gray wall, and on the red flag that drowsed above the citadel, and was a friendly lustre on the tinned roofs of the Lower Town; while away off to the south and east and west wandered the purple hills and the farmlit plains in such dewy shadow and effulgence as would have been enough to make the heaviest heart glad. Near at hand the river was busy with every kind of craft, and in the distance was mysterious with silvery vapors; little breaths of haze, like an ethereal colorless flame, exhaled from its surface, and it all glowed with a lovely inner radiance. In the middle distance a black ship was heaving anchor and setting sail, and the voice of the seamen came soft and sad and yet wildly hopeful to the dreamy ear of the young girl, whose soul at once went round the world before the ship, and then made haste back again to the promenade of the Saguenay boat. She sat leaning forward a little with her hands fallen into her lap, letting her unmastered thoughts play as they would in memories and hopes around the consciousness that she was the happiest girl in the world, and blest beyond desire or desert. To have left home as she had done, equipped for a single day at Niagara, and then to have come adventurously on, by grace of her cousin's wardrobe, as it were, to Montreal and Quebec; to be now going up the Saguenay, and finally to be destined to return home by way of Boston and New York;--this was more than any one human being had a right to; and, as she had written home to the girls, she felt that her privileges ought to be divided up among all the people of Eriecreek. She was very grateful to Colonel Ellison and Fanny for affording her these advantages; but they being now out of sight in pursuit of state-rooms, she was not thinking of them in relation to her pleasure in the morning scene, but was rather regretting the absence of a lady with whom they had travelled from Niagara, and to whom she imagined she would that moment <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in praise of the prospect. This lady was a Mrs. Basil March of Boston; and though it was her wedding journey and her husband's presence ought to have absorbed her, she and Miss Kitty had sworn a sisterhood, and were pledged to see each other before long at Mrs. March's home in Boston. In her absence, now, Kitty thought what a very charming person she was, and wondered if all Boston people were really like her, so easy and friendly and hearty. In her letter she had told the girls to tell her Uncle Jack that he had not rated Boston people a bit too high, if she were to judge from Mr. and Mrs. March, and that she was sure they would help her as far as they could to carry out his instructions when she got to Boston.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a segment}} on the 2006 season of American Idol (before singing [...] "Broken" [...] by Seether), Daughtry {{revealed}} that he is balding and {{made the decision to}} shave his head completely in order to retain an aesthetically pleasing appearance. He has been married to Deanna Daughtry since November 11, 2000. He has four children: a stepdaughter, Hannah, born September 7, 1996 from his wife's previous marriage, a stepson, Griffin, born June 30, 1998 and twins, Adalynn Rose and Noah James, born November 17, 2010. In a December 2007 interview with Gibson Lifestyle, Daughtry said, [...] "I used to call wife and just quickly throw in the towel. But I’ve found that the less I say and the more I actually listen to her, and just be there without actually being there, is the best thing I can do. As a man, I always feel <b>like</b> I need <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> Sometimes I have to stop myself because all I want to do is call and tell her about how much awesome stuff is going on in my life, and, you know, her day is sucking hard.

6000|$|... "One such word in {{a million}} {{would have been too}} many. It made me feel that they would all have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'dankening,' or <b>something</b> of the sort. And in the new poets, on other occasions, I have found faulty syntax, bad rhymes, limping feet. The editors are to blame for that, when it happens. The editor who printed 'dankening' was more to blame than the poet who wrote it, and loved the other ugly word above all his other vocables." [...] The elder poet was silent, and the other took fresh courage. [...] "Yes, I say it! You were wrong in your praise of the present {{magazine}} verse at the cost of that in our day. When we were commencing poets, the young or younger reputations were those of Stedman, of Bayard Taylor, of the Stoddards, of Aldrich, of Celia Thaxter, of Rose Terry, of Harriet Prescott, of Bret Harte, of Charles Warren Stoddard, of the Piatts, of Fitz James O'Brien, of Fitzhugh Ludlow, of a dozen more, whom the best of the newest moderns cannot rival. These were all delicate and devoted and indefatigable artists and lovers of form. It cannot do the later generation any good to equal them with ours." ...|$|R
40|$|Professor Foster's {{invitation}} to this symposium hinted pretty strongly {{that he would}} <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> trenchant about continued federal fiscal responsibility, after the initial pump-priming, in a growth center strategy. At the time I quite happily agreed. Later reflection, however, convinced {{me that this was}} not one of the key questions for the Halifax region nor in fact a very important one at all. What I propose to discuss instead is a structured way for a community to study and debate its future. The twin assumptions, that the future is malleable in important ways [...] "ours to design" [...] and that its designers ought to be the present residents, are now part of the conventional planning wisdom. Just how far they are (or ought to be) true, though, is still a good question. Part of this paper has to do with shortcomings in present ways in which communities now study their futures, especially in the more analytic methods propounded by fellow professionals, and with suggestions for alternative. approaches. Along the way, and in the blissful absence of real data, I shall mention aspects of some potential futures that may be disquieting and maybe mildly provocative, and allude {{from time to time to}} intergovernmental finance. The heart of the argument is that every alternative proposal for this region's future ought to be examined for its feasibility, its implications, and community valuations of those implications; and that in addition to the interests of the groups party to the decision, a prudent community will sequentially evaluate a proposal in terms of resilience, equity and (only then) efficiency. The order is important. There is little sense in arguing about the desirability of infeasible policies or unattainable goals. Structuring the learning process in this fashion allows many more options to be addressed with the same resources of community time and energy. Most of the rest of this paper is concerned with explaining the italicized words above. Let me begin by defining one of the many possible alternative futures of the Halifax-Dartmouth metropolitan region as an exemplary straw horse...|$|R

5000|$|Professionally, [...] "what {{it means}} to criticize" [...] has become a much more {{specialized}} and technical matter, where [...] "inside knowledge" [...] is required to understand the criticism truly; this development {{is linked to the}} circumstance, that the right to criticize, or the propriety (appropriate use) of criticism, is regarded nowadays much more as depending on one's position, or on the context of the situation ("I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but I am {{not in a position to}} criticize").|$|E

5000|$|I felt very, {{very upset}} with the way people treated each other last year, when we were writing, {{and a lot of}} that came out as anger. It made me feel a lot better to sing about it, and a lot of what was said really needed to be said by someone, even if I didn't. Even if my main message that people get is 'I don't know what's going on but I think you're all dicks... does anyone else feel like this?', that's {{important}} as no one was saying even that. Everyone was just letting it all go on, only saying 'ooh, isn't it terrible?', but not engaging or trying to understand why these things were happening, or not even having an opinion about our role in all of it. I just felt <b>like</b> I needed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> even if that is on a poppy-indie type record.

Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent [...] "watching rolling news" [...] and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of and violence, you've got rolling news and you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." ...|$|R
