The brittle, kinky hypopigmented hair of steely appearance is due to a deficiency in an unidentified cuproenzyme.

25|$|A related {{disease has}} been {{identified}} and named osteolathyrism, because it affects the bones and connecting tissues, instead of the nervous system. It is a skeletal disorder, caused by the toxin beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), and characterized by hernias, aortic dissection, exostoses, and kyphoscoliosis and other skeletal deformities, apparently {{as the result of}} defective aging of collagen tissue. The cause of this disease is attributed to beta-aminopropionitrile, which inhibits the copper-containing enzyme <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidase,</b> responsible for cross-linking procollagen and proelastin. BAPN is also a metabolic product of a compound present in sprouts of grasspea, pea and lentils. A disorder that is clinically similar is konzo.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidase,</b> and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E

40|$|The {{inadequate}} {{transport of}} drugs into the tumor tissue caused by its abnormal vasculature {{is a major}} obstacle {{to the treatment of}} cancer. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs can cause phenotypic alteration and maturation of the tumor's vasculature. However, whether this consistently improves delivery and subsequent response to therapy is still controversial. Clinical results indicate that not all patients benefit from antiangiogenic treatment, necessitating the development of criteria to predict the effect of these agents in individual tumors. We demonstrate that, in anti-VEGF-refractory murine tumors, vascular changes after VEGF ablation result in reduced delivery leading to therapeutic failure. In these tumors, the impaired response after anti-VEGF treatment is directly linked to strong deposition of fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components and high expression of <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases.</b> The resulting condensed, highly crosslinked ECM impeded drug permeation, protecting tumor cells from exposure to small-molecule drugs. The reduced vascular density after anti-VEGF treatment further decreased delivery in these tumors, an effect not compensated by the improved vessel quality. Pharmacological inhibition of <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> improved drug delivery in various tumor models and reversed the negative effect of VEGF ablation on drug delivery and therapeutic response in anti-VEGF-resistant tumors. In conclusion, the vascular changes after anti-VEGF therapy can have a context-dependent negative impact on overall therapeutic efficacy. A determining factor is the tumor ECM, which strongly influences the effect of anti-VEGF therapy. Our results reveal the prospect to revert a possible negative effect and to potentiate responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy by concomitantly targeting ECM-modifying enzymes.

40|$|Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} that are extensively used in agriculture as pesticides. As such, humans and wildlife are undoubtedly exposed to these chemicals. Although DTCs {{are thought to be}} relatively safe due to their short half lives, it is well established that they are teratogenic to vertebrates, especially to fish. In zebrafish, these teratogenic effects are characterized by distorted notochord development and shortened anterior to posterior axis. DTCs are known copper (Cu) chelators but this does not fully explain the observed teratogenic effects. We show here that DTCs cause malformations in zebrafish that highly resemble teratogenic effects observed by direct inhibition of a group of cuproenzymes termed <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> (LOX).

Histological and ultrastructural analyses of cartilage elements in loxl 3 b morphant embryos reveal abnormal maturation of cartilage and altered chondrocyte morphology. Spatiotemporal analysis of craniofacial markers in loxl 3 b morphant embryos shows that cranial neural crest cells migrate normally into the developing pharyngeal arches but that differentiation and condensation markers are aberrantly expressed.

We previously found fewer alveoli and more elastin in lungs of preterm compared to term lambs that had mechanical ventilation with O 2 -rich gas for 3 wk (MV- 3 wk). We hypothesized that in preterm {{more than in}} term lambs, MV- 3 wk would reduce lung expression of growth factors that regulate alveolarization (VEGF, PDGF-A), and increase lung expression of growth factors (TGF-, TGF- 1) and matrix molecules (tropoelastin, fibrillin- 1, fibulin- 5, <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases)</b> that regulate elastin synthesis and assembly. We measured lung expression of these genes in preterm and term lambs after MV for 1 d, 3 d or 3 wk, and in fetal controls. Lung mRNA for VEGF, PDGF-A and their receptors (VEGF-R 2, PDGF-R) decreased in preterm and term lambs after MV- 3 wk, with reduced lung content of the relevant proteins in preterm lambs with CLD.

Overhydroxylation of lysine residues and the subsequent formation of hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline (LP) cross-links underlie the ECM stiffness and profoundly affect tumor progression. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the relationship between ECM of UF, collagen and collagen cross-linking enzymes [lysyl hydroxylases (LH) and <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> (LOX) ], and the development and progression of UF. Our results indicated that hydroxyl lysine (Hyl) and HP cross-links are significantly higher in UF compared to the normal myometrial tissues accompanied by increased expression of LH (LH 2 b) and LOX. Also, increased resistance to matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) proteolytic degradation activity was observed. Furthermore, the extent of collagen cross-links was positively correlated with the expression of myofibroblast marker (α-SMA), growth-promoting markers (PCNA; pERK 1 / 2; FAKpY 397; Ki- 67; and Cyclin D 1), and the size of UF. In conclusion, our study defines the role of overhydroxylation of collagen and collagen cross-linking enzymes in modulating UF cell proliferation, differentiation, and resistance to MMP.

Functionally, Aspn-/- mice had an increased skin mechanical toughness, although there were no structural changes present on histology or immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy analyses showed 7 % thinner collagen fibrils in Aspn-/- mice (not statistically significant).

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} pancreatic {{cancer is the}} predominant stroma, which consists of fibroblasts, immune cells and a significant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The stroma accounts for over {{eighty percent of the}} pancreatic tumor mass and plays significant, yet poorly understood, roles in tumor progression and therapeutic response. One major component of the ECM in pancreatic cancer is fibrillar type I collagen, which has been shown to serve as a barrier to chemotherapy and to facilitate metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells through integrin-mediated signaling. The cross-linking of type I collagen mediated by the <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> (LOX) is elevated in invasive cancers and inversely correlates with metastatic free survival in breast cancer patients. Moreover, inhibition of LOX enzymes in mouse models of breast cancer decreases tumor size, latency, and metastasis. Given the abundance of type I collagen and the high expression of several LOX family members in pancreatic cancer, we examined whether inhibiting these enzymes could limit the progression of pancreatic cancer in mouse models. Using syngeneic, orthotopic transplantation models of pancreatic cancer - with significant fibrosis - we determined the effects of <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> on pancreatic cancer. First, we established that both LOX and LOX-like 2 (LOXL 2) were expressed much higher in tumors than in normal pancreatic tissue. However, inhibition of LOX activity, using the small molecule inhibitor β-aminoproprionitirile, significantly increased tumor wet weight and metastasis to the liver and spleen – the exact opposite results of those reported in breast cancer mouse models. Similarly, silencing the expression of LOXL 2 in cancer cells, using RNA interference, also resulted in increased tumor growth. To examine why LOX inhibition has this surprisingly negative effect on pancreatic cancer progression, we tested the effects of LOX enzyme inhibition on collagen structure by picrosirius red stains, which visualize fibrillar collagens when tissues are observed under cross-polarized light. LOX inhibition promoted the deposition of fibrillar collagen in the tumor. To determine how this altered collagen deposition influenced cell behavior, we performed confocal microscope imaging in live tumor-bearing mice that express a fusion protein in which GFPtopaz is inserted into the N-terminus of α 2 (I) - collagen and expression is driven by the 3. 6 kb Col 1 a 1 promoter [α 2 (I) -col-GFP mice]. Live imaging of red fluorescent protein expressing cancer cells in pancreatic tumors in the α 2 (I) -col-GFP mice showed a rich deposit of collagen and migration of cancer cells on linear collagen. Imaging confirmed that administration of the LOX inhibitor for just 3 days resulted in thicker collagen fibers than the control treated tumors. We are currently examining the underlying mechanisms responsible for the opposite responses of LOX targeting in breast and pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that targeting collagen cross-linking enzymes would be a poor strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCongenital {{vertebral}} malformations (CVM) {{occur in}} 1 in 1000 live births {{and in many}} cases can cause spinal deformities, such as scoliosis, and result in disability and distress of affected individuals. Many severe forms of the disease, such as spondylocostal dystostosis, are recessive monogenic traits affecting somitogenesis, however the etiologies of the majority of CVM cases remain undetermined. Here we demonstrate that morphological defects of the notochord in zebrafish can generate congenital-type spine defects. We characterize three recessive zebrafish leviathan/col 8 a 1 a mutant alleles (m 531, vu 41, vu 105) that disrupt collagen type VIII alpha 1 a (col 8 a 1 a), and cause folding of the embryonic notochord and consequently adult vertebral column malformations. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a transient loss of col 8 a 1 a function or inhibition of <b>Lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> with drugs during embryogenesis was sufficient to generate vertebral fusions and scoliosis in the adult spine. Using periodic imaging of individual zebrafish, we correlate focal notochord defects of the embryo with vertebral malformations (VM) in the adult. Finally, we show that bends and kinks in the notochord can lead to aberrant apposition of osteoblasts normally confined to well-segmented areas of the developing vertebral bodies. Our results afford a novel mechanism for the formation of VM, independent of defects of somitogenesis, resulting from aberrant bone deposition at regions of misshapen notochord tissue...|$|R

Penicillamine was added to the diet (0. 2 % and 0. 4 %, in the presence or not of 10 mg/kg CuSO 4 and 100 mg/kg vitamin B 6) from hatching, for periods from 7 days up to 2 months. The same regions of the thoracic aortas were examined and compared in all the different experimental conditions. The results showed that penicillamine induced relevant modifications in the process of elastin fibrogenesis. The alterations consisted of an increase of elastin in the extracellular space, associated with {{an increase in the number}} of elastin fibers per unit area, and a decrease of the mean profile area of the fibers. Interestingly, penicillamine induced the formation of numerous bundles of microfibrils associated or not with elastin fibers. After prolonged treatment, elastin tended to diminish and the fibers tended to fuse into polymorphic syncytia. Collagen fibrils were larger, showed more heterogeneous cross diameters, were less numerous, and were more spread out within the tissue. All the other components of the aortic wall appeared not to be altered by the chemical. Penicillamine did not modify the copper content of chick aortas, whereas it induced a 40 - 50 % reduction of the activity of both salt and 4 M urea-soluble peptidyl <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> in the same tissue.

The mechanisms responsible for this aggressiveness remain unclear. Here, we used the clinically relevant 4 T 1 breast cancer model mimicking aggressive local relapse after radiotherapy to identify differences between tumors grown in untreated versus preirradiated mammary glands. Tumors grown within preirradiated beds were highly enriched in transcripts encoding collagens and other proteins building or modifying the extracellular matrix, such as laminin- 332, tenascins, <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> and matrix metalloproteinases. Type I collagen, known to directly contribute to tissue stiffening, and the pro-metastatic megakaryoblastic leukemia- 1 (Mkl 1) target gene tenascin-C were further investigated. Mammary tissue preirradiation induced Mkl 1 nuclear translocation in the tumor cells in vivo, indicating activation of Mkl 1 signaling. Transcript profiling of cultured 4 T 1 cells revealed {{that the majority of}} the Mkl 1 target genes, including tenascin-C, required serum response factor (SRF) for their expression. However, application of dynamic strain or matrix stiffness to 4 T 1 cells converted the predominant SRF/Mkl 1 action into SAP domain-dependent Mkl 1 signaling independent of SRF, accompanied by a switch to SAP-dependent tumor cell migration. 4 T 1 tumors overexpressing intact Mkl 1 became more metastatic within preirradiated beds, while tumors expressing Mkl 1 lacking the SAP domain exhibited impaired growth and metastatic spread, and decreased Mkl 1 target gene expression. Thus, we identified SAP-dependent Mkl 1 signaling as a previously unrecognized mediator of aggressive progression of mammary tumors locally relapsing after radiotherapy, and provide a novel signaling pathway for therapeutic intervention...|$|R

The condition is caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin- 1, an essential component in the formation of elastic fibers. While experimental findings in animal models of the disease have shown the involvement of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) - and angiotensin II-dependent pathways, alterations in the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) may also {{play a role in the}} onset and progression of the aortic disease. <b>Lysyl</b> <b>oxidases</b> (LOX) are extracellular enzymes, which initiates the formation of covalent cross-linking of collagens and elastin, thereby contributing to the maturation of the ECM. Here we have explored the role of LOX in the formation of aortic aneurysms in MFS. We show that aortic tissue from MFS patients and MFS mouse model (Fbn 1 C 1039 G/+) displayed enhanced expression of the members of the LOX family, LOX and LOX-like 1 (LOXL 1), and this is associated with the formation of mature collagen fibers. Administration of a LOX inhibitor for 8 weeks blocked collagen accumulation and aggravated elastic fiber impairment, and these effects correlated with the induction of a strong and rapidly progressing aortic dilatation, and with premature death in the more severe MFS mouse model, Fbn 1 mgR/mgR, without any significant effect on wild type animals. This detrimental effect occurred preferentially in the ascending portion of the aorta, with little or no involvement of the aortic root, and was associated to an overactivation of both canonical and non-canonical TGF-β signaling pathways. The blockade of angiotensin II type I receptor with losartan restored TGF-β signaling activation, normalized elastic fiber impairment and prevented the aortic dilatation induced by LOX inhibition in Fbn 1 C 1039 G/+ mice. Our data indicate that LOX enzymes and LOX-mediated collagen accumulation play a critical protective role in aneurysm formation in MFS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Biochemical alternation of collagen metabolism during periodontal bacterial infection leads to tissue breakdown. We examined collagen I metabolism in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and systemically studied {{the impact of}} hypoxia and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are both intimately involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. METHODS: Primary HGF were treated with Escherichia coli LPS, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 -neutralizing antibody, and/or hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) inhibitor 3 -(5 '-hydroxymethyl- 2 '-furyl) - 1 -benzyl indazole (YC- 1) under different oxygen concentrations. The transcript levels of 35 genes directly related to collagen I synthesis and degradation were examined using Real-Time PCR. The concentrations of collagen I and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 3 from cultured cells were measured by ELISA. The activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and - 9 were examined using gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Although the transcript and protein production of collagen I propeptide remained unchanged, hypoxia and/or LPS enhanced the transcription of several enzymes related to collagen assembly and crosslinking, including prolyl 4 -hydroxylases, lysyl hydroxylases and <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases.</b> The mRNA levels of MMP- 1, 2, 8, 9, 13 and 14 remained stable, as did the enzymatic activity of MMP- 2 and - 9. However, levels of TIMP- 1 and - 3 were increased by hypoxia. The observed cellular reactions under hypoxic conditions could be reversed by YC- 1 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia and LPS appeared to alter cellular reactions in HGF by maintaining or upregulating signals involved in collagen I matrix homeostasis possibly mediated through HIF-α. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 25 th IADR-SEA Division Annual Scientific Meeting, Singapore, 28 - 30 October 2011...|$|R

LOX genes expanded during metazoan evolution resulting in two superfamilies, LOXL 2 /L 3 /L 4 and LOX/L 1 /L 5.

A reduction in elastin has been observed in chronic venous insufficiency, but little is known about some of the factors involved in elastin synthesis such as <b>lysyl</b> <b>oxidases.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the in vivo expression of the elastin precursor, tropoelastin (TE), and lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL 1), a cross-linking enzyme responsible for elastin polymer deposition. The effects of age on these expression patterns were also evaluated. METHODS: Saphenous vein segments were obtained during surgery from organ donors (controls, n= 20) and subjects with venous insufficiency (varicose veins, n= 20). Both these groups were subdivided according to subject age into or= 50 years (n= 10). Control and varicose vein tissue specimens were immunolabelled using anti-tropoelastin and anti-LOXL 1 antibodies and also subjected to Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the levels of these markers of elastin synthesis (LOXL/tropoelastin) in the vein wall diminish in a significant way (p or= 50 years (n= 10). Control and varicose vein tissue specimens were immunolabelled using anti-tropoelastin and anti-LOXL 1 antibodies and also subjected to Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the levels of these markers of elastin synthesis (LOXL/tropoelastin) in the vein wall diminish in a significant way (p< 0. 05) with the age factor. Excluding the age factor, LOXL 1 was significantly decreased in the varicose condition (p< 0. 05). In the younger pathological population they showed an inverse relationship (LOXL decreased, tropoelastin increased). CONCLUSIONS: The already established reduction in elastin in the varicose condition may be related, at least in part, to the decreased LOXL 1 levels observed here. These events could reduce spontaneous reticulation of elastin and the partial loss of tissue elasticity in this group of patients...|$|R
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} by {{an evaluation}} of medical history and clinical observation. The Beighton criteria are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. DNA and biochemical studies can help identify affected individuals. Diagnostic tests include collagen gene mutation testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and <b>lysyl</b> hydroxylase or <b>oxidase</b> activity. However, these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped mutation, so clinical evaluation by a geneticist remains essential. If there are multiple affected individuals in a family, {{it may be possible to}} perform prenatal diagnosis using a DNA information technique known as a linkage study. There may be poor knowledge about EDS among practitioners.|$|R
