40|$|Indicator {{models of}} sexual {{selection}} predict that females mating {{with the most}} ornamented males should produce offspring with enhanced expression of fitness-related traits, such as overall vigor and viability. Empirical support for this prediction, however, is limited. We quantified {{the effects of a}} heritable and condition-dependent secondary sexual trait on offspring performance traits in Drosophila bipectinata Duda (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Forty-eight genetic (isofemale) lines were extracted from a natural population, reared in a common environment, and characterized in terms of sex comb size. We measured pupal viability and adult mating success among the progeny of the 5 lines with the largest combs (high <b>line</b> <b>category)</b> and the 5 lines with the smallest combs (low <b>line</b> <b>category).</b> The high <b>line</b> <b>category</b> produced offspring that were significantly more viable than the low <b>line</b> <b>category,</b> and this advantage held across 2 developmental temperatures. In contrast, there was no effect of <b>line</b> <b>category</b> on male mating success, although at the individual-level, comb size was significantly positively correlated with mating success. Our results indicate that the relative size of the D. bipectinata sex comb taps genotypic properties that enhance offspring fitness in a trait-specific manner. Thus, distinct proximate mechanisms likely underlie relationships between secondary sexual trait expression and different performance traits in offspring, offering a possible explanation for inconsistent support for the existence of indirect benefits in sexual selection. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} level {{pattern matching}} approach to text image parsing is described. The parser assigns syntactic categories to words {{that occur in}} a two-dimensional image of a constrained block of text. Bottom-up information (from an image segmentation routine), that includes the number of lines of text, {{the number of words}} in each line, and an estimate of the number of characters in each word, is initially used to compute a ranked list of categories for each word and a probability that each one is correct. The local support provided by words that are horizontally adjacent is used to refine the initial assignment and to assign a ranked list of categories to each line. The word and <b>line</b> <b>category</b> assignments are then probabilistically fit to patterns that describe allowable configurations of lines. The output is a ranked list of the patterns that fit best and the probabilities that they are correct. A success rate of up to 96 percent is achieved in classifying lines of text in a test sel of postal address images. AI topic: Knowledge-based control, parsing. Domain area: Process automation...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 44). Zalophus californianus, the California sea lion, is {{a coastal}} sea lion that ranges {{along the west}} coast of USA, from Alaska in the north to the Baja Mexico, in the south. Sea lions are well-known for their playfulness, intelligence, and are used in the military and wildlife shows. Sea lions have been identified to have a propensity for urinary tract carcinomas and about 17 % are are diagnosed with cancers. Sequencing the sea lion genome provides experience in researching a large genome and will identify genes that are responsible for specific traits, such as the evolution of a land mammal to semi-aquatic habitat and also identify genes that are causing cancers in these animals. The Sea lion genome was sequenced using a 454 FLx sequencer, provided through collaboration with Roche 454 Lifesciences, and the resultant data was assembled using Newbler assembler. A total of 1, 951, 532, 210 bps of sea lion DNA was assembled and 1. 4 million contigs were generated. Interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA were identified and masked using Repeatmasker. The proportion of repeat regions within the sea lion genome was 35. 56 %, and dominated by the <b>LINE</b> <b>category,</b> similar to other carnivores. The sea lion mitochondrial DNA was identified and assembled to perform phylogenetic analysis. Prediction of gene structure and compositional features of exons, introns and intergenic regions was conducted by a HMM based model called GlimmerHMM. Two different approaches, HMMgene and GlimmerHMM were conducted to identify exon regions to build a sea lion specific training model. The number of exons predicted by GlimmerHMM was 244, 377 much higher than 74, 700 exons predicted by HMMgene. Out of 1. 4 million contigs, 379 contigs have coding sequences with initial, internal and terminal exons and out of 379 contigs, 248 contigs showed similarity matches against `nr' database. Therefore a pipeline was created to build the species specific model by GlimmerHMM to predict species specific protein coding sequences and this approach can be broadly applied to any newly sequenced eukaryotic genome in an academic settings. Furthermore, sequencing and annotation of the sea lion genome will help in finding the underlying cause for diseases such as cancers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The general aim of {{this study}} and those {{presented}} in Parts 2 – 4 of this series was to characterize the structure, properties, wear, and fracture of prosthetic retaining screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses after long-term use in vivo. This part of the overall investigation addresses whether there are differences in thread wear between the screws closest to the fulcrum and those that are farthest from the fulcrum in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. Materials and Methods: The total number of prosthetic retaining screws used in this study was 100 (10 new and 90 used). New screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) were divided into Group 1 (slotted) and Group 2 (hexed). Ninety used screws (in service 18 – 120 months) were retrieved from fixed detachable hybrid prostheses in 18 patients (5 screws from each patient, 60 from NB and 30 from Sterngold). The used screws were divided into 18 groups. Additionally, each group was subdivided into A and B categories. Category A contained the middle three prosthetic screws, which were considered the farthest screws from the fulcrum <b>line.</b> <b>Category</b> B contained the most posterior two screws, which were considered the screws closest to the fulcrum line. All 100 screws were subjected to thorough, nondestructive testing. Results: Light and scanning electron microscopic examination of all used screws for each group revealed surface deterioration of the active profile of the screw threads consistent with adhesive wear. The observed thread profile deterioration ranged from mild to severe. The wear was aggressive enough to cause galling, which led to thinning of the threads and, in severe cases, to knife-edges at thread crests. In ten groups, the most anterior three screws exhibited more wear than the most posterior two screws. In addition to thread wear, severe plastic deformation was detected on the bottom part of each screw for three groups, and a long external longitudinal crack was detected in one screw of Group 2. Conclusions: The findings of this study and those presented in Parts 2 – 4 demonstrate that different retaining screws from the same manufacturer and/or from different manufacturers have different geometrical design, microstructures, major alloy constituents, and microhardness, and that these differences influence their preload and fractured load values. In this part of the overall investigation, the occurrence of galling as a result of wear involving prosthetic retaining screws appears to be an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of long-term use in vivo in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses regardless of the intended/original preload value. The galling rate is greater on the middle three screws compared to the most posterior two screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. The wear pattern is consistent with an adhesive wear mechanism; however, this study does not provide enough data to support a definitive analysis. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|With {{different}} {{choices of}} the cut-offs used in theoretical calculations, we have carried out extensive numerical calculations of the N 2 -broadend Lorentzian half-widths of the H 2 O lines using the modified Robert-Bonamy formalism. Based on these results, {{we are able}} to thoroughly check for convergence. We find that, with the low-order cut-offs commonly used in the literature, one is able to obtain converged values only for lines with large half-widths. Conversely, for lines with small half-widths, much higher cut-offs are necessary to guarantee convergence. We also analyse the uncertainties associated with calculated half-widths, and these are correlated as above. In general, the smaller the half-widths, the poorer the convergence and the larger the uncertainty associated with them. For convenience, one can divide all H 2 O <b>lines</b> into three <b>categories,</b> large, intermediate, and small, according to their half-width values. One can use this division to judge whether the calculated half-widths are converged or not, based on the cut-offs used, and also to estimate how large their uncertainties are.

While humans can easily interpret robot gestures, the perception of human behavior using robot sensors is more difficult.

Todetermine the intended pointing target, frequently the line between a person’s eyes and hand {{is assumed to be}} the pointing direction. However, since people tend to keep the line-of-sight free while they are pointing, this simple approximation is inadequate. Moreover, depending on the distance and angle to the pointing target, the line between shoulder and hand or elbow and hand may yield better interpretations of the pointing direction. In order to achieve a better estimate, we extract a set of body features from depth and amplitude images of a ToF camera and train a model of pointing directions using Gaussian Process Regression.
