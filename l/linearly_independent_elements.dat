40|$|When {{a spatial}} process is {{recorded}} {{over time and}} the observation {{at a given time}} instant is viewed as a point in a function space, the result is a time series taking values in a Banach space. To study the spatio-temporal extremal dynamics of such a time series, the latter is assumed to be jointly regularly varying. This assumption is shown to be equivalent to convergence in distribution of the rescaled time series conditionally on the event that at a given moment in time it is far away from the origin. The limit is called the tail process or the spectral process depending on the way of rescaling. These processes provide convenient starting points to study, for instance, joint survival functions, tail dependence coefficients, extremograms, extremal indices, and point processes of extremes. The theory applies to linear processes composed of infinite sums of <b>linearly</b> transformed <b>independent</b> random <b>elements</b> whose common distribution is regularly varying.

We study the problem: Does a finite-dimensional minimal lattice-subspace (or equivalently a finite-dimensional minimal subspace with a positive basis) of R-Omega which contains X exist? To this end we define the function beta(t) = 1 /z(t) (x(1) (t), x(2) (t), [...] ., x(n) (t)), where z(t) = x(1) (t) + x(2) (t) + [...] . + x(n) (t), which we call basic function and takes values in the simplex Delta(n) of R-+(n). We prove {{that the answer to}} the problem is positive if and only if the convex hull K of the closure of the range of beta is a polytope. Also we prove that X is a lattice-subspace (or equivalently X has positive basis) if and only if, K is an (n- 1) -simplex. In both cases, using the vertices of K, we determine a positive basis of the minimal lattice-subspace. In the sequel, we study the case where Omega is a convex set and x(1), x(2), [...] ., x(n) are linear functions. This includes the case where x(i) are positive elements of a Banach lattice, or more general the case where x(i) are positive elements of an ordered space Y. Based on the linearity of the functions x(i) we prove some criteria by means of which we study if K is a polytope or not and also we determine the vertices of K.
