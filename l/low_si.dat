The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine SI and the gender-specific factors associated with <b>low</b> <b>SI</b> in a Korean elderly cohort. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study identifying the gender-specific factors related to SI in 252 men and women aged 65 years and greater from local senior centers in Seoul, Korea between January and February 2009. Results: The mean SI of elderly men was significantly higher than that of the women's. A multiple regression analysis reveals that age, nutritional status, and physical activity were predictive factors of lower SI in men, whereas age, alcohol consumption, educational level, and genetic polymorphism were predictive factors for elderly women. Conclusions: <b>Low</b> <b>SI</b> was common in both elderly men and women.

SI, proposed by Cox (1991), is a means of describing the racial/ethnic diversity present among the employees of a firm, whereas diversity management programs are the successors to affirmative action plans.

In this study, the biodistribution of a recently developed fluorescent imaging probe with high affinity to the endothelin A (ETA) receptor was evaluated by fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI). CD- 1 mice were injected with 2 nmol of the probe intravenously and sacrificed at various time points. Tissue samples of the heart, spleen, lung, kidneys, liver, brain, and muscle were removed and imaged by FRI. Initially, the signal intensity (SI) was highest in lung, kidney, and liver tissue, followed by the heart, whereas spleen, muscle, and brain showed the <b>lowest</b> <b>SI.</b> In the kidneys, the SI decreased rapidly. In the heart, an initial SI increase was observed, followed by SI attenuation, whereas in the lung, the SI steadily increased.

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} value of {{magnetic}} resonance angiography (MRA) {{in the evaluation of}} vascular patency after intravascular endoprosthesis placement. Methods Three different metallic stents (Wallstent, Strecker, Palmaz) were studied in vitro, and in vivo in six patients with spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GRE) MR imaging. Time-of-flight, two-dimensional (2 D) gadolinium-enhanced MRA was performed with GRE and flow-compensation technique, and reconstructed with a maximum-intensity projection (MIP) algorithm. MRA was compared to digital angiograms. Results In vitro studies demonstrated that the signal intensity (SI) within the stent differed according to the device employed, the <b>lowest</b> <b>SI</b> being observed within the Palmaz stent (p =. 001). There was no difference in SI or apparent diameter of the stent according to the sequence (SE vs GRE) or length of echo time (TE). In patients, the endoprostheses recorded as a well-defined area of signal void or drop-out (p = 0. 004), whereas vessels above and below the stent displayed high signal intensities. Conclusion MRA does not seem as yet to be well suited for evaluating vascular patency after endoprosthesis placement, even if the Strecker and Wallstent endoprostheses provide fewer artifacts than the Palmaz stent. © 1995, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

A ranking is proposed along a Si: P gradient: at the high end are the planktonic Synedra spp. with the highest <b>Si</b> requirements and <b>lowest</b> P requirements (high Si: P), the planktonic Nitzschia spp. are intermediate, and the Stephanodiscus pp. are at the low end with the <b>lowest</b> <b>Si</b> requirements and highest P requirements (low Si: P).

The {{mechanical}} properties of galvannealed dual phase steels bearing Si were investigated, {{and then the}} effect of Si on work hardening behavior during tensile deformation was discussed. Both tensile strength and yield strength were increased with increasing Si content, especially increasing ratio of tensile strength was larger than that of yield strength. On the other hand, the decrease of uniform elongation was very small with increasing Si content. Therefore, tensile strength and total elongation balance was improved by Si addition.

Dislocation cell structures were observed at 8 % tensile strain in <b>low</b> <b>Si</b> steel, while dislocation cell structures were scarcely observed and instead, tangled dislocations were dominantly observed in high Si steel.

Two weeks after pollination ZmLsi 1 and ZmLsi 6 genes were expressed, and expression continued until the final developmental stage of the kernels, while ZmLsi 2 was not expressed.
