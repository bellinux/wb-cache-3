5|$|At Tikal, {{beams of}} {{sapodilla}} wood were placed as <b>lintels</b> spanning the inner doorways of temples. These {{are the most}} elaborately carved wooden <b>lintels</b> to have survived anywhere in the Maya region.|$|E
5|$|The {{red brick}} facade is {{detailed}} with {{significant amounts of}} limestone, including in its continuous <b>lintels</b> and sills. The entrances are covered with large round arches. The full basement is hinted at by the building's prominent foundation and water table. The window <b>lintels,</b> and sills, {{as well as the}} arches and stairs are trimmed with limestone.|$|E
5|$|Most {{surviving}} pre-Columbian Maya writing {{dates to}} the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites, such as stelae, or on ceramics vessels. Other media include the aforementioned codices, stucco façades, frescoes, wooden <b>lintels,</b> cave walls, and portable artefacts crafted {{from a variety of}} materials, including bone, shell, obsidian, and jade.|$|E
50|$|For Post and <b>Lintel</b> System ICFs, the {{concrete}} has a horizontal member, called a <b>lintel,</b> {{only at the}} top of the wall (Horizontal concrete at the bottom of the wall is often present in the form of the building's footer or the <b>lintel</b> of the wall below.) and vertical members, called posts, between the <b>lintel</b> and the surface on which the wall is resting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lintel</b> 30 {{is part of}} the <b>lintel</b> series {{carved with}} a {{continuous}} hieroglyphic text set into Structure 10.|$|R
30|$|Research {{about the}} <b>lintel</b> is scarce because <b>lintel</b> {{has not been}} {{considered}} as a structural member in construction field. Recently, Lee and Oh [7] conducted a static experiment to evaluate the seismic performance of a two-story reinforced concrete (RC) shear wall system. As a result, it was shown that the specimen with a <b>lintel</b> beam underwent the seismic performance with an ultimate strength and ductility capacity better than the specimen without a <b>lintel</b> beam.|$|R
5|$|The {{architect}} Tiratur built a square-planned gavit (narthex) west of Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) in 1648. It {{functioned as}} a church during the 19th century, called Surb Gevorg. To {{the west of the}} narthex was a 17th-century three-arched open-air porch; to the north was Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross); while to the south was the 17th-century Church of Surb Sion. Urartian cuneiform inscriptions were used as <b>lintels</b> on their western entrances.|$|E
5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} {{architecture}} is modelled {{after the great}} city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, <b>lintels,</b> and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and <b>lintels,</b> stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door transom and concrete stoop. The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} force vectors acting upon the post and <b>lintel</b> system: weight {{carrying}} compression at the joint between <b>lintel</b> and post, and tension induced by deformation of self-weight and the load above between the posts. The two posts are under compression from {{the weight of the}} <b>lintel</b> (or beam) above. The <b>lintel</b> will deform by sagging in the middle because the underside is under tension and the topside is under compression.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lintel</b> may {{support the}} chimney above a fireplace, or span the {{distance}} of a path or road, forming a stone <b>lintel</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lintel</b> 17 {{was another}} <b>lintel</b> from a doorway in Structure 21 {{that is now}} in the British Museum. It is sculpted from {{limestone}} and was originally set above the northwest doorway of the central room. It dates to the reign of Bird Jaguar IV. The <b>lintel</b> depicts Bird Jaguar IV and his wife Lady B'alam Mut participating in a bloodletting ritual. The king watches while his wife pulls a rope through her tongue draw blood. This ritual is recorded as having taken place eight days after the capture event depicted on <b>Lintel</b> 16.|$|R
5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden shutters and white-painted wooden <b>lintels</b> and sills.|$|E
5|$|The {{opinion of}} historians {{is that the}} temple was built as a {{dedication}} to the Shaivite beliefs of Hinduism (from {{the large number of}} Shaivaite images seen on the <b>lintels</b> of the main temple and in other adjoining temples). But at some stage during the Middle Ages, there was a shift in the religious beliefs of the rulers and people adopted Vaishnavite beliefs of Hinduism as witnessed by the images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita deified in the main sanctum sanctorum of the temple complex.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{was used}} for beams, and for <b>lintels,</b> even in masonry structures. Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples {{continued}} to be built from wooden poles and thatch. Adobe was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.|$|E
30|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{evaluate}} whether <b>lintel</b> has structural effect because {{it has not been}} categorized as a structural member. This study experimentally evaluated the horizontal load-carrying capacity of post-beam timber frame structures with bi-linear model and energy dissipation mechanism. To evaluate the effect on horizontal performance of <b>lintel</b> which has been widely used as wall frame in Korean traditional post-beam structure, two frames were tested in different types. One had no <b>lintel</b> and the other one had <b>lintel</b> at the height of 800  mm, respectively. Cyclic loading tests were conducted for each frame according to the standard loading protocol. Frame which had <b>lintel</b> showed slightly higher stiffness. And it showed noticeably significant energy dissipation performance after yield point of the joint. And that leads to the conclusion that <b>lintel</b> has structural effect and it should be considered as an important factor when evaluating horizontal performance of the structure after yield point of the joint.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Lintel</b> 1 over {{doorway to}} Room 1. This <b>lintel</b> depicts Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak, {{capturing}} an enemy on January 12, A.D. 787 (Longcount date: 9.17.16.3.12, 8 Eb 10 K’umk’u).|$|R
50|$|<b>Lintel</b> 13 {{is above}} a doorway in Structure 20. It had fallen when {{the roof of}} the {{building}} collapsed but has since been reset. The sculpture on the <b>lintel</b> is very well preserved.|$|R
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and <b>lintels</b> constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{script was}} in use {{up to the}} arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 {{individual}} texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, <b>lintels,</b> stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, {{as a result of the}} impact of the conquest on Maya society.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, <b>lintels</b> and arching. At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
50|$|Original {{windows on}} the other facades are double-hung, with main panels three by three {{rectangular}} panes wide. Each of these also has a stone <b>lintel</b> with circular bas-relief design. Windows added later lack the <b>lintel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The doorway is 1.67 m (5.5 ft) high. It has a flat <b>lintel.</b> On {{the inside}} over the <b>lintel,</b> two holed stones project {{out from the}} wall, {{possibly}} for the attachment of a wooden door.|$|R
50|$|St. Dairbhile's Church is a gabled single-cell church, now in ruins. The {{church has}} a narrow ashlar-lined, deeply-splayed east window with an arcuated <b>lintel,</b> and a narrow west doorway with {{inclined}} jambs and arcuated <b>lintel.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although the Calendar Round {{is still}} in use today, the Maya started using an {{abbreviated}} Short Count during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 k'atuns. For this reason, {{there is no direct}} correlation between the Long Count and the European calendar. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation. The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems {{with the rest of the}} Maya region. The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period. Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden <b>lintels</b> at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.|$|E
5|$|Fire Station Number 4 or Fire Station No. 4 is a {{historic}} fire station located at 474 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The building historically has also been called the Collyer Fire Station. The Queen Anne Style station was built in 1890. It is a -story, hip-roofed rectangular brick building with two brick wings and a bell tower. Constructed of red brick with sandstone trim and sandstone <b>lintels</b> and sills on the windows, the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction. The fire station was closed as a firehouse in 1974, when the current Fire Station Number 4 on Cottage Street opened. The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and meeting rooms {{by the time of}} its listing on the national register. In 2014, the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window <b>lintels</b> were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lintel</b> 16 also spanned {{a doorway}} in Structure 21 and was removed to the British Museum in 1982-3. It was sculpted from {{limestone}} and was originally set above the central {{doorway of the}} central room. It shows Bird Jaguar IV holding a spear and standing over a kneeling captive. Bird Jaguar IV wears the same costume that his father is depicted wearing on <b>Lintel</b> 26. The capture event depicted on <b>Lintel</b> 16 took place in 752.|$|R
5000|$|There was a second, smaller synagogue, {{but little}} of it was found. A <b>lintel</b> from this smaller synagogue is at the Louvre. The Hebrew {{inscription}} on the <b>lintel</b> reads, [...] "Peace be upon the place, and on all the places of Israel." ...|$|R
50|$|There seem to {{have been}} three entrances in this {{perimeter}} wall, which is about 350m long. The main gateway through the outer wall is at the southeast and consists of two vertical boulders with a third balanced on them as a <b>lintel.</b> It opens into a passageway 4.3m long with stairs to either side. There is another similarly-sized entrance to the northeast, though its <b>lintel</b> has disappeared. The southwest gateway, which gave access to a nearby spring, also has no <b>lintel,</b> and is less obvious.|$|R
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, <b>lintels</b> (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E
5|$|Woodlea is {{constructed}} of buff-colored pressed Italian brick with pale limestone trim. It is three stories tall, seven bays wide, {{and more than}} fourteen bays deep. The south and west facades are both symmetrical, although the house has an asymmetrical overall plan. The house has pedimented pavilions and entrance porticos on the west, south, and east; window trim consisting of stone surrounds, pediments, <b>lintels,</b> and sills; classical balusters and quoins. The house's third story is separated visually by a stone string course and is topped with a modillioned cornice. From a shallow hipped roof rise brick chimneys that are trimmed and capped with stone. The pavilion pediments have decorative urn-shaped elements. The house's windows are primarily rectangular, double hung, one-over-one panel style, except for a large triple Palladian window, which has stained glass and is situated midway up the house's main staircase, illuminating its lower steps. The house has distinctive quoins, pediments, and classical balustrades of pale gray limestone.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in more stable walls that could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, <b>lintels</b> and arching. At the same time there was increasing influence from English and continental European designs, known as Romanesque. The Romanesque style had its origins in Roman building techniques and early churches in the Byzantine Empire and Italy and was characterised by massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded barrel vault roofs. The introduction of this style to Scotland is associated with the ecclesiastical reforms that began in the reign of Máel Coluim III (r. 1058–93), bringing continental ideas of monasticism and church organisation to the country. The oldest Romanesque church in Scotland is probably the small chapel built for Máel Coluim's wife Margaret on Castle Rock, Edinburgh, with a vaulted semi-circular apse. In the twelfth century a number of new parish churches were built by lords on their land. They were often small aisless buildings with two or three connected cells, each of diminishing size, ending in a rounded apse. One of the best preserved is at Dalmeny in Lothian.|$|E
