In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes {{placed in the}} top half of their events before 1976, while the vast {{majority}} placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.|$|E

5|$|An intense {{propaganda}} campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of {{the leaders}} of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays modern {{societies}} {{are to be}} more competitive and include more non-intact families and living difficulties due to employment and social deprivations. Adolescents may suffer from depressive mood (DM) which is common and multi-factorial. This study assessed, among boys and girls, the causal relationships between DM and parent education, nationality, occupation, income, divorce/separation, and death, repeating a school-year, lifetime alcohol/tobacco/cannabis/other drugs uses, victim of violence and sexual abuse, involvement in violence, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> social <b>supports</b> (family members/friends). Methods: 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (mean age 13. 5, SD 1. 3) completed in class a questionnaire including DM (Kandel scale), factors studied, and their occurring/persisting period. Data were analyzed using Cox models taking into account risk factors which came before and persisted until DM occurring. Findings: Lifetime-DM affected 7. 6 % of boys and 19. 1 % of girls. Among girls factors with significant crude hazard ratios (HR) were: parent divorce/separation (1. 57), insufficient income (1. 95), repeating a school-year (1. 95), victim of violence (2. 99) or sexual abuse (4. 96), and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> (4. 08 for score 1 - 2 and 7. 74 for score 3 +, vs. score 0) while tobacco use was close to significance (1. 77). Taking all factors into account retained only repeating a school-year (adjusted HR 1. 87), victim of violence (2. 50) or sexual abuse (4. 02), and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> (3. 83 and 7. 28). Among boys, the significant factors were: hard-drug use (6. 01), victim of violence (2. 88), and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> (2. 27 and 4. 78) while insufficient income (1. 75), low parent education (1. 60), and victim of sexual abuse (3. 58) were close to significance. Full model retained only victim of violence (adjusted HR 2. 29) and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> (2. 16 and 4. 18). Conclusion: Taking chronology in consideration revealed strong gender disparities for DM and its associations with family characteristics, school difficulties, unhealthy behaviours, violence, and social supports that may be prevention targets...|$|R
5|$|GreenSky London, a {{biofuels}} plant {{under construction}} in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road.

Although the Wallachians emerged victorious from the battle, Michael was forced to retreat with his troops and wait for aid from his allies, Prince Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The war continued until a peace finally emerged in January 1597, but this lasted for only a year and a half.

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} why working mothers choose to not exclusively breast feed their infants in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. Methods : The study used a qualitative design with a phenomenological approach. Data collection in this study involved focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. In-depth interviews with 9 working women not exclusively breastfeeding. Focus group discussions two comprising of 21 respondents were husbands, in-laws, mother’s family, healthcare provider, workplace representatives, religious and community leaders. Result : Study findings indicated that the primary reason for working women to not exclusively breastfeed, because <b>of</b> a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> individual motivation, pressures of a high workload, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> permitted time off, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure and concerns about losing employment due to time off. Obstacles included fear of losing employment, maternal physical factors (low/no milk production), psychological factors (stress/anxiety/frustration), <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> facilities and <b>supporting</b> infrastructure. Conclusion : The predominant reasons behind non-exclusive breastfeeding were <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> personal motivation, high workload, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> permitted time off, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> infrastructure and fear of losing employment. The external obstacles for providing exclusive breastfeeding were economic factors, the mother’s ability to produce milk, psychological factors, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> infrastructure.
