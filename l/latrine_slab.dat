2500|$|Access {{to water}} supply and {{sanitation}} in Georgia is high. Based on household surveys and census results, the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation estimates that access to an improved water source was universal in 2015. Access to improved sanitation stood at 86% (95% in urban areas, 76% in rural areas). According to these estimates based on census and household survey data access to water improved from 96% in 1990 to 100% in 2010, while access to sanitation declined from 98% in 1990 to 86% in 2015. The decline in access to sanitation was most marked in rural areas, where it declined from 96% estimated during a survey in 1996 to 79% estimated through a survey in 2013. The definition of improved sanitation includes pit <b>latrines</b> with <b>slabs,</b> while it excludes pit <b>latrines</b> without <b>slabs.</b> [...] It is often difficult for surveyors conducting general household surveys to get reliable responses to the question that refers to the exact type of latrine in a house, so that the above access numbers should be treated with some caution.|$|R
25|$|Access to safe {{drinking}} water is indicated by safe water sources. These improved drinking water sources include household connection, public standpipe, borehole condition, protected dug well, protected spring, and rain water collection. Sources that do not encourage improved drinking water {{to the same extent}} as previously mentioned include: unprotected wells, unprotected springs, rivers or ponds, vender-provided water, bottled water (consequential of limitations in quantity, not quality of water), and tanker truck water. Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved sanitation facilities for excreta, such as connection to public sewer, connection to septic system, or a pit <b>latrine</b> with a <b>slab</b> or water seal.|$|R
2500|$|In some {{circumstances}} [...] "improved" [...] sanitation facilities {{can be regarded}} as not sustainable, whereas in other circumstances [...] "unimproved" [...] sanitation facilities {{can be regarded as}} sustainable. This is because it depends on the sanitation system, of which the toilet is only one part. For example, a pit <b>latrine</b> with a <b>slab</b> can become unsustainable sanitation if it is polluting the groundwater or if the faecal sludge that is removed from the pit latrine is dumped into the environment. A bucket toilet can become sustainable if the collection, treatment and reuse or disposal of excreta is taken care of in a safe manner, for example with the urine-diverting dry toilets that SOIL is employing in Haiti.|$|R
40|$|The {{data from}} the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) provide {{important}} information about living conditions in Cambodia and have {{a wide range of}} use. Results from CSES are used for monitoring the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) and progress towards the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDG). Drinking water and sanitation also part of CMDG. Furthermore, the data from CSES are used for developing poverty lines and calculating poverty rates. A lack of improved drinking water and poor sanitation are major problems in Cambodia after the civil war conflict destroyed much of Cambodia’s water supply infrastructure and sanitation systems. By 1990, only about 30 percent of rural residents had access to improved drinking water and about 5 percent of rural residents had access to improved sanitation. The efforts of the Royal Government of Cambodia with the support from development partners to address the challenges of unimproved drinking water and unimproved sanitation that affect to the Cambodian population health has been much improved. Investments since the mid- 1990 s have helped provide cleaner water supplies and improved sanitation for many in Cambodia. In year 2011 about 50 percent of the Cambodian people now gets its water from improved drinking water sources like piped in dwelling or on premises, public tap, tube/piped well or borehole, protected dug well and improved rainwater collection and about 44 percent of Cambodian people using improved sanitation facilities like pour flush/flush connected to sewerage, pour flush/flush connected to septic tank and pit <b>latrine</b> with <b>slab...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a mixed-methods study examining adaptation strategies that property owners in low-income, rapidly urbanizing areas in Malawi adopt to address the limitations of pit latrines, the most common method of disposing human excreta. A particular challenge is lack of space for constructing new latrines as population density increases: traditional practice has been to cap full pits and simply move to a new site, but increasing demands on space require new approaches to extend the service life of latrines. In this context, we collected data on sanitation technology choices from January to September 2013 through 48 in-depth interviews and a stated preference survey targeting 1, 300 property owners from 27 low-income urban areas. Results showed that property owners with concern about space for replacing pit latrines were 1. 8 times more likely to select pit emptying service over the construction of new pit <b>latrines</b> with a <b>slab</b> floor (p = 0. 02) but there was no significant association between concern about space for replacing pit latrines and intention to adopt locally promoted, novel sanitation technology known as ecological sanitation (ecosan). Property owners preferred to adapt existing, known technology by constructing replacement pit latrines on old pit latrine locations, reducing the frequency of replacing pit latrines, or via emptying pit latrines when full. This study highlights potential challenges to adoption of wholly new sanitation technologies, even when they present clear advantages to end users. To scale, alternative sanitation technologies for rapidly urbanising cities should offer clear advantages, be affordable, be easy to use when shared among multiple households, and their design should be informed by existing adaptation strategies and local knowledge...|$|R
