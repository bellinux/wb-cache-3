40|$|The human {{cerebral}} cortex {{is characterized by}} a number of features that are not uniformly distributed, such as the presence of multiple cytoarchitectonic elements and of myelinated layers running tangentially to the cortex surface. The presence and absence of these features are the basis of the parcellation of the {{cerebral cortex}} in several areas. A number of areas show myelin increases localized within the cortex, e. g. the stria of Gennari located in layer IV of the primary visual cortex. Sub-millimeter MRI can resolve myelin variations across the human cortex and may allow in vivo parcellation of these brain areas. Here, we image within-area myelination. We modified a T 1 -weighted (T 1 -w) MPRAGE sequence, to enhance myelin visualization within the cortex. First, we acquired images from an ex vivo sample, and compared MRI <b>laminar</b> <b>profiles</b> from calcarine (corresponding to primary visual cortex) and extra-calcarine areas with histology sections from the same locations. <b>Laminar</b> <b>profiles</b> between myelin stained sections and the T 1 -w images were similar both in calcarine as well as extra-calcarine cortex. In calcarine cortex, the profile reveals the stria of Gennari. In extra-calcarine cortex, a similar profile exists which we suggest corresponds to the lines of Baillarger. Next, we adapted the same sequence to image within-area myelination in vivo. Also in in vivo data we discriminated similar <b>laminar</b> <b>profiles</b> in calcarine and extra-calcarine cortex, extending into parietal and frontal lobes.

40|$|Deciphering the {{direction}} of information flow is critical to understand the brain. Data from non-human primate histology shows that connections between lower to higher areas (e. g. retina→V 1), and between higher to lower areas (e. g. V 1 ←V 2) can be dissociated based upon the distribution of afferent synapses at the laminar level. Ultra-high field scanners opened up the possibility to image brain structure and function at an unprecedented level of detail. Taking advantage of the increased spatial resolution available, it could theoretically be possible to disentangle activity from different cortical depths from human cerebral cortex, separately studying different compartments across depth. Here we use half-millimeter human functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, MRI) to derive <b>laminar</b> <b>profiles</b> in early visual cortex using a paradigm known to elicit two separate responses originating from an excitatory and a suppressive source, avoiding any contamination due to blood-stealing.

40|$|Turbulent-laminar banded {{patterns}} in plane Poiseuille flow are studied via direct numerical simulations in a tilted and translating computational domain using a parallel {{version of the}} pseudospectral code Channelflow. 3 D visualizations via the streamwise vorticity of an instantaneous and a time-averaged pattern are presented, as well as 2 D visualizations of the average velocity field and the turbulent kinetic energy. Simulations for Reynolds numbers descending from 2300 to 700 show the gradual development from uniform turbulence to a pattern with wavelength 20 half-gaps near Re= 1900, to a pattern with wavelength 40 near Re= 1300 and finally to laminar flow near Re= 800. These transitions are tracked quantitatively via diagnostics using the amplitude and phase of the Fourier transform and its probability distribution. The propagation velocity of the pattern is approximately that of the mean flux and is a decreasing function of Reynolds number. Examination of the time-averaged flow shows that a turbulent band is associated with two counter-rotating cells stacked in the cross-channel direction and that the turbulence is highly concentrated near the walls. Near the walls, the Reynolds stress force accelerates the fluid through a turbulent band while viscosity decelerates it; advection by the <b>laminar</b> <b>profile</b> acts in both directions. In the center, the Reynolds stress force decelerates the fluid through a turbulent band while advection by the <b>laminar</b> <b>profile</b> accelerates it.

40|$|The {{orthogonal}} polarisation spectral (OPS) imaging technique {{is a method}} that enables intravital microscopy of the tissue microvasculature particularly including the erythrocytes and leucocytes. As a new finding we here report multi flow, i. e, several different <b>laminar</b> velocity <b>profiles</b> in each and separate veins (diameters < 200 μm) of the microcirculation of the rat brain cortex. The phenomenon was present in all 20 preparations studied and these different <b>laminar</b> velocity <b>profiles</b> were regularly maintained in length beyond 20 times the diameter of parent vessel. In single veins up to 9 different <b>laminar</b> velocity <b>profiles</b> were discernible, each with a different red blood cell velocity.

40|$|Multielectrode array {{recordings}} of extracellular electrical field potentials along the depth {{axis of the}} cerebral cortex are gaining popularity as an approach for investigating the activity of cortical neuronal circuits. The low-frequency band of extracellular potential, i. e., the local field potential (LFP), is assumed to reflect synaptic activity {{and can be used}} to extract the laminar current source density (CSD) profile. However, physiological interpretation of the CSD profile is uncertain because it does not disambiguate synaptic inputs from passive return currents and does not identify population-specific contributions to the signal. These limitations prevent interpretation of the CSD in terms of synaptic functional connectivity in the columnar microcircuit. Here we present a novel anatomically informed model for decomposing the LFP signal into population-specific contributions and for estimating the corresponding activated synaptic projections. This involves a linear forward model, which predicts the population-specific laminar LFP in response to synaptic inputs applied at different positions along each population and a linear inverse model, which reconstructs <b>laminar</b> <b>profiles</b> of synaptic inputs from laminar LFP data based on the forward model. Assuming spatially smooth synaptic inputs within individual populations, the model decomposes the columnar LFP into population-specific contributions and estimates the corresponding <b>laminar</b> <b>profiles</b> of synaptic input as a function of time. It should be noted that constant synaptic currents at all positions along a neuronal population cannot be reconstructed, as this does not result in a change in extracellular potential. However, constraining the solution using a priori knowledge of the spatial distribution of synaptic connectivity provides the further advantage of estimating the strength of active synaptic projections from the columnar LFP profile thus fully specifying synaptic inputs...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in ultra high field MRI and receiver coil technology {{have opened up}} the possibility of laminar fMRI in humans. This could offer greater insight into human brain function by elucidating both the interaction between brain regions {{on the basis of}} laminar activation patterns associated with input and output, and the interactions between laminae in a specific region. We used very high isotropic spatial resolution (0. 75 mm voxel size), multi-echo acquisition (gradient-echo) in a 7 T fMRI study of human primary visual cortex (V 1) and novel data analysis techniques to quantitatively investigate the echo time dependence of <b>laminar</b> <b>profiles,</b> <b>laminar</b> activation, and physiological noise distributions over an extended region of cortex. We found T(2) * profiles to be explicable in terms of variations in myelin content. <b>Laminar</b> activation <b>profiles</b> vary with echo time (TE) : at short TE the highest signal changes are measured at the pial surface; this maximum shifts into grey matter at longer TEs. The top layers peak latest as these have the longest transverse relaxation time. Theoretical simulations and experiment suggest that the intravascular contribution to functional signal changes is significant even at long TE. Based on a temporal noise analysis we argue that the (physiological) noise contributions will ameliorate differences in sensitivity between the layers in a statistical analysis, and correlates with laminar blood volume distribution. We also show that even at this high spatial resolution the physiological noise limit to sensitivity is reached within V 1, implying that cortical sub-regions can be examined with this technique...|$|R
