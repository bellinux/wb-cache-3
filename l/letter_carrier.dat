In 1861, at the age of 15, he went to work in a local post office, owned by Henry Cockcroft, who also ran a printing business. Despite his injury, he learned to be a typesetter.

25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of letter carriers. Previously, the delivery of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and collection of mail from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position of a mail service courier, while letter carriers delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering parcels, mail, clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and collection of mail from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased overtime, work stress, and injuries to employees who are facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|E
25|$|Richard Carpenter {{began working}} as a <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> for Canada Post in 1974 and still held this {{position}} into the 2000s. He served on the Brantford Public Utilities Commission from 1991 to 1994 and was its chair in 1993. Carpenter was first elected to the Brantford city council in the 1994 municipal election and was re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2010, finishing {{at the head of}} the polls each time. In his time in office, he has developed a reputation as both a strong constituency worker and a combative politician. In 1996, he spearheaded a motion to rename a municipal parkway after legendary ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky, who was born in Brantford. He warned against a shift to private utility ownership in 2001, after the city quietly eliminated the Brantford Hydro-Electric Commission; later, he welcomed a court decision that prevented the government of Ontario from selling a part of Ontario Hydro. In 2002, he supported Marguerite Ceschi-Smith's campaign to restore municipal brownfield space. He introduced a motion in 2003 that would have required the municipal government to hold a referendum before raising taxes; the motion was defeated. Carpenter considered seeking the Ontario Liberal Party nomination for Brant in the 1999 provincial election, but ultimately did not do so. He sought the Liberal Party of Canada nomination for the federal Brant division in the 2004 election, but lost to Lloyd St. Amand.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Davis was {{commissioned}} by the United States Postal Service to design the 25-cent <b>Letter</b> <b>Carriers</b> stamp. There was some concern that the cartoon would offend some <b>letter</b> <b>carriers</b> as being too informal and not respectful of their position. However, {{the president of the}} <b>Letter</b> <b>Carriers</b> Union gave his blessing, and the stamp was well received. Although postal policy does not allow artists to portray living persons on stamps, one of the carriers in the stamp is an unmistakable self-portrait of Davis.|$|R

[...] In {{the course of the}} escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face. Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back. On August 11, a <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, [...] "Here's the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital.

500|$|The American team {{consisted}} of semi-professional players, {{most of whom}} had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr {{was a high school}} teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral home and others worked as <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> or dishwashers. One player, Ben McLaughlin, had to withdraw from the tournament because he could not get time off work. The team had also been hastily assembled, and had only been able to train together once, and that was the day before they left for Brazil, which happened to be against the touring English team featuring Matthews (Matthews did not play in that game, as he was injured.) Three players—Joe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens, none of whom were U.S. citizens—had been added to the roster just before that game. [...] "We have no chance," [...] recently appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press; he also declared his players [...] "sheep ready to be slaughtered". The English Daily Express newspaper wrote: [...] "It would be fair to give the U.S. three goals of a start." ...|$|E
