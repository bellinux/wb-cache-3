The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used.

5000|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs. Some <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> indicators, located either as a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad material or with an external [...] "sensor", are also designed to squeal when the lining is due for replacement.

40|$|The present master thesis {{focuses on}} the study of brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> calculation. This brake system {{regulation}} function is worldwide only provided in passenger cars of the BMW Group. It calculates continually the wear of brake linings and displays to the driver the kilometre availability, as part of the Conditioned Based Service. The task assignment consists in the analysis and improvement of the current brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> monitoring function that is used by BMW. First of all, the preliminary required task would be to understand and analyse the current status of the brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> calculation. For that purpose, {{it will be necessary to}} build up a simulation environment, in which the calculation algorithm could be tested. The virtual calculation results can be compared with available experimental data from brake test bench and vehicle tests. Furthermore, in order to understand wear process, a study of all possible influence variables on the brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> will be required. The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings. Then, a method has to be developed to find out possible empirical equations of wear that fit the characteristic diagram obtained on the brake test bench. Finally, the models obtained must be tested and validated with real test bench wear measurements...|$|E

Ensuring good condition of brake lining is very crucial to ensure the efficiency of the braking system, where, the worn off brake lining not only endangers life but also damages the entire brake associated parts such as hub, disk, shaft, etc. In this paper, Malaysian made luxury car Proton Perdana V 6 brake pads were investigated to be embedded with a <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> limit alert system. The current spring steel alert system has some drawbacks where, the alerting sound is only activated while the car moves and secondly, when the car is on move, rarely the alerting sound reaches the driver. Therefore, a critical investigation of the existing pads manufactured in Malaysia and their characterizations are conducted to identify the most suitable sensor spot on the brake pad. Later, a micro sensor is embedded into the pad and fully tested on a specially designed test rig. The evaluation of thickness, hardness, layer properties and critical wear region has enabled the spotting of exact sensor location. The embedment of the micro switch was successfully done and tested to be very efficient in alerting the driver upon reaching the maximum <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> limit.

40|$|In most motor {{vehicles}} {{the transfer of}} torque from engine to the transmission is done through friction clutch. The process of clutch engagement is characterized with intensive sliding between the friction surfaces until angular speeds of the drive and the driven parts become equal. Friction lining lifetime significantly depends on operating conditions which are expressed through total cumulative sliding work {{as a result of}} clutch engagement number in certain traffic and exploitation conditions. From obvious reasons (time, cost, durability, etc.) constantly, it is endeavored most of the tests to be carried out in laboratory conditions. Although laboratory test methodologies are continually improved and in certain cases even standardized, structure differences in the individual clutches especially related friction material composition, leave this issue constantly opened. Starting from the statement above, the aim of the research is to show the process of establishing interdependence of friction <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> and number of clutch engagement in exploitation and laboratory conditions. Taking laboratory testing advantages, the aim is also to develop such procedures which can be the basis for forecasting its lifetime. ...|$|E
40|$|Particulate matter emitted to the {{atmosphere}} due to motor vehicles arises from several sources in addition to tailpipe exhaust. In this study, the organic constituents present in fine particulate (d_p ≤ 2. 0 µm) road dust, brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> particles, and tire tread debris (not size segregated) are analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The objective is to characterize such traffic-related sources on an organic compound basis and to search for molecular markers that will assist the identification of traffic-associated dusts in the urban atmosphere. More than 100 organic compounds are quantified in these samples, including n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids, n-alkanals, n-alkanols, benzoic acids, benzaldehydes, polyalkylene glycol ethers, PAH, oxy-PAH, steranes, hopanes, natural resins and other compound classes. Paved road dust acts as a repository for vehicle-related particles, which can then be resuspended by the passing traffic. To evaluate the contributions from major urban sources to the road dust complex, source profiles representing different types of vehicle exhaust, brake dust, tire debris, and vegetative detritus are compared, and their fractional contributions are estimated using several groups of organic tracer compounds. Likewise, the close relationship between airborne fine particulate organic constituents and road dust organic matter is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ freeze lining concept {{combines}} wall cooling {{with carbon}} and graphite refrac-tories of higher thermal conductivities to “chill ” the refractory lining by transferring {{heat from the}} refractory lining. Effective sidewall water cooling, together with {{the efficiency of the}} heat dissipating conductive refrac-tories, lowers the temperature of the lining to below that of the molten process materials. This causes a layer of slag and process metal to solidify or “freeze ” and form a protective “skull ” which completely coats the refractory hot face. Once formed, the slag skull insulates the refractories, reducing heat loss and protect the lining from erosion, chemical attack, thermal shock, and other stresses. The result: extended life and greatly improved refractory performance. The Ilmenite smelting process depends on the presence of a solidified slag skull to protect sidewall refrac-tory material from chemical attach by molten slag. No known refractory material is able to withstand this corrosive material. To date, UCAR has not applied their Chill Kote ™ technology in the ilmenite smelting industry. This paper revolves around the results obtained from conducting an ilmenite smelting campaign on a 500 kW DC open-arc furnace with a UCAR designed refractory system. The purpose of this test was to es-tablish the effects such a lining has on refractory wear and the reduction-smelting process. Proper thermo-couple management enabled the authors to monitor <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> {{for the duration of the}} campaign. Prior to the pilot-scale campaign, modeling work was completed to evaluate the feasibility of applying UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ technology to ilmenite smelting furnaces.

40|$|Paved road dust {{present on}} the surface of streets in Southern California {{consists}} of a complex mixture of soil dust, deposited motor vehicle exhaust particles, tire dust, brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> dust, plant fragments, and other biological materials. The research presented here shows that allergens from at least 20 different source materials are found in the paved road dust. These include pollens and pollen fragments, animal dander, and molds. When paved road dust is resuspended into the atmosphere by passing vehicle traffic, allergen concentrations in the air are increased above the levels that would prevail without the vehicle traffic. Using immunological assays that measure the proteins extracted from environmental samples that bind to IgE antibodies present in the blood serum of allergenic patients, it is possible to measure the allergen concentrations present in paved road dust and in airborne particle samples. Total protein contributions to monthly average airborne TSP and PM_(10) concentrations are found to be in the range from 1 to 5. 8 μg m^(- 3), potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the airborne particulate organic material that has not been identified to date by GC/MS techniques. Results show that up to 5 − 12 % of the allergenicity of atmospheric total suspended particulate matter samples at Long Beach and Rubidoux, CA, is attributable to paved road dust emissions. In an industrial area of urban central Los Angeles where there is less proximity to vegetation and domestic activities, the paved road dust contribution to airborne allergen concentrations is lower, accounting for approximately 0. 5 % of the total allergenic activity of the atmospheric particle samples. In conclusion, paved road dust when entrained into the atmosphere by passing traffic is a source of allergen exposure for the general population and could be more important in areas with more abundant vegetation or with closer proximity of populations to major highways than is the case for the Southern California air monitoring sites studied here...|$|E

40|$|The {{sources of}} ambient organic {{particulate}} matter {{in urban areas}} are investigated through a program of emission source measurements, atmospheric measurements, and mathematical modeling of source/receptor relationships. A dilution sampler intended to collect fine organic aerosol from combustion sources {{is designed to simulate}} atmospheric cooling and dilution processes, so that organic vapors which condense under ambient conditions will be collected as particulate matter. This system is used to measure the emissions from a boiler burning distillate oil, a home fireplace, catalyst and noncatalyst automobiles, heavy-duty diesel trucks, natural gas home appliances, and meat cooking operations. Alternate techniques are used to sample the particulate matter emitted from cigarette smoking, a roofing tar pot, paved road dust, brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear,</b> tire wear, and vegetative detritus. The bulk chemical characteristics of the fine aerosol fraction are presented for each source. Over half of the fine aerosol mass emitted from automobiles, wood burning, meat cooking, home appliances, cigarettes, and tar pots is shown to consist of organic compounds. The organic material collected from these sources is analyzed using high-resolution gas chromatography. Using a simple analytical protocol, a quantitative, 50 -parameter characterization of the elutable fine organic aerosol emitted from each source type is obtained, which proves to be a unique fingerprint {{that can be used to}} distinguish most sources from each other. A mathematical model is used to predict the characteristics of fine ambient organic aerosol in the Los Angeles area that would prevail if the primary organic emissions are transported without chemical reaction. The model is found to track the seasonal variations observed in the ambient aerosol at the three sites studied. Emissions from vehicles and fireplaces are identified as significant sources of solvent-extractable organic aerosol. Differences between the model predictions and ambient concentrations that could be due to atmospheric chemical reaction are discussed. An upper limit on the amount of secondary organic aerosol present is estimated based on the difference between the acidic organic aerosol present in ambient samples versus that due to primary emissions as computed by the model. Finally, several hypotheses concerning the origin of the acidic organic aerosol are proposed...|$|E
