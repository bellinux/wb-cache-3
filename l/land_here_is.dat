25|$|Normanby is {{the name}} of the {{northern}} end of North East Valley, at which point Dunedin's urban area gives way to open countryside. The <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> steeply sloping, as it is the foothills of Mount Cargill. The slopes of Mount Cargill itself are densely wooded, and are crisscrossed with walking tracks, some of which start at the Bethune's Gully reserve, at the northern end of Normanby. Chingford Park, at the Normanby end of the valley is now a sports field and recreational reserve, but was originally the residence of one of Sam Neill's forebears, who was founder of Dunedin Company Wilson Neill. The large house is now gone, but the stone stables still on the site are impressive.|$|E
25|$|Areas {{along and}} west of the south fork of Beargrass Creek (and more generally, I-65) are located where the Ohio River once ran, so the <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> very flat and is {{composed}} of harder rocks. Prior to urbanization much of this area was composed of wetlands, and early roads through these were made of wooden planks. This history is occasionally still readily evident in street names, for example the spoke road Poplar Level, whose name describes its original construction on planks of poplar. 3rd Street was formerly called Central Plank Road for the same reason. As industry, namely Standiford Field airport, moved into {{the area in the}} 1950s most creeks through the area were rerouted into ditches to alleviate the area's poor drainage and constant flooding.|$|E

The <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> of a very rugged plateau type which allows streams to gather sufficient water volume before they fall off the plateau and create challenging rapids. Some {{of the best known}} specific stream locations for this include: ...|$|E

In the island of Panay, the natives declare that no {{one of them had}} ever been afflicted with buboes until the people from Bohol - who, as we said above, abandoned Bohol on account of the people of Maluco - came to settle in Panay, and gave the disease to some of the natives. For these reasons the governor, Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, founded the town of Arevalo, {{on the south side of}} this island; for the island runs north and south, and on that side live the majority of the people, and the villages are near this town, and the <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> more fertile." ...|$|E

25|$|Conversion of {{the area}} into a {{municipality}} helped greatly in getting water, pavement, sewer and streetlights in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the sale of <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> legally complicated due to problems in land title. This began to be regulated in the mid-1970s and would continue through the 1980s and into part of the 1990s.|$|R

60|$|We {{have shown}} briefly {{one of the}} many phases of tyrannical cruelty practised by the conquerors of the <b>land.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> another specimen. At first there were few merchants in Peru, {{therefore}} privilege was granted to the Spanish corregidors, or governors of districts, to import goods suitable for Indians, and barter them at a fair price. Of course this permission was abused, and trade became a compulsory and disgraceful traffic. Useless and worthless articles and damaged goods--razors, for instance, silk stockings, velvets, etcetera--were forced on Indians who preferred naked feet and had no beards.|$|E
60|$|The dominions of the Czar {{extended}} then, as now, {{through all}} the northern portions of Europe and Asia, to {{the shores of the}} Icy Sea. A very important part of this region is the famous Siberia. The <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> not of much value for cultivation, on account of the long and dreary winters and the consequent shortness of the summer season. But this very coldness of the climate causes it to produce a great number of fine fur-bearing animals, such as the sable, the mink, the ermine, and the otter; for nature has so arranged it that, the colder any climate is, the finer and the warmer is the fur which grows upon the animals that live there.|$|E
50|$|Chathamattom is a {{place of}} {{historical}} importance. The ordnance factory of the ancient kingdom (Thrikkariyoor-the oldest capital of Chera Dynasty) <b>was</b> situated <b>here.</b> At that time Chathamattom was known as Shasthavumattom.

50|$|The site of St Mary's {{has been}} the centre of worship {{for people in the}} area for over 1,000 years, and a church was built in about 930 AD by King Athelstan as an act of thanksgiving for victory over the Danes. The <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> owned by the king in Saxon and early Norman times and the church was very richly endowed.|$|R

60|$|The {{manner in}} which fishes are enabled to migrate from lake to lake is unknown, but many {{suggestions}} have been made. It {{is a fact that}} whirlwinds and waterspouts sometimes carry living fish in considerable numbers and drop them on the <b>land.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> one mode which might certainly have acted now and then in the course of thousands of years, and the eggs of fishes may have been carried with even greater ease. Again we may well suppose that some of these fish have once inhabited the streams that enter or flow out of the lakes as well as the lakes themselves; and this opens a wide field for conjecture as to modes of migration, because we know that rivers have sometimes changed their courses to such an extent as to form a union with distinct river basins. This has been effected either by floods rising over low watersheds, by elevations of the land changing lines of drainage, or by ice blocking up valleys and compelling the streams to flow over watersheds to find an outlet. This is known to have occurred during the glacial epoch, and is especially manifest {{in the case of the}} Parallel Roads of Glenroy, and it probably affords the true solution of many of the cases in which existing species of fish inhabit distinct river basins whether in streams or lakes. If a fish thus wandered out of one river-basin into another, it might then retire up the streams to some of the lakes, where alone it might find conditions favourable to it. By a combination of the modes of migration here indicated it is not difficult to understand how so many species are now common to the lakes of Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland, while others less able to adapt themselves to different conditions have survived only in one or two lakes in a single district; or these last may have been originally identical with other forms, but have become modified by the particular conditions of the lake in which they have found themselves isolated.|$|E

[...] By 950, there was a Benedictine priory at West Mersea and <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> granted to the Abbey of St Ouen in France by Edward the Confessor in 1046.

50|$|During the mid-1800s, Garryowen was a {{thriving}} farming community. Wheat, potatoes, pork, {{as well as}} maple sugar and syrup were the main commodities. Several farms also raised sheep or had orchards. Many residents opened quarries as the <b>land</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> shallow and limestone was abundant.
