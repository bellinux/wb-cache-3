40|$|Abstract. A direct {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} radiative transfer equation is typically expensive, since the radiative intensity depends on time, space and direction. An expansion in the direction variables yields an equivalent system of infinitely many moments. A fundamental problem is how to truncate the system.

We formulate the method of optimal prediction, a strategy to approximate the mean solution of a large system by a smaller system, for radiation moment systems. To that end, the formalism is generalized to systems of partial differential equations. Using Gaussian measures, we re-derive <b>linear</b> <b>closures,</b> such as PN, diffusion, and diffusion correction closures. In addition, we propose a modification to existing closures.

40|$|Objective: The {{repair of}} dilated ear lobules after gauge ear {{piercing}} is increasingly performed {{to restore the}} natural ear appearance and shape for esthetic, professional, or social reasons. Because of a deficit of remaining lobule tissue, reconstruction of this area can be challenging. Many have described the repair of partial cleft ear lobule defects, but few focus on the repair of dilated ear lobules. The authors review the methods of repair described in the literature and propose a new technique. Methods: A double opposing perpendicular <b>linear</b> <b>closure</b> was used to repair dilated ear lobules. A <b>linear</b> <b>closure</b> is made on the anterior aspect of the circular lobular defect followed by a <b>linear</b> <b>closure</b> on the posterior aspect oriented 90 degrees {{to that of the}} anterior surface. Results: This method produces an esthetically pleasing result with a rounded, natural appearance. Perpendicular repair lines prevent the dog-ear deformity that may be noticed on the lobule with a single <b>linear</b> <b>closure.</b> Preserving the outer remnant of ear lobule prevents notching seen when this area is violated.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present two new {{closures}} for the spherical harmonics (PN) method in slab geometry transport problems. Our approach {{begins with an}} analysis of the squared-residual of the transport equation where we show that the standard truncation and diffusive closures do not minimize the residual of the PN expansion. Based on this analysis we derive two models, a moment-limited diffusive MLDN closure and a transient PN (TPN) closure that attempt to address shortcomings of common closures. The form of these closures is similar to flux-limiters for diffusion {{with the addition of a}} time-derivative in the definition of the closure. Numerical results on a pulsed plane source problem, the Gordian knot of slab-geometry transport problems, indicate that our new <b>closure</b> outperforms existing <b>linear</b> <b>closures.</b> Additionally, on a deep penetration problem we demonstrate that the TPN closure does not suffer from the artificial shocks that can arise in the MN entropy-based closure.

These ingredients are a constitutive law for sea-ice stress, relating stress {{to the material}} properties of sea ice and to internal variables describing the sea-ice state, and equations describing the evolution of these variables. The sea-ice cover is treated as a densely flawed two-dimensional continuum consisting of a uniform field of thick ice that is uniformly permeated with narrow linear regions of thinner ice called leads. Lead orientation, thickness and width distributions are described by second-rank tensor internal variables: the structure, thickness and width tensors, whose dynamics are governed by corresponding evolution equations accounting for processes such as new lead generation and rotation as the ice cover deforms. These evolution equations contain contractions of higher-order tensor expressions that require closures.

When the <b>linear</b> <b>closure</b> is used, a sufficient condition for consistency is that the particle number Np satisﬁes Np ≤ 35 / 2.

The model reads as a quasi-linear first order hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) {{and in order to}} incorporate initial and boundary data the PDE is treated as an initial boundary value problem (IBVP). The derivation of a first order explicit finite difference scheme of the IBVP for two-point boundary condition is presented which is analogous to the well known Lax-Friedrichs scheme. The Lax-Friedrichs scheme for our model is not straight-forward to implement and one needs to employ a simultaneous physical constraint and stability condition. Therefore, a mathematical analysis is presented in order to establish the physical constraint and stability condition of the scheme. The finite difference scheme is implemented and the graphical presentation of numerical features of error estimation and rate of convergence is produced. Numerical simulation results verify some well understood qualitative behavior of traffic flow. 1...|$|R

Stapler {{application}} for pharyngeal closure after total laryngectomy allows for rapid watertight closure without field contamination and for potentially reduced fistula rate. Methods. One thousand four hundred fifteen patients under-went laryngectomy with <b>linear</b> stapler <b>closure.</b> In 98. 6 %, laryn-gectomy was performed after radiation failure. Results. A relatively {{high incidence of}} pharyngeal fistulae (12 %) was seen, although these rates were reduced to 5. 5 % during the recent decade.

The advantages of mechanical sutures with the closed stapling technique are simple and rapid application, watertight closure with good hemostasis, prevention of field contamination, good speech and deglutition, no increase in fistula rate, and low local recurrence rates.

40|$|An {{analysis}} for the linear stability of fiber suspensions in the Taylor–Couette flow is conducted. The orientation state of fibers is determined using the linear, quadratic and composite HL-I closure model and {{the model of the}} fiber contribution to the total stress is established based on the slender-body theory. The linear stability equation is derived and solved with the Chebyshev spectral method. The results show that the suppression effect is most predominant for the composite HL-I model, while least predominant for the <b>linear</b> <b>closure</b> model. The longer fibers and suspensions with high volume fraction have a more predominant influence on suppressing the instability. The contribution of the suspending fluid to the change rate of the disturbance energy dominates the energy dissipation. While the contribution of the fiber shear stress increases monotonously with increasing fiber aspect ratio for the three closure models, the contribution based on the composite HL-I closure model is the largest, and that based on the <b>linear</b> <b>closure</b> model is the smallest. The effect of fiber aspect ratio on the change rate of the disturbance energy caused by the fiber shear stress is more predominant than that of the fiber volume fraction. The positive energy caused by the fiber shear stress consumes the gross energy of the fluid system and leads to a suppression of the flow instability. Z. H. Wan, J. Z. Lin, Z. J. Yo...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A popular {{approach}} to formulating the initial-boundary value problem for fibre suspension flows {{is that in}} which fibre orientation is accounted for in an averaged sense, through {{the introduction of a}} second-order orientation tensor A. This variable, together with the velocity and pressure, then constitutes the set of unknown variables for the problem. The governing equations are balance of linear momentum, the incompressibility condition, an evolution equation for A, and a constitutive equation for the stress. The evolution equation contains a fourth-order orientation tensor A, and it is necessary to approximate A as a function of A, through a closure relation. The purpose of this these is to examine the well-posedness of the equations governing fibre fibre suspension ﬂows, for various closure relations. It has previously been shown by GP Galdi and BD Reddy that, for the <b>linear</b> <b>closure,</b> the problem is wellposed provided that the particle number, a material constant, is less than a critical value. The work by Galdi and Reddy made of a model in which rotary diffusivity {{is a function of the}} ﬂow. This thesis re-examines these issues in two different ways. First, the second law of thermodynamics is used to establish the constraints that the constitutive equations have to satisfy in order to be compatible with this law. This investigation is carried out for a variety of closure rules. The second contribution of the thesis concerns the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the governing equations, for the linear and quadratic closures; for a model in which the rotary diffusivity is treated as a constant, local and global existence of solutions are established, for sufficiently small data, and in the case of the <b>linear</b> <b>closure,</b> for admissible values of the particle number.
