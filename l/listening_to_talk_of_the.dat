60|$|But Mrs. Yonelet {{was in no}} humour <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> elk marriages. The mating of two {{human beings}} was the subject {{uppermost}} in her mind, and the opportunity for advancing her pet project was too valuable to be neglected.|$|R
60|$|The scout <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the cavalrymen for fully {{ten minutes}} with great interest.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean you've been <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the men?" [...] I {{challenged}} rashly, all my gorge {{rising at}} the unofficerlike conduct of this ship's officer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We be two old men,' {{said the}} lama. 'The fault is mine. I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> thy <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> {{the world and}} its madness, and one fault led to the next.' ...|$|R
60|$|The chief {{entered the}} cabin and took a seat near the door. He took a cup of milk and some meat and bread silently, and ate while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the settler.|$|R
6000|$|Later {{that season}} I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> inexperienced bonefishermen telling {{what they had}} done and heard. To me it was absurd. So much fishing talk seems ridiculous, anyway. And the expert fishermen, {{wherever}} they were, received the expressive titles: [...] "Bonefish Bugs and Bonefish Nuts!" [...] Again I heard arguments about tackle rigged for these mysterious fish and these arguments fixed my vague impression. By and by some bonefishermen came to Long Key, and the first sight of a bonefish made me curious. I think it weighed five pounds--a fair-sized specimen. Even to my prejudiced eye that fish showed class. So I began to question the bonefishermen.|$|R
60|$|I shall {{come and}} sit here often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> three old {{men who are}} sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{this is what}} I want," [...] {{continued}} Ziffa; [...] "I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> Rais Ali and the sailor who lives with you, when they don't know you are near, and tell me all that they say about a family named Rimini--will you?" ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is a case}} of a {{trial of}} {{structured}} encounter group using the 2 ̆ 2 Collaborative Method Ⅲ 2 ̆ 2 that holds the training of facilitator concurrently. In this method, the following three points are newly introduced: (1) training of listen at the first three sessions, (2) intentional match of members and small-group facilitator, (3) preliminary research of interested themes among the members. As a result of the first point, the members became able <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> other members carefully, and the facilitators could understand members who should be taken care. Because of the arrangement of the second point, members and facilitators were more secured and more relieved in their small groups. And through the third point, members 2 ̆ 7 motivation in session participation were strengthened...|$|R
50|$|In the Kudi Arasu of 1932, Periyar {{explained}} the basic {{differences between the}} reasons given to us for contraception and the reasons given by others for this. We say that contraception is necessary for women to gain freedom. Others advocate contraception taking into consideration many problems like the health of women, the health and energy of the children, the poverty {{of the country and}} the maintenance of the family property. Many Westerners also support contraception for the same reasons. Our view is not based on these considerations. We recommend that women should stop delivering children altogether because conception stands in the way of women enjoying personal freedom. Further, begetting a number of children prevents men also from being free and independent. This truth will be clear if we <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> men and women when their freedom is hampered.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was really}} the idea of her correspondent, but Sophia Antonovna had adopted it fully. She stated it in one word--"Remorse." [...] Razumov opened his eyes very wide at that. Sophia Antonovna's informant, by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the house, by putting this and that together, had managed to come very near {{to the truth of}} Haldin's {{relation}} to Ziemianitch.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed through}} the gates, {{half an hour before}} they were closed, and entered a small cabaret. Here, calling for some bread and common wine, they sat down in a corner, and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the men who were {{drinking}} there. It was all about the movements of troops, and the scraps of news that had come in from all quarters.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Durgin and Cynthia sat by {{the lamp}} and sewed at night, or <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the men. If Westover read aloud, they whispered {{together}} {{from time to time}} about some matters remote from it, as women always do where there is reading. It was quiet, but it was not dull for Westover, who found himself in no hurry to get back to town.|$|R
60|$|His uncle, as {{captain of}} the men-at-arms left in the castle, was invited to the banquet held after {{the arrival of the}} force. Oswald, therefore, was free to wander about among the soldiers, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> their <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> what they had seen in London, and of the {{entertainments}} there in honour of the new king; exciting, thereby, no small amount of envy among those who had been left behind in garrison.|$|R
60|$|Although the {{conversation}} drifted {{on to other}} and calmer topics, I could not {{ignore the fact that}} he had not denied <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the men. And yet, even as Mr. Pike grudgingly admits, he is a good sailorman and second mate save for his unholy intimacy with the men for'ard--an intimacy which even the Chinese cook and the Chinese steward deplore as unseamanlike and perilous.|$|R
60|$|When {{they had}} {{finished}} Dale ate his meal, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the girls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was twilight {{when he began}} to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the time his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and sat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably propped against the saddles.|$|R
60|$|They put up {{at a small}} inn and, as they partook of a meal, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> {{those around}} them. But it was not here that they could expect to gather the news they required. They heard the names of {{many of those who}} had been killed, but these were all leaders of distinction; and as soon as they had {{finished}} their food, they started for the Louvre.|$|R
60|$|He now {{entered the}} town. There {{were no signs}} of renewed fighting, and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the {{officers}} near the headquarters, he gathered that Bonaparte had granted a pardon to the inhabitants, but that the prisoners taken in the attack on Fort Dupres, among whom were many of those most deeply concerned in the rising, were to be tried at ten o'clock by court-martial, and that probably {{a great part of}} them would be shot.|$|R
60|$|While they hesitated, eyeing Hank's heels doubtfully, a merry peal of {{laughter}} startled {{the animals and}} turning their heads they beheld three lovely girls standing just within the richly carved entrance to the stable. In the center was Ozma, her arms encircling the waists of Dorothy and Betsy, who stood {{on either side of}} her. Ozma was nearly half a head taller than the two other girls, who were almost of one size. Unobserved, they had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the animals, which was a very strange experience indeed to little Betsy Bobbin.|$|R
60|$|That moment bound Whit Hurtle and Frank Connelly into a far closer {{relation}} {{than the}} one between player and manager. I sat silent for a while, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the drowsy <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the other players and the rush and roar of the train as it sped on into the night.|$|R
60|$|Marshal Keith {{was a tall}} man, with a face {{thoughtful}} in repose, {{but having}} a pleasant smile, and an eye that lit up with quiet humour when he spoke. He enjoyed the king's confidence to the fullest extent, and was regarded by him {{not only as a}} general in whose sagacity and skill he could entirely rely, but as one on whose opinion he could trust upon all political questions. He was his favourite companion when, as happened not unfrequently, he donned a disguise and went about the town, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the citizens and learning their opinions upon public affairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "CAMP NEAR BAUTZEN, 30th July, 1757. [...] "MY DEAR BROTHER,--Your bad {{guidance}} {{has greatly}} deranged my affairs. It {{is not the}} Enemy, it is your ill-judged measures that have done me all this mischief. My Generals are inexcusable; either for advising you so ill, or in permitting you to follow resolutions so unwise. Your ears are accustomed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> flatterers only. Daun has not flattered you;--behold the consequences. In this sad situation, nothing is left for me but trying the last extremity. I must go and give battle; and if we cannot conquer, we must {{all of us have}} ourselves killed.|$|R
60|$|Here {{two of us}} dismounted, {{and while}} {{one of the ladies}} sketched the other in her novel {{attitude}} of cavalier, I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> Count Giovanni and the Cimbrian. This Cimbrian's name in Italian was Lazzaretti, and in his own tongue Brück, which, pronouncing less regularly, we made Brick, in compliment to his qualities of good fellowship. His broad, honest visage was bordered by a hedge of red beard, and a light of dry humor shone upon it: he looked, we thought, like a Cornishman, and the contrast between him and the viso sciolto, pensieri stretti expression of Count Giovanni was curious enough.|$|R
60|$|All these conceptions and {{applications}} {{of a universal}} precedence and much else I drank in at Bladesover, as I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> valets, ladies'-maids, Rabbits the butler and my mother in the much-cupboarded, white-painted, chintz-brightened housekeeper's room where the upper servants assembled, or of footmen and Rabbits and estate men of all sorts among the green baize and Windsor chairs of the pantry--where Rabbits, being above the law, sold beer without a license or any compunction--or of housemaids and still-room maids in the bleak, matting-carpeted still-room or of the cook and her kitchen maids and casual friends among the bright copper and hot glow of the kitchens.|$|R
60|$|As she spoke, {{the bells}} were just tolling {{the people out}} of church, and I fell a-thinking of my dear dear Mary Smith in the country, walking home to her grandmother's, in her modest grey cloak, as the bells were chiming and the air full of {{the sweet smell of}} the hay, and the river shining in the sun, all crimson, purple, gold, and silver. There was my dear Mary a hundred and twenty miles off, in Somersetshire, walking home from church along with Mr. Snorter's family, with which she came and went; and I was <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> this great leering vulgar woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{money you}} mean, Toad," [...] she answered, kicking {{him with her}} slippered foot. [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> your <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> love while we journeyed together, and before, but here I need not, and if you speak of it again you shall go living into that baker's oven. Oh! you have {{forgotten}} it, but I have a long score to settle with you. You were a familiar of the Holy Office here at Seville--were you not?--before Morella promoted you to Motril for your zeal, and made you one of his chaplains? Well, I had a sister," [...] And she knelt down and whispered a name into his ear.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} later on, when he was alone, that Tavernake {{realized}} with how little interest he <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> his companion's <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> their success. It was so short a time ago since the building up of a fortune {{had been the one}} aim upon which every nerve of his body was centered. Curiously enough, now he seemed to take it as a matter of course.|$|R
60|$|So Tua was summoned, and {{presently}} {{swept in}} gloriously arrayed, and on seeing her father sitting up and well, ran {{to him and}} embraced him {{and for a long}} time refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> his <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> matters of State. At length, however, he made her sit by him still holding his hand, and asked her why in the name of Amen she had sent that handsome young firebrand, Rames, in command of the expedition to Kesh. Then she answered very sweetly that she would tell him. And tell him she did, at such length that before she had finished, Pharaoh, whose strength as yet was small, had fallen into a doze.|$|R
60|$|She had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the Forester and the Supervisor, and she {{had learned}} from them that Cavanagh was sure of swift advancement, {{now that he had}} shown his courage and his skill; and the thought that he might leave the State to take charge of another forest brought her some uneasiness, for she and Lize had planned to go to Sulphur City. She had consented to this because it still left to her the {{possibility}} of occasionally seeing or hearing from Cavanagh. But the thought that he might go away altogether took some of the music out of the sound of the stream and made the future vaguely sad.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{cling to}} some of our mother's ways, you see, Margaret. As I have grown older, I have become more English than I was. Naturally, as a boy of thirteen, as I was when you last saw me, I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> those around me, and was guided by their {{opinions}} a good deal. Among them, there was a feeling of regret that our father had married an English woman; and I, of course, was ever trying my hardest to show that in riding, or the chase, or in exercises of any kind, I was as worthy to be the son of an Indian rajah as if I had no white blood in my veins.|$|R
6000|$|Within the tent, which flopped and creaked in the wind, we huddled {{about the}} cook-stove {{in the light}} of a lantern, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the loud <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> a couple of packers who were {{discussing}} their business with enormous enthusiasm. Happily they grew sleepy at last and peace settled upon us. I unrolled my sleeping bag and slept dreamlessly until the [...] "Russian nobleman," [...] who did the cooking, waked me.|$|R
6000|$|The {{people of}} the {{neighborhood}} having discovered who H. was, were very kind, and full of delight at seeing her. It was Scotland over again. We {{have had to be}} unflinching to prevent her being overwhelmed, both in Paris and Geneva, by the same demonstrations of regard. To this we were driven, as {{a matter of life and}} death. It was touching <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> these secluded mountaineers. The good hostess, even the servant maids, hung about H., expressing such tender interest for the slave. All had read Uncle Tom. And it had apparently been an era in their life's monotony, for they said, [...] "O, madam, do write another! Remember, our winter nights here are very long!" ...|$|R
60|$|After resting {{and taking}} a look round I became {{interested}} in watching and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> two other visitors who had come in before me. One was a slim, rather lean brown-skinned woman, still young but with the incipient crow's-feet, the lines on the forehead, the dusty- looking dark hair, and other signs of time and toil which almost invariably appear in the country labourer's wife before she attains to middle age. She {{was dressed in a}} black gown, presumably her best although it was getting a little rusty. Her companion was a fat, red- cheeked young girl in a towny costume, a straw hat decorated with bright flowers and ribbons, and a string of big coloured beads about her neck.|$|R
60|$|Bob {{would have}} liked to be out all day, {{watching}} the busy preparations, and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the natives; who were greatly alarmed at the prospect of the siege, knowing that the guns from the Spanish forts, and especially from Fort Saint Philip, could throw their shot and shell into the town. But Captain O'Halloran agreed with his wife that it was much better he should continue his lessons with Don Diaz, of a morning; for that it would be absurd for him to be standing about in the sun, the whole day. The evening lessons were, however, discontinued from the first; as Dr. Burke had his hands full in superintending the preparations making, at the hospitals, for the reception of large numbers of wounded.|$|R
60|$|Early {{next morning}} he was {{up and down on}} the wharf <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the west-country sailors. Every word they spoke seemed to him to revive his memory and bring him nearer to the light. From time to time they paused in their work, and seeing the white-haired {{stranger}} sitting so silently and attentively, they laughed at him and broke little jests upon him. And even these jests had a familiar sound to the exile, as they very well might, seeing that they were the same which he had heard in his youth, for no one ever makes a new joke in England. So he sat through the long day, bathing himself in the west-country speech, and waiting for the light to break.|$|R
60|$|Uneasy at the news, Harry wandered {{about the}} town, and at nightfall entered a small public house near the port. Calling for some liquor, he sat down, and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> the sailors. Presently these left, {{and soon after}} they did so three other men entered. One was dressed as a farmer, the other two as serving-men. Harry thought that he noticed a glance of {{recognition}} pass between the farmer and the landlord, and as the latter placed some liquor and a candle {{on the table before}} the newcomers, Harry recognized in the farmer Colonel Wyndham, a Royalist with whom he was well acquainted. He now looked more closely at the two serving-men, and recognized in them the king and Lord Wilmot.|$|R
