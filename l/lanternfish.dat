5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, <b>lanternfish,</b> flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and <b>lanternfish.</b> Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{macaroni}} penguin {{consists of}} a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the <b>lanternfish</b> species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.|$|E

25|$|Sampling via deep {{trawling}} {{indicates that}} <b>lanternfish</b> account {{for as much}} as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, <b>lanternfish</b> are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of <b>lanternfish</b> is 550–660 million metric tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. <b>Lanternfish</b> also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of <b>lanternfish</b> swim bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom.|$|E
25|$|Some deep-sea pelagic groups, {{such as the}} <b>lanternfish,</b> ridgehead, marine hatchetfish, and lightfish {{families}} are sometimes termed pseudoceanic because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably seamounts and over continental slopes. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{residents}} {{occur in}} three groups: species which {{live in the}} zone only when they are juveniles (drifting with jellyfish and seaweeds); species which live in the zone only when they are adults (salmon, flying fish, dolphin and whale sharks); and deep water species which make nightly migrations up into the surface waters (such as the <b>lanternfish).</b> Accidental residents occur occasionally when adults and juveniles of species from other environments are carried by accident into the zone by currents.|$|E

25|$|While {{hunting in}} the dark depths, {{elephant}} seals seem to locate their prey, at least in part, using vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals {{do not have a}} developed system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae (facial whiskers), which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed {{to play a role in}} search of food. When at the subantarctic or Antarctic coasts, the seals can also consume molluscs, crustaceans, nothothens, <b>lanternfish,</b> krill, cephalopods or even algae.|$|E
25|$|King {{penguins}} eat {{small fish}} and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans. Fish constitute 80–100% of their diet, except in winter months of July and August, {{when they make}} up only 30%. <b>Lanternfish</b> are the main fish taken, principally the species Electrona carlsbergi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, as well as Protomyctophum tenisoni. Slender escolar (Paradiplospinus gracilis) of the Gempylidae, and Champsocephalus gunneri, is also consumed. Cephalopods consumed include those of the genus Moroteuthis, the hooked squid or Kondakovia longimana, the sevenstar flying squid (Martialia hyadesii), young Gonatus antarcticus and Onychoteuthis species.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the natural history of}} the smalleye pygmy shark. It feeds {{primarily}} on midwater squid, krill, shrimps, and small bony fishes such as <b>lanternfish.</b> The photophores on its underside may serve to camouflage its silhouette from predators by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as [...] "counter-illumination". Reproduction is aplacental viviparous as in other members of its family, with the young being born under [...] long. Males attain sexual maturity around [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|Schooling in nature, the gecko {{catshark}} feeds opportunistically on a {{wide variety}} of bony fishes (including <b>lanternfish),</b> cephalopods (including sepiolid and enoploteuthid squid), and crustaceans (including isopods, amphipods, krill, and decapods). The relative importance of the three prey categories varies between geographical areas and seasons, likely reflecting what is most available in the environment. This species is oviparous; adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional oviducts. A single egg matures within each oviduct at a time. Mature eggs are contained within smooth, translucent yellow, vase-shaped capsules [...] measuring roughly [...] long and [...] across, with the top squared off and the bottom converging on a short projection. One study in Suruga Bay recorded females with large yolked ova inside the ovary year-round, but females in the western part of the bay were only found to carry egg cases from October to January, suggesting that the interval between egg depositions is shorter at that time. Males and females attain sexual maturity at approximately [...] and [...] long respectively. However, there is a Taiwanese record of an immature male [...] long.|$|E
