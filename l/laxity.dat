The perceived <b>laxity</b> of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the Congo, worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.|$|E

40|$|A {{communications}} network {{that is part}} of a soft real-time system may need to transmit messages within a bounded delay, but may allow some messages to miss this bound and be dropped within a maximum pre-specified rate of message loss. In this paper, we describe a media access protocol for soft real-time systems implemented on a slotted radio channel with binary feedback. The protocol is based on the Gallager FCFS window-splitting algorithm, but incorporates strict delay bounds using packet <b>laxities.</b> We present an analytic model for this protocol by examining the probable lengths of the collision resolution intervals given the current lag at any time. Both analytic and simulation results are obtained to study the maximum input traffic rates that can be sustained for various <b>laxities,</b> delay bounds, and message loss rates. Keywords.

5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including <b>laxity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous <b>laxity,</b> but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the notorious}} <b>laxity</b> of the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{when it came}} to security precautions and the uncanny ability of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands. At the lower levels, it was limited to the intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's I Corps, under Lieutenant General Hoàng Xuân Lãm, who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When Lãm was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he had helped to write the very plan under discussion. At this meeting, Lãm's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than 15 miles on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone.|$|E

5|$|In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the {{important}} post of prior of Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority {{over half the}} city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery {{as well as the}} clergy of Lucca were known for moral <b>laxity,</b> which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well as moral correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded St John's College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary <b>laxity</b> across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Real-time systems span a broad {{spectrum}} of complexity from very simple microcontrollers (such as a microprocessor controlling an automobile engine) to highly sophisticated, complex and distributed systems (such as air traffic control for the continental United States). Some future systems will be even more complex [4]. These complex future systems include the space station, integrated vision/robotics/AI systems, collections of humans/robots coordinating to achieve common objectives (usually in hazardous environments such as undersea exploration or chemical plants), and various command and control applications. To further complicate the problem there are many dimensions along which real-time systems can be categorized. The main ones include: ffl what is the granularity of deadlines and what are the <b>laxities</b> for tasks, ffl how strict are the deadlines, ffl how reliable must the system be, ffl what is the size o...|$|R

However, {{there has been}} little work undertaken to offer support for real-time applications on wireless networks. We present and evaluate three protocols; variations of two published protocols by Paterakis and Gallager as well as our new one, the Sliding Partition (SP) collision resolution algorithm (CRA). In a real-time setting, the modified Gallager CRA consistently performs worst of the three we consider. We observe that when the deadline range is small, the Sliding Partition CRA performs best. When the deadline range is large, however, the Paterakis CRA performs slightly better than the SP CRA. Both analytic and simulation results are obtained to study the maximum input traffic rates that can be sustained for various <b>laxities,</b> delay bounds, and message loss rates. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} global {{real-time}} periodic scheduling on homogeneous multiprocessor platforms. A number of theoretical results have been obtained in the field of real-time systems, but mainly focusing on properties of specific algorithms in uniprocessor settings. The multiprocessor case has been considered only recently, with few resolution techniques proposed and experimented with up to now. In this paper we discuss several systematic search algorithms—exploring different search spaces—that exploit various features of the problem. These approaches are then evaluated experimentally on numerous randomly generated problems. This work shows (1) how two heuristic approaches can solve most (feasible and unfeasible) problems in no time, and (2) how to improve a state of the art algorithm by looking at jobs' <b>laxities</b> and by focusing the search on bottlenecks. We also discuss limitations of the proposed solvers and future work...|$|R

30|$|Wandering spleen is {{characterized}} by extensive mobility and displacement of the spleen from its normal position.

Chronic torsion of the vascular pedicle from a wandering spleen leads to splenic venous occlusion and development of collateral varicose veins, which is even rarer. Splenopexy is a favorable surgical treatment when the spleen is viable, while splenectomy is obligated to be adopted when it is infarcted [3]. Here, we present a case of wandering spleen with chronic torsion of the vascular pedicle complicating gastric varices. However, there was little guidance to determine which technique should be adopted for this specific condition. We reviewed cases of gastric varices secondary to wandering spleen in the available literature.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a panel {{data set}} of Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) households and {{demonstrates that the}} estimate of EIS (Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution) for stockholders and non-stockholders is large and dierent between them, based upon the consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CAPM). However, recognizing possible <b>laxities</b> in defining and measuring stockholding status, and hence allowing for possible misclassification error therein, I use the switching regression framework to show the evidence {{that there is a}} significant portion of stockholders misclassified as non-stockholders. The correction for this misclassification error results in closer gap of EIS between these two groups. Estimates after the correction are in line with those found in repeated cross-section Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) samples, whereas estimates without the correction are not. This illustrates the importance of accounting for misclassification error in such contexts. To some extent this result along with others of this research validates the use of repeated cross-section data in quatitative estimation of CAPM. ...|$|R

Whereas inadequate canthal tightening or horizontal lid shortening will result in recurrent ectropion, overzealous lid shortening without tendon plication will result in a noticeably narrower horizontal palpebral fi ssure, a persistent ectropion, or temporal migration of the punctum. We used lateral cantholysis, medial canthal tendon plication, and punctal rotation to return the punctum to its normal position and temporalis muscle to support the lower lid in eight cases in which previous procedures had failed to correct the lid malposition. In all eight cases there was improvement of the lid position. In one case of severe medial ectropion, the punctal eversion was not completely corrected. This technique is not recommended as an initial procedure for ectropion repair. It is only used to manage previous surgical failures.
