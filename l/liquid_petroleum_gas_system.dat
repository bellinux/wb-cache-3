In this investigation, a single cylinder, vertical, air-cooled diesel engine was modified to use <b>liquid</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in dual fuel mode. The liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas,</b> was mixed with air and supplied through intake manifold. The liquid fuel neem oil or diesel was injected into the combustion chamber. The performance, emission, and combustion characteristics were studied and compared for neat fuel and dual fuel mode. The experimental results on dual fuel engine show a reduction in oxides of nitrogen up to 70 % of the rated power and smoke in the entire power range. However the brake thermal efficiency was found decreased in low power range due to lower calorific value of <b>liquid</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas,</b> and increase in higher power range due to the complete burning of <b>liquid</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were increased significantly at lower power range and marginal variation in higher power range...|$|R
