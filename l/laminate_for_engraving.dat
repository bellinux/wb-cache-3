40|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} the disadvantages of conventional engraving machine and exert the advantages of parallel mechanism, a novel parallel engraving machine is presented and some key technologies are studied in this paper. Mechanism performances are analyzed {{in terms of the}} first and the second order influence coefficient matrix firstly. So the sizes of mechanism, which are better for all the performance indices of both kinematics and dynamics, can be confirmed and the restriction due to considering only the first order influence coefficient matrix in the past is broken through. Therefore, the theory basis for designing the mechanism size of novel engraving machine with better performances is provided. In addition, method for tool path planning and control technology <b>for</b> <b>engraving</b> force is also studied in the paper. The proposed algorithm for tool path planning on curved surface can be applied to arbitrary spacial curved surface in theory, control technology <b>for</b> <b>engraving</b> force based on fuzzy neural network(FNN) has well adaptability to the changing environment. Research on teleoperation <b>for</b> parallel <b>engraving</b> machine based on B/S architecture resolves the key problems such as control mode, sharing mechanism for multiuser, real-time control <b>for</b> <b>engraving</b> job and real-time transmission for video information. Simulation results further show the feasibility and validity of the proposed methods...|$|R
