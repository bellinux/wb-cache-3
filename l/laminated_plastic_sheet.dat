50|$|Panel saws {{are used}} by cabinet shops to easily cut panels, profiles, solid-wood, plywood, MDF, <b>laminates,</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> and {{melamine}} sheets into sizes or cabinet components. They are also used by sign shops to cut <b>sheets</b> of aluminum, <b>plastic</b> and wood for their sign blanks. Some higher end panel saws feature computer controls that move the blade and fence systems to preset values. Other lower end machines offer simplicity and ease of use, including full scale hobbyist level panel saws at a mere fraction of the cost. While the entry level machines are designed for light duty usage, they offer home DIYers a cheap alternative for infrequent cutting when accuracy and clean cuts are not required.|$|R

This method is used in a variety of fields of modeling, architecture, figure, jewelry, and dental care (Noh and Lee 2016). In addition, various types of 3 D printing methods are utilized in diverse fields (e.g., direct metal printing, <b>laminated</b> object manufacturing, <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> lamination) (Noh and Lee 2016; Shin 2015).|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{satellite}} designs require increasing {{amounts of}} electrical power to operate spacecraft instruments and to provide environments suitable for human habitation. In the past, electrical power was generated by covering rigid honeycomb panels with solar cells. This technology results in unacceptable weight and volume penalties when large amounts of power are required. To fill the need for large-area, lightweight solar arrays, a fabrication technique in which solar cells are attached to a copper printed circuit <b>laminated</b> to a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> was developed. The result is a flexible solar array with one-tenth the stowed volume and one-third the weight of comparably sized rigid arrays. An automated welding process developed to attack the cells to the printed circuit guarantees repeatable welds that are more tolerant of severe environments than conventional soldered connections. To demonstrate the flight readiness of this technology, the Solar Array Flight Experiment (SAFE) was developed and flown on the space shuttle Discovery in September 1984. The tests showed the modes and frequencies of the array to be very close to preflight predictions. Structural damping, however, was higher than anticipated. Electrical performance of the active solar panel was also tested. The flight performance and postflight data evaluation are described...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} various substrata on the {{settlement}} of a pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, was evaluated. The settlement of the larvae in the experiments with four different color substrata was compared and showed that deep color <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> (red and blue) attracted significantly more larvae (P < 0. 05) than light color (green and yellow). In addition, the influence of biofilm substrata was {{compared with that of}} non-film substrata of smooth or rough texture. Number of settled larvae was highest on biofilmed <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets,</b> either rough or smooth, then rough <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without film, the least recorded was on smooth <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without biofilm.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} of crude palm oil (CPO) in local and world markets {{led to the}} {{increasing}} palm oil production {{and the expansion of}} oil palm plantations in Indonesia. Together with the increasing CPO production the wastes generated at palm oil industry are in growing as well. One of the solid waste (biomass) at the palm oil mill is empty fruit bunches of oil palm (EFB). The utilization of EFB for environmental friendly composites (bio composites) can reduce the amount of this biomass which so far has less uses for technical sectors. The good properties of natural fibers of EFB for technical applications are such as high mechanical strength, good heat resistance and as lightweight material, good resistance electrical conductivity. However, bio composite has the disadvantage since this material is not water proof, neither humidity resistant. So that for its implementation as technical products the suitable coating material is necessary. This paper focuses on the production of bio composite s, its bending test and its water resistance test in kind of soaking test. The coating materials used for this research were <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> (<b>plastic),</b> bee wax, car nauba wax and craft glue (synthetic). The test results indicate that the coating using laminate sheet showed suitable results than the other of coating materials : bee wax, carnauba wax, craft glu...|$|R
