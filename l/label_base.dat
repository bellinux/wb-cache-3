5000|$|With [...] "BIGGSHOT Music & Films", Skatterman {{released}} the inaugural Mixtape “This is Kansas City; Vol. 1(2010)”. Skatterman also moved forward and released The Cookbook; Recipe One,. {{and also the}} highly anticipated follow-up, [...] "The Cook Book:Recipe Two" [...] (2012), the industry veteran, breaks new barriers and provides fans {{with a little more}} insight into life away from his previous <b>label</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

40|$|Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) {{spectroscopy}} and fluorescence spectroscopy are complementary biophysical {{techniques used}} to examine the structure and dynamics of macromolecules. We have previously described the bi-functional spectroscopic probe Ç for the study of nucleic acid structure and dynamics using EPR and fluorescence spectroscopy. As with any newly designed spectroscopic probe, the utility, functionality, and the structural effects of the probe on the nucleic acid must be examined in detail. Initial EPR, fluorescence, and thermal denaturation studies indicated that the phenoxazine-derived spin-labeled deoxycytosine analog Ç forms a structurally non-perturbing base-pair with deoxyguanosine in DNA. Here we extend the analysis of the spectroscopic probe by presenting a detailed crystallographic study of this label based on small molecule crystal structures of the nucleoside base ç and its phenoxazine analog as well as a 1. 7 Å resolution crystal structure of Ç within a decamer duplex A-form DNA. The DNA crystal structure confirms that the spin-labeled deoxycytosine analog forms a non-perturbing base-pair with deoxyguanosine. Interestingly, this structure and also the one of the phenoxazine base show the label in a planar conformation, whereas the structure of the free spin <b>label</b> <b>base</b> ç has a bend at the oxazine linkage. Density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both conformations are very close in energy and possess both the same frequency for bending at the oxazine linkage. These results are interpreted as a small degree of bending flexibility around the oxazine linkage, which may be a consequence of the antiaromaticity in this 16 -pi electron ring system. Within DNA, the amplitude of the bending motion is likely to be restricted due to steric hindrance. This detailed structural analysis shows that the spin <b>label</b> <b>base</b> ç can be used with high confidence in EPR- or fluorescence-based structural and dynamics studies of oligonucleotides.

30|$|The model {{offers two}} merit-order approaches: either based on {{marginal}} costs, or the merit-order {{can be assigned}} by the user based on user assumptions or preferences. Because we want to explore potential consequences of differential implementation of the PHS plants to the electricity system, this last approach is {{used in this study}} (see Section  2.3. 1). The defined power plants are placed in order of the merit (see Table  2 and Appendix A). Within each defined type of plant, the newest plant is placed higher in the merit order. The last option is by changing the plants’ typical <b>label</b> (<b>base,</b> middle or peak load). For example, if a new highly efficient, cleaner combined cycle (CC)-plant should be placed higher in the merit order then an old coal-fired power station, the CC-plants’ label could become “Base Load” while the coal-fired power plants’ label becomes “Middle Load”. In this case the CC-plant is placed higher in the merit order. For scheduled maintenance and unplanned outage, the existing capacities are de-rated for operation & maintenance by a fixed fraction throughout the year (see Appendix A). The model was previously used in the contexts of developed and developing countries [29, 30, 31, 32].|$|E
