5000|$|The Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands (CBWR) were {{originally}} {{granted to the}} Oregon & California Railroad in 1866. They include odd-numbered sections in a six-mile swath between Coos Bay and Roseburg. The grant, which was intended to finance construction of a military road between the two towns, was forfeited by the railroad for violating grant provisions identical to those that caused the revestment of the Oregon and California Railroad Revested Lands (O&C Lands). On February 26, 1919 federal legislation was enacted to reconvey to the United States approximately 73,583 acres of land in Coos and Douglas counties that had been conveyed by the United States to the Coos Bay Wagon Road. Congress enacted the Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937 (...) , directing the Secretary of Interior to manage the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands for permanent forest production under the principle of sustained yield, {{for the purpose of}} providing a permanent source of timber supply, protecting watersheds, regulating stream flow, and contributing to the economic stability of local communities and industries. The act also directed the secretary to provide recreational facilities and establish a formula to pay revenues from forest production on the reconveyed lands to Coos and Douglas counites in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>in</b> proportion to the relative assessed value of the reconveyed lands in each county.|$|E

5|$|Putting {{an end to}} most {{foreign trade}} relationships, the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance, made {{possible}} through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of fanompoana—forced labor <b>in</b> <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> payments <b>in</b> money or goods. Ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor, Radama I, {{in an effort to}} extend her realm over the entire island, and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will. Due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns, high death rates among fanompoana workers, and harsh traditions of justice under her rule, the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839, and from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 in Imerina. These statistics have contributed to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalona's rule in historical accounts.|$|R

50|$|The Belize Estate and Produce Company {{survived the}} {{depression}} {{years because of}} its special connections in British Honduras and London. Since 1875 {{various members of the}} Hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company. Sir Samuel Hoare, a shareholder and former director, was a former British cabinet member and a friend of Leo Amery, the British secretary of state for the colonies. In 1931, when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression, family member Oliver V.G. Hoare contacted the Colonial Office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the United States. The British government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of US$200,000 to erect a sawmill in Belize Town. When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. The government accepted some virtually worthless land <b>in</b> <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> and <b>in</b> 1935 capitulated completely, reducing the tax to its former rate and annulling the landowners' arrears by making them retroactive to 1931. But small landowners had paid their taxes, often at a higher rate.|$|R
50|$|Early {{resistance}} from potential host communities over financial impact concerns {{meant that the}} committee had two choices: to stop the project {{and wait for the}} problems to be resolved, or push ahead, utilizing the powers granted in the Lanham Act powers to overrule local resistance, but creating a great deal of friction that could potentially effect the project's future success. The housing need was so great, though, that the only viable choice was the second one, and they pushed forward to find a site. Consciously attempting to avoid conflict, the committee tried to assure potential host communities that projects built within the mutual ownership program would pay real taxes, and not make payments <b>in</b> <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> as outlined <b>in</b> the Lanham Act of 1940.

But the financial concerns of the residents only served to exacerbate other local fears about the new project. Many defense workers took these other fears very personally.|$|R
