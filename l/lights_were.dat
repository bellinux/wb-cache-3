5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|The post-War period saw {{changes in}} the {{production}} of Christmas tree ornaments. Shiny Brite and other ornament companies began mass-producing inexpensive glass ornaments. Bubble <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> introduced during the period, and inexpensive, lit-from-within tree toppers were another option for the tree.|$|E

50|$|HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> {{a member}} of the HOL theorem prover family. Like the other members, it is a proof {{assistant}} for classical higher order logic. Compared with other HOL systems, HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> intended to have relatively simple foundations. HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> authored and maintained by the mathematician and computer scientist John Harrison. HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> released under the simplified BSD license.|$|R
50|$|Trouble <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} by {{automotive}} mechanics and electricians where localized <b>light</b> <b>is</b> needed where ambient <b>light</b> proves to <b>be</b> insufficient.|$|R
5|$|All {{five seasons}} of Friday Night <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Austin and Pflugerville. With the show {{yielding}} roughly $33 {{million a year}} in revenue, other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show's producers. The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states, and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the track, on {{the site}} of the former Kaiser Steel Mill, began in 1995 and was {{completed}} in late 1996. The speedway has a grandstand capacity of 68,000 and 28 skyboxes and a total capacity of 122,000. In 2006, a fanzone was added behind the main grandstand. <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> added to the speedway in 2004 with the addition of a second annual NASCAR weekend. Since 2011, the track has hosted only one NASCAR weekend.|$|E
5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
50|$|The font Calibri <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in Microsoft Windows 8. From Microsoft Word 2013 onwards, Calibri and Calibri <b>Light</b> <b>are</b> the default fonts for body text and headings respectively. Calibri <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> also {{commonly used in}} Powerpoint templates.|$|R

50|$|In fish-only marine aquariums, <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{only for}} illumination. <b>Lighting</b> <b>is</b> chosen primarily with aesthetic considerations for optimal viewing of the fish. The <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> generally of much lower intensity than {{is used in}} reef aquariums to limit algae growth.|$|R
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Yehudi <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> again tried, {{this time}} mounted to an F-4 Phantom painted in a dull blue-and-white {{camouflage}} pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer visually acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, {{this time with}} thin computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering much of an aircraft's surface.|$|E
5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced fluorescent pastel lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> {{banned from}} photographing all of Central America except Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia, {{as a safety}} measure against the {{gathering}} of strategic knowledge. They {{took advantage of the}} Peruvian government's allowal to take pictures in the air by capturing the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines. These were unable to distinguish from the surface, though further into the atmosphere the designs can range from simple patterns to hummingbirds and llamas.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{dismantled}} and {{a modern}} automated <b>light</b> <b>was</b> erected {{on the old}} foundation.|$|R
50|$|Buffalo Harbor North and South {{entrance}} <b>Lights</b> <b>are</b> lighthouses {{located at}} the entrance to Buffalo harbor in New York. The south <b>light</b> <b>is</b> at Stony Point breakwater (known also as the Buffalo Harbor South Entrance Light), and the North <b>light</b> <b>was</b> relocated.|$|R

5|$|The theatre reputedly {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} under the Brars. In 1998, the Princess was called “an absolutely lousy advertisement for late 20th century privatization” by Magic Lantern Theatre’s Rick Ostapchuk, {{who said that}} the current owners had allowed the theatre to sink “with the velocity, if not the sanitized H20, of a waterslide”. By his count, 170 of the marquee’s 330 <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> burnt out, and he did not believe the interior had been regularly washed or maintained.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, {{as well as by the}} provision of an electricity supply.|$|E

50|$|In 1933, the {{automated}} <b>light</b> <b>was</b> dismantled, and the Coast Guard constructed a 50 ft steel tower {{in front of}} the lighthouse. The automated <b>light</b> <b>was</b> placed on top until 1985, when the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> placed back in the lighthouse and the tower was removed.|$|R
5000|$|Soft light {{refers to}} light {{that tends to}} [...] "wrap" [...] around objects, casting diffuse shadows with soft edges. Soft <b>light</b> <b>is</b> when a <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> large {{relative}} to the subject; hard <b>light</b> <b>is</b> when the <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> small relative to the subject.|$|R
5|$|Despite ongoing {{efforts by}} the Ministry of Domestic Security, crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009. Between 1994 and 1998, the city {{had an average of}} eight to twelve police {{officers}} for every 10,000 inhabitants; large cities should typically have closer to fifteen. Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime. , the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime. The recent increase in crime and the inadequate response from the CUA has prompted the growth of private security firms in the city.|$|E
5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a surprise to the Americans, and construction <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
50|$|Thorngumbald Clough Low <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> {{constructed}} of a wrought iron frame approximately 10 m {{high on a}} 2 m high brick and flagstone base, the Thorngumbald Clough High <b>light</b> <b>is</b> of a similar design; the low <b>light</b> <b>is</b> painted white, the high light red. The low <b>light</b> <b>was</b> originally on a trolley, enabling it to move up to 28 ft so as to adjust {{to changes in the}} shipping channel. The Thorngumbald lights ceased operation , but were restarted in 1952. As of 2015 both <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> still in use (owned and operated by Associated British Ports, Hull). Both are Grade II listed structures.|$|R
50|$|The Passage <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the last}} <b>lights</b> to <b>be</b> {{constructed}} on the Great Lakes. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> built {{at the same time that}} the 1895 lighthouse was deactivated. In 1959, the lighthouse's beacon characteristic was changed from green to a flashing red light, and the radiobeacon distance-finding system was deactivated in 1962. In 1968 the formerly all-white <b>light</b> <b>was</b> given a red-painted base on a white pier. In 1973 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> automated, and the steel antenna tower was removed in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Monochromators {{are used}} in many optical {{measuring}} instruments and in other applications where tunable monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> wanted. Sometimes the monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directed at a sample and the reflected or transmitted <b>light</b> <b>is</b> measured. Sometimes white <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directed at a sample and the monochromator is {{used to analyze the}} reflected or transmitted <b>light.</b> Two monochromators <b>are</b> used in many fluorometers; one monochromator is used to select the excitation wavelength and a second monochromator is used to analyze the emitted light.|$|R
5|$|Huntsville was {{the largest}} city with no {{electricity}} from TVA. All the traffic <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> off, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, students were sent home from United States Space Camp, and the Panoply Arts Festival was canceled. Power was restored gradually to Huntsville, beginning with 3 percent {{on the morning of}} May 1. Only localized outages remained eight days after the storm. In addition to traffic and safety issues, the outage caused difficulties with water treatment and distribution and retail of all kinds, including gasoline and food purchases.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. Brussels was taken by the Germans, and the radio was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 2014, Palestinians {{tried to}} burn down Joseph's tomb while protesting. Palestinian Authority {{security}} forces {{were able to}} stop the protesters before {{they were able to}} burn it down. On December 22, 2014, Jews who were visiting the tomb to light candles for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah discovered that the site had been vandalized. <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> broken and electrical wiring had been cut. It was the first time Jews were allowed to visit the tomb in over a month.|$|E
