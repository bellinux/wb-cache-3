25|$|Among {{the handful}} of cases that Evers and Ellgers studied, major lesion sites {{included}} the temporal cortex; however, the specific location and <b>laterality</b> (left vs. right temporal cortex) was variable. Many cases of focal brain lesions had comorbidity with hearing impairment (see hypoacusis), epileptic activity and intoxication. There have also been several findings of acute musical hallucinations in patients with dorsal pons lesions post-stroke and encephalitis potentially due to disruption of connections between the sensory cortex and reticular formation.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{proposed}} theoretical views generally {{taken to}} approach bilingual aphasia. The more traditional Localizationist view, {{states that the}} loss of one language occurs because the patient's languages are represented in different brain areas or in different hemispheres. Thus, if one area is damaged, only the language represented there would suffer, and the others would not. The second view is the Dynamic view of selective language recovery, which proposes that the language system of representation and control is compromised as a result of damage. This theory is supported by the functional imaging data of normal bilinguals and holds that fluency in a language is lost because of an increase in the activation threshold. The Dynamic view offers an explanation for selective recovery of language and many reported recovery patterns in bilingual aphasia (See Recovery) There is much debate over which hemisphere supports the languages and which intrahemispheric neural regions represent each language within a bilingual individual. Most neuroimaging studies show no <b>laterality</b> differences between monolingual and bilingual speakers, supporting the hypothesis that languages share some areas of the brain, but also have some separate neural areas. Right hemisphere damage has been shown to result in the same patterns of cognitive-communication deficits in monolinguals and bilinguals; however, bilingual speakers who have left hemisphere damage are shown to be at risk for aphasia while monolingual individuals are not.|$|E

2500|$|In {{conjunction}} with fraternal birth order, handedness provides {{further evidence of}} prenatal effects on sexual orientation, because handedness is regarded by many as a marker of early neurodevelopment. Other correlates to handedness (e.g., cerebral <b>laterality,</b> prenatal hormonal profiles, spatial ability) {{have been linked to}} sexual orientation, either empirically and/or theoretically. [...] In right-handed individuals, the number of older brothers increased the odds of homosexual orientation, but this effect was not seen in left-handed individuals. As with other purported marks indicating higher incidence of homosexuality, however, the link with handedness remains ambiguous and several studies have been unable to replicate it.|$|E
50|$|In {{domestic}} dogs (Canis familiaris), {{there is}} a correlation between motor <b>laterality</b> and noise sensitivity - a lack of paw preference is associated with noise-related fearfulness. (Branson and Rogers, 2006) Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for <b>laterality</b> can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog's <b>laterality</b> can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking {{to the left or}} the right of their blind owner.|$|E

50|$|Domestic horses (Equus ferus caballus) exhibit <b>laterality</b> in {{at least}} two areas of neural organization, i.e. sensory and motor. In thoroughbreds, the {{strength}} of motor <b>laterality</b> increases with age. Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction. Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye <b>laterality</b> when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive French saddlebreds glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the trotters, although the emotive index is the same for both breeds. Racehorses exhibit <b>laterality</b> in stride patterns as well. They use their preferred stride pattern at all times whether racing or not, unless they are forced to change it while turning, injured, or fatigued.|$|E

50|$|One theory, {{known as}} the {{acoustic}} <b>laterality</b> theory, the physical properties of certain speech sounds are what determine <b>laterality</b> to the left hemisphere. Stop consonants, for example t, p, or k, leave a defined silent period {{at the end of}} words that can easily be distinguished. This theory postulates that changing sounds such as these are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere. As a result of the right ear being responsible for transmission to sounds to the left hemisphere, it is capable of perceiving these sounds with rapid changes. This right ear advantage in hearing and speech <b>laterality</b> was evidenced in dichotic listening studies. Magnetic imaging results from this study showed greater left hemisphere activation when actual words were presented as opposed to pseudo-words (Shtyrov, Pihko, and Pulvermuller, 2005). Two important aspects of speech recognition are phonetic cues, such as format patterning, and prosody cues, such as intonation, accent, and emotional state of the speaker (Imaizumi, Koichi, Kiritani, Hosoi & Tonoike, 1998).|$|E
5000|$|Some data {{gathered}} from dichotic listening test experiments {{suggests that there}} is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language <b>laterality.</b> According to Voyer (2011), [...] "Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of <b>laterality</b> effects, with men obtaining larger <b>laterality</b> effects than women. However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in [...] "Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test," [...] women reported more [...] "intrusions" [...] of words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.|$|E
