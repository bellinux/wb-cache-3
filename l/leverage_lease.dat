Because direct financing <b>leases</b> and <b>leveraged</b> <b>leases</b> are distinct classifications in paragraph 6, some believe that paragraph 34 precludes sale-leaseback transactions from being classified as <b>leveraged</b> <b>leases.</b> The issue is whether Statement 13 precludes real estate leases and leases in sale-leaseback transactions from being classified as <b>leveraged</b> <b>leases</b> if the criteria in paragraph 42 are met.

The distinction between sales-type and direct financing leases has changed: whereas in ASC 840 the test was whether the fair value of the leased asset {{was different from the}} lessor's cost or carrying amount (if so, the lease is a sales-type lease), in ASC 842, any lessor lease that meets the lessee finance lease tests (based on rents and guaranteed residuals due from the lessee) is a sales-type lease; direct financing treatment applies if the lease is capital only because a third-party residual guarantee causes the present value test to be met.|$|R

50|$|Hong Kong {{leveraged}} lease: In Hong Kong, where {{income taxes}} {{are low in}} comparison to other countries, <b>leveraged</b> <b>leasing</b> to local operators is common. In such transactions, a locally incorporated lessor acquires an aircraft {{through a combination of}} non-recourse debt, recourse debt, and equity (generally in a 49-16-35 proportion), and thus be able to claim depreciation allowances despite only being liable for half of the purchase price. Its high tax losses can then be set off against profits from leasing the aircraft to a local carrier. Due to local tax laws, these investments are set up as general partnerships, in which the investors' liability is mainly limited by insurance and by contract with the operator.|$|R
40|$|For {{a variety}} of tax, accounting, and {{economic}} reasons, leasing has become an enormously popular method of financing the acquisition of capital assets. In particular, for power generation assets, the use of leasing products (including synthetic and <b>leveraged</b> <b>leases)</b> has grown substantially in recent years. However, the long-lived nature of most power generation assets, together with their often unique physical and economic characteristics, makes estimation of their residual values challenging. In an environment where uncertainties are commonplace and in which capital structures are often highly leveraged, even small changes in residual values can {{have a significant impact}} on the profitability of financial institutions and other investors. This article outlines a framework for analyzing the uncertainty in residual values for assets, such as power generation facilities, for which few data points exist...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic model of firm financing {{based on the}} need to collateralize promises to pay with tangible assets, leading to a unified theory of optimal investment, capital structure, leasing, and risk management. Tangible assets required for production restrict <b>leverage.</b> <b>Leasing</b> is costly, highly collateralized financing, which enables higher leverage and faster firm growth. Financing and risk management are connected as both involve promises to pay, making incomplete risk management optimal. In the cross section, more constrained firms lease more and engage in less risk management and may completely abstain, contrary to extant theory and consistent with the evidence. Dynamically, firms with low cash flows may sell assets and lease them back, and discontinue risk management. Empirically, tangible assets and leased assets are key determinants of the capital structure...|$|R
50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessor credits owned assets and debits a lease {{receivable}} {{account for the}} present value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or carrying amount of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called direct financing leases. A third type of lessor capital <b>lease,</b> called a <b>leveraged</b> <b>lease,</b> is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the leased asset is substantially financed by debt.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that leasing is a {{financial}} alternative so popular in the world is the one that synthesize its own „philosophy”: It’s not ownership of the assets but their effective use is the one leading to profit. The key aspect is the proper use of capital resources: the investment of money in what generates „business” and brings profit, like publicity, the superior qualification of the staff, stocks, exploring new markets, research, development, instead of blocking them by purchasing fixed assets. This article aims to approach the leasing as a source or as a financing alternative investments, to highlight the benefits given by that to the three parties involved in a lease - the lessee or the user of the lease, the lessee or the leasing company and the good or the assets supplier which are the subject lease.

40|$|A {{structured}} leasing {{is a new}} {{and highly}} flexible transaction that develops synergies between funding policy, risk management of the underlying assets, and tax benefits. It is used in particular transactions involving complex and large-scale assets, such as airplanes, ships, industrial plant and equipment, and large real estate projects. As in other tax-based techniques, {{the implementation of a}} structured leasing transaction, either a <b>leveraged</b> <b>lease</b> or a synthetic lease, is more significant when the value of the asset is large and allows for a potentially greater tax benefits’ appropriation. Structured leasing creates value by increasing liquidity and funding, reducing the funding costs, allowing sponsors to attain greater leverage and to increase tax shields, improving lessees’ risk management, and allowing lessees to maintain financial flexibility, by improving or maintaining financial ratios. Although all of the above-mentioned economic advantages, structured leasing also has problems. The most commonly referred problems of structured leases are complexity, offbalance sheet treatment, higher transaction costs, and wealth expropriation. Besides describing the economic motivations and problems of structured leasing, this paper provides details on the characteristics of structured leasing activity and reviews the most influential papers, summarizes their results, and associates them with the existing empirical evidence. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Leasing {{represents}} an attractive method of raising 100 % {{of the cost}} of capital goods and equipment and of obtaining the use of capital goods and equipment {{over long periods of time}} for relatively low periodic payments. Typically the cost of lease financing is less than the cost of a comparable debt financing. An important element in lease financing is the transfer or treatment of the tax benefits that are associated with owning capital equipment. My presentation will cover what a lease is, how lease financing has developed and grown in the last 20 years and who are some of the firms in the leasing industry. I will also discuss the specific tax benefits that are available to owners of capital equipment because those tax benefits and the tax characteristics of the equipment financed are very important ingredients in leasing today.

40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 {{affects the}} net income to be {{recognized}} by an investor in a safe harbor lease over its remaining life. The FASB issued two Exposure Drafts of a proposed FASB Statement addressing the accounting for safe harbor leases but did not issue a final Statement.

The first Exposure Draft, issued October 29, 1981, does not address the subsequent accounting required by the change in tax law or other significant assumptions.

EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that, if the investor accounted for the investment under the revised Exposure Draft, the lease should be recalculated from inception in accordance with paragraph 11 of the revised Exposure Draft.

The findings show that more profitable firms appear to engage more in tax strategies that result in lower ETRs. Moreover, they indicate that multinational firms have more possibilities to reduce the tax burden, resulting in a negative association with ETR. Germany’s tax reform of 2008 has a negative effect on ETR and impacts some firm-specific factors.
