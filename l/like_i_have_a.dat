[...] He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, {{due to the fact that}} his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.|$|E
500|$|The mixtape samples {{songs from}} Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want to seem <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E

500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E

[...] "But when you can't get things done by others, you can do them, in a smaller way, yourself, and I find I can be {{satisfied}} with running a prairie farm as it ought to be run." [...] She paused and resumed with a soft laugh: [...] "Looks as if neither of us was fixed quite as we <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> husband who must be hustled; you want to hold yours back. Well, I guess we can't change that; we must take the boys for what they are and make allowances. Besides, your man's fine energy is perhaps the best thing he has." ...|$|E

6000|$|Thank you, {{my dearest}} cousin, for your kind little note, which I run {{the chance of}} {{answering}} by that Wednesday's post you think you may wait for. So (via your table) I set about writing to you, and the first word, of course, must be an expression of my contentment with the 'Examiner' review. Indeed, I am more than contented--delighted with it. I had some dread, vaguely fashioned, about the 'Examiner'; the very delay looked ominous. And then, I thought to myself, though I did not say, that if Mr. Forster praised the verses on Flush to you, it was just {{because he had no}} sympathy for anything else. But it is all the contrary, you see, and I am the more pleased for the want of previous expectation; and I must add that if you were so kind as to be glad of being associated with me by Mr. Forster's reference, I was so human as to be very very glad of being associated with you by the same. Also you shall criticise 'Geraldine' exactly as you like--mind, I don't think it all so rough as the extracts appear to be, and some variety is attained by that playing at ball with the pause, which causes the apparent roughness--still you shall criticise 'Geraldine' exactly as you <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great fancy for writing some day a longer poem of a like class--a poem comprehending the aspect and manners of modern life, and flinching at nothing of the conventional. I think it might be done with good effect. You said once that Tennyson had done it in 'Locksley Hall,' and I half agreed with you. But looking at 'Locksley Hall' again, I find that not much has been done in that way, noble and passionate and full as the poem is in other ways. But there is no story, no manners, no modern allusion, except in the grand general adjuration to the 'Mother-age,' and no approach to the treatment of a conventionality. But Crabbe, as you say, has done it, and Campbell in his 'Theodore' in a few touches was near to do it; but Hayley clearly apprehends the species of poem in his 'Triumphs of Temper' and 'Triumphs of Music,' and so did Miss Seward, who called it the 'poetical novel.' Now I do think that a true poetical novel--modern, and on the level of the manners of the day--might be as good a poem as any other, and much more popular besides. Do you not think so? ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 1991, a year {{prior to}} the incident, O'Connor had told Spin magazine: Madonna is {{probably}} the hugest role model for women in America. There's a woman who people look up to as being a woman who campaigns for women's rights. A woman who in an abusive way towards me, said that <b>I</b> look <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> run in with a lawnmower and that I was about as sexy as a Venetian blind.

5000|$|A {{member of}} the great Lion teams of the 1950s and early 1960s, Harley was the best draft choice for Detroit out of any choices in 1953.

A tireless worker, Harley was one of the toughest and most conditioned Lions of his era. He once said {{at the peak of his}} career, [...] "(I) never feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> job cinched."

I think what I was more surprised and excited by was how much the internet and technology {{played a part in}} that. I got tons of hate-mail, love-mail, and [...] "meat dress" [...] was a top Twitter topic for three days straight."
