5000|$|The {{latch hook}} tool traces its origin to the {{invention}} of the <b>latch</b> <b>needle.</b> Invented in 1847, the <b>latch</b> <b>needle</b> was part of a knitting machine that wrapped yarn around the latch and pushed through a canvas before pulling it through and knotting the yarn to the canvas. In the 1920s, the tool was created by combining the hand hook with the latch.|$|E
5000|$|A {{latch hook}} {{is both the}} tool and the textile art of latch hooking. Latch hooking differs from {{traditional}} rug hooking and locker hooking by the physical knotting of the yarn to canvas. Latch hook was invented {{in the nineteenth century}} with the <b>latch</b> <b>needle,</b> in the twentieth century the <b>latch</b> <b>needle</b> underwent numerous variations including the hand tool used by artisans and crafters to produce latch hook rugs. While rug hooking uses a base fabric of burlap or hessian, latch hooking uses specially woven rug canvas. Rug canvases range from 3.3 holes per inch (hpi) to 5 hpi. The pattern may be stencilled onto the canvas or worked from a chart similar to a needlepoint pattern. Latch hook yarns may be bough pre-cut (usually 2.5 inch lengths) or in skeins and cut to the desired length.In his book [...] "The Hooked Rug," [...] published in 1930, American writer William Winthrop Kent describes a form of rugmaking [...] "A canvas is used like cross-stitch canvas only coarser, which has every third mesh a large one. It is held on the knee or on a table. The pieces of wool yarn are cut exactly the same length by a gauge. The hook used has a catch or latch on it and is inserted in one hole and out the next in the next row, as follows: The wool is held in the left hand and above the canvas, then doubled and the double end is slipped over the hook, the catch being up or open. The hook is then drawn out through the canvas toward the worker, the cut ends being kept in the left hand. The catch by this action drops down and secures the wool. The tool is next pushed forward through the wool loop and catches the two ends held in the left hand, then the loop is held in the left hand and has the two ends pulled through it with the hook. To pull out hook and draw tight the two cut ends finishes the knot. This is really a pile fabric and is known as a Turkey Rug but sprang from the hooking process as the earlier hook used was of the crochet hook form." ...|$|E

The paper concerns the spring loaded <b>latch</b> <b>needle</b> and its advantages in the loop forming process, the steel composite needle for a higher productivity and maintenance-free of the knitting machine and special sinkers, with local increased hardness, to process abrasive yarns...|$|E
40|$|The fibre pile or fleece knits {{can be made}} on {{circular}} knit {{machines with}} different types of construction. The machines may be complex, utilizing either spring or <b>latch</b> <b>needles</b> employing sinker-top, dial, cylinder, or dial/cylinder mechanisms. With this equipment, various effects can be produced. This paper describes the influence of some variables like count and twists of backing yarn and stitch length upon shrinkage of two and three-yarn fleecy fabrics. The results shows that by suitable combination of these variables the length wise and width wise shrinkage can be controlled...|$|R
50|$|Part I of the Act put {{a five-year}} duty of 33.3% ad valorem on nine {{categories}} of items (including optical glass, laboratory porcelain, hosiery <b>latch</b> <b>needles,</b> metallic tungsten, synthetic chemicals) that {{were perceived as}} being essential to British success in the Great War. Part II of the Act put a similar duty on imported goods which were sold at prices below the cost of production (dumping) or at prices lower than the prices of similar goods profitably made in Britain, due to depreciating currencies of the imported goods' country of origin. In the House of Commons 142 voted for its third reading, which was passed by 178 votes to 56.|$|R
50|$|Growth was the {{dominant}} theme during the decade, engendering a more well-rounded and financially sound company. As the 1890s progressed, Excelsior Needle diversified {{into a number}} of new areas, including the manufacture of knitting machine <b>latch</b> <b>needles</b> and the manufacture of heavy hook needles used in the mass production of shoes and other leather goods. Excelsior Needle continued to diversify, forming a subsidiary named Torrington Swaging Company, to manufacture spokes for bicycle wheels. (This was in response to a new feature of the sewing machine industry that took shape during the 1890s: Sewing machine manufacturers, led by the Singer Company, had begun to manufacture bicycles in increasing numbers.) Excelsior Needle also acquired controlling interest in two sales organizations—Boston-based S.M. Supplies Company and New York City-based C.B. Barker & Company—and moved beyond U.S. borders {{for the first time with}} the establishment of American Supplies Company in England.|$|R
