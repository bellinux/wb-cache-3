The experiment was planted under irrigation on May 2009 at Embrapa Cerrados, Federal District, Brazil. A complete randomized block design with four replicates was used. Genetic variability was observed among the tested genotypes. The genotypic correlations (in absolute values) found for all traits were greater than their corresponding phenotypic and environmental correlations. A significant influence of genetic factors on trait expression was observed. It could be concluded that the phenotypic expression is decreased depending on the environmental conditions. The greatest magnitudes for the genotypic and phenotypic correlations were found for TKW and CLASS. Trait YLD was positively correlated to PHt in terms of genotypic and phenotypic correlation. The selection accuracy was rated high for all traits. The high magnitudes found in the estimation of broad sense heritability indicated the existence of genetic variability, showing the possibility of obtaining genetic gains through the selection for all characters. 201...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Recently, {{researches}} {{have shown}} that the Brazilian savannah has a great potential to supply the demand for barley grains. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the genetic variability in 39 elite barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes based on the agro-morphological traits of a crop irrigated in the savannah system. An irrigation experiment in the design of complete randomized block with four replicates was conducted at Federal District - Brazil. The evaluated traits were: distance from the last knot to the rachis, distance from the flag leaf to rachis, spike length, number of grains by ear, flag leaf area, plant height, silking, <b>lodging,</b> <b>grain</b> yield, thousand-seed weight, protein content and grain commercial classification. After using analysis of variance the means were used to estimate the genetic dissimilarity among all genotypes pairs based on the Mahalanobis’ generalized distance. Cluster analysis using genetic distance matrix was performed having Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic Means method (UPGMA) as the criteria. Highly significant differences were found among the genotypes for all traits evaluated. The high coefficient of genetic variation indicates the possibility of having genetic gains for all traits. The traits that most contributed to the variability were the flag leaf area and silking, while the protein content and lodging were the traits that contributed the least. Based on the cluster analysis, at least three major groups of similarity were found. There was a clustering trend of two and six-rowed materials.

We characterized 27 brachytic (brh) semidwarf mutants in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and located the genes on barley chromosome linkage maps. All brachytic genes were transferred into the two-rowed cultivar Bowman by backcrossing four to seven times and selecting for semidwarf plants. The brachytic lines were evaluated for 10 phenotypic traits: plant height, awn, peduncle, and rachis internode length, leaf length and width, <b>lodging,</b> <b>grain</b> yield, number of kernels per spike, and kernel weight. We intercrossed the lines {{to determine which}} mutants were at independent loci and which were alleles at the same locus. F 2 populations from 18 brh semidwarfs were constructed for genetic mapping using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The brachytic semidwarf near-isogenic lines were significantly shorter than their normal counterparts and most had lower yields (16 / 27); shorter awns (26 / 27), peduncles (26 / 27), and rachis internodes (24 / 27); and reduced kernel weight (22 / 27). Twelve of the lines had shorter penultimate leaves and 15 had reduced lodging. Four lines had increased kernels per spike, while one had fewer kernels per spike. Allelism tests and mapping comparisons indicated that the 27 semidwarfs comprise 18 independent genetic loci. SSR mapping placed these loci {{in five of the}} seven barley chromosomes.

40|$|Earliness is {{a highly}} {{heritable}} trait and selection is an efficient method to decrease days to flowering in maize (Zea mays L.). In many tropical environments, earliness is important for a brief rainy season or for a specific cropping sequence. The evaluation of 15 cycles of selection at 13 environments has been performed {{in the present study}} to measure the direct effect of selection for earliness and the correlated response in other agronomic traits in the Compuesto Seleccion Precoz population;Direct response to selection resulted in a decrease in time to flowering of 0. 5 days per cycle of selection and most of the gain was obtained in the first three cycles of selection. The contribution of homozygotes was more important than of the heterozygotes for the mean of the base population although both were highly significant. Similar tendency was observed for the mean of the selected populations. The genetic drift was highly significant with assortative mating being the probable cause. The additive genetic variance accounted for 89 % of the total genetic variation, based on the performance of cycles per se;Correlated response as a result of selection for earliness caused a decrease in grain yield, plant height, ear height, grain moisture, and leaf area. For the mean of the base population, genes with additive effects determined the major contribution for grain yield, plant height, ear height, root <b>lodging,</b> stalk <b>lodging,</b> <b>grain</b> moisture, and leaf area.

30|$|Plant height, an {{important}} trait in crop improvement, {{is related to}} <b>lodging</b> resistance, <b>grain</b> yield, and biomass production. Reduced plant height and associated lodging resistance are predominant strategies in crop improvement (Ayano et al. 2014). Various factors cause reduced height in plants; gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroids (BRs) are the most widely investigated factors affecting plant height in rice. Many rice GA- and BR-related mutants show dwarf or semi-dwarf phenotypes, such as sd 1, d 1 and d 61 (Sasaki et al. 2002; Fujisawa et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2016; Yamamuro et al. 2000). These dwarf mutants result from reduced cell numbers or cell length in stems, and analyzing more dwarf mutants may provide novel insights into the mechanisms controlling stem elongation.|$|R
40|$|Lodging {{resistance}} of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{can be increased}} by late sowing. However, whether grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) can be maintained with delayed sowing remains unknown. During the 2013 â 2014 and 2014 â 2015 growing seasons, two winter wheat cultivars were sown on three dates (early sowing on October 1, normal sowing on October 8, and late sowing on October 15) to investigate the responses of <b>lodging</b> resistance, <b>grain</b> yield, and NUE to sowing date. No significant differences in <b>lodging</b> resistance, <b>grain</b> yield, or NUE between early and normal sowing were observed. Averaging over the two cultivars and years, postponing the sowing date significantly increased lodging resistance by 53. 6 % and 49. 6 % compared with that following early and normal sowing, respectively. Lodging resistance was improved mainly through {{a reduction in the}} culm height at the center of gravity and an increase in the tensile strength of the base internode. Late sowing resulted in similar grain yield as well as kernel weight and number of kernels per square meter, compared to early and normal sowing. Averaging over the two cultivars and years, delayed sowing resulted in a reduction in nitrogen uptake efficiency (UPE) by 11. 0 % and 9. 9 % compared to early and normal sowing, respectively, owing to reduced root length density and dry matter accumulation before anthesis. An average increase in nitrogen utilization efficiency (UTE) of 12. 9 % and 11. 2 % compared to early and normal sowing, respectively, was observed with late sowing owing to a reduction in the grain nitrogen concentration. The increase in UTE offset the reduction in UPE, resulting in equal NUEs among all sowing dates. Thus, sowing later than normal could increase lodging resistance while maintaining grain yield and NUE.

30|$|In summary, SSR markers {{are very}} useful to find genetic {{variation}} and phylogenetic analysis in different ploidy level, {{but they are}} not a reliable tool to predict heterosis for yield and other complex traits in diploid rice. Autotetraploid lines showed greater genetic differentiations which we can’t find in diploid rice and both have a marked difference in their gene pool. Therefore, these results suggest that autotetraploid rice is an important germplasm for breeding and molecular studies. We could improve the rice cultivars through autotetraploid rice breeding for various important traits because autotetraploid rice had great stability across varying environments, resistant to <b>lodging,</b> greater <b>grain</b> length and width and resistant to insect pest and diseases.

The materials evaluated were S 1 and S 2 lines derived from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 and S 2 lines derived from BS 1 (HS) C 1 in hybrid combinations with B 73 and MO 17. Eight plant and grain traits (kernel shear strength, visual endosperm rating, date of anthesis, harvest moisture, grain breakage, 300 -kernel weight, 300 -kernel volume, and kernel density) were evaluated for the S 1 and S 2 lines from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1. Also, five plant and <b>grain</b> traits (root <b>lodging,</b> stalk <b>lodging,</b> <b>grain</b> breakage, harvest moisture, and grain yield) of BS 1 (HS) C 1 S 2 lines and S 2 line testcross hybrids were evaluated. All materials were grown at two locations, one year for each generation (visual endosperm rating and date of anthesis were evaluated only at Ames);Statistical analyses revealed significant genetic variability in BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 for all traits. Estimated genotype-by-environment variance components for physical grain quality traits were 0 to 66 % as large as the estimated genotypic variance components. Heritability estimates (entry mean basis) for grain breakage ranged from 0. 48 to 0. 67. Nonadditive gene action for grain breakage was indicated by a highly significant S 2 line-by-tester interaction. Because the means of S 2 lines and S 2 line testcross hybrids for grain breakage were similar in magnitude, the presence of nonadditive gene action may be the consequence of bi-directional dominance;The optimum harvest moisture range for physical grain quality preservation was 19 to 26 %. Increasing deviations from this optimum range resulted in increasing grain breakage. Grain resistant to breakage tended to be smaller, denser, and higher in shear strength. Correlations of the same traits between generations indicated that S 1 and S 2 line means would have predictive value for S 2 line and S 2 line testcross hybrid means, respectively. The data indicated that selection of S 1 lines with breakage-resistant grain would result in earlier flowering S 2 lines with smaller kernels. A small, positive correlation between S 2 line grain breakage and S 2 line testcross hybrid yield revealed that selection of S 2 lines with superior physical grain quality could result in lower yielding S 2 line testcross hybrids...|$|R

During the years 1900 - 2003, increases in grain yield of spring barley were generally associated with reduced plant height and improved lodging resistance. An increase in 1000 -grain weight across 100 years was rather small. The genotypes developed between 1972 and 1985, the so-called “Diamant’s set” period, and the genotypes developed later [1985 – 2003], were characterized by improved lodging tolerance, increased yield, and disease resistance. No trend across time was observed for length of vegetative period...|$|R
40|$|Lodging is a {{persistent}} phenomenon that reduces grain quality and grain yield of wheat. It {{is defined as}} the permanent displacement of the plant/shoots from their vertical position. During the Green revolution, wheat plant height was reduced to avoid lodging and allowed growers to increase nitrogen fertilization. This resulted in a considerable increase of grain yield. After the Green Revolution, plant growth regulators were used to further reduce plant height which continued increasing <b>lodging</b> resistance and <b>grain</b> yield. However, <b>lodging</b> susceptibility has not disappeared completely and as yields increase, there is evidence that growers cannot continue to rely on these strategies, raising {{the question of how to}} further improve lodging resistance of wheat. Collaborative studies by physiologists, biologists and engineers generated a deeper understanding of lodging (through stem and anchorage failure mechanisms) and the development of models of the lodging process, together with better crop husbandry or agronomic management strategies. Most of these studies were made on winter wheat under a reduced range of environmental conditions. This thesis attempted to further develop lodging mechanisms and models using spring wheat and a wider range of environmental and agronomic conditions and to investigate the genetic control of lodging-proof traits. Field experiments on spring wheat cultivars were carried out in irrigated conditions in NW Mexico and on a winter wheat Avalon x Cadenza doubled-haploid population in rainfed conditions in the UK. A lodging-proof crop was designed for spring wheat growing in NW Mexico that suggests the need for both increased structural stem biomass and a wider root plate spread (anchorage strength). The model also infers that trade-offs with grain yield will occur, mainly because of overlapping of the development of <b>lodging</b> traits with <b>grain</b> yield formation processes. Rapid selection tools for lodging resistance will play a primary role if lodging resistance is to be improved concurrently with grain yield. Fine mapping and validation of QTLs related to lodging traits identified in this study can be used to develop reliable genetic markers that can accelerate selection for lodging resistance concurrently with improvement of genetic yield potential...|$|R
40|$|A foliar {{fungicide}} efficacy {{trial was}} conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln South Central Agricultural Laboratory near Clay Center, NE. Corn hybrid NK ‘N 68 B’, rating of “fair” (7 out of 9) for gray leaf spot (GLS), not rated for common rust (CR), and “excellent” (2 out of 9) for southern rust (SR), was planted on 15 May in 30 -in. rows at a target population of 31, 763 plants/A. The trial area was disked with corn as the previous year’s crop. Eight treatments and a non-treated control were replicated six times in a randomized complete block design. Each plot was four rows (10 ft) wide by 40 ft in length.... There were significant differences among treatments for SR AUDPC as the nontreated control had a statistically larger SR AUDPC compared to all treatments. Stay green percentages ranged from 50. 7 % to 56. 9 %. Percent lodging ranged from 0. 8 % to 6. 7 %. Grain moisture at harvest ranged from 16. 8 % to 17. 0 %.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different nitrogen application methods on yield and yield components of winter wheat, a field experiment with split plot arrangement in randomized completely blocks design with four replicates was conducted during 2006 - 07. Basal dressing in three levels (with no basal dressing, strip and distributing nitrogen fertilizer) as main plot and top dressing in six levels (distributing on tillering, two distributing on tillering and before spike appearance, water soluble fertilizing with herbicide application before heading, two water soluble fertilizing on tillering and before spike appearance, two application: one distributing on tillering and one water soluble fertilizing before spike appearance and finally, three water soluble fertilizing on tillering, before spike appearance and milking period) as subplot was carried. The amount of fertilizer in strip application was 2 / 3 of distributing method. In the compartmented application, the amount of applied fertilizer was two third of distributing fertilizer method. Leaf dry weight for strip and broadcasting treatments was 18 percent more than no basal nitrogen application treatments. Effect of basal nitrogen application on wheat {{biomass and grain yield}} was not significant, that attributed to wheat <b>lodging.</b> The <b>grain</b> protein percent for strip and broadcasting basal nitrogen application treatments was 15 percent more than protein percent of no basal treatment. Developing cropping systems that use N efficiently is important for reducing costs of N fertilizer inputs and for minimizing nitrate contaminatio...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in maize (Zea mays L.) yields {{have been}} due to {{improvements}} in production inputs as well as to cultivars that have improved performance at low levels of inputs and the ability to respond to high levels of inputs used on today 2 ̆ 7 s farms. The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic rates of gain and inbreeding depression by evaluating populations representative of each of seven eras of maize breeding. Inbred lines representative of each of the six decades (eras) from 1930 to 1980 were intermated to produce six era populations. A seventh, pre- 1930 era, was represented by the open-pollinated cultivars (OP) ‘Reids Yellow Dent’ and ‘Lancaster Sure Crop’. These eight entries along with three check populations were evaluated in six Iowa environments. In addition, to assess changes in the rates of inbreeding depression, S 1 bulk populations of the six era populations and OP and S 2 bulks of the three check populations were also evaluated. The average genetic rate of gain for grain yield was 0. 52 ± 0. 04 Mg ha- 1 era- 1 when OP was included in the analysis. By assuming 10 yr per era, the yearly genetic rate of gain was 0. 052 ± 0. 004 Mg ha- 1. The rates of genetic gain for percentage of stalk <b>lodging</b> and <b>grain</b> moisture at harvest were − 5. 1 ± 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to verify the {{occurrence}} of interaction between common bean genotypes and environments (G×E) in Pernambuco state, and to identify genotypes with high yield adaptability and stability, for environmental stratification and determination of which factors are more important to interaction. Ten trials were conducted in a randomized complete blocks design with three replications during the rainy seasons of 2007 and 2008. Each trial was composed by 16 genotypes from four different grain types: “carioca” (cream with brown stripes), black, cream and “rajado” (cream with red stripes). The data obtained were: grain yield, weight of one hundred grains, anthracnose reaction, plant architecture and <b>lodging</b> tolerance. <b>Grain</b> yield data were used for analysis of variance, for stability and adaptability analysis according to the methodology proposed by Annichiarico, for factor analysis to environmental stratification, and for joint analysis with decomposition of G×E interaction in genotypes by years and genotypes by locals. G×E interactions were observed for two evaluated traits. The genotypes BRS Pontal, of carioca- type, BRS Campeiro and BRS Esplendor, of black-type, and BRS Agreste, of mulatinho-type combine high adaptability, stability and grain yield in Pernambuco. Locals used to common bean evaluation in this region were informative and, therefore, must not to be eliminated. There is interaction between genotypes, locals and years in this region, showing that genotypes must be evaluated in larger possible number of locals and years, in this importance order. ...|$|R
40|$|Soybean genotypes {{grown in}} sub-tropical climate may exhibit lodging. The plant lodging is {{influenced}} by soil type and fertility level, sowing date, latitude and altitude of the location, plant population and conditions of crop development. Plant regulators and herbicides are able to avoid or reduce plant lodging. This study aimed to verify {{the effects of the}} growth regulators TIBA and daminozide on vegetative growth and yield of soybean cultivar CD 214 RR. The experiment was carried out at a field in randomized block design with four replications in a factorial scheme. The A factor was represented by the combination of regulators TIBA and daminozide and its concentrations, and the Factor B was seven times of evaluation of injury and plant height or eight times of evaluation of lodging. In the range of doses used, the application of daminozide resulted in greater injury to soybean plants than TIBA. The smaller plant height was achieved by the application of 6 g ha- 1 of TIBA and 1200 g ha-¹ of daminozide. Treatments with daminozide (100 g ha-¹) and TIBA (10 g ha- 1) stood out due to the reduced lodging of soybean plants. Grain weight increased linearly when the levels of TIBA increased. There was a negative correlation between <b>lodging</b> and <b>grain</b> yield and a positive correlation between plant height and lodging. There was also a negative correlation between injury caused by the application of plant regulators and lodging...|$|R
40|$|In the 1980 s, {{under the}} {{influence}} of the worldwide breeding achievements, the Institute of Agriculture in Каrnobat launched its program for breeding new oat varieties. 80 % of the breeding program included winter oats, and 20 % - spring oats. The goal of these two main directions has been to create genotypes combining high and stable productive potential, high quality grain, complex resistance to stressful effects from abiotic and biotic environmental factors. It is necessary to make specialized collections, to create suitable source material, to adapt and apply new methods and approaches to assess the breeding material and to clarify some genetic and biological issues of theoretical and applied nature, which support the breeding process to realize the set goals. The priority areas in the breeding programs focus on overcoming low winter resistance, drought tolerance and productivity, reduction of the vegetation period, high stem and poor <b>lodging</b> resistance, increased <b>grain</b> quality, and others.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} the results of a {{diagnostic}} study conducted to assess the problems and needs of sorghum farmers in north-east Ghana with the aim of determining the type of research that would be useful for them in their own context. The importance of the crop and its position within the cropping system are identified. Sorghum is still {{an integral part of the}} livelihoods of farmers. The crop is very versatile and not only contributes to food security but also plays a part in the socio-cultural, socioeconomic, and religious aspects of the lives of farmers. Farmers have different uses for the varieties they grow, which depends on the morphological, agronomic and gastronomic traits of the crop. Sorghum varieties introduced from the research institutions have several problems including <b>lodging,</b> poor <b>grain</b> quality, bird damage and precocious germination. Farmers have developed management strategies for dealing with some of these problems. Nevertheless, further work is required by breeders to make the varieties more acceptable to users. Sorghum production constraints identified include poor soils, erratic rainfall and pest infestation of the grain during storage. The diagnostic study suggests that because farmers produce their own seed, enhancing their ability to improve the quality of their seed would be of benefit to them. The study further underscores the importance and value of diversity for farmers. It also highlights their understanding of diversity, and management and use of variation in their agronomic practices. Areas identified for further research together with farmers aim at enhancing farmers' knowledge towards strengthening their practices in diversity management and improving seed storage practices...|$|R
