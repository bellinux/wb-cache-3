50|$|Concavenator had {{structures}} resembling quill knobs on its forearm, {{a feature}} known only in birds and other feathered theropods, such as Velociraptor. Quill knobs {{are created by}} ligaments which attach to the feather follicle, and since scales do not form from follicles, the authors ruled {{out the possibility that}} they could indicate the presence of <b>long</b> <b>display</b> scales on the arm. Instead, the knobs have been thought to probably anchor simple, hollow, quill-like structures. Such structures are known both in coelurosaurs such as Dilong and in some ornithischians like Tianyulong and Psittacosaurus. If the ornithischian quills are homologous with bird feathers, their presence in an allosauroid like Concavenator would be expected. However, if ornithischian quills are not related to feathers, the presence of these structures in Concavenator would show that feathers had begun to appear in earlier, more primitive forms than coelurosaurs. Feathers or related structures would then likely be present in the first members of the clade Neotetanurae, which lived in the Middle Jurassic. No impressions of any kind of integument were found near the arm, although extensive scale impressions were preserved on other portions of the body, including broad, rectangular scales {{on the underside of the}} tail, bird-like scutes on the feet, and plantar pads on the undersides of the feet.|$|E
5000|$|Sculptures, altars, paintings, and statuettes of the Baroque era can {{be found}} in the chancel of the former abbey.

It is home to many statuettes and paintings.The organ case from the abbey church of Gengenbach, which was built in the 1720s, is the showpiece of the museum. The organ itself was attached by the local company M. Welte & Söhne in the year 1935. In the attic one can find paintings from the 19th century by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, Hans Thoma, Anselm Feuerbach and many more. The paintings show the countryside, portraits, genre scenes, allegorical and religious themes. The space which is used to show those pieces of art is around 1.400 square kilometres big, air-conditioned and barrier-free. The basement of the former Augustinian’s church?( [...] Augustinerkirche) contains a modern exhibition hall which is almost 450 square kilometres in area. This hall makes it possible for the city of Freiburg to host special exhibitions according to the international conservational standards. The exhibits of the treasure chamber are again available to the public since the January 22, 2011. The chamber contains gold- and silversmithery manufactured from the 9th to 18th century.

40|$|Stationary objects {{appear to}} move in the {{opposite}} direction to a pursuit eye movement (Filehne illusion) and moving objects appear slower when pursued (Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon). Both illusions imply that extra-retinal, eye-velocity signals lead to lower estimates of speed than corresponding retinal motion signals. Intriguingly, the velocity (i. e. speed and direction) of the Filehne illusion depends on the age of the observer, especially for brief display durations (Wertheim and Bekkering, 1992). This suggests relative signal size changes as the visual system matures. To test the signal-size hypothesis, we compared the Filehne illusion and Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon in young and old observers using short and <b>long</b> <b>display</b> durations. The trends in the Filehne data were similar to those reported by Wertheim and Bekkering. However, we found no evidence for an effect of age or duration in the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. The differences between the two illusions could not be reconciled on the basis of actual eye movements made. The findings suggest a more complicated explanation of the combined influence of age and duration on head-centred motion perception than that described by the signal-size hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{expectation}} and repetition on searching for singletons in very brief displays. In Experiment 1, we found that when a given feature defined the singleton for a whole block— so that in every trial the subject could expect a particular target feature—search accuracy {{was significantly higher than}} when the feature setting was randomly redetermined from trial to trial. However, an unexpected repetition triggered almost no advantage. In Experiment 2, we found no advantage for expected alternation. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that {{there is little or no}} advantage for perception in conditions allowing only for target-feature facilitation or distractor-feature inhibition. We propose that in singleton search a division of feature space facilitates detection, and that this division works best under conditions of expected repetition. Experiment 5 replicated Experiment 1, but in Experiment 5 we examined response times and <b>long</b> <b>display</b> exposures. Results suggested that previous findings of singleton priming reflect mainly postperceptual factors.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Müller—Lyer stimuli on saccade {{amplitude}} varies across studies. One methodological difference between studies is stimulus display time; studies with long stimulus display times tend to report smaller effects than studies with short display times. Is {{it possible that}} <b>long</b> <b>display</b> times might provide conditions in which saccade adaption takes place? Five adult subjects were exposed to runs of the same illusion-inducing Müller—Lyer stimulus, presented for 1 s, interspersed with probe trials in which a point target was presented for 200 ms. While saccade amplitude was consistently larger with ‘in-configurations’ than with ‘out-configurations’ {{at the beginning of}} runs, amplitude declined over runs with the in-configuration. On average, it was constant in out-configuration runs. The net effect was a decline in the apparent effect size (in-amp - out-amp / out-amp) of the Müller—Lyer stimulus. Probe trial saccade amplitude increased in ‘out’ runs and decreased in ‘in’ runs. These effects were not present in control experiments, in which stimulus display time was 200 ms. One explanation for this pattern of results is that long stimulus presentation times allow for the generation of retinal error signals. This in turn leads to saccade adaptation, causing an underestimation of the effect of this type of stimulus on saccade amplitude...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—A salient {{event in}} the visual field tends to at-tract {{attention}} and the eyes. To account {{for the effects of}} salience on visual selection, models generally assume that the human visual system continuously holds information concerning the relative salience of objects in the visual field. Here we show that salience in fact drives vision only during the short time interval immediately following the onset of a visual scene. In a saccadic target-selection task, human performance in making an eye movement to the most salient element in a display was accurate when re-sponse latencies were short, but was at chance when re-sponse latencies were long. In a manual discrimination task, performance in making a judgment of salience was more accurate with brief than with <b>long</b> <b>display</b> dura-tions. These results suggest that salience is represented in the visual system only briefly after a visual image enters the brain. A salient object tends to attract attention and often initiates a subsequent eye movement. This finding has been replicated often and is well established (Itti & Koch, 2001; Theeuwes, Kramer, Hahn, & Irwin, 1998). It demonstrates that visual se-lection is very much influenced by the stimulus properties in the visual field. Current computational, functional, and neuro-physiological models of visual selection account for stimulus-driven effects by assuming that the brain possesses a salience map, a topographical representation of the relative distinctive...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} whether attentional capture by salient but task-irrelevant visual stimuli is triggered in a bottom–up fashion or depends on top–down task settings is still unresolved. Strong support for bottom–up capture was {{obtained in the}} additional singleton task, in which search arrays were visible until response onset. Equally strong evidence for top–down control of attentional capture was obtained in spatial cueing experiments in which display durations were very brief. To demonstrate the critical role of temporal task demands on salience-driven attentional capture, we measured ERP indicators of capture by task-irrelevant color singletons in search arrays that could also contain a shape target. In Experiment 1, all displays were visible until response onset. In Experiment 2, display duration was limited to 200 msec. With <b>long</b> <b>display</b> durations, color singleton distractors elicited an N 2 pc component {{that was followed by}} a late Pd component, suggesting that they triggered attentional capture, which was later replaced by location-specific inhibition. When search arrays were visible for only 200 msec, the distractor-elicited N 2 pc was eliminated and was replaced by a Pd component in the same time range, indicative of rapid suppression of capture. Results show that attentional capture by salient distractors can be inhibited for short-duration search displays, in which it would interfere with target processing. They demonstrate that salience-driven capture is not a purely bottom–up phenomenon but is subject to top–down control...|$|E
