60|$|Schools {{were not}} {{abundant}} in 1815; and, after learning to read, spell, sew, and cipher {{a little at}} some dame school, girls were left to pick up knowledge as they could; while the brothers went to college, or were apprenticed to some trade. But the few things they did study were well learned; so that Abby's reading was a pleasure to hear. She wrote a fine, clear hand, seldom misspelled a word, kept her own little account-book in good order, and already made her father's shirts, hemstitching the <b>linen</b> <b>cambric</b> ruffles with the daintiest skill, and turning out button-holes any one might be proud of. These accomplishments did not satisfy her, however, and she longed to know much more,--to do and be something great and good,--with the sincere longing of an earnest, thoughtful girl.|$|E

'This,' {{said the}} fellow, {{producing}} one, 'this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing {{all sorts of}} stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, <b>linen,</b> <b>cambric,</b> cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she's cured at once--for it's poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question--for it's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, {{and a great deal}} nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!' ...|$|E

It's true, I wasn't at home; but Rosamond told me you hadn't a word to say against the engagement. And she has begun to buy in the best <b>linen</b> and <b>cambric</b> for her underclothing." ...|$|R
50|$|Batiste is a {{balanced}} plain weave, a fine cloth made from cotton or <b>linen</b> such as <b>cambric.</b> Batiste was {{often used as}} a lining fabric for high-quality garments. Batiste is also used for handkerchiefs (cotton batiste) and lingerie (batiste de soie).|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages {{the city}} grew richer and larger {{thanks to its}} weaving {{industry}} which produced woollen cloth, <b>linen</b> and <b>cambric.</b> Cambrai, {{and in particular the}} drapery, experienced an economic decline from the 15th century. Cambrai then belonged to a commercial hansa of seventeen low country cities whose aim was to develop trade with the fairs in Champagne and Paris. By the 11th century the city walls had reached the circumference they would keep until the 19th century.|$|R

[...] "I wish some of your {{northern}} servants could look at her closets of dresses,--silks and muslins, and one real <b>linen</b> <b>cambric,</b> she has hanging there. I've worked sometimes whole afternoons, trimming her caps, and getting her ready to go to a party. As to abuse, she don't know what it is. She never was whipped more than once or twice in her whole life. She has her strong coffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it. It's abominable, to be sure; but St. Clare will have high life below-stairs, and they every one of them live just as they please. The fact is, our servants are over-indulged. I suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish, and act like spoiled children; but I've talked to St. Clare till I am tired." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ruffs were {{primarily}} made from <b>linen</b> <b>cambric,</b> stiffened with starch imported from the Low Countries. Later ruffs were also sometimes made entirely from lace. However, lace was expensive {{since it was}} a new fabric, developed in the early sixteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|White <b>linen</b> <b>cambric</b> or batiste from Cambrai, {{noted for}} its weight and luster, was [...] "preferred for ecclesiastical wear, fine shirts, underwear, shirt frills, cravats, collars and cuffs, handkerchiefs, and infant wear". Technical use {{sometime}} introduced a difference between cambric and batiste, the latter being of a lighter weight and a finer thread count. Chambray, though {{the same type of}} fabric, had a coloured warp and a white weft, though it could be [...] "made from any colour as you may wish, in the warp, and also in the filling; only have them differ from each other.|$|E
50|$|Baron Conway gave a {{site for}} weaving workshops, and Irish {{apprentices}} were taken on. Dutchmen were engaged to teach flax-growing to farmers, and to superintend bleaching operations. It is not without some reason that Crommelin has been credited with originating, as regards Ulster, a system of technical education for the textile art. Crommelin was assisted by his brothers, and the <b>linens</b> and <b>cambrics</b> could replace imported textiles. In 1705 a factory was opened at Kilkenny, under the management of William Crommelin.|$|R
5000|$|The modern town of Dundalk largely {{owes its}} form to Lord Limerick (James Hamilton, later 1st Earl of Clanbrassil) in the 17th century. He {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} streets leading to the town centre; his ideas came from many visits to Europe. In addition to the demolition of the old walls and castles, he had new roads laid out eastwards of the principal streets. The {{most important of these}} new roads connected a newly laid down Market Square, which still survives, with a <b>linen</b> and <b>cambric</b> factory at its eastern end, adjacent to what was once an army cavalry and artillery barracks (now Aiken Barracks).|$|R

Nevertheless, for the {{provision}} of things necessary in domestic life, there developed itself, together with the group of inventive artists exercising these nobler functions, a vast body of craftsmen, and, literally, manufacturers, workers by hand, who associated themselves, as chance, tradition, or the accessibility of material directed, in towns which thenceforward occupied a leading position in commerce, as producers of a staple of excellent, or perhaps inimitable, quality; and the <b>linen</b> or <b>cambric</b> of Cambray, the lace of Mechlin, the wool of Worstead, and the steel of Milan, implied the tranquil and hereditary skill of multitudes, living in wealthy industry, and humble honour.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{garments}} {{for women}} {{consisted of the}} smock, hose, kirtle, gown, surcoat, girdle, cape, hood, and bonnet. Each piece had designated colours and fabrics, for example “Materials used {{in the middle ages}} were woolen cloth, fur, <b>linen,</b> <b>cambric,</b> silk, and the cloth of silver or gold…the richer Middle Age women would wear more expensive materials such as silk, or linen”. The development of the skirt was significant for women’s medieval clothing, “The more fashionable would wear very large or wide skirts”. The petticoat made way for the skirt, which quickly became a popular garment because it “wraps rather than enclosing, touches without grasping, brushes without clasping, coasts, caresses, skims, strokes”.|$|E

[Sidenote: Sir Percival beholds the grail] For on {{the third}} day (which was Christmas day) it chanced that Sir Percival sat alone in the hall of the castle, and he meditated upon the great sorrow that lay upon him. And as he sat thus this very {{wonderful}} thing befell him: He suddenly beheld two youths enter that hall. And the faces of the two youths shone with exceeding brightness, and their hair shone like gold, and their raiment was very bright and glistering like to gold. One of these youths bare in his hand a spear of mighty size, and blood dropped from the point of the spear; and the other youth bare in his hand a chalice of pure gold, very wonderful to behold, and he held the chalice in a napkin of fine <b>cambric</b> <b>linen.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{when the}} next morning had come, Sir Ewaine arose greatly refreshed, and by and by Elose came to him with food with which to break his fast. And after he had broken his fast she brought a bowl of ivory with tepid water, and she brought a razor with a heft of ivory studded with gold, and she hung a fine linen towel upon her {{shoulder}} and she shaved Sir Ewaine so that his face was both fresh and clean. After that she brought him fine raiment--an undervest of soft <b>cambric</b> <b>linen</b> and a surcoat and hose of azure silk embroidered with silver, and a cloak with a clasp of gold, and with pears of silver hanging from the corners thereof. And she brought a circlet of gold for his head, such as became {{the son of a}} king. Then she looked upon Sir Ewaine and he was very comely.|$|R
