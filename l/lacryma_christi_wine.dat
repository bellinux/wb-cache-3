Red <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> is made from Piedirosso and Sciascinoso grapes. It is also, as archaeologists have discovered, the nearest equivalent to wine drunk by the Ancient Romans, having analysed microscopic residue left on the taps of the casks.|$|R

In the Rogue River Valley appellation of Oregon in the U. S., a varietal wine is made from local Caprettone grapes.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> {{comes from}} an old myth that Christ, crying over Lucifer's fall from heaven, cried his tears on the land and gave divine {{inspiration}} to the vines that grew there. The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by past lava flows, and its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages and covered with vineyards.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> {{is an old}} wine, {{frequently}} mentioned by poets and writers. <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> was mentioned in the book by Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo, in W. J. Turner's poem Talking with Soldiers, in Candide by Voltaire, and by Christopher Marlowe in his play Tamburlaine the Great, Part II. The Irish periodical writer and journalist William Maginn mentions the wine amongst other spirits in his poem [...] "Inishowen" [...] c. 1822. In the late work of the German novelist Theodor Fontane [...] "Der Stechlin" [...] (1898) the wine is mentioned to be served after lunch in a convent and is characterized to be of higher grade than a Montefiascone. The Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch mentions the wine together with the island of Capri in his 1987 novel [...] "The Pupil". In the short story [...] "Rappaccini's Daughter" [...] collected in Mosses from an Old Manse and Other Stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne, a glass of lachryma is drunk by the protagonist [...] "which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies".|$|R

50|$|Vesuvio DOC - Large DOC {{based in}} the {{volcanic}} soils around Mt. Vesuvius. The white wines are composed primarily of Coda di Volpe (35-80%) with Verdeca permitted up to 45% and Falanghina and Greco up to 20%. Grapes destined for DOC wines must be kept to a maximum yield of 10 tonnes/ha with the finished product attaining a minimum alcohol level of 11%.

5000|$|In The Great Warrior Skanderbeg, a Soviet-Albanian {{production}} of 1953, the wine is {{mentioned as a}} symbol of feudal luxury enjoyed by sybaritic enemies of the protagonist, the popular and prudent ruler of Albania who defeated Venice in the 1447-48 war and stalled the advance of the Ottoman Empire.

50|$|The Italian gastronome Platina, in De honesta voluptate et valetudine (1475), {{says that}} the best vino greco was made at San Gimignano (Non improbatur et graecum, maxime vero quod in oppidum Geminianum in Hetruria nascitur), but he is careful to {{distinguish}} it from the still-famous Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Vino greco or wine Greek is described by several authors as being made {{on the slopes of}} Mount Vesuvius; one such traveller is the scientist John Ray, writing in 1673.

5000|$|Ercolano [...] is a {{town and}} comune in the Metropolitan City of Naples, Campania of Southern Italy. It lies at the western foot of Mount Vesuvius, on the Bay of Naples, just {{southeast}} {{of the city of}} Naples. The medieval town of Resina - read Resìna - was built on the volcanic material left by the eruption of Vesuvius (79 CE) that destroyed the ancient city of Herculaneum, from which the present name is derived. Ercolano is a resort and the starting point for excursions to the excavations of Herculaneum and for the ascent of Vesuvius by bus. The town also manufactures leather goods, buttons, glass, and the <b>wine</b> known as <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> (Tears of Christ).|$|R
50|$|Verdeca {{is a white}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety that is {{primarily}} grown in the Colli Piacentini region of Emilia-Romagna in central Italy and Apulia in southern Italy where ampelographers believe that the grape may have originated. In Apulia, {{it is one of}} the main grapes in the Denominazione di origine controllata wines of Locorotondo DOC and Martina Franca DOC along with Bianco d'Alessano. In Campania, it is grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius where it used as a blending variety with Falanghina, Coda di volpe and Greco in both the white wines and the sweet dessert wine of the region, <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi.</b> It is also a minor component used in the some vermouth production.|$|R
25|$|Greco bianco is {{most widely}} found in {{southern}} Italy {{where it is}} featured in several DOCs. In 2006, it numbered less than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of the varieties planted. In Calabria, a specific clone of Greco bianco is used to produce the sweet dessert wine Greco di Bianco, made in a partial passito style from grapes that have been partially dried after harvest. On the island of Capri, Greco is usually blended with Biancolella and Falanghina to produce dry-style wines. In Apulia, it is a permitted blend component in the Gravina DOC. In Campania, it is featured in the DOCG wine of Greco di Tufo produced around the town of Tufo, Provincia di Avellino. It is also permitted in <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> produced {{on the slopes of}} Mount Vesuvius.|$|R

50|$|The second {{transition}} era {{began in}} 1993 by bands such as LArc-en-Ciel, Glay (although formed in 1988, their first album {{was released in}} 1994), Kuroyume, Malice Mizer and Siam Shade. They gained mainstream awareness, although they were not as commercially successful, except for LArc-en-Ciel and Glay whose later huge success was also accompanied by a drastic change in their appearance and were often not associated with visual kei. Around 1995 the visual kei bands experienced a booming success in the general population. It lasted four years, when began the third transition era by bands such as <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi,</b> Penicillin, Shazna and Dir en Grey with moderate success. During the 1990s emerged some subgenres, local Nagoya kei (with more emphasize on music rather than fashion), and several conceptual like Eroguro kei (notably band Cali Gari), Angura kei (underground style, wearing traditional kimono or Japanese uniform), and Ouji kei or Kodona kei (prince/boy style, notably Plastic Tree).|$|R

They {{used to give}} me cinnamon when I had a cold--quite useless, but not disagreeable. One poured it drop by drop out of narrow bottles, a golden liquor, fierce and fiery. On the label was a list of its virtues, and among other things it was described as being in the highest degree carminative. I adored the word. 'Isn't it carminative?' I {{used to say to}} myself when I'd taken my dose. It seemed so wonderfully to describe that sensation of internal warmth, that glow, that--what shall I call it?--physical self-satisfaction which followed the drinking of cinnamon. Later, when I discovered alcohol, 'carminative' described for me that similar, but nobler, more spiritual glow which wine evokes not only in the body but in the soul as well. The carminative virtues of burgundy, of rum, of old brandy, of <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi,</b> of Marsala, of Aleatico, of stout, of gin, of champagne, of claret, of the raw new wine of this year's Tuscan vintage--I compared them, I classified them. Marsala is rosily, downily carminative; gin pricks and refreshes while it warms. I had a whole table of carmination values. And now"--Denis spread out his hands, palms upwards, despairingly--"now I know what carminative really means." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 9th century a Trieste bishop {{ordered a}} small church {{to be built}} in Gasello {{dedicated}} to Saint Apollinare del Gasello. In 1072, Bishop Adalger gave the church of Saint Apollinare with surrounding properties to the Benedictine Monastery of Saint Niccolo of Venice. The Benedictines expanded their territory toward Koper and down to Poreč throughout the western part of Istria. The monastery was expanded several times, and later renamed to San Niccolo (Sveti Nikolaj). Gradually a few farms emerged around the main complex, and the monastery itself promoted grape and olive cultivation. The San Niccolo wines were sold to Filippo Maria Visconti and Litta, among others, and trading was conducted in the 16th century even to the German lands as Lacrimae <b>Christi</b> <b>wines.</b> Apparently the monastery also produced olive oil because olive oil storage tanks were found near today's Hotel Convent. In 1572 a Guelf-style belltower was built on the complex itself, and the church gained a new name: San Niccolo d'Oltre, later San Niccolo d'Oltra, to distinguish it from its Koper counterpart.|$|R
50|$|The {{early history}} of Chianti is very much {{intertwined}} {{with the history of}} the entire Tuscany region. The history of viticulture in the area dates back to its settlements by the Etruscans in the eighth century BC. Amphora remnants originating from the region show that Tuscan wine was exported to southern Italy and Gaul as early as the seventh century BC before both areas begun to actively cultivate grape vines themselves. From the fall of the Roman Empire and throughout the Middle Ages, monasteries were the main purveyors of wines in the region. As the aristocratic and merchant classes emerged, they inherited the sharecropping system of agriculture known as mezzadria. This system took its name from the arrangement whereby the landowner provides the land and resources for planting in exchange for half ("mezza") of the yearly crop. Many landowners in the Chianti region would turn their half of the grape harvest into wine that would be sold to merchants in Florence. The earliest reference of Florentine wine retailers dates to 1079 with a guild for wine merchants being created in 1282.Unlike France or Spain, Italy did not have a robust export market for its wines during the Middle Ages. Its closest trading partners, France and Austria, were separated from Italy by the massive Alps Mountains and also had ample supply of their own local wines.

60|$|March.--Embarked on an {{excursion}} to Paestum, with Sir William Gell and Mr. Laing-Meason, {{in order}} to see the fine ruins. We went out by Pompeii, which we had visited before, and which fully maintains its character {{as one of the most}} striking pieces of antiquity, where the furniture treasure and household are preserved in the excavated houses, just as found by the labourers appointed by Government. The inside of the apartments is adorned with curious paintings, if I may call them such, in mosaic. A meeting between Darius and Alexander is remarkably fine.[520] A street, called the street of Tombs, reaches a considerable way out of the city, having been flanked by tombs on each side as the law directed. The entrance into the town affords an interesting picture of the private life of the Romans. We came next to the vestiges of Herculaneum, which is destroyed like Pompeii but by the lava or molten stone, which cannot be removed, whereas the tufa or volcanic ashes can be with ease removed from Pompeii, which it has filled up lightly. After having refreshed in a cottage in the desolate town, we proceed on our journey eastward, flanked by one set of heights stretching from Vesuvius, and forming a prolongation of that famous mountain. Another chain of mountains seems to intersect our course in an opposite direction and descends upon the town of Castellamare. Different from the range of heights which is prolonged from Vesuvius, this second, which runs to Castellamare, is entirely composed of granite, and, as is always the case with mountains of this formation, betrays no trace of volcanic agency. Its range was indeed broken and split up into specimens of rocks of most romantic appearance and great variety, displaying granite rock as the principal part of its composition. The country on which these hills border is remarkable for its powers of vegetation, and produces vast groves of vine, elm, chestnut, and similar trees, which grow when stuck in by cuttings. The vines produce <b>Lacryma</b> <b>Christi</b> in great quantities--not a bad wine, though the stranger requires to be used to it. The sea-shore of the Bay of Naples forms the boundary on the right of the country through which our journey lies, and we continue to approach to the granite chain of eminences which stretch before us, as if to bar our passage.|$|R
