It is common for vendors to offer extensions to AMD for various non-standard features, although dependency on these extensions undermines interoperability. As in all interoperability scenarios, care should be taken to determine if this is acceptable before using such extensions.|$|R
50|$|Protection {{architectures}} like Path {{protection and}} <b>Link</b> <b>protection</b> safeguard the above-mentioned networks from {{different kinds of}} failures. In path protection, a backup path is used from the source to its destination to bypass the failure. In <b>Link</b> <b>protection,</b> the end nodes of the failed link initiate the protection. These nodes detect the fault and are responsible to initiate the protection mechanisms in order to detour the affected traffic from the failed link onto predetermined reserved paths. Other types of protection are channel-, segment- and p-cycle protection.|$|E

40|$|Protection {{of victims}} and {{prosecution}} of traffickers are established as core principles in international and national anti-trafficking policies. In this article, {{we discuss the}} dilemmas of <b>linking</b> <b>protection</b> of victims (a term that includes social protection) to their cooperation with authorities, using Norway as a case. Our analysis of the Norwegian case is {{based on interviews with}} victims of trafficking, social workers, police and prosecutors, and examination of court decisions on cases of trafficking. The <b>linking</b> of <b>protection</b> and prosecution is anchored in international conventions and directives. While this is often framed as a mutual advantage for both protection and prosecution, in reality both goals may suffer. We discuss how the goal of prosecution affects assistance available to different groups of victims. It creates unequal access to assistance and different preconditions for well-being and predictability, depending on how useful their information about traffickers is perceived to be, and police capacity to investigate. We then move on to discuss how the incentive of protection for cooperation is interpreted and dealt with in the justice system. Victims who receive assistance and have a chance of getting permanent residence permits in exchange for their testimonies are considered to be less reliable and credible witnesses. This also brings into question how victims of trafficking are understood and constituted as witnesses. We discuss these issues in light of a broader literature on gender, law and victimhood...|$|R

50|$|The 2.x {{version of}} HDCP {{is not a}} {{continuation}} of HDCPv1, and is rather a completely different <b>link</b> <b>protection.</b> Version 2.x employs industry-standard encryption algorithms, such as 128-bit AES with 3072 or 1024-bit RSA public key and 256-bit HMAC-SHA256 hash function. While all of the HDCP v1.x specifications support backwards compatibility to previous versions of the specification, HDCPv2 devices may interface with HDCPv1 hardware only by natively supporting HDCPv1, or by using a dedicated converter device. As a result, there is currently no deployment plan for v2 to replace v1 in existing systems. This means that HDCPv2 {{is only applicable to}} new technologies.

It is a packet-based network technology that provides a framework for recovery {{through the creation of}} point to point paths called Label Switched Paths (LSP). These LSPs creation are between a head-end and a tail-end Label Switch Router (LSR). In the former case, the head-end router is the input or ingress router. In the latter case the tail-end represents the output or egress router in the path. There are a few protection techniques for MPLS very similar in the general concept to those for Optical Mesh Networks, such as <b>link</b> <b>protection</b> (e.g., MPLS local protection) and path protection.

40|$|One notable {{feature of}} Arab {{broadcasting}} {{has been the}} belated emergence of free-to-air channels for children. Today, with children’s channels a still-expanding feature of the Arab satellite television landscape, the region is witnessing growth in the local animation industry alongside intensified competition for child audiences through imported content and a selective squeeze on state funds. In this context the policies and rationales that inform production and acquisition of children’s content remain far from transparent, beyond occasional public rhetoric about protecting children from material that ‘breaches cultural boundaries and values’ and providing programmes that revere a perceived ‘Arab-Islamic’ heritage and preserve literary forms of the Arabic language. Attempts at promoting children’s genuine participation in Arab television have been rare. Drawing on theoretical literature that <b>links</b> <b>protection</b> and participation {{in the sense that}} children’s safety depends on their agency, this paper explores emerging guidelines developed by Arab regulators, broadcasters and others in relation to television content for children...|$|R

This strategy simultaneously addresses the problem of routing working traffic, determining multi-backup paths for each single link failure.
