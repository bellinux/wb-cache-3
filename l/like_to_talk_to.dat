500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gives George Park, Fred O'Dwyer, and Milton Greene a tour around the backstage area of TGS. Fred tells Kenneth that he resembles a man he served with in the service, which Kenneth says [...] "Well, obviously that's a coincidence. How could I be in Normandy?". Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served. Jack shows up where Kenneth and the three men are, and tells Kenneth that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Milton, prompting Kenneth to tell Jack [...] "As head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request." [...] Jack and Milton are then seen at Jack's office.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her third}} divorce, Lake drifted between cheap hotels in New York City, and was arrested several times for public {{drunkenness}} and disorderly conduct. In 1962, a New York Post reporter found her {{living at the}} all-women's Martha Washington Hotel in Manhattan, working as a waitress downstairs in the cocktail lounge. She was working under the name [...] "Connie de Toth". Lake said she took the job in part because [...] "I like people. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them".|$|E
2500|$|Ponting also {{responded to}} Lillee's {{comments}} that Shane Warne should be captain, {{and that he}} made more decisions than Ponting during the series: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{a lot of guys}} out on the field and use their ideas and thoughts. I'll go to Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) and even Matty Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn... The way I think {{is not going to be}} right 100 percent of the time, but that's the way I do it. Warne has got a cricket brain as good as anybody around. But I wouldn't agree [...]" ...|$|E

6000|$|On {{returning}} to the waiting-room, he addressed a characteristic question to the assembled visitors. [...] "More humbug?" [...] asked the gentleman who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a pretty woman.|$|R
2500|$|... "There was a {{guy named}} Dan Jones who was then about 60years old, who was a wino {{who lived in a}} fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the man who saved his life. They told me they had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say hello and he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course. There are one or {{two things}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about.|$|E

5000|$|Adriano Ramos (Konstantino Atan): He {{has very}} crazy dreams, which make him sleep during class time. In his room, he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> an old sock, named Chulé (Portuguese word for [...] "stinky feet"), and a chair name Senhor Cadeirudo ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why in {{the name}} of common sense," [...] I cried, turning {{suddenly}} around in my chair and facing Walkirk, [...] "did you put into Miss Raynor's head all that stuff about typewriting? Did you do it simply because you <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her?" ...|$|R
50|$|Mr. Renê Magalhães (Gustavo Wabner): Is {{the music}} teacher at Mundial School. He knows Ms. Suzana from college. He likes Ms. Suzana as a friend, so he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. However, he has a crush on Ms. Helena. The {{students}} of the third grade love him, so they always behave during his class.|$|R

60|$|Twinkle {{was glad}} to see them go. She didn't care much for the woodchuck children, they were so wild and ill-mannered, and their mother was even more disagreeable than they were. As for Mister Woodchuck, she did not object to him so much; in fact, she rather <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, for his words were polite and his eyes {{pleasant}} and kindly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] said Mrs. Lapham, deeply pleased inwardly, but {{not going}} to show it, as she would have said. [...] "I guess you want to build there yourself." [...] She insensibly got a little nearer to her husband. They <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other in that blunt way; it is the New England way of expressing perfect {{confidence}} and tenderness.|$|R
50|$|Josh <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> his {{deceased}} {{mother at}} the makeup desk at Bloomingdale's. His mother would go there once a month <b>to</b> buy makeup and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the woman who worked there. Josh sits on a chair and <b>talks</b> out loud <b>to</b> his mother. He waits for the next voice he hears and whatever they say is his answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Courage," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "you are a {{sensible}} man, and a man of honor. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you confidentially." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drop {{in on me}} sometime," [...] he said, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--Hodder heard a {{voice behind}} him, and turned. A servant was {{standing}} there.|$|E

25|$|QOTW Off Topic {{was invented}} for those users of QOTW who found they had {{things in common}} and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other using the reply system. Over several weeks {{it became clear that}} more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already set up, so Off Topic was created.|$|R
60|$|He had female acquaintances in Plainton, {{but not one}} of {{them seemed}} to have the {{qualifications}} he would desire in a wife. Willy Croup was a good-natured and pleasant woman, and he always <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, but she was too old for him. He might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> adopt her as a maiden aunt, but then that would not be practicable, for Mrs. Cliff would not be willing to give her up.|$|R

6000|$|... "Say, is that Earl Portney?" [...] {{came from}} within, and both Earl and Randy {{recognized}} Jasper Guardley's voice. [...] "If it is, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} thought that I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you again," [...] she said, immediately. [...] "It seems {{strange to me}} how many things I said to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I left {{it until}} it was too late," [...] she answered. [...] "Walk a little way with me," [...] she added abruptly. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Each {{of those}} two <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the other {{as a sort of}} fellow- captive, solacing {{themselves}} with discussions over the 'Censor' and its fellows. Love is not often the first thought, even where it lurks in modern intellectual intercourse between man and maid; and though Kitty Varley might giggle, the others thought the idea only worthy of her. Aunt Jane, however, smelt out the notion, and could not but communicate it to her sister, though adding—- ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the very Saturday on which Lothair was to pay his visit to Vauxe, riding in the park, he was joined by that {{polished}} and venerable nobleman who presides over the destinies of art in Great Britain. This distinguished person had taken rather a fancy <b>to</b> Lothair, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about the Phoebus family; about the great artist himself, and all his theories and styles; but especially about the fascinating Madame Phoebus and the captivating Euphrosyne.|$|R
60|$|He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you {{of what he}} {{had found}} {{characteristic}} in your work, to analyze you to yourself; and the very modesty of the man, which made such a study impersonal {{as far as he was}} concerned, sometimes rendered him insensible to the sufferings of his subject. He had a keen perception of humor in others, but he had very little humor; he had a love of the beautiful in literature which was perhaps sometimes greater than his sense of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{be able to}} {{ride and}} take care of myself in a day or two," [...] went on Duane. [...] "Then I'll go--I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about Jennie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Telephone me," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "and if I can get off, I will. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. You {{have more}} sense than most women I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is too bad, Doctor. I {{was very}} interested. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{people who can}} think of {{something}} besides races and balls and the gossip of the station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, don't you?" [...] said Tessa, [...] "but {{you must}} not tell anybody. Shall I fetch you a bit of cold sausage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You use {{the proper}} term, sir. Mr. Hall thinks Mike has no {{personal}} hatred of Moore. Mike says he even <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him and run after him, {{but he has}} a hankering that Moore should be made an example of. He was extolling him to Mr. Hall the other day as the mill-owner with the most brains in Yorkshire, and for that reason he affirms Moore should be chosen as a sacrifice, an oblation of a sweet savour. Is Mike Hartley in his right mind, do you think, sir?" [...] inquired Sweeting simply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dog tired, but feelin' fine," [...] he replied. [...] "I've got a meetin' {{at eight}} an' I need a rest. Reckon I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> smoke--an' <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--if you don't mind." ...|$|R
