25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral <b>locking</b> <b>arm</b> as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E
500|$|Escapement, hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks): Although the {{escapement}} mechanism was first invented by the Greek Philon of Byzantium for a mechanical washstand, an {{escapement mechanism}} for clockworks was first {{developed by the}} Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) for his water-powered celestial globe {{in the tradition of}} the Han dynasty polymath and inventor Zhang Heng (78–139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the clock towers developed by the military engineer Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor Su Song (1020–1101). Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a striking clock. Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating pendulum resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of gravity and hydraulics. In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical waterwheel (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a clepsydra tank. When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a <b>locking</b> <b>arm,</b> the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had [...] "only the name in common" [...] with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum) [...] device of earlier mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|A multi-bay {{electrical}} connector is described, {{of the type}} that has a frame (12, FIG. 2) with cavities (14) that each holds a separate module 20, which enables quick withdrawal of a single module from the frame and its quick replacement. A <b>lock</b> <b>arm</b> (42) is slidable along a first side (50) of a first cavity, and {{has at least one}} lock lug (80). A first module has a barrier part (70) that lies inward of the lock lug, which prevents outward movement of the first module out of the frame cavity. The <b>lock</b> <b>arm</b> can be moved to an unlocked position wherein the barrier part on the module lies inward of a gap (84) in the <b>lock</b> <b>arm</b> to permit the module to be pulled out of the frame cavity and later inserted therein. A latch (54) is slidable on the frame in directions (A, B) perpendicular to the sliding movement of the <b>lock</b> <b>arm,</b> and has an abutment (112, FIG. 5) that abuts a shoulder (114) on the <b>lock</b> <b>arm</b> to keep the <b>lock</b> <b>arm</b> in its unlocked position until the latch is released...|$|R
