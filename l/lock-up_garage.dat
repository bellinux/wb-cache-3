2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 May, he was found hanged in a deserted <b>lock-up</b> <b>garage</b> he had broken into, in Shoreditch, London, after visiting Chariots Roman Spa, a local gay sauna. In his suicide note, he denied the charges, stating that the sex was consensual, {{and that he had}} fled to England because he felt he could not get a fair trial because of his homosexuality, and he added: [...] "I {{realised}} that I had already been presumed guilty. I do not want to give any more embarrassment to my friends and family." [...] An inquest held in London on 9 September heard evidence from a Scotland Yard detective that the Americans made no request for Fashanu to be found or arrested, and the Coroner stated that he was not a wanted man at the time he hanged himself. The Times and the BBC reported that an arrest warrant had been issued by Howard County District Court on 3 April, that he had been charged with second-degree sexual assault and first-degree and second-degree assaults punishable by up to 20 years in jail, and that Howard County police would have requested his extradition had they known he fled to England. The inquest recorded a verdict of suicide.|$|E

It may be noted that Bretch Hill Road may have remained a long cul-de-sac and not reached the main road if the long planned Banbury by-pass had gone ahead in the 1970s. The housing around Appleby Close {{was built in the}} 1970s and might have been replaced by a proposed link between the by-pass and Bretch Hill, if the project had gone ahead.

However, {{at the time of his}} death, he was being investigated by the police as part of an inquiry into a suspected large-scale fraud and it is speculated that fear of being re-imprisoned could have led to a suicide attempt. Edwards was survived by his wife and their daughter.|$|E
5000|$|Cliffside was {{equipped}} with all modern conveniences including built-in furniture, dining nooks and serverys, electric refrigerators, electric hot water, water softening and incinerator and laundry chutes. The design of the building maximised privacy, views, light and the flow of air. Each of the eight flats had their own private entrance and floors were sound-proofed. The slope of the site was used to advantage so that {{no more than one}} and a half flights of stairs had to be scaled to gain access to any one of them. Plumbing connections were housed in a special duct with access from outside the building so that maintenance and repairs could take place without bothering the tenants. A caretaker's quarters was part of the original design, as was the provision of <b>lock-up</b> <b>garages.</b> The building was designed in the popular interwar style of English Revival or Tudor Revival with elements such as eaves and bay windows having a half-timbered appearance. As the promotional literature stated, Cliffside was [...] "the newest, the best and the most attractive offering in Brisbane".|$|R
5000|$|This was {{followed}} {{a month later}} by the killing of another Catholic barman, Paul McCartan (52), who was abducted by the unit and brought to a UDA [...] "romper room" [...] for a [...] "rompering". These notorious UDA [...] "romper rooms" [...] had been invented by UDA brigadier Davy Payne in the early 1970s. They were located inside disused buildings, <b>lock-up</b> <b>garages</b> or rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. Once inside, a victim would be [...] "rompered" [...] (brutally beaten and tortured), and then killed. After {{other members of the}} unit savagely beat McCartan, Baker then shot him to death. According to a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) report, members of a foot patrol had stopped a drunk McCartan as he walked along the Newtownards Road shortly before his abduction but had let him pass after he refused a lift home. However, Baker would later claim that the police had picked him up and had left him off just fifty yards away from where they knew the UDA gang was waiting.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{they are}} officially {{part of the}} Bretch Hill estate, they were {{originally}} created as separate entities in the late 1960s to early 1970s and mid-1970s to early 1980s respectively. Trinity Close was mostly built between 1973 and 1975. Powys Grove is near the Barley Mow Pub and Trinity Close is opposite the North Oxfordshire Academy school. The sense of separation caused by the large Trinity park lead to a local community, whose original inhabitants saw as separate from the then yet to be completed Bretch Hill, indeed, Sandford Green and Wythicombe Drive were near to them, across the field come park in the mid-1970s as the 1973, 1977 and 1983 Ordnance Survey maps help illustrate. It is also to {{be noted that the}} Bretch Hill Road may have remained a long cul-de-sac not reached the main road near the Drayton School or have had Appelby and Penrith Closes added to it, if the long planned Banbury by-pass had gone ahead in the early to mid-1980s.

The particular engine used was a Mk 8 from a Gloster Meteor of around 3,500 pounds thrust. The ladder chassis was also acquired as surplus, from Noble's employers GKN Sankey. The extremely tight project budget was initially funded by Noble selling his own car, a Triumph TR6. The direct costs of the project, estimated afterwards, were at around £1,500, including £1,100 for the TR6 Sponsorship was acquired {{from a variety of}} small agreements, including sponsorship-in-kind from the tool manufacturer Black & Decker.

2500|$|The Sandy Row women's UDA {{unit was}} disbanded after it {{carried out a}} vicious [...] "romper room" [...] {{punishment}} beating on 24 July 1974 which left 32-year-old Ann Ogilby dead. The body of Ogilby, a Protestant single mother who {{had an affair with}} the husband of one of the unit's members, was found in a ditch five days later. The day of the fatal beating Ogilby was abducted and forced upstairs to the first floor of a disused bakery in Sandy Row that had been converted into a UDA club. Two teenage girls, Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith, acting under Elizabeth Douglas' orders to give Ogilby a [...] "good rompering", punched, kicked, then battered her to death with bricks and sticks; the autopsy later revealed that Ogilby had suffered 24 blows to the head and body. The killing, which was carried out within earshot of Ogilby's six-year-old daughter, caused widespread revulsion throughout Northern Ireland and was condemned by the UDA prisoners serving inside the Maze Prison. None of the other UDA women's units had consented to or been aware of the fatal punishment beating until it was reported in the news. Douglas, Cowan, and Smith were convicted of the murder and sentenced to imprisonment at Armagh Women's Jail. Seven other members of the women's unit and a UDA man were also convicted for their part in the murder. The UDA [...] "romper rooms", named after the children's television programme, were places where victims were beaten and tortured prior to being killed. This was known as a [...] "rompering". The [...] "romper rooms" [...] were normally located in disused buildings, <b>lock-up</b> <b>garages,</b> warehouses, and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. The use of the [...] "romper rooms" [...] was a more common practice among male members of the UDA than their female counterparts.|$|R
2500|$|On 23 July 1974, {{eight weeks}} after Ogilby {{gave birth to}} a {{premature}} son, Derek, fathered by Young, five UDA women, including her lover's wife Elizabeth Young (32), Kathleen Whitla (49, the second-in-command), Josephine Brown (18), Elizabeth Douglas (19), led by the latter's mother, commander Elizabeth [...] "Lily" [...] Douglas, abducted Ogilby from a friend's house in the Suffolk housing estate. They took her back to Sandy Row and put her before a kangaroo court held inside the disused Warwick's Bakery in 114 Hunter Street between Felt Street and Oswald Street, which had been converted into a UDA club. Ogilby had often frequented the club with Young on previous occasions prior to his internment; according to Kiely she had enjoyed the company of the other patrons and being part of the camaraderie of loyalists [...] "against the Fenians". A total of eight women and two men presided over this [...] "trial"; Elizabeth Young, however, had by then absented herself as she was not part of Douglas' [...] "Heavy Squad". The [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] were the members of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit who meted out punishment beatings by Douglas' orders. Ogilby was grilled for an hour over her affair with Young and regarding her calumnies over the food parcels. At some stage, Douglas told her, [...] "We have rules here. We all stick to them and I expect anybody new to do the same". Ogilby, by now frightened at the predicament in which she found herself, was additionally informed that if found guilty, she would be subjected to a [...] "rompering". The notorious UDA [...] "romper rooms" [...] had been invented in the early 1970s by UDA North Belfast Brigadier Davy Payne. Named after the children's television programme, these [...] "romper rooms" [...] were located inside vacant buildings, warehouses, <b>lock-up</b> <b>garages,</b> and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. Once inside, a victim would be [...] "rompered" [...] (beaten and tortured) before being killed. Although most of the victims were Catholics, many Protestants were also consigned to the [...] "romper rooms".|$|R
5000|$|On 3 February 2013, the Irish Independent {{remarked that}} {{although}} Kennerk welcomes plans {{to acknowledge the}} part that Moore Street played during the 1916 Rising, its rejuvenation as a battlefield historical quarter should not {{come at the expense}} of the area's [...] "soul". A broader interpretation of the Casual Trading Act (1995) could facilitate a more viable business model - one that allows traders to engage in the sale of craft goods and finished food products, thus helping to ensure the market's protection as a cultural treasure. Part of Kennerk's vision for the area also includes moving the 'footprint' of the market east into Moore Lane and Henry Place with <b>lock-up</b> facilities and <b>garages</b> turned into businesses, thus helping to recreate a sense of the market district that once existed prior to the 1970s. It could become the Camden Market of Dublin.|$|R
