40|$|Current {{biological}} and medical research {{is aimed at}} obtaining a detailed spatiotemporal map of a live cell's interior to describe and predict cell's physiological state. We present here an algorithm for complete 3 -D modelling of cellular structures from a z-stack of images obtained using label-free wide-field bright-field <b>light-transmitted</b> microscopy. The method visualizes 3 -D objects with a volume equivalent {{to the area of}} a camera pixel multiplied by the z-height. The computation is based on finding pixels of unchanged intensities between two consecutive images of an object spread function. These pixels represent strongly light-diffracting, light-absorbing, or light-emitting objects. To accomplish this, variables derived from Rényi entropy are used to suppress camera noise. Using this algorithm, the detection limit of objects is only limited by the technical specifications of the microscope setup [...] we achieve the detection of objects of the size of one camera pixel. This method allows us to obtain 3 -D reconstructions of cells from bright-field microscopy images that are comparable in quality to those from electron microscopy images.

40|$|A flowing solvent {{photochemical}} reactor was designed, built and tested. A modified ACE {{photochemical reactor}}, lamp and power supply were employed. They were modified {{to accommodate a}} silica column-constrained dispersed coal sample and a solvent flowing through the silica/coal column to sweep away coal extract. Before each experiment the column was packed with the mixture of silica and coal in the annular space around the lamp. A reflective aluminum surface (foil) reflected any <b>light-transmitted</b> through the column for multiple passes back through the sample. A variable speed Rainin Rabbit Plus peristaltic pump was interfaced to an IBM XT computer via a Gilson RS 232 /RS 422 converter. The purpose of the computer control was to vary {{the speed of the}} pump so as to control the absorbance of the solution of coal extract in the solvent. Absorbances at a chosen wavelength were measured by a Spec 21 spectrophotometer with a flow cell connected to the column effluent port. A signal proportional to transmittance from the Spec 21 was delivered to the computer through a Keithley DAS 801 A/D plug-in the computer. The analysis of the Spec 21 signal and control of the pump speed was based on a QuickBasic computer program written by us...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) <b>light-transmitted</b> signals play a {{major role}} in avian {{foraging}} and communication, subserving functional roles in feeding, mate choice, egg recognition, and nestling discrimination. Sequencing functionally relevant regions of the short wavelength sensitive type 1 (SWS 1) opsin gene that is responsible for modulating the extent of SWS 1 UV sensitivity in birds allows predictions to be made about the visual system's UV sensitivity in species where direct physiological or behavioral measures would be impractical or unethical. Here, we present SWS 1 segment sequence data from representative species of three avian lineages for which visually based cues for foraging and communication have been investigated to varying extents. We also present a preliminary phylogenetic analysis and ancestral character state reconstructions of key spectral tuning sites along the SWS 1 opsin based on our sequence data. The results suggest ubiquitous ultraviolet SWS 1 sensitivity (UVS) in both paleognaths, including extinct moa (Emeidae), and parrots, including the nocturnal and flightless kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), and in most, but not all, songbird (oscine) lineages, and confirmed violet sensitivity (VS) in two suboscine families. Passerine hosts of avian brood parasites were included both UVS and VS taxa, but sensitivity did not co-vary with egg rejection behaviors. The results should stimulate future research into the functional parallels between the roles of visual signals and the genetic basis of visual sensitivity in birds and other taxa. No Full Tex...|$|R
60|$|Of {{the more}} special {{appearances}} which the photosphere presents, {{let us take}} first the faculæ. These are ascribed to waves in the photosphere; {{and the way in}} which such waves might produce an excess of light has been variously explained in conformity with various hypotheses. What would result from them in a photosphere constituted and conditioned as above supposed? Traversing a canopy of cloud, here thicker and there thinner, a wave would cause a disturbance very unlikely to leave the thin and thick parts without any change in their average permeability to light. There would probably be, at some parts of the wave, extensions in the areas of the <b>light-transmitting</b> clouds, resulting in the passage of more rays from below. Another phenomenon, less common but more striking, appears also to be in harmony with the hypothesis. I refer to those bright spots, of a brilliancy greater than that of the photosphere, which are sometimes observed. In the course of a physical process so vast and so active as that here supposed to be going on in the Sun, we may expect that concurrent causes will occasionally produce ascending currents much hotter than usual, or more voluminous, or both. One of these, on reaching the stratum of luminous and illuminated cloud forming the photosphere, will burst through it, dispersing and dissolving it, and ascending to a greater height before it begins itself to condense: meanwhile allowing to be seen, through its transparent mass, the incandescent molten shell of the sun's body.|$|E
60|$|The {{conception}} of the Sun's constitution thus set forth, is like that of M. Faye {{in so far as}} the successive changes, the resulting structures, and the ultimate state, are concerned; but unlike it in so far as the Sun is supposed to have reached a later stage of concentration. As I gather from your abstract of M. Faye's paper [this referred to an article in The Reader], he considers the Sun to be at present a gaseous spheroid, having an envelope of metallic matters precipitated in the shape of luminous clouds, the local dispersions of which, caused by currents from within, appear to us as spots; and he looks forward to the future formation of a liquid film as an event that will soon be followed by extinction. Whereas the above hypothesis is that the liquid film already exists beneath the visible photosphere, and that extinction cannot result until, in the course of further aggregation, the gaseous nucleus has become so much reduced, and the shell so much thickened, that the escape of the heat generated is greatly retarded.... M. Faye's hypothesis appears to be espoused by him, partly because it affords an explanation of the spots, which are considered as openings in the photosphere, exposing the comparatively non-luminous gases filling the interior. But if these interior gases are non-luminous from the absence of precipitated matter, must they not for the same reason be transparent? And if transparent, will not the light from the remote side of the photosphere seen through them, be nearly as bright as that of the side next to us? By as much as the intensely-heated gases of the interior are disabled by the dissociation of their molecules from giving off luminiferous undulations, by so much must they be disabled from absorbing the light transmitted through them. And if their great <b>light-transmitting</b> power is exactly complementary to their small light-emitting power, there seems no reason why the interior of the Sun, disclosed to us by openings in the photosphere, should not appear as bright as its exterior.|$|E

50|$|Unusual for bony fish, {{many species}} have a {{modified}} iris called an omega iris. The dorsal {{segment of the}} iris expands downward over the pupil to form a loop which can expand and contract, called an iris operculum; when light levels are high, the pupil reduces in diameter and the loop expands to cover {{the center of the}} pupil, giving rise to a crescent-shaped, <b>light-transmitting</b> partial pupil. This feature gets its name from its similarity to an upside-down uppercase Greek letter omega (Ω). The origins of this structure are unknown, but breaking up the outline of the highly visible eye has been suggested to aid camouflage in what are often highly mottled animals. Species in the tribe Rhinelepini are an exceptional group among loricariids, having a circular iris. The presence or absence of the iris operculum can be used for identification of species in the subfamily Loricariinae.|$|E

40|$|A need {{exists to}} {{investigate}} {{changes in the}} transparency of a <b>light-transmitting</b> surface during simultaneous exposure to a contaminant and an atomic oxygen (AO) flux. This mechanism {{may be responsible for}} the degradation of the <b>light-transmitting</b> surfaces of both photovoltaic cells and photodiodes currently in use on many low-Earth-orbit spacecraft. To address this need, researchers from the Electro-Physics Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field built such a test system within their AO beam facility. This facility produces an effective AO flux of 1. 4 10 (exp 16) atoms/sq cm/sec and contains a three-axis positioning system that provides the motion capability necessary for test operations. During testing, a target surface is held directly within the AO beam and close to two contaminant effusion cells. The effusion cells are shielded from the AO beam, and the outgassing contaminant is constrained to move across the target surface when heat is applied to either of the reservoirs. A light source is periodically moved over the target surface, and the transmitted light intensity is checked with a photodiode located below the target. This light source is also periodically checked with a separate photodiode, which is protected from contamination and AO exposure, to allow adjustments necessary to maintain a consistent light intensity...|$|E
30|$|It is also {{important}} to understand the mechanism underlying the difference in the <b>light-transmitting</b> properties from the far-red to the shorter NIR regions between the species. Differences in the <b>light-transmitting</b> properties have been reported in some wood species [10 – 13]. These differences were attributed to differences in wood density, anatomical structures, and so on. In this study, the difference in light conductive property between T. nucifera and C. obtusa {{does not seem to be}} caused by a difference in wood density (Table  1). To differentiate the effects of wood density on accumulated voltage from the effects of other species-dependent factors (e.g., anatomical structures), we performed an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with density as the covariate and species as the independent variable. The ANCOVA results revealed no significant effect of density (P =  0.63), while significant differences between species were observed (P =  0.046). This indicates that the light conductivity of wood was affected by species-dependent factors rather than by wood density. As differences in light conductance among wood tissues have also been reported in the branches of some wood species [10, 11], anatomical structures are considered to play an important role in light conductance. Anatomical structures are considered to be less severely affected by degradation with long time storage than chemical compositions [1 – 3]. For these reasons, the method that we have developed in this study may have a potential to confirm which species were used for Buddhist statues T. nucifera or C.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between light and <b>light-transmitting</b> objects, known as participating media, involves complex physical phenomena such as light absorption and scattering. Media such as clouds, smoke and translucent materials often feature heterogeneous scattering proper-ties. Hence the radiance transmitted by the medium potentially de-pends on such varying properties {{on the entire}} light paths, yielding soft light shafts and opacity variations (Figure 1). Computing light scattering in these media usually requires com-plex offline computations [Cerezo et al. 2005]. Real-time applica-tions are either based on heavy precomputations [Zhou et al. 2008], limited to homogeneous media [Gautron et al. 2009] or relying on simplistic rendering techniques such as billboards.
