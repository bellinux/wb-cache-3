We explored the long-term impact of increased CO 2 availability on <b>light</b> <b>requirements,</b> productivity, and C allocation in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.). Enrichment of seawater CO 2 increased photosynthesis 3 -fold, but had no long-term impact on respiration.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the development of building envelope design for improved energy performance of a controlled indoor agricultural growing center in a cold climate zone (Canada, 54 ° N). A parametric study is applied to analyze the effects of envelope parameters on the building energy loads for heating, cooling and lighting, required for maintaining growing requirement as obtained in the literature. A base case building of rectangular layout, incorporating conventionally applied insulation and glazing components, is initially analyzed, employing the EnergyPlus simulation program. Insulation and glazing parameters are then modified to minimize energy loads under assumed minimal <b>lighting</b> <b>requirement.</b> This enhanced design forms a base case for analyzing effects of additional design parameters—solar radiation control, air infiltration rate, sky-lighting and the addition of phase change materials—to obtain an enhanced design that minimizes energy loads. A second stage of the investigation applies a high lighting level to the enhanced design and modifies the design parameters to improve performance. A final part of the study is an investigation of the mechanical systems and renewable energy generation. Through the enhancement of building envelope components and day-lighting design, combined heating and cooling load of the low level lighting configuration is reduced by 65 % and lighting load by 10 %, relative to the base case design. Employing building integrated PV (BIPV) system, this optimized model can achieve energy positive status.

As 60  % of the house energy consumption is for electrical appliances, unplugging them rather than just simply turning off the switch has {{a significant effect on}} the house’s electricity consumption. Awareness of this habit is very important to Philippine household owners. Furthermore, using an energy efficient lighting system, particularly the light-emitting diode (LED) lamp could save lighting electricity consumption by up to 69  % as represented by House G. In the Philippine middle to upper class houses, most of the lightings are the florescent-based lamps. In terms of prices, the current price of LED light bulb is around ₱ 85 per watt ($ 1.9 /W) compared to ₱ 10 per watt ($ 0.2 /W). However, in terms of lamp lifespan, the LED light is 30, 000  h compared to 8000  h for the CFL. Hence, price is another factor for mass application of LED lighting. Using a high overall heat transfer coefficient material on the first floor could help support the cooling requirement of the house. The house saves fan and pump energy consumption from the low-grade geothermal cooling of the air supply. Hence, these {{energy conservation}} measures {{have an effect on the}} energy consumption of the house and are important for the development of energy efficient houses for tropical Philippines. Based on the study’s overall results, the present Philippine single family house (House A) needs more improvement in its thermal performance and energy conservation measures. In addition, utilization of alternative energy sources and application of new air-conditioning technologies are important to minimize the house’s energy supply from the grid line and maximize energy conservation. Energy conservation measures (ECM) such as unplugging of un-used electrical appliances are important and are the simplest way to save electricity. Another important measure is to use a high energy efficient lighting system to save more energy for the <b>lighting</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|E
40|$|Improved {{daylighting}} is {{an efficient}} way of utilizing solar energy in buildings. It is relatively cheap {{and more efficient}} than common electric incandescent or fluorescent light. Daylight can be utilized with traditional facades with wall windows, skylight windows, or with multifunctional photovoltaic (PV) solar facades which can produce daylight, heat, and electricity for the building. In this thesis, the optimal use of daylight in solar facades is studied. A new daylight simulation tool, DeLight, developed in the Helsinki University of Technology, {{is used for the}} daylight calculations and optimizations. It is a more accurate tool than the simple daylight factor models but faster than the more sophisticated models commercially available. The simulation tool DeLight uses a single room two-zone model with one wall window. It takes as input data hourly horizontal beam and diffuse irradiance measurements which are readily available at many weather stations around the world. The irradiance measurements are converted to illuminance values by the Perez luminous efficacy model, and the illuminance values are used to generate a sky luminance distribution by the Perez all-weather sky luminance model, because these models were found to agree best with year-round illuminance and irradiance measurements. The interior illuminance distribution is calculated from the room geometry and the sky luminance distribution by an interior light transfer model. By simplifying the geometry and omitting higher-order interior reflections, a fast but still accurate simulation tool is achieved. The average simulation error of DeLight is only 2 - 3 % at illuminance levels of 300 - 500 lx when compared with year-round illuminance and irradiance measurements. The simulation tool DeLight has been used to assess the daylight availability in a case study room for four facade orientations at four locations. Maximum yearly average daylight availability (DA) is achieved with continuous dimming and automated blind system control. About 70 - 90 % of the yearly <b>lighting</b> <b>requirement</b> during the office hours can be provided by daylight in Southern Europe, and 50 - 70 % in Northern Europe. With on/off switching and manual blind control, most of the electricity savings due to daylight are lost. The DA can be increased considerably by using diffusive glazing elements {{near the top of the}} facade where an outside view is not necessary. However, it is important to also have a clear glazing window at the centre of the facade to permit the occupants visual contact with the environment. In multifunctional solar facades, the optimization of the window area becomes the key design issue. Increasing the window area reduces the electric lighting load but it also decreases the PV electricity production and increases the heating and cooling load. Considering the yearly total auxiliary energy requirement for heating, cooling, electric lighting, and appliances, the optimum window area is around 15 - 20 % of the total south-oriented facade area. An optimal PV facade layout consists of a central window, diffusive glazing above the window, and PV panels covering the rest of the facade area. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In many plant communities, {{there is}} a {{negative}} interspecific correlation between relative growth rates and survival of juveniles. This negative correlation is most likely caused by a trade-off between carbon allocation to growth vs. allocation to defense and storage. Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) stored in stems allow plants to overcome periods of stress and should enhance survival. In order to assess how species differ in carbohydrate storage in relation to juvenile <b>light</b> <b>requirements,</b> growth, and survival, we quantified NSC concentrations and pool sizes in sapling stems of 85 woody species in moist semi-evergreen and dry deciduous tropical forests in the rainy season in Bolivia. Moist forest species averaged higher NSC concentrations than dry forest species. Carbohydrate concentrations and pool sizes decreased with the <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> of juveniles of the species in the moist forest {{but not in the}} dry forest. Combined, these results suggest that storage is especially important for species that regenerate in persistently shady habitats, as in the understory of moist evergreen forests. For moist forest species, sapling survival rates increased with NSC concentrations and pool sizes while growth rates declined with the NSC concentrations and pool sizes. No relationships were found for dry forest species. Carbon allocation to storage contributes to the growth¿ survival trade-off through its positive effect on survival. And, a continuum in carbon storage strategies contributes to a continuum in <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> among species. The link between storage and <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> is especially strong in moist evergreen forest where species sort out along a light gradient, but disappears in dry deciduous forest where light is a less limiting resource and species sort out along drought and fire gradients.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{improvements}} to the MIT Design Advisor, a whole-building energy usage modeling tool intended for use during early design stages, are investigated. These include changes to the thermal mass temperature distribution and <b>lighting</b> <b>requirement</b> calculations, the formulation of a representative day scheme {{to reduce the number}} of days that need to be simulated to find energy usage for a full year, the creation of an optimization algorithm to allow users to improve on their designs, and the addition of an algorithm to predict potential savings from retrocommissioning (RCx) using a limited set of simple inputs. Design Advisor itself is also tested for usability, speed, and accuracy using three existing buildings. The frequency of thermal mass-related calculations is reduced by finding the limits of the semi-implicit Crank-Nicolson method before it begins to return physically implausible oscillatory temperature profiles. An effort is made to speed up lighting calculations using a multivariate regression analysis in place of a multiple-reflection-based illuminance model. Representative days are formed by creating an average and two extreme weather days per month using existing climatological data, reducing the number of simulated days per year from 365 to 72 (three per month, repeated once for training). Combined, these changes lead to reductions in run time of up to 50 % with roughly 10 % loss of accuracy. The optimizer leverages these run time improvements to rapidly find optimal building designs given a set of input constraints. Initially, a multistep multivariate regression is used to reduce the given search space and tighten the constraints. Then, a genetic algorithm is used to find the target solution. Initial tests of this combination have led to average reductions in energy usage of 25 % given 6 minutes of calculation. To extend Design Advisor's applicability to existing buildings, an algorithm for predicting potential energy savings from RCx is implemented and tested. A database of 90 buildings that have undergone an RCx process and had their resulting energy savings documented has been collected. A k-nearest neighbors algorithm is used to evaluate the potential savings of test buildings based on this data set, operating on the assumption that similar buildings (in terms of location, size, and energy usage intensity) will present similar faults or opportunities for savings. While the average savings percentage prediction error is 0. 02, the root-mean-square error is 12. 4, which is greater than the actual savings potential of many buildings. Model validation is performed using three existing buildings; two in the Philadelphia area and one on MIT's campus. For energy types for which no building faults or other issues were later found (as in the MIT building), final usage predictions are found to be accurate to within a mean bias error of 11. 2 % to 2. 6 %. To improve upon these accuracies, further details about key building parameters and modes of operation would be required. These studies also inform further usability improvements, including reporting site (rather than primary) energy usage and expending reported electricity usage to include loads other than lighting. by Andrew Mandelbaum.

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{volume of}} tree stems {{is made up}} of three {{components:}} solid wood, gas and water. These components have important consequences for the construction costs, strength and stability of trees. Here, the importance of stem components for sapling growth and survival in the field was investigated, and then these stem components were related to two important life history axes of variation: the <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> for regeneration and the adult stature of the species. Methods: Stem fractions of wood, gas and water were determined for saplings and adults of respectively 30 and 58 Bolivian tropical moist-forest species. Sapling height growth and survival were monitored for 2 years in the field as indicators of sapling performance. Key Results: Sapling stems consisted of 26 % wood (range 7 ¿ 36 % for species), 59 % water (range 49 ¿ 88 %), and 15 % gas (range 0 ¿ 38 %) per unit volume. The wood fraction was the only determinant of sapling performance and was correlated with increased survival and decreased growth rate across species. The wood fraction decreased with <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> of the species, probably because a high wood fraction protects shade-tolerant species against pathogens and falling debris. The gas fraction increased with the <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> and adult stature of the species; probably as an aid in realizing a rapid height growth and accessing the canopy in the case of light-demanding species, and for rapidly attaining stability and a large reproductive size in the case of tall species. The water fraction was not correlated with the life history variation of tree species, probably because it leads to increased stem loading and decreased stability. Conclusions: The wood fraction might partially explain the growth¿survival trade-off that has been found across tropical tree species. The wood and gas fractions are closely related to the regeneration <b>light</b> <b>requirements</b> of the species. Tall species have a high gas fraction, probably not only because gas is a cheap filler, but also because it might lead to an increased stability of these tall tree...|$|R
