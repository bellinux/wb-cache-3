5|$|On 16 September 1854, a {{passenger}} train collided with some wagons {{on the line}} near Preston due to a pointsman's error and his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> Some passengers were injured.|$|E
5|$|Between 1995 and 2004 {{there were}} 2,630 {{accidents}} involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, {{resulting in the}} loss of 317 lives. The majority of accidents involved small fixed-wing aircraft engaged in private flights, and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to: flight handling skills; poor judgement or airmanship; <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> or experience; and omission of, or inappropriate, action.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{columnist}} and highly decorated military veteran David Hackworth again criticized the 10th Mountain Division for being unprepared due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> low physical fitness, unprepared leadership and low morale. He said the division {{was no longer}} capable of mountain warfare.|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> kindergarten teachers {{has been a problem}} for the Norwegian ECEC-sector for many decades. Other explanations for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> personnel are apostasy from the profession (approx. 50 % <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> kindergarten teachers working outside the kindergarten), <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> recruitment and higher education institutions’ training capacity.|$|R
50|$|The {{welfare of}} the company's {{employees}} has been subject to scrutiny in recent months following complaints of late salary payments, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> leadership, long hours, unfair dismissals, high staff turnover and harassment cases.|$|R
5000|$|Instructional {{television}} {{was used in}} El Salvador during the 1970s to improve primary education. One problem was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> teachers. Teaching materials were improved {{to make them more}} relevant. More children attended school and graduation rates increased.|$|R
5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E

5|$|Marshall held another {{press conference}} on October 17 to {{announce}} that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions that had led the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put {{the great majority of}} African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> that had led to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers. when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion were not significantly different from the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} issuing the signal and turning his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging {{back in the}} original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by Queen Charlotte that headed unevenly for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, but the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E

5|$|Hassan was {{originally}} interested in association football {{before deciding to}} take up track and field athletics. Despite a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> opportunities and facilities, she was {{given the opportunity to}} participate in the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but, since South Sudan was not yet a member of the International Olympic Committee, she competed as an Individual Olympic Athlete. She took part in the 400 m, but did not win a medal. She also attended the 2016 African Championships in Athletics, where she was eliminated in the heats of the 200 m event. For the 2016 Summer Games, she was again entered in the women's 200 m, where she was placed in heat four. This heat contained eventual gold medal-winner Elaine Thompson of Jamaica, although it was won by the Ivory Coast's Marie-Josée Ta Lou. Hassan finished eighth and last, although she set a new personal best of 26.99.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Los Angeles City College from 1939 onward. Although Roddenberry {{ranked in}} the ninetieth percentile on an intelligence test, and in the 99th percentile on a reading test administered {{as part of his}} college entrance examination, he elected to major in the police science curriculum; as president of the school's Police Club, he communicated with police liaison Stanley Sheldon. During his second year, he developed an interest in aeronautical engineering and obtained a pilot's license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He graduated from Los Angeles City College with an Associate of Arts degree in police science on June 26, 1941, becoming the first member of his family to earn a college degree. After graduating, he traveled to March Air Base and signed up for the Army Air Corps; due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> spaces his entrance was delayed. For the remainder of the summer, he attended Peace Officer training at the University of California, Los Angeles as an Army cadet.|$|E
5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E

30|$|A {{major factor}} {{contributing}} to the overall success was the detailed pre-visit planning and effective collaborative utilisation of local personnel and facilities.

5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|Scherger {{served as}} Officer Commanding No.2 Training Group at RAAF Station Wagga from July 1943 {{until he was}} {{appointed}} AOC of the newly formed No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) in November. The Air Force's main mobile strike force, No.10 OG at its formation consisted of No.77 Wing, operating A-31 Vengeance dive bombers, and No.78 Wing, operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, as well as various ancillary units. Promoted to acting air commodore in January 1944, Scherger established his headquarters at Nadzab, Papua New Guinea, {{in support of the}} US Fifth Air Force. Though able to launch No.78 Wing's first mission that same month, he had to deal with several organisational problems to bring all his squadrons to combat readiness, including <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in tropical conditions, and shortcomings in aircraft maintenance and staff rotation that resulted in the RAAF's operational rate of effort being inferior to similar USAAF formations. These issues were overcome later in the year and No.10 OG units began exceeding the rate of effort of their American counterparts.|$|E

50|$|Health {{communication}} faces many challenges.

5|$|By mid-1944, {{the five}} 'Lower Establishment' {{divisions}} allocated to home defence duties (the 38th (Welsh), the 45th, the 47th (London), the 55th (West Lancashire), and the 61st) had a combined total of 17,845 men. Of this number, around 13,000 were available as replacements for the 21st Army Group fighting in France. The remaining 4,800 men were considered ineligible {{at that time}} for service abroad {{for a variety of}} reasons, including a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> or being medically unfit. Over the following six months, up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st Army Group following the completion of their training and certification of fitness. For example, those eligible for overseas service from the 9th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment were transferred to 21st Army Group. The battalion was then tasked with training those who were considered unfit, re-training soldiers who had recovered from wounds, and training men from anti-aircraft units to become infantry. On 18 July, HQ Residue Concentration Area reverted to its former infantry role. Two days later, the brigade staff of 184th Infantry Brigade became the headquarters of 183rd Infantry Brigade and likewise the headquarters staff of the 183rd became HQ 184th Infantry Brigade. In August, the 4th Northamptonshire was transferred to Force 135 that was planning to end the German occupation of the Channel Islands. Such an attack did not materialize, and the entire force was transferred to Europe to reinforce the 21st Army Group. On 1 September, the 184th Infantry Brigade (while remaining part of the division) was transferred to the Orkney and Shetland Islands for a two-month stint as the defensive garrison. Over the remainder of the year, and into 1945 the makeup of the division changed. However, the role of the division remained the same. For example, the 4th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment role was to find drafts for other battalions fighting overseas.|$|E
5|$|In , Boruto joins an {{examination}} {{to improve his}} ninja rank from low status Genin to middle status Chunin with his teammates. Before the exams happened, he was training to surpass his father. For it, he becomes a student of Naruto's best friend and rival Sasuke Uchiha who first challenges him to perform the Rasengan; not knowing how, he received help from his teacher Konohamaru {{to know how to}} perform it. Upon learning and mastering a small Rasengan, Boruto starts training with Sasuke after his acceptance to it. Later in the film, Boruto is told by Sasuke that he has potential of surpassing his father. In the exams, he cheats by using a device that uses ninjutsu due to his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in traditional abilities. After being caught and disqualified, Naruto gets captured by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki from protecting the leaf village. Upon being scolded by Sasuke, Boruto realizes his underhandedness and joins the rescue team to save the abducted Naruto, while finally gaining his father's compliance. With the help of Naruto and Sasuke, Boruto defeats the enemy Momoshiki with his Rasengan. Although he resented the Hokage position, Boruto becomes resolute to become strong to protect his village's leader and entrust Sarada to be a future Hokage instead of himself. Boruto also reprises his role in the novel adaptation of the movie, as well as part of an omake from the manga Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend where he trains with the title character.|$|E
