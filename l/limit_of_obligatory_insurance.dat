He explores it as the integral system with the well-developed infrastructure and provision and the effective instrument of the state control tax system restructuring. One of the variants of restructuring is the duty assignment of separate organizations to carry out the external tax audit at legislative level, which is executed by the auditors (independent accountants), which got the applicable accreditation in the authorized state body, and then to give the proper conclusions to the taxes authorities and to execute all the recommendations according to the amendments of violations of the tax legislation found in the process of the tax audit conducting.

(ii) In recent years, local governments have had been given more authority in the realm of DRM, however, Turkey’s approach to DRM is still predominantly centralized at the expense of successful DRM practices at the local level. (iii) While the devastating 1999 earthquake has resulted in advances in the pre-disaster components of DRM; progress has been mostly in the realm of earthquakes.

40|$|Introduction. Based on {{clinical}} studies data voriconazole is recommended as the {{drug of choice}} for treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) – a widespread infectious complications occurring in immunocompromised patients and is characterized by severe clinical course and high mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the cost-effectiveness of voriconazole compared to other preparations recommended in the Russian practice for the treatment of IA in adult patients. Materials and methods. The authors constructed a «decision tree» type of model, which compared the three treatment alternatives for the IA in adult patients, depending on the drug in first-line therapy: 1) voriconazole, 2), caspofungin, or 3) amphotericin B lipid complex (LC). Efficacy was assessed as the probability of patient survival within 14 weeks of starting treatment. We took into account the drugs cost and an increase in the hospitalization duration due to the development of serious adverse events. The model parameters were determined on the basis of the published results of clinical studies, the costs were calculated on the basis of medicines prices in the public procurement and the average bed-day cost in system <b>of</b> <b>obligatory</b> health <b>insurance.</b> Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. Results. It has been shown that the use of voriconazole for treatment of IA is the dominant strategy compared to the use of caspofungin and amphotericin B LC, providing cost reduction while achieving maximum effect. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (1000 simulations) showed stability of the revealed pattern. Conclusion. The use of voriconazole in the treatment of IA allows to save the greatest number of lives at minimal cost compared to other preparations recommended in the Russian practice. </p...|$|R

Based on the RE-LY study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin prescribed in “real-world” settings from a Russian payer perspective. Material and methods. Markov model simulated AF patients at moderate to high risk of stroke while tracking clinical events and resulting functional disability. Acute event costs and resulting long-term follow-up costs incurred by disabled stroke survivors were calculated using general tariff agreement <b>of</b> Russian <b>obligatory</b> health <b>insurance</b> system and official national statistics. Clinical events, summarized as events per 100 patient-years, expected life years, total costs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. Results. Over a lifetime, dabigatran etexilate treated patients experienced fewer intracranial haemorrhages and fewer ischaemic strokes.

40|$|Objective: to {{estimate}} the cost of treatment in patients with complicated osteoporosis (OP) {{in the first year}} after fracture under the conditions of the Moscow municipal healthcare system. Patients and methods. The investigation enrolled 196 women (mean age, 65. 8 ± 9. 1 years) who had sustained fractures at five major osteoporotic sites (proximal hip (PH), distal forearm (DF), surgical humeral neck, vertebral column, and medial and/or lateral ankle). A unified questionnaire that included data on inpatient and outpatient treatment, patients' personal costs, and social benefits, as well as tariffs on services of the Moscow City Fund <b>of</b> <b>Obligatory</b> Health <b>Insurance</b> was used {{to estimate}} the cost of treatment for complicated OP during one year after fracture. Results. The direct cost of treatment for PH fracture amounted to 101, 243 rubles and was significantly higher (p < 0. 01) than that for fractures at other sites: DF (22, 080 rubles); humeral neck (39, 855 rubles), vertebral column (51, 167 rubles), and ankle (43, 345 rubles). The average cost of treatment in terms of indirect costs of treatment for complicated OP during a year was as high as 61, 151 rubles. In the overall cost structure for the disease, hospital costs accounted for 44 %; social benefits were 12 % and the cost of antiosteoporotic drugs was only 7 %, which was associated {{with the fact that the}} latter were rarely prescribed by primary healthcare physicians. Conclusion. Costs of treatment in patients with complicated OP in Moscow were estimated in relation to the site of low-energy fracture. The disease was shown to cause considerable economic losses regardless of the site of osteoporotic fracture; however, the cost of antiosteoporotic drugs has an insignificant share in the overall cost structure for treatment. At the same time, secondary prevention of OP requires that combination antiosteoporotic therapy should be performed in all patients who have sustained low-energy fracture. </p...|$|R

Not only car owners and passangers but also other persons using public roads suffer damages in their result. Insurance is an instrument which satisfies the need of economic aid to victims of car accidents in the most complex way. Road traffic insurance have been submitted to certain phases in it's development what resulted in formation of three insurance systems. The oldest and the most universal one consists in insurance of civil responsibility of {{the cause of the}} accident. A system of insuring consequences of accidents in road traffic was introduced in few countries.

The problem of securing actual realization of victims' claims is of importance above all in the countries in which especially rapid development of motor transport has occured.

A social role of insurance of civil responsibility can be then underlined. The basic and superior aim of the insurance is protection of the victims of car accidents.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} situation in the Croatian health-care system, with special emphasis on the (dis) organization of palliative care within the public health, more precisely gerontology context. Namely, population world-wide is getting older, that is both a statistical and an everyday-medical fact. Today we consider citizens {{after the age of}} 65 as the elderly, with a tendency to move the age-limit to 75 years. Croatia on the matter swiftly follows global trends, while literature points to the fact that an increase in the elderly population dictates the need for an organized system of palliative care and hospice building. Although we can not ignore the fact that children can become palliative care patients, we can conclude that these are predominantly elderly patients. In fact, aproximately half of patients - users of palliative care - have some type of oncological diagnosis, a significant number of patients suffers from dementia, stroke or heart failure. As for the Primorsko-goranska county and the City of Rijeka, they show similar trend, as can be illustrated with data from the 2011 census, when the share of citizens over 65 years in the population of Primorsko-goranska county reached 18, 91 %, and in the population of the City of Rijeka 19, 74 %. Thus, one of the main quality-of-life issues in the Croatian senior population is the (dis) function of the palliative medicine/care system. Practice, namely, shows that there has still been no implementation. In particular, palliative medicine is not yet recognized as a speciality or sub-speciality, standards and norms for this activity are not set, palliative care is still not included in the system <b>of</b> <b>obligatory</b> health <b>insurance,</b> {{and as far as the}} national strategy of health policy for the area of palliative care, Croatian Government at its meeting held on 27 th December 2013 finally adopted the "Strategic Plan for Palliative Care of the Republic of Croatia for the Period 2014 - 2016 ".
