40|$|With the {{enhanced}} capacity of bioinformatics to interrogate extensive banks of sequence data, more efficient technologies {{are needed to}} test gene function predictions. Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vectors are widely used in expression analysis since they provide for extremely efficient expression of transgenes {{in a wide range}} of cell types. To facilitate rapid, high-throughput generation of recombinant viruses, we have re-engineered an adenovirus vector (designated AdZ) to allow single-step, directional gene insertion using recombineering technology. Recombineering allows for direct insertion into the Ad vector ofPCR products, synthesized sequences, or oligonucleotides encoding shRNAs without requirement for a transfer vector. Vectors were optimized for high-throughput applications by making them “self-excising” through incorporating the I-SceI homing endonuclease into the vector, removing the need to <b>linearize</b> <b>vectors</b> prior to transfection into packaging cells. AdZvectors allow genes to be expressed in their native form or with strep, V 5, or GFP tags. Insertion of tetracycline operators downstream of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early (HCMV MIE) promoter permits silencing of transgenes in helper cells expressing the tet repressor, thus making the vector compatible with the cloning of toxic gene products. The AdZ vector system is robust, straightforward, and suited to both sporadic and high-throughput applications...|$|R

40|$|Traditional error {{diffusion}} halftoning is a {{high quality}} method for producing binary images from digital grayscale images. Error diffusion shapes the quantization noise power into the high frequency regions where the human eye is the least sensitive. Error diffusion may be extended to color images by using error filters with matrix-valued coefficients to takeinto account the correlation among color planes. For vector color error diffusion, we propose three contributions. First, we analyze vector color error diffusion based on a new matrix gain model for the quantizer, which <b>linearizes</b> <b>vector</b> error diffusion. The model predicts key characteristics of color error diffusion, esp. image sharpening and noise shaping. The proposed model includes linear gain models for the quantizer by Ardalan and Paulos and by Kite, Evans, and Bovik as special cases. Second, based on our model, we optimize the noise shaping behavior of color error di#usion by designing error filters that are optimum with respect to any given linear spatially-invariant model of the human visual system. Our approach allows the error filter to have matrix-valued coefficients and diffuse quantization error across color channels in an opponent color representation. Thus, the noise is shaped into frequency regions of reduced human color sensitivity. To obtain the optimal filter, we derive a matrix version of the Yule-Walker equations which we solve by using a gradient descent algorithm. Finally, we show that the vector error filter has a parallel implementation as a polyphase filterbank...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{molecules}} undergoing {{transformation into}} yeast are highly recombinogenic, even when diverged. We reasoned that transformation-associated recombination (TAR) could {{be employed to}} clone large DNAs containing repeat sequences, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} in vitro enzymatic reactions such as restriction and ligation and reducing the amount of DNA handling. Gently isolated human DNA was transformed directly into yeast spheroplasts along with two genetically marked (M 1 and M 2) <b>linearized</b> <b>vectors</b> that contained a human Alu sequence at one end and a telomere sequence at the other end (Alu-CEN-M 1 -TEL and Alu-M 2 -TEL). Nearly all the M 1 -selected transformants had yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA inserts that varied in size from 70 kb to > 600 kb. Approximately half of these had also acquired the unselected M 2 marker. The mitotic segregational stability of YACs generated from one (M 1) or two (M 1 and M 2) vector(s) was comparable, suggesting de novo generation of telomeric ends. Since no YACs were isolated when rodent DNAs or a vector lacking an Alu sequence was used, the YACs were most likely the consequence of TAR between the repeat elements on the vector(s) and the human DNA. Using the BLUR 13 Alu-containing vector, we demonstrated that human DNA could be efficiently cloned from mouse cells that contained a single human chromosome 16. The distribution of cloned DNAs on chromosome 16 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We propose that TAR cloning can provide an efficient means for generating YACs from specific chromosomes and subchromosome fragments and that TAR cloning may be useful for isolating families of genes and specific genes from total genome DNA...|$|R
