5000|$|In the Oaks at Epsom a month later, Carrozza, ridden by Lester Piggott, {{started at}} odds of 100/8 {{in a field}} of eleven runners, being less fancied than the Queen's other runner, Mulberry Harbour. Piggott sent Carrozza into the lead a furlong from the finish and looked set for a {{comfortable}} win until the Irish-trained grey Silken Glider emerged with a late challenge. In a [...] "desperate finish" [...] the royal filly prevailed by a short head after a photo-finish. The favourite Rose Royale, who appeared unsuited by the firm ground, finished three lengths further back in third. Carrozza was led into the winner's circle by her owner: the filly was initially reluctant but acquiesced after the Queen gave the <b>lead</b> <b>strap</b> a [...] "mighty jerk". Later in the year, Silken Glider was successful in the Irish Oaks, while Rose Royale won the Prix du Moulin and the Champion Stakes. In July, Carrozza started odds-on favourite for the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood, but finished fourth behind Swallowswift. Carrozza returned from the race lame and was retired to stud.|$|E
50|$|A railway {{detonator}} (torpedo in North America) is a coin-sized {{device that}} is used to make a loud sound as a warning signal to train drivers. It is placed {{on the top of the}} rail, usually secured with two <b>lead</b> <b>straps,</b> one on each side. When the wheel of the train passes over, it explodes emitting a loud bang.It was invented in 1841 by English inventor Edward Alfred Cowper.|$|R
5000|$|A torpedo is {{a device}} which is {{strapped}} {{to the top of}} a rail. When a train drives over the torpedo, it emits a very loud [...] "bang" [...] which can be heard over the noise of the engine, and signals the engineer to stop immediately. Torpedoes are generally placed by the flagman when protecting a train ahead.Torpedoes are about 2" [...] x 2", red in color, about 3/4" [...] high, and have two <b>lead</b> <b>straps</b> attached, which hold it to the rail. The torpedo has discs inside and are filled with detonating powder. The torpedo was invented about 1874.|$|R
50|$|Toddler {{boys and}} girls wore low-necked gowns. <b>Leading</b> strings—narrow <b>straps</b> of fabric {{attached}} to the gown at the shoulder—functioned {{as a sort of}} leash to keep the child from straying too far or falling as they learned to walk.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} dated [...] "1721" [...] on the <b>lead</b> {{downpipe}} <b>straps.</b> It was extended and altered by Samuel Pountney Smith of Shrewsbury in 1857. It is a three-storey red brick building with red sandstone ashlar dressings, featuring some fluted pilasters and a Corinthian stone doorcase consisting of pilasters, each supporting {{a section of}} entablature. The rainwater heads are emblazoned with the Mackworth arms and crest, and an acanthus ornament at the junction of pipes and cornice, and straps have the initials [...] "BM" [...] and the date [...] "1721".|$|R
5000|$|By early June 1955, Peel {{was in a}} panic. The top {{legal officer}} in the county, Chillingworth, had already stated that Peel would get no second chance. Peel then hired Floyd [...] "Lucky" [...] Holzapfel (a known {{criminal}} and a carpenter's apprentice) to murder the Chillingworths. On the night of June 14, Holzapfel and an accomplice named Bobby Lincoln went to Manalapan and landed on the beach behind the Chillingworths' house around 1a.m. Bobby Lincoln crouched in the bushes as Holzapfel knocked on the door. The judge answered in his pajamas. Holzapfel pulled a pistol from under his shirt and forced the judge and his wife into the boat. After the boat drifted for about an hour, the couple were thrown overboard with <b>lead</b> weights <b>strapped</b> to their legs.|$|R
40|$|The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is {{preparing}} to upgrade the Advanced Light Source (ALS) with three superconducting dipoles (Superbends). In this paper we present the final magnet system design which incorporates R&D test results and addresses the ALS operational concerns of alignment, availability, and economy.

40|$|The tension straps, {{which are}} {{primarily}} {{part of the}} preload structure, are also used to support the <b>leads.</b> The <b>straps</b> must support the lead connection to the coil, and must support the uncompensated parts of the leads. In addition to the Lorentz loading, the displacements of the straps due to the global structural behavior should be imposed on the short runs of lead connections that bridge from the straps to the coils. In the present design the transfer of support of the lead between coil and strap is abrupt, and prone to stress concentration. A support concept that is schematically shown in figure 2 is recommended. It results from attempts to allow some flexibility in lead support as the support is transferred from coil to strap, while supporting the Lorentz loads on the lead. In this concept, radial differential coil / strap motions are allowed and are absorbed by flexure of {{a portion of the}} vertical run of the lead. Circumferentia...|$|R

40|$|High T(sub c) superconducting {{electrical}} current <b>leads</b> and ground <b>straps</b> {{will be used}} in cryogenic coolers in future NASA Goddard Space Flight Center missions. These superconducting samples are long, thin leads with a typical diameter of two millimeters. A longitudinal method is developed to measure the thermal diffusivity of candidate materials for this application. This technique uses a peltier junction to supply an oscillatory heat wave into one end of a sample and will use low mass thermocouples to follow the heat wave along the sample. The thermal diffusivity is calculated using both the exponential decay of the heat wave and the phase shift to the wave. Measurements are performed in a cryostat between 10 K and room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The ITER Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) antenna is {{required}} to couple 20 MW through fast (sub-ms) changes in loading during Edge Localised Modes (ELM’s). The chosen design comprises a port plug supporting a close-packed array of 24 straps which are connected in triplets to eight transmission lines fed via 3 dB couplers or a conjugate-T configuration. Significant RF engineering challenges have arisen given the need to maximise the coupled power and/or reduce electric field strength for the straps, feeders and transmission lines, whilst minimising power loadings caused by sheath effects. For instance, the use of closely-spaced <b>straps</b> <b>leads</b> to significant levels of inter-strap mutual coupling that complicates the matching algorithm, calling for external decoupling networks. Arc detection is also a key issue for this antenna, as recent JET and Tore Supra results have highlighted the need for parallel development of arc detection and ELM-tolerant systems. The mechanical design challenges lie even further beyond the range of present experience. The limited space available, coupled to the requirements that the RF components are sufficiently large to achieve acceptabl...|$|R
5000|$|At WrestleMania XXVI, both {{members of}} Cryme Tyme {{competed in the}} dark match battle royal, where JTG would be {{eliminated}} by Gaspard. Just days later on SmackDown, after a quick loss to John Morrison and R-Truth, Gaspard was enraged and attacked JTG for not coming to his rescue in the match, thus turning Gaspard heel {{for the first time}} in his WWE brand career and second time in his wrestling career. Backstage after the match during an interview, Gaspard told Josh Mathews, [...] "No more Time... no more Cryme Tyme... This is my time". The next week on SmackDown, Gaspard came to the ring and announced that he was done with Cryme Tyme and announced again that it was his time. Afterwards, an enraged JTG came out ready to fight him, but got kicked in the face by Gaspard for his troubles. This would <b>lead</b> to a <b>strap</b> match at Extreme Rules, which was won by JTG. The two had a standard rematch on the May 6 episode of Superstars, which Shad won by pinfall, thus ending their feud. Gaspard was then sent to FCW developmental territory, while JTG stayed on the SmackDown brand. Gaspard was later released from his WWE contract on November 19, 2010 along with five other wrestlers.|$|R
40|$|The ITER Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency antenna must couple 20 MW at an antenna-plasma spacing of ∼ 15 cm for pulse lengths up to 1000 s at {{frequencies}} from 40 MHz to 55 MHz, using matching components mounted {{outside of}} the torus to allow powering through fast (sub-ms) changes in loading during Edge Localised Modes (ELM's) {{by the use of}} either 3 dB couplers or a conjugate-T configuration. The chosen design comprises a port plug supporting a close-packed array of 24 straps which are connected in triplets to eight feed transmission lines. Rear sections of the antenna are removable {{from the rear of the}} port plug, to allow damaged windows or diagnostics to be replaced, and much of the interior comprises radiation shielding material. The RF specification poses substantial challenges. Computer modelling has been used to maximise the coupled power and/or reduce electric field strength for the straps, feeders and transmission lines, and is now being extended to minimise power loadings caused by sheath effects. The use of closely-spaced <b>straps</b> <b>leads</b> to significant levels of inter-strap mutual coupling that complicates the matching algorithm. Arc detection is also a key issue for this antenna, as recent JET and Tore Supra results have highlighted the need for parallel development of arc detection and ELM-tolerant systems. The mechanical design challenges lie even further beyond the range of present experience. Given the long pulse length, the thermal design dominates much of the detailed mechanical design as peak RF currents of 1 - 2 kA will result in high thermal loads; a situation exacerbated by the power loading from the plasma. Resilience to disruption forces has required the design of RF windows that can transmit the forces on the central RF conductors to the port plug structure. The requirement that the rear transmission line section is removable considerably increases the complexity of the mechanical layout. Achievement of the required level of radiation shielding is challenging, given the need to both maintain the water/steel fraction close to the optimum value and to keep the total antenna weight below 45 tonnes. This paper details the RF and mechanical design features proposed for the antenna and outlines the manner in which the wider EU programme will feed into the design proces...|$|R
