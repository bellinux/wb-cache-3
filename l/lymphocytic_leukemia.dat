25|$|Early {{clinical}} failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it {{was still}} largely an experimental technique. These include treatment of retinal diseases Leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID, adrenoleukodystrophy, chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL), acute <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (ALL), multiple myeloma, haemophilia, and Parkinson's disease. Between 2013 and April 2014, US companies invested over $600 million in the field.|$|E

50|$|Hematological {{malignancies}} may {{derive from}} {{either of the}} two major blood cell lineages: myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. The myeloid cell line normally produces granulocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, macrophages and mast cells; the lymphoid cell line produces B, T, NK and plasma cells. Lymphomas, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> and myeloma are from the lymphoid line, while acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative diseases are myeloid in origin.|$|R

50|$|Lymphoid leukemias — {{also called}} lymphocytic, lymphogenous, or lymphoblastic leukemias — are {{a group of}} leukemias {{affecting}} circulating lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells. The <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> {{are closely related to}} lymphomas of the lymphocytes, to the point that some of them are unitary disease entities that can be called by either name (for example, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). Such diseases are all lymphoproliferative disorders. Most lymphoid leukemias involve a particular subtype of lymphocytes, the B cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemokine}} receptor CXCR 4, {{which normally}} regulates stromal stem cell interactions {{in the bone}} marrow, is highly expressed {{on a variety of}} malignant hematologic cells, including lymphoma and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> A new treatment concept has arisen wherein CXCR 4 may be an effective therapeutic target as an adjunct to treatment of hematologic neoplasms with chemo- and immunotherapy. In the present study, we developed pepducins, cell-penetrating lipopeptide antagonists of CXCR 4, to interdict CXCL 12 -CXCR 4 transmembrane signaling to intracellular G-proteins. We demonstrate that pepducins targeting the first (i 1) or third (i 3) intracellular loops of CXCR 4 completely abrogate CXCL 12 -mediated cell migration of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> and lymphomas. Stromal-cell coculture protects lymphoma cells from apoptosis in response to treatment with the CD 20 -targeted Ab rituximab. However, combination treatment with CXCR 4 pepducins and rituximab significantly increases the apoptotic effect of rituximab. Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing disseminated lymphoma xenografts with pepducins alone or in combination with rituximab significantly increased their survival. These data demonstrate that CXCL 12 -CXCR 4 signaling can be effectively inhibited by cell-penetrating pepducins, which represents a potential new treatment strategy for lymphoid malignancies...|$|R

40|$|TIA-I is a 15 -kd {{cytotoxic}} granule-associated protein {{expressed in}} natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. TIA- 1 expression was evaluated by paraffin immunohistochemistry in 115 T- or NK-cell neoplasms, 45 B-cell neoplasms, and 45 Hodgkin's lymphomas. TIA- 1 -positive granules were identified within the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells in 6 / 6 large granular <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> 11 / 11 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, 15 / 15 intestinal T-cell lymphomas, 6 / 6 NK-like T-cell lymphomas of no special type, 2 / 2 NK-cell lymphomas, 8 / 9 nasal T/NK-cell lymphomas, 7 / 8 subcutaneous T-cell lymphomas, 4 / 5 pulmonary T- or NK-cell angiocentric lymphomas (lymphomatoid granulomatosis), 12 / 19 T-cell anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, 2 / 12 nodal peripheral T-cell lymphomas, 1 / 3 CD 8 + cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and 5 / 38 classical Hodgkin's disease.

25|$|Leukemia {{is rarely}} {{associated}} with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women. How it is handled depends {{primarily on the}} type of leukemia. Nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias. Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester. Chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones. Treatment for chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> which are rare in pregnant women, can often be postponed until {{after the end of the}} pregnancy.|$|R
25|$|Chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL) {{most often}} affects adults {{over the age}} of 55. It {{sometimes}} occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. Two-thirds of affected people are men. The five-year survival rate is 75%. It is incurable, but there are many effective treatments. One subtype is B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a more aggressive disease.|$|E
25|$|In August two {{of three}} {{subjects}} of a pilot study were confirmed to have been cured from chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL).

25|$|Another {{important}} {{case study}} in rational drug design is imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed specifically for the bcr-abl fusion protein that is characteristic for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias (chronic myelogenous leukemia and occasionally acute <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia).</b> Imatinib is substantially different from previous drugs for cancer, as most agents of chemotherapy simply target rapidly dividing cells, not differentiating between cancer cells and other tissues.|$|E
50|$|All cancers are {{mutations}} in the genomes that cause abnormal cell growth. Determining {{factors that contribute}} to or regulate this excessive growth can potentially lead to preventative, therapeutic treatments of cancer. For example, chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> illustrates a region of miRNAs (mir-15 and mir-16) are missing from the genome in the expression of this cancer. While in other cancers, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, expression of miRNA sequences are amplified. This leads to the suggestion that many miRNA have regulatory sequences involved in cancer. If those were to be better regulated, potentially through AMOs, perhaps the onset and progression of cancer could be regulated.|$|R

40|$|The TCL 1 {{oncogene}} {{on human}} chromosome 14 q 32. 1 {{is involved in}} the development of T cell leukemia in humans. These leukemias are classified either as T prolymphocytic leukemias, which occur very late in life, or as T chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> which often arise in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) at a young age. The TCL 1 oncogene is activated in these leukemias by juxtaposition to the α or β locus of the T cell receptor, caused by chromosomal translocations t(14 : 14) (q 11 :q 32), t(7 : 14) (q 35 :q 32), or by inversions inv(14) (q 11 :q 32). To show that transcriptional alteration of TCL 1 is causally involved in the generation of T cell neoplasia we have generated transgenic mice that carry the TCL 1 gene under the transcriptional control of the p 56 lck promoter element. The lck-TCL 1 transgenic mice developed mature T cell leukemias after a long latency period. Younger mice presented preleukemic T cell expansions expressing TCL 1, and leukemias developed only at an older age. The phenotype of the murine leukemias is CD 4 −CD 8 +, in contrast to human leukemias, which are predominantly CD 4 +CD 8 −. These studies demonstrate that transcriptional activation of the TCL 1 protooncogene can cause malignant transformation of T lymphocytes, indicating the role of TCL 1 in the initiation of malignant transformation in T prolymphocytic leukemias and T chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R
