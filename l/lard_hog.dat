For development of size in hogs they must have (1) length and depth of body, (2) length of leg, and (3) large but not coarse bones. The long-bodied rather 2 ̆ 2 leggy 2 ̆ 2 pig grows rapidly and makes the larger hog. While the modern hog is still a <b>lard</b> <b>hog,</b> it is not as thick and broad as were its predecessors. It is logical to assume that the hog of the future will be required to make his gains more largely in growth on cheap roughages and less in fat on heavy grain feeding. It must also be noted that the hog which makes its gain by putting on a thick layer of fat probably will show a loss to the producer, while the hog which makes its gains by increasing its muscles will show a profit because it costs less to produce lean meat than it does fat. There is no demand on the market for the ultra-fat hog because lard is worth less after it is put in the pad than the packer pays for it on the hog; neither does the present-day consumer desire fat on meat purchased...|$|E

5000|$|The next skating club to be {{established}} was in London and was not founded until 1830. By the mid-19th century, ice skating was a popular pastime among the British upper and middle classes, (Queen Victoria got to know her future husband, Prince Albert, {{through a series of}} ice skating trips.) and early attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were made during the 'rink mania' of 1841-44. As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of <b>hog's</b> <b>lard</b> and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Littell's 'Living Age' headed the 'Glaciarium' reported that [...] "This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' Tottenham Court Road, was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating".|$|R

Introduction: If {{there is}} one class of farm animals that is misunderstood, undervalued, and uninvestigated by the {{majority}} of farmers in the United States, both in the corn belt and out of it, it is the bacon hog. Investigation shows that the unfavorable light in which the bacon hog is viewed is due largely to an attempt {{on the part of the}} farmer to consider the bacon hog from a strictly lard producing standpoint. The bacon hog is designed for the production of bacon and it is most important that they should not lay on fat as do the <b>lard</b> producing <b>hogs.</b> The bacon hog is a pure bred animal in fact the principle breed of bacon hogs, is one of the oldest, breeds of hogs known. They are bred for the economical production of bacon of the highest class, and as high grade bacon has a large proportion of lean meat to fat consequently a bacon hog must produce much more lean meat than fat. This point has been kept well in mind in the developing of the breeds of this class, and as a result a hog has been obtained that differs in many respects from the so called mortgage lifter of the corn belt and certainly will not fill all the qualifications of the fat hog classes. And best results from them cannot be obtained under conditions in which the fat hog gives the best returns. That the men who have been handling the bacon hog knew what they were about, is shown by the following standard of excellence as adopted by the national Pig Breeders Association of Great Britain; the Tamworth being the leading breed of bacon hog...|$|R

As the technology {{for the maintenance of}} natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of <b>hog's</b> <b>lard</b> and various salts.

The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating". By 1844, these venues fell out of fashion, as customers grew tired of the 'smelly' ice substitute, and it was only thirty years later, that refrigeration technology developed to the point that natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink. The world's first mechanically frozen ice rink was the Glaciarium, opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1876. In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring 40 by 24 ft was established.|$|R

They were exposed in the apartments of the Scotch Academy; and filled those who are accustomed to visit the annual spring exhibition, with astonishment {{and a sense of}} incongruity. Instead of the too common purple sunsets, and pea-green fields, and distances executed in putty and <b>hog's</b> <b>lard,</b> he beheld, looking down upon him from the walls of room after room, a whole army of wise, grave, humorous, capable, or beautiful countenances, painted simply and strongly by a man of genuine instinct. It was a complete act of the Human Drawing-Room Comedy. Lords and ladies, soldiers and doctors, hanging judges, and heretical divines, a whole generation of good society was resuscitated; and the Scotchman of to-day walked about among the Scotchmen of two generations ago. The moment was well chosen, neither too late nor too early. The people who sat for these pictures are not yet ancestors, they are still relations. They are not yet altogether a part of the dusty past, but occupy a middle distance within cry of our affections. The little child who looks wonderingly on his grandfather's watch in the picture, is now the veteran Sheriff EMERITIS of Perth. And I hear a story of a lady who returned the other day to Edinburgh, after an absence of sixty years: [...] "I could see none of my old friends," [...] she said, [...] "until I went into the Raeburn Gallery, and found them all there." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{remarkable}} {{method of}} catching gulls, {{derived from the}} Indians, was practised in Wellfleet in 1794. [...] "The Gull House," [...] it is said, [...] "is built with crotchets, fixed in the ground on the beach," [...] poles being stretched across for the top, and the sides made close with stakes and seaweed. [...] "The poles on the top are covered with lean whale. The man being placed within, is not discovered by the fowls, and while they are contending for and eating the flesh, he draws them in, one by one, between the poles, until he has collected forty or fifty." [...] Hence, perchance, a man {{is said to be}} gulled, when he is taken in. We read that one [...] "sort of gulls is called by the Dutch mallemucke, i.e. the foolish fly, because they fall upon a whale as eagerly as a fly, and, indeed, all gulls are foolishly bold and easy to be shot. The Norwegians call this bird havhest, sea-horse (and the English translator says, it is probably what we call boobies). If they have eaten too much, they throw it up, and eat it again till they are tired. It is this habit in the gulls of parting with their property [disgorging the contents of their stomachs to the skuas], which has given rise to the terms gull, guller, and gulling, among men." [...] We also read that they used to kill small birds which roosted on the beach at night, by making a fire with <b>hog's</b> <b>lard</b> in a frying-pan. The Indians probably used pine torches; the birds flocked to the light, and were knocked down with a stick. We noticed holes dug {{near the edge of the}} bank, where gunners conceal themselves to shoot the large gulls which coast up and down a-fishing, for these are considered good to eat.|$|R
6000|$|There is a {{delightful}} account {{of such a}} log cabin by John S. Williams, whose father settled in the woods of Belmont County in 1800. [...] "Our cabin," [...] he says, [...] "had been raised, covered, part of the cracks chinked, {{and part of the}} floor laid, when we moved in on Christmas day. There had not been a stick cut except in building the cabin, which was so high from the ground that a bear, wolf, panther, or any animal less in size than a cow could enter without even a squeeze.... The green ash puncheons had shrunk so as to leave cracks in the floor and doors from one to two inches wide. At both the doors we had high, unsteady, and sometimes icy steps, made by piling the logs cut out of the walls, for the doors and the window, if it could be called a window, when perhaps it was the largest spot in the top, bottom, or sides of the cabin where the wind could not enter. It was made by sawing out a log, and placing sticks across, and then by pasting an old newspaper over the hole, and applying <b>hog's</b> <b>lard,</b> we had a kind of glazing which shed a most beautiful and mellow light across the cabin when the sun shone on it. All other light entered at the doors, cracks, and chimneys. Our cabin was twenty-four by eighteen. The west end was occupied by two beds, the center of each side by a door.... On {{the opposite side of the}} window, made of clapboards, supported on pins driven into the walls, were our shelves. On these shelves my sister displayed in simple order, a host of pewter plates, and dishes and spoons, scoured and bright.... Our chimney occupied most of the east end; with pots and kettles opposite the window, under the shelves, a gun on hooks over the north door, four split-bottomed chairs, three three-legged stools, and a small eight by ten looking glass sloped from the wall over a large towel and comb case.... We got a roof laid over head as soon as possible, but it was laid of loose clapboards split from a red-oak, and a cat might have shaken every board in our ceiling.... We made two kinds of furniture. One kind was of hickory bark, with the outside shaved off. This we would take off all around the tree, the size of which would determine the caliber of our box. Into one end we would place a flat piece of bark or puncheon, cut round to fit in the bark, which stood on end the same as when on the tree.... A much finer article was made of slippery-elm bark, shaved smooth, with the inside out, bent round and sewed together, where the end of the hoop or main bark lapped over.... This was the finest furniture in a lady's dressing room," [...] and such a cabin and its appointments were splendor and luxury beside those of the very earliest pioneers, and many of the latest. The Williamses were Quakers, and the mother was recently from England; they were of far gentler breeding and finer tastes than most of their neighbors, who had been backwoodsmen for generations.|$|R
