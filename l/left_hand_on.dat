5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E

50|$|The entire {{harmonic}} structure, {{save for}} one note, is constructed {{so that the}} <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> part is the highest note in a B Minor chord which is below the melody line. Thus, when the melody is on a C# or D, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is <b>on</b> a B. When the melody is on an E or F#, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is <b>on</b> a D, and when the melody is on a G, A, or B, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is <b>on</b> an F#. The only break from this harmonic structure appears when the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> hits a C# below an F# in the right hand, synchronous {{with the release of}} the pedal {{at the end of the}} 11th bar.|$|R
25|$|Ray Manzarek {{played the}} song's bass line with his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, while {{performing}} the other keyboard parts on a Vox Continental using his right hand. After the recording session, producer Paul A. Rothchild brought in session musician Larry Knechtel to overdub a Fender Precision Bass guitar {{to double the}} keyboard bass line. When the Doors played the song at live concerts, Manzarek used the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass without augmentation.|$|E
25|$|His biggest {{contribution}} to the game of field hockey was the 'half push- half hit'- a stroke he used {{to hit the ball}} using the same grip used to dribble the ball. With the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> top of the handle and the right half low down around the centre of the stick he used to essay this shot with a minimum back lift and slam the ball towards his partner-teammate to make an early and accurate pass. The same stroke was adapted by his successor Dhanraj Pillay, who was an ardent fan of the maestro. Earlier the stroke or technique did not exist in a field hockey player's repertoire or in the game's coaching manual.|$|E
25|$|When in {{formation}} and standing, the color bearer keeps the military colors near his foot, holding {{his right hand}} down on the rod and his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the rod, at his chest level. The rod's low end must {{be in front of}} his right foot. When saluting from this position, the military colors are bowed at horizontal for the Romanian President and other heads of state and at 45degrees for the other civil and military staff. When marching, the color bearer holds the military colors vertically. If the unit is walking more than 100m, the rod is introduced inside the scarf's muff. When traveling by vehicle, the color bearer with the military color stands inside the unit commander's car. During the march, the color bearer salutes by bowing the military colors at 45degrees, regardless the person. When two military units cross each other (either one or both of them are marching {{in formation}}) the military colors are bowed for salute at 45degrees. In case of raining, snowing or strong winds, the military colors are protected by a transparent plastic cover.|$|E

25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, di Grassi led Sarrazin, Rosenqvist, Evans, Vergne, Prost, Carroll, Turvey, Duval, Dillmann, Heidfeld, Abt, Félix da Costa, Frijns, Engel, Buemi, López, d'Ambrosio, Bird and Piquet. Di Grassi began to pull away from the rest of the field. Sarrazin was put under {{pressure}} by Rosenqvist but defended his position from him. Attention then switched to Buemi who was beginning his move up the field. He adopted the positioning of his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his steering wheel against his bent steering arm. Heidfeld and Abt were able to enter the top-ten places and both battled for position. Abt passed Heidfeld for ninth place on the ninth lap. After ten laps Buemi had passed four drivers to run in 12th place. After Buemi had overtaken Duval for tenth position on the 14th lap, Heidfeld attempted to overtake Duval on the outside line, but Duval defended his position, leaving Heidfeld without any space on the dirty part of the track and the two made contact at turn six. Duval resumed but Heidfeld's front-right suspension was bent and drove to the side of the track at turn 12 to retire. Heidfeld's stricken car prompted the activation of the full course yellow procedure to enable marshals to remove it from the circuit and most drivers elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change into their second cars.|$|E
500|$|In the Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kubera is {{described}} {{as the embodiment of}} both Artha ("wealth, prosperity, glory") and Arthashastras, the treatises related to it—and his iconography mirrors it. Kubera's complexion {{is described}} as that of lotus leaves. He rides a man—the state personified, adorned in golden clothes and ornaments, symbolizing his wealth. His left eye is yellow. He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly. The Vishnudharmottara Purana further describes his face to be inclined to the left, sporting a beard and mustache, and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth, representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours. His wife Riddhi, representing the journey of life, is seated on his left lap, with her <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the back of Kubera and the right holding a ratna-patra (jewel-pot). Kubera should be four-armed, holding a gada (mace: symbol of [...] dandaniti—administration of justice) and a shakti (power) in his left pair, and standards bearing a lion—representing Artha and a shibika (a club, the weapon of Kubera). The nidhi treasures Padma and Shankha stand beside him in human form, with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively.|$|E

500|$|Several {{years after}} the events of The Legend of Zelda, the now-sixteen-year-old Link notices a strange mark {{on the back of}} his left hand, exactly like the crest of Hyrule. He seeks out Impa, who {{responds}} by taking Link to the North Castle, where a door has been magically sealed for generations. Impa places the back of Link's <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden. Impa tells Link that the maiden is Zelda (not the Zelda from the first game), the princess of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the [...] "Legend of Zelda". Zelda's brother had tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father's secrets concerning the last of three sacred golden triangle treasures of his kingdom, known collectively as the Triforce. Princess Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the prince's wizard friend, in anger, tried to strike her down with a spell. Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it. The prince, filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, in the hope that she would one day be awakened. He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy.|$|E

500|$|The central Buddha Hall is tall, with a large, paved courtyard. A porch {{leads to}} the open courtyard, which is two {{concentric}} circles with two temples: one in the outer circle and another in the inner circle. The outer circle has a circular path, {{with a number of}} large prayer wheels (nangkhor); this path {{leads to the}} main shrine, which is surrounded by chapels. Only one of the temple murals remains, depicting the arrival of Queen Wencheng and an image of the Buddha. The image, brought by the king's Nepalese wife and initially kept at Ramoche, was moved to Jokhang and kept in the rear center of the inner temple. This Buddha has remained on a platform since the eighth century; on a number of [...] occasions, it was moved for safekeeping. The image, amidst those of the king and his two consorts, has been gilded several times. In the main hall on the ground floor is a gilded bronze statue of Jowo Sakyamuni, [...] tall, representing the Buddha at age twelve. The image has a bejeweled crown, cover around its shoulder, a diamond on its forehead and wears a pearl-studded garment. The Buddha is seated in a lotus position on a three-tiered lotus throne, with his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his lap and his right hand touching the earth. A number of chapels surround the Jowo Sakayamuni, dedicated to gods and bodhisattvas. The most important bodhisattva here is the Avalokiteshwara, the patron saint of Tibet, with a thousand eyes and a thousand arms. Flanking the main hall are halls for Amitabha (the Buddha of the past) and Qamba (the Buddha of the future). Incarnations of Sakyamuni are enshrined on either side of a central axis, and the Buddha's warrior guard {{is in the middle of}} the halls on the left side.|$|E

500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim, who also directed the video for the group's subsequent single [...] "Do or Die", and shows the Super Furry Animals waiting to leave Mars having played a concert on the planet. The video begins with Gruff Rhys standing alone on the Martian soil, singing along to the song. A silver, computer generated, spaceship is seen landing behind Rhys. Around one minute into the track the camera pans back to reveal {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals sitting down to the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is sat on the floor playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large round face and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around and looks up to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before the camera moves behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes.

2500|$|Four-mallet vibists usually play scalar linear {{passages}} {{much the}} same as two-mallet players, using one mallet from each hand (outside right and inside left for Burton grip), except four-mallet players tend to make more use of double strokes, not only to avoid crossing hands but also to minimize motion between the two bar rows. For example, an ascending E flat major scale could be played L-R-R-L-L-R-R-L, keeping the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the [...] "black" [...] bars and the right hand on the [...] "white". For linear passages with leaps, all four mallets are often used sequentially.|$|E

The subsequent alterations, including the repainting of his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his hip, reduced the animation of the figure and increased its sense of monumentality. [...] The most richly elaborated areas are the background and head, with the latter constructed of many nuanced colors, thickly painted, and imparting a dynamic realism. In contrast to the impasted areas are the eye sockets, painted with subtle glazes, one eye in shadow and the effect enigmatic.|$|E
