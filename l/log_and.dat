5|$|Although {{there had}} been plenty of {{fighting}}, the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7thCavalry found it on 20March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8thCavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese bunkers, actually <b>log</b> <b>and</b> earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Current {{databases}} need <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery {{to maintain}} the correctness properties of transactions and consistency of the database under failures. Also, <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery have tremendous performance implications. While {{there has been a}} lot of work that deals with <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery algorithms for traditional disk resident databases ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and Main Memory Databases (MMDB) ([6, 7]), researchers have not systematically explored the issue of <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery in Real-Time Databases (RTDB). In fact, there is a need 109 110 REAL-TIME DATABASE SYSTEMS: ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNIQUES for designing new algorithms for <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery in RTDBs because the sequential nature of <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> the lack of time and priority cognizance during recovery are not in tune with the priority oriented and preemptive nature of activities in RTDBs. This chapter motivates the need to do <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery differently in Real-Time Databa...|$|R

5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, the <b>Log</b> <b>and</b> Line—a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Published in 1921, Around the Boree <b>Log</b> <b>and</b> Other Verses {{was written}} by Patrick Joseph Hartigan, under the pen name John O'Brien. A Roman Catholic priest, after early stints at Thurgoona and Berrigan, in 1917 Hartigan was {{appointed}} as the parish priest of Narrandera where he stayed until 1944. His poems recorded the everyday lives and mateship {{of the people of}} the Riverina. His friend and well-known poet C. J. Dennis hailed them in the Bulletin as in 'the direct Lawson-Paterson line mainly—unaffected talk about Australians, much as they would naturally talk about themselves'. Around the Boree Log ran to five editions and 18,000 copies by 1926.|$|E
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} <b>log</b> <b>and</b> scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the transistor and integrated circuits in the 1960s made electric logs vastly more reliable.

5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police <b>log</b> <b>and</b> at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{joined the}} Marsh Agency, and {{although}} Lubin landed him his biggest role {{to date in}} The First Traveling Saleslady (1956) and later hired him for Escapade in Japan, without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling. Upon the advice of Irving Leonard, his financial advisor, he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC's Reader's Digest series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a Highway Patrol episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in West Point series and a suicidal gold prospector on Death Valley Days. In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of Navy <b>Log</b> <b>and</b> in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on Maverick opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money. Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture Lafayette Escadrille and {{played a major role}} as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in Ambush at Cimarron Pass, a film which Eastwood viewed disastrously and professes to be the lowest point of his career.|$|E
5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's <b>log</b> <b>and</b> the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E
