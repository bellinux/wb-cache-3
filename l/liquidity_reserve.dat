First, because banks commit themselves to lend, they carry costly <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> to meet their obligations. Due to liquidity costs, the interest rate on commitment loans is high relative to spot loans. Second, high interest rates trigger moral hazard.

40|$|We study a {{continuous}} time {{model of a}} levered firm with fixed assets generating a cash flow that fluctuates with business conditions. Since external finance is costly, the firm holds a liquid (cash) reserve to help survive periods of poor business conditions. Holding liquid assets inside the firm is costly {{as some of the}} return on such assets is dissipated due to agency problems. We solve for the firms optimal dividend, share issuance, and liquid asset holding policies. The firm optimally targets a level of liquid assets which is a non-monotonic function of business conditions. In good times, the firm does not need a high <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve,</b> but as conditions deteriorate, it will target higher reserve. In very poor conditions, the firm will declare bankruptcy, usually after it has depleted its <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve.</b> Our model can predict liquidity holdings, leverage ratios, yield spreads, expected default probabilities, expected loss given default and equity volatilities all in line with market experience. We apply the model to examine agency conflicts associated with the <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve,</b> and some associated debt covenants. We see that a restrictive covenant applied to the <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve</b> will often enhance the debt value as well as the equity value. contingent claims; corporate finance; dividend policy; liquidity...|$|E

40|$|We study {{information}} acquisition and withdrawal decisions when a liquidity event triggers a spreading rumor and exposes a bank to a run. Uncertainty about the bank’s liquidity and potential failure motivates agents who hear the rumor to acquire additional signals. Depositors with unfavorable signals may wait and thus gradually {{run on the}} bank, leading to an endogenous aggregate withdrawal speed. A bank run equilibrium exists when agents aggressively acquire information. We study threshold parameters (e. g. <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve</b> and deposit insurance) that eliminate runs. Public provision of solvency information can eliminate runs by indirectly crowding-out individual depositors ’ effort to acquire liquidity information. However, providing too much information that slightly differentiates competing solvent-but-illiquid banks can result in inefficient runs. JEL Classification: D 8, G...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews how {{central banks}} {{allocate}} seigniorage, based on systematic crosscountry comparisons of their financial accounts. Central banks {{are classified as}} weak or strong, depending upon their structural profitability. Weak central banks typically (although not exclusively) operate in smaller and less wealthy countries, lack independence from their governments, and are burdened by compulsory transfers and low capital. Their operating expenditures, nonperforming assets, international reserve carrying costs, and international reserve accumulation needs are high. Governance {{appears to be a}} potential concern in many central banks, both weak and strong, with operating expenditures often adjusting upward for high profitability and capital accumulation adjusting downward for low profitability.

40|$|In this paper, I {{study how}} {{corporate}} governance influences firms' choices between cash and lines of credit. Stakeholders may disagree about firms' liquidity choices because they {{differ in the}} allocation of ex-post control rights for the firms' <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves.</b> Using state-level changes in takeover protection as exogenous shocks to corporate governance, I find that firms increase cash relative to lines of credit when the threat of takeover weakens.

40|$|Emergency {{liquidity}} {{assistance to}} banking institutions is usually dis-cussed {{in isolation from}} banking regulation. Instead, theoretical literature has kept a focus on issues relating to the information structure between banks and the lender of last resort. Also, controlling for moral hazard among banks due to safety nets was mainly attained through an element of ambiguity regarding the ultimate decision of a central bank to resolve a liquidity crisis, rather than through regulation. In this paper, regulat-ing a bank’s <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve</b> is considered quid pro quo for emergency liquidity assistance by a central bank. Asymmetric information among bank’s claimholders (depositors) {{turns out to be}} pivotal in providing an insurance-based rationale for liquidity regulation, where liquidity regula-tion is warranted if and only if the total-loans-to-deposits ratio is above a threshold that is explicitly evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{counter-cyclical}} liquidity hoarding by financial intermediaries may strongly amplify business cycles. It develops a dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} in which banks operate subject to agency problems and funding liquidity risk in their inter- mediation activity. Importantly, the amount of <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> held in the financial sector is determined endogenously: Balance sheet constraints force banks to trade off insurance against funding outflows with loan scale. A financial crisis, simulated as an abrupt decline in the collateral value of bank assets, triggers a flight to liquidity, which strongly amplifies the initial shock and induces credit crunch dynamics sharing key features with the Great Recession.

Meanwhile in Islamic banks, CAR result significantly positive effect on liquidity risk, while ROA shows negative and significant result. Possible explanation for this is that, given the huge profit by the conventional banks, it has more chance to allocate it as <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve</b> as well as increasing the facilities (improvement on technology). When the NPL is high, conventional banks will increase the liquid assets as a buffer.

30|$|The most {{important}} component of any short-term stimulus is the relaxing of the money supply. So far, interest rates have been lowered twice. But this is far from enough. Moreover, the reserve deposit ratio is currently too high at 20  %. It should be 17  %, a rate that would have raised {{the amount of money}} available for lending at commercial banks to RMB 2500 – 3000 billion. M 2 can also grow at the expected target rate of 16  %. As for monetary policy, the central bank should amend or abandon the use of interest rate adjustments or “punitive” (or “differential”) reserve ratio requirement hikes which local branches have been required to make in the last 2  years. This would free employees up from the monotonous task of monitoring these numbers from around the country. Instead, local Banking Regulatory Commissions should be allowed to determine the proper scale of lending for commercial banks by applying the set of relevant formulas for calculating <b>liquidity,</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio requirement, and risks devised by the central Banking Regulatory Commission. The central bank should focus on combating money laundering and managing in-flows and out-flows of foreign currencies and payments and receipts for cross-border transactions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} which studies the business-cycle implications of financial frictions and liquidity risk at the bank-level. Following Holmstr m and Tirole (1998), demand for <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> arises from the anticipation of idiosyncratic operating expenses during the execution phase of bank-financed investment projects. Banks react to adverse aggregate shocks by hoarding liquidity while being forced to decrease their leverage. Both effects amplify recessionary dynamics, since they crowd out funds available for investment financing. This mechanism is triggered by a market liquidity squeeze modelled {{as a shock to}} the collateral value of banks assets. This novel type of aggregate risk induces a credit crunch scenario which shares key features with the Great Recession such as strong output decline, pro-cyclical leverage and counter-cyclical liquidity hoarding.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Islamic banking {{products and}} interprets {{them in the}} context of financial intermediation theory. Anecdotal evidence shows that many of the conventional products can be redrafted as Sharia-compliant products, so that the differences are smaller than expected. Comparing conventional and Islamic banks and controlling for other bank and country characteristics, the authors find few significant differences in business orientation, efficiency, asset quality, or stability. While Islamic banks seem more cost-effective than conventional banks in a broad cross-country sample, this finding reverses in a sample of countries with both Islamic and conventional banks. However, conventional banks that operate in countries with a higher market share of Islamic banks are more cost-effective but less stable. There is also consistent evidence of higher capitalization of Islamic banks and this capital cushion plus higher <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> explains the relatively better performance of Islamic banks during the recent crisis.
