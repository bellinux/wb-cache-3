25|$|Earlier, in Brulotte v. Thys Co. , the Supreme Court {{held that}} it was patent misuse if, without more, a {{patentee}} charged royalties that extended beyond the statutory term of the patent. In National <b>Lockwasher</b> Co. v. George K. Garrett Co., the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a patentee misused its patent by requiring licensees to agree not to deal in the technology of the patentee’s competitors. Thus, in these cases, among many others, the Supreme Court and other federal courts had found misuse in cases not involving price fixing or tie-ins, and had not required any rule-of-reason or relevant-market analysis.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Lockwasher</b> {{case was}} {{followed}} by courts in several other circuits. In 2010, the Federal Circuit ruled, however, that similar conduct is not misuse. A 2015 decision of the Supreme Court may {{call into question the}} Federal Circuit's decision in that case.|$|E
40|$|The rhythmic {{movement}} of the microtubular axostyle in the termite flagellate, Pyrsonympha vertens, was analyzed with polarization and electron microscopy. The protozoan axostyle is birefringent {{as a result of}} the semi-crystalline alignment of approximately 2, 000 microtubules. The birefringence of the organelle permits analysis of the beat pattern in vivo. Modifications of the beat pattern were achieved with visible and UV microbeam irradiation. The beating axostyle is helically twisted and has two principal movements, one resembling ciliary and the other flagellar beating. The anterior portion of the beating axostyle has effective and recovery phases with each beat thereby simulating the flexural motion of a beating cilium. Undulations develop from the flexural flipping motion of the anterior segment and travel along the axostyle like flagellar waves. The shape of the waves differs from that of flagellar waves, however, and are described as sawtooth waves. The propagating sawtooth waves contain a sharp bend, approximately 3 micron in length, made up of two opposing flexures followed by a straight helical segment approximately 23 micron long. The average wavelength is approximately 25 micron, and three to four sawtooth waves travel along the axostyle at one time. The bends are nearly planar and can travel in either direction along the axostyle with equal velocity. At temperatures between 5 degrees and 30 degrees C, one sees a proportionate increase or decrease in wave propagation velocity as the temperature is raised or lowered. Beating stops below 5 degrees C but will resume if the preparation is warmed. A microbeam of visible light shone on a small segment of the axostyle causes the typical sawtooth waves to transform into short sine-like waves that accumulate in the area irradiated. Waves entering the affected region appear to stimulate waves already accumulated there to move, and waves that emerge take on the normal sawtooth wave pattern. The effective wavelengths of visible light capable of modifying the wave pattern is in the blue region of the spectrum. The axostyle is severed when irradiated with an intense microbeam of UV light. Short segments of axostyle produced by severing it at two places with a UV microbeam can curl upon themselves into shapes resembling <b>lockwashers.</b> We propose that the sawtooth waves in the axostyle of P. vertens are generated by interrow cross-bridges which are active in the straight regions...|$|R

50|$|The 2015 {{decision}} of the Supreme Court in Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, however, may call the soundness of Princo into question. The Kimble Court firmly rejected efforts to assimilate the patent misuse doctrine to antitrust law and explained in some detail the different policies {{at work in the}} two bodies of law. The Court insisted that patent policy rather than antitrust policy must govern patent misuse cases. One statement of patent policy is found in the Constitution, which authorizes Congress to establish patent laws to promote the progress of the useful arts. Arguably, a conspiracy to suppress a competitive technology is inconsistent with the policy to promote technological progress, as the <b>Lockwasher</b> case suggests.|$|E
50|$|National <b>Lockwasher</b> owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring {{lock washers}} with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A lock washer is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|E
