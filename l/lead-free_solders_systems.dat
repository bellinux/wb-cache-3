Although PBGA packages have many advantages such as {{a larger number of}} I/Os, robust assembly process, and better thermal / electrical performance, their board level reliability is still a major concern. This is because their solder joints have a relatively short stand-off height especially for the Chip Scale Package (CSP). It is a global trend to replace today's harmful lead-containing <b>solders</b> with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> in future electronic products. Although there are various <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>systems</b> available in the industry, people are still unsure over the selection of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> {{due to the lack of}} reliability data. When implementing such a large change in a material system, the effect on the reliability is always the first concern, especially at the board level. The implementation of the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> is a challenging process. It involves lots of study of process control and reliability for the board level interconnects. This brings out the value of the current study on the experimental evaluation of board level solder joint reliability of plastic ball grid array assemblies with eutectic lead-tin and <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders.</b> Four different reliability tests, namely the accelerated temperature cycling test, three point bending test, random vibration test, and the mechanical drop test were performed to evaluate the reliability of the <b>lead-free</b> board level <b>solder</b> joint. Five DOE testing programs including four lead-free systems with different combinations of solder materials and peak reflow temperatures together with one conventional lead-tin eutectic were arranged for the PBGA samples. In the present study, it is found that the selected <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> candidates had better performances than the eutectic lead-tin solder when subjected to the thermal fatigue load. However, the four <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>systems</b> had poorer performances than the eutectic lead-tin solder when subjected to the mechanical loads. The effect of solder joint size on board level reliability was found in CSP samples.

Good wettability of Sn-Ag-Cu-Pr is obtained with around 0 · 05 %- 0 · 1 % (mass fraction) Pr. When measured at 260 ℃, the wetting force of of SnAgCu solder was increased by 5. 0 % with 0. 1 %Pr and the wetting time of SnAgCu solder was descreased by 16. 9 %. The mechanical properties of soldered joints are enhanced with the addition of Pr, and the soldered joints possess the peak values of shear stress when the Pr addition is about 0. 05 % in Sn-Ag-Cu-Pr solder joint.

40|$|Solder joints play an {{important}} role in electronics packaging, serving both as electrical interconnections between the components and the board, and as mechanical support for components. As the trend towards further miniaturisation of pocket and handheld consumer electronics products continue apace, the requirements for even smaller solder joints will continue. With further reductions in the size of solder joints, the reliability of solder joints will become more and more critical to the long-term performance of these electronic products. One of the most important factors which are known to influence solder joint reliability is the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer formed between the solder and the substrate. Although the formation of an IMC layer signifies good bonding between the solder and substrate, its main disadvantage is that it is also known to be the most brittle part of the solder joint. Thus as the miniaturisation trend continues and solder joints become even smaller in size, the nature and impact of IMCs on solder joint reliability becomes even more of a concern with the introduction of new <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy <b>systems.</b> Although the IMC formation in Sn-Pb alloys have been studied extensively and a number of empirical relationships have been developed, there are very few reports on the Sn-Ag-Cu alloy systems and there is wide agreement that the existing empirical kinetic relationships developed for Sn-Pb alloy can not be extrapolated to fit the new Sn-Ag-Cu alloy systems. The objectives of the study were therefore to study the effect of solder volume on IMC layer formation and growth rate, the effect of reflow soldering profile on Pb-free solder joint microstructure and IMC formation, and the effect of the rework process on the Pb-free solder joint microstructure and IMC formation. This study on the formation and growth of IMC in the new Sn-Ag-Cu <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy <b>system</b> is divided into three main parts. The first part concerns the study of the effect of solder volume on IMC formation and growth rate. The second part of the study concerns the experimental investigation of the effect of reflow soldering profile on solder joint microstructures and IMC formation. The focus of the final part of the study is the investigation of the effect of the rework process on the Pb-free solder joint microstructure and IMC formation. The key research questions explored in the study include the following: What is the effect of solder volume (size) on the IMC layer? What is the effect of primary and secondary rework reflow profile parameters on IMC formation? The results of the experimental work conducted show that the solder volume has very little influence on the growth pattern of the IMC, suggesting that the IMC layer thickness is not very volume sensitive. Further work is however needed, given continuing trend to, wards further miniaturisation of hand held and pocket consumer electronic products - the size of the solder joint might in future be limited by the IMC layer thickness. With further reductions in joint size, with IMC layer thickness remaining the same, the ratio of the IMC layer thickness to solder joint size will increase and adversely impact the joint reliabilit...|$|R

In particular, accidental dropping is believed to cause substantial damage to the solder joints. The increasing occurrence of drop failure of portable electronics has been traced to the failure of the solder joints that interconnect the integrated circuit (IC) components with the printed circuit board (PCB). The increasing market pressure to replace lead based solder in electronic products has resulted in research being carried out in many areas related to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Thus, the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints under mechanical shock loading is a major concern. The main objective of this thesis is to study the failure mechanism and life prediction for lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joint subject to repetitive mechanical drop loading. The emphasis will be placed on the strain hardening effect of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint under repetitive mechanical drop loading. The mechanical properties of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy were first studied by the tensile test. The results showed that the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was strongly strain rate dependent. The constitutive model of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was built. Nanoindentation tests were employed to obtain the mechanical properties of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC. The nanoindentation hardness value for SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC was found to decrease with increasing aging time. The IMC layers grew in thickness during thermal aging tests, while there were no significant changes in the Young’s modulus of IMC. High speed ball pull tests were used to find the brittle fracture strength of IMC. The simulation of the high speed ball pull tests were studied and correlated with the high speed ball pull tests. Then the IMC brittle failure criterion was established. The strain hardening effects of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> were found by solder wire drop test and board level drop test (BLDT).

40|$|As {{the world}} moves towards {{eliminating}} lead from consumer products, the microelectronics industry has {{put effort into}} developing <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste. The major drawback of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> is the problems caused by its high reflow temperature. Variable frequency microwave (VFM) processing {{has been shown to}} allow some materials to be processed at lower temperatures.

With further reductions {{in the size of}} solder joints, the reliability of solder joints will become more and more critical to the long-term performance of electronic products. Solder joints {{play an important role in}} electronics packaging, serving both as electrical interconnections between the components and the board, and as mechanical support for components. With world-wide legislation for the removal/reduction of lead and other hazardous materials from electrical and electronic products, the electronics manufacturing industry has been faced with an urgent search for new <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy <b>systems</b> and other <b>solder</b> alternatives. In order to achieve high volume, low cost production, the stencil printing process and subsequent wafer bumping of solder paste has become indispensable. There is wide agreement in industry that the paste printing process accounts for the majority of assembly defects, and most defects originate from poor understanding of the effect of printing process parameters on printing performance. The printing of ICAs and <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> pastes through the very small stencil apertures required for flip chip applications was expected to result in increased stencil clogging and incomplete transfer of paste to the printed circuit pads. Paste release from the stencil apertures is dependent on the interaction between the solder paste, surface pad and aperture wall; including its shape. At these very narrow aperture sizes the paste rheology becomes crucial for consistent paste withdrawal because for smaller paste volumes surface tension effects become dominant over viscous flow. Successful aperture filling and release will greatly depend on the rheology of the paste material. Wall-slip plays an important role in characterising the flow behaviour of solder paste materials. The wall- slip arises due to the various attractive and repulsive forces acting between the solder particles and the walls of the measuring geometry. These interactions could lead to the presence of a thin solvent layer adjacent to the wall, which gives rise to slippage. The wall slip effect can play an important role in ensuring successful paste release after the printing process. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the paste microstructure on slip formation for the paste materials (<b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste and isotropic conductive adhesives). The effect of surface roughness on the paste viscosity was investigated. It was also found that altering the surface roughness of the parallel plate measuring geometry did not significantly eliminate wall slip as was expected. But results indicate that the use of a relatively rough surface helps to increase paste adhesion to the plates, inducing structural breakdown of the paste. Most importantly, the study also demonstrated on how the wall slip formation in the paste material could be utilised for understanding of the paste microstructure and its flow behaviou...|$|R

Theorethical part {{is focused on}} the types of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> wettability tests performed on solder joints, different types of soldering or comparison of influence of the base material in regards to the wetting of the solder. The goal of practical part is testing and comparison of spreadability of selected <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> on two conductive surfaces with different concentration of oxygen in protective nitrogen atmosphere. Testing has been performed on ceramic substrate which differs this method from others, performed on organic substrate. For an over-melted solder, the crystal-growth on surface in regards to protective atmosphere concentration is shown...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{work has}} been {{conducted}} by industry to develop <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> for electronics applications. The driving force behind this effort is pressure to ban or tax the use of lead-bearing solders. There has been further interest to reduce the use of hazardous chemical cleaners. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> and low-residue, ``no clean`` assembly processing are being considered as solutions to these environmental issues. Most of the {{work has been}} directed toward commercial and military printed wiring board (PWB) technology, although similar problems confront the hybrid microcircuit (HMC) industry, where the development of <b>lead-free</b> HMC <b>solders</b> is generally lagging. Sandia National Laboratories is responsible for designing a variety of critical, high reliability hybrid components for radars. Sandia has consequently initiated a project, {{as part of its}} Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing program, to develop low-residue, <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> for HMCs. This paper discusses the progress of that work...|$|R
40|$|Among various <b>lead-free</b> alloys, Sn-Ag(-Cu) <b>system</b> <b>solders</b> are {{considered}} the most promising <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> for both wave and reflow soldering technology. Moreover, to improve the characteristics of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> {{the effect of the}} addition of minor elements to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> on the properties of solder and interfacial reactions have been studied. The purpose of this research was to investigate the addition of Ni or Co to the Sn-Ag solder on the microstructure and the joint strength of the interface with metallization layer of the substrate. As a metallization layer of the substrate, bare Cu and electroless Ni-P plating were used. For the reflow process, test samples were heated in a radiation furnace at 523 K for 60 s, and for the aging process, some samples were heat-treated in an oil bath at 423 K for 168 h, 504 h and 1008 h. Results show the addition of Ni or Co was effective for the IMC formation and growth at the interface with a Cu pad during reflow and aging process, and the addition of Co, except Ni, affected the pull strength of the solder joint with electroless Ni-P plating during aging process.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how collaboration networks are formed among university, {{industry and the}} public sector and work {{for the creation of}} innovation. The focus of this study is placed on the development of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> in the electric and electronic industry in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The structure of innovation networks on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> is analyzed with quantitative methods of social network analysis, based on data on the membership of research and development projects and scientific papers. While initiatives to regulate the use of lead for soldering were made earlier in the United States, development and adoption of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> progressed significantly in Japan through the formation of research and development networks. This case suggests that university could {{play a crucial role in}} establishing innovation networks among relevant actors in the private as well as public sectors. To implement an effective transition to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> cooperation and coordination was indispensable among relevant actors, including those working on chip implementation, solders, manufacturing equipment, parts, devices, print boards, and measurement instruments.

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} two major driving forces for {{considering}} alternative materials to lead-based products, specifically interconnections, in electronics applications, including the impending legislation or regulations which may tax, restrict, or eliminate the use of lead and the trend toward advanced interconnection technology, which may challenge the limits of present soldering technology. The reliability of solder joints is a concern because fracture failures in solder joints accounts for 70 % of failures in electronic components. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> are being investigated as replacements for lead solders currently used in electronics. Thermo-mechanical properties describe the stresses accumulated due to thermal fatigue as a result of CTE mismatch within the system. By understanding the failure mechanisms related to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> the application of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> could be more strategically designed for reliability. The objective of this thesis is to observe microstructural change in large-area solder joints caused by thermal cycling and relate these changes to reliability issues in large-area lead and <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> cons tructed semiconductor power devices. This study focused on the microstructural changes within the solder alloy of a large-area solder joint under thermal cyclin...|$|R
