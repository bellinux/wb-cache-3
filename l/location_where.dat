50|$|In some cases, {{the term}} current source {{refers to a}} {{boundary}} where charge flows from <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> it is not measured to <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> it is measured. In a similar fashion, a current sink may refer to the boundary where charge flows from <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> it is measured to <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> it is not measured. By analogy to the flow of water, a current source {{would be like a}} mountain spring - water flows from its source (a hidden location underground) to the surface where it is easily observed. Using the same analogy, a current sink would be like water flowing down a drain - water travels from where it is observed to where it is not observed.|$|R

5|$|The rank of {{midshipman}} originated {{during the}} Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally {{referred to a}} post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published {{use of the term}} midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the <b>location</b> <b>where</b> midshipmen worked on the ship, or the <b>location</b> <b>where</b> midshipmen were berthed.|$|E

5|$|A disused quarry at East Kirkton in the Bathgate Hills is the <b>location</b> <b>where</b> the Carboniferous fossil of Westlothiana lizziae (aka 'Lizzie') {{was found}} in 1984.

The site was originally discovered in the early 19th century and has also provided fossil eurypterids, sharks and a variety of primitive acanthodian fish.|$|E

Yardley moved a man from fine leg to the <b>location</b> <b>where</b> the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a <b>location</b> <b>where</b> capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E
