The method consists in loading at each step {{a small part of the}} two meshes and computing the symmetrical distance for these areas.

For this, one of the two meshes is simplified and then a correspondence between the simplified mesh and the triangles of the input meshes is done. The experiments show that the proposed method is very efficient in terms of memory cost, while producing results comparable to the existent tools for the small and medium size meshes. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to compute the distance for massive meshes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the dawn}} of the data {{intensive}} research era, scientific dis-covery deploys data analysis techniques similar to those that drive busi-ness intelligence. Similar to classical Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) processes, data is <b>loaded</b> <b>entirely</b> from external data sources (reposito-ries) into a scientific data warehouse before it can be analyzed. This process is both, time and resource intensive and may not be entirely necessary if only a subset of the data is of interest to a particular user. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel technique to lower the costs for data loading: Lazy ETL. Data is extracted and loaded transpar-ently on-the-fly only for the required data items. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant reduction of the time from source data avail-ability to query answer compared to state-of-the-art solutions. In addi-tion to reducing the costs for bootstrapping a scientific data warehouse, our approach also reduces the costs for loading new incoming data. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We define in {{this paper}} an {{extended}} solution to improve an Out-of-Core data structure which is the streaming format, by adding new information allowing to reduce file access cost, reducing the neighborhood access delay to constant time. The original streaming format is conceived to manipulate huge triangular meshes. It assumes that the whole mesh cannot be <b>loaded</b> <b>entirely</b> into the main memory. That's why the authors {{did not include the}} neighborhood in the file structure. However, almost all of the applications need the neighborhood information in the triangular structures. Using the original streaming format does not allow us to extract the neighborhood information easily. By adding the neighbor indices to the file {{in the same way as}} the original format, we can benefit from the streaming format, and at the same time, guarantee a constant time access to the neighborhood. We have adapted our new structure so that it can allow us to apply our direct access algorithm to different parts of the structure without having to go through the entire file.

40|$|Along with {{increased}} {{oil prices and}} rising environmental issues, a demand for alternatives to combustion engine driven hydraulic applications has risen. In the field of mobile hydraulics, the hydraulic applications have traditionally been driven by the combustion engine of the vehicle on which they are mounted. By instead using a battery driven power pack the hydraulic application is able to operate without the engine running, saving fuel costs and reducing sound levels. In this thesis, the concept of using an electric-hydraulic power pack with a variable-speed electric motor and a fixed-displacement hydraulic pump to provide power to a truck-mounted loader crane is investigated. This concept is compared to an electric-hydraulic system imitating the conventional combustion engine system by using a fixed-speed electric motor connected to a variable-displacement pump. The use of a variable speed motor where the speed can be controlled electrically by a control unit creates possibilities of using different control strategies to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the application. The efficiencies of the two electric-hydraulic systems are compared by constructing a physical test rig and performing measurements in a test lab. The tests have shown an increased efficiency of about 20 % when using the variable speed configuration. Three different control strategies are also investigated and tested on a simulated model. The simulations show that very good responsiveness and robustness {{can be achieved by}} using a hydraulic flow feed forward controller with a complementary pressure feedback controller. Furthermore, by controlling the hydraulic flow to the heaviest of the crane <b>loads</b> <b>entirely</b> with the flow from the hydraulic pump, the hydraulic pressure can be reduced and energy efficiency increased...|$|R

40|$|Besides a {{sufficient}} energy supply, concepts for accommodations require an intelligent water management. Using {{the example of}} quarters {{that do not have}} water and energy access, a dynamic simulation model is presented in which a rainwater harvesting concept is implemented and simulated over one year using MATLAB-Simulink. The aim is to minimize respectively suspend the use of fossil energy sources and to guarantee the provision of decentralized clean drinking water. Since traditional water bodies, e. g. groundwater, are increasingly polluted and depleted, utilisation of alternative sources is prudent. Especially in rural areas, where access to drinking water is scarce, rainwater is suitable for providing potable water. Besides its beneficial chemical water properties, it is easily accessed in a decentralized manner, which makes it a preferred choice in areas with sufficient precipitation. However, access to rainwater is limited by its occurrence and contamination, calling for proper storage, utilisation, and treatment strategies. For this purpose, a rainwater harvesting system, including different water and energy management systems, was modelled and implemented using the site of the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity in Cambodia as an example. For the simulation, a precipitation generator was implemented using real historical rain event data. An appropriate rainwater treatment process was chosen, consisting of a microfiltration and a subsequent ultrafiltration unit removing bacteriological <b>loads</b> <b>entirely.</b> Both were modelled and implemented dynamically. Using the site of the Angkor Centre of Conservation of Biodiversity, a complete rainwater harvesting plant was implemented including harvest, storage, and utilization of rainwater. Further, a renewable energy management strategy is developed, using photovoltaic modules and batteries.

Recent observations indicating a greater role of renal glucose metabolism in various physiologic and pathologic conditions have rekindled the interest in renal glucose handling as a potential target {{for the treatment of}} diabetes. The enormous capacity of the proximal tubular cells to reabsorb the filtered glucose <b>load</b> <b>entirely,</b> utilizing the sodium-glucose co-transporter system (primarily SGLT- 2), became the focus of attention. Original studies conducted in experimental animals with the nonspecific SGLT inhibitor phlorizin showed that hyperglycemia after pancreatectomy decreased as a result of forced glycosuria. Subsequently, several compounds with more selective SGLT- 2 inhibition properties (&# 8220;second-generation&# 8221;) were developed. Some agents made it into pre-clinical and clinical trials and a few have already been approved for commercial use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In general, a 6 -month period of therapy with SGLT- 2 inhibitors is followed by a mean urinary glucose excretion rate of ~ 80 g/day accompanied by a decline in fasting and postprandial glucose with average decreases in HgA 1 C ~ 1. 0 %. Concomitant body weight loss and a mild but consistent drop in blood pressure also have been reported. In contrast, transient polyuria, thirst with dehydration and occasional hypotension have been described early in the treatment. In addition, {{a significant increase in the}} occurrence of uro-genital infections, particularly in women has been documented with the use of SGLT- 2 inhibitors.

Silicon measurement results verify the viability of the technique for embedded processors. Furthermore, the proposed clock modulation technique demonstrates a significant area reduction, without compromising the detection performance.

Based on the proposed method, the FGMs were idealized to be composed of finite uniform layers, each of which is represented by one repeated unit cell. The titanium (Ti) matrix is modeled as an isotropic hardening elastic plastic solid following the incremental (J 2) theory of plasticity. As the strength and fracture toughness of hydroxyappatite (HA) inclusion is very weak as compared with the Ti metal, the HA particles may be broken firstly when the composite is subjected to an excessive load. The brittle failure criterion has been implemented in the VUMAT subroutine using the finite element software ABAQUS. A uniaxial tension test along the y-axis of the unit cell has been simulated. The simulation results show that the load-bearing capability of Ti/HA FGMs will decrease rapidly with the increase in the volume fraction of HA.
