40|$|Growth and {{survival}} of the larvae of milkfish (Chanos chanos), seabass (Lates calcarifer) and rabbitfish (Siganus guttatus) in 40, 200 and 500 liter rearing tanks were evaluated at day 14. Milkfish larvae survived better (46 %) in 500 l than in 200 <b>l</b> (7 %) <b>tanks.</b> All larvae died on day 6 in the 40 <b>l</b> <b>tanks.</b> Growth was better in the 200 <b>l</b> <b>tanks</b> than in the 500 <b>l</b> <b>tanks.</b> The survival rate of the seabass larvae was significantly different in the 40 l (47 %), 200 l (61 %) and 500 <b>l</b> (75 %) <b>tanks,</b> but growth was highest in the 40 <b>l</b> <b>tanks.</b> Rabbitfish larvae had the highest survival in 500 <b>l</b> <b>tanks</b> (7 %) but the same growth in all tank sizes. The optimum tank size may vary for different fish species. However, small containers are more convenient to use because they require less manpower, are easily manipulated and more cost- effective...|$|R

50|$|Large {{volumes of}} water enable more {{stability}} {{in a tank}} by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium. The bigger the tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, because the effects of that event are diluted. For example, {{the death of the}} only fish in an 11 <b>L</b> <b>tank</b> causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 400 <b>L</b> <b>tank</b> with many other fish in it represents only a minor change. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks, as they require less attention.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to gain}} understanding of certain aspects of natural convection in a glass-melting tank heated locally from below. Based on numerical predictions, the effects of Rayleigh number, geometry of heated strip and tank on the flow patterns and heat transfer are investigated for Rayleigh numbers in the range 10 (2) to 10 (7), strip width to <b>tank</b> <b>length</b> ratios 0. 1 - 0. 5 and half-tank aspect ratios 1. 0, 3. 0 and 7. 0. The effect of the heated strip position is studied by placing it at centre and off-centre positions at the tank bottom wall. The effect of Rayleigh number on heat transfer is found to be significant. The Nusselt number is obtained as a function of Rayleigh number, heated strip width to <b>tank</b> <b>length</b> ratio and <b>tank</b> aspect ratio. Augmentation of flow circulation intensity and fluid temperature results when increasing the <b>tank</b> <b>length</b> and strip width. A scale analysis led to a behaviour which is confirmed by the numerical results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stocking}} of stocking density and tank size on early {{growth and survival}} of grouper, Epinephelus coioides (=suillus) larvae were determined. In one experiment, larvae were stocked in 500 <b>L</b> <b>tanks</b> at densities of 5, 10, 20 and 30 per liter and fed rotifers at 15 ind/mL. After 21 d, larvae attained best growth (9. 6 mm) and highest survival (32. 2 %) at 20 /L. In another experiment, larvae were stocked at 30 /L in 40 L, 200 L and 500 <b>L</b> circular fiberglass <b>tanks.</b> Survival was highest in 500 L (22. 3 %) and lowest in 40 <b>L</b> <b>tanks</b> (0. 5 %), but larvae in 200 <b>L</b> <b>tanks</b> were larger (8. 2 mm total length, 1. 5 mg dry weight) on day 21. Thus in small tanks, 20 larvae/L is the optimum stocking density. In larger <b>tanks</b> of 500 <b>L,</b> 30 larvae/L is feasible.

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was done by}} challenging the fish with 109 CFU/ml of live S. agalactiae using different routes of infection. The fish (n= 192) were divided into four groups with duplicates. Group 1 (n= 24) were exposed to S. agalactiae through intraperitoneal (IP) route and transferred into the 6 <b>L</b> <b>tank,</b> Group 2 (n= 24) were exposed to S. agalactiae through immersion bath (IM) (5 L of water + 1 L of S. agalactiae broth) for 10 min before being transferred into the 6 <b>L</b> <b>tank</b> and Group 3 (n= 24) were exposed to S. agalactiae through immersion bath (5 L of water + 1 L of S. agalactiae broth) for 10 min with the body of fish being incised (IC) (0.5 cm) at the caudal part before being transferred into the 6 <b>L</b> <b>tank.</b> Group 4 (n= 24) was the control unchallenged group. The fish were kept for 24 h off fed and the clinical signs were observed continuously within 24 h duration of the experiment. The gills, brain, eyes and kidney were collected from three fish four hourly within 24 h. The tissue samples were subjected to bacterial culture, PCR, histopathology and IHC.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} the finite element {{analysis}} of the water tanks in Eulerian approach. In the governing equations of fluid in a container, pressure {{is considered to be}} the independent nodal variables. The sloshing behaviour of fluid due to harmonic excitation for different <b>tank</b> <b>lengths</b> is investigated. The free surface of the fluid gets higher elevation when the <b>length</b> of the <b>tank</b> is equal to the height of the water in the tank. The hydrodynamic pressure along the wall increases with the decrease of <b>length</b> of the <b>tank.</b> The fluid with in the tank has tendency to rotate for comparatively lower <b>tank</b> <b>length</b> which enhances the hydrodynamic pressure on tank walls...|$|R

5000|$|The {{addition}} of [...] "wet" [...] hardpoints meant the F-100C could carry {{a pair of}} 275 U.S. gal (1,040 l) {{and a pair of}} 200 U.S. gal (770 <b>l)</b> drop <b>tanks.</b> However, the combination caused a loss of directional stability at high speeds and the four tanks were soon replaced by a pair of 450 U.S. gal (1,730 <b>l)</b> drop <b>tanks.</b> The 450s proved scarce and expensive and were often replaced by smaller 335 US gal (1,290 <b>l)</b> <b>tanks.</b> Most troubling to TAC was the fact that, as of 1965, only 125 F-100Cs were capable of utilizing all non-nuclear weapons in the air force inventory, particularly cluster bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. By the time the F-100C was phased out in June 1970, 85 had been lost in major accidents.|$|R

It generates electricity to extend the range from 80 to 100 mi to 240 to 300 km Performance in range-extending mode may be more limited than when it is running on battery power, as BMW designed the range extender as a backup to enable reaching a recharging location.|$|R

50|$|Balance is {{facilitated}} by larger volumes of water which dilute {{the effects of}} a systemic shock. For example, the death of the only fish in a 10 <b>L</b> <b>tank</b> causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 400 <b>L</b> <b>tank</b> that holds many fish may create only a minor imbalance. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks whenever possible, as they require less intensive attention. This same concept extends to the filtration system as well, external (outside of the tank) systems in particular. Generally speaking, the larger the filtration system depending on its configuration, the more capable it will be of properly maintaining an aquatic environment. External filtration systems provide the added benefit of increasing the overall volume of water and its dilution effect. For example, a 190 L aquarium with an external filter that holds 40 L creates a 230 L aquatic system, and increase of over twenty percent.|$|R
