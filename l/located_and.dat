5|$|After {{graduating from}} Adams Township High School, Verville took a {{correspondence}} course in electrical engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan {{at the age}} of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hudson Motor Car Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, the editor and owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was <b>located,</b> <b>and</b> told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E
5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is <b>located,</b> <b>and</b> was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was {{a relic of the}} merger of two railway schemes. The station building is close to the Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they <b>located</b> <b>and</b> confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, {{the entire}} High Seas Fleet, {{including}} Bayern and Baden, left harbor {{with the intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been <b>located,</b> <b>and</b> so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants.

However, since then more plants have been <b>located,</b> <b>and</b> populations {{have been found to}} be gradually increasing in response to a number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.|$|E
5|$|Data {{for most}} of the storms were {{provided}} through the World Wide Consolidated Tropical Cyclone data file known as TD-9636. The document utilized several sources to indicate where storms were <b>located,</b> <b>and</b> as a result there were duplications. During the season, the Philippine Weather Bureau issued monthly bulletins, which later provided info for tropical cyclone tracks. The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago. The weather data ceased in August 1940, which were later rebuilt in 1945. Also in 1940, meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong, which were later restored in 1947, due to World War II.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{matching}} mitochondrial DNA, geneticist Turi King continued {{to pursue a}} link between the paternally-inherited Y-DNA and that of descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been <b>located,</b> <b>and</b> their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false paternity are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, boosted by Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs.

At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been <b>located</b> <b>and</b> nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E
