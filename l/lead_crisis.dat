40|$|Masteroppgave helse- og sosialinformatikk- Universitetet i Agder, 2015 Background and {{research}} question: Today {{there is an}} increasing openness regarding suicide in the Norwegian public, and Norwegian politicians, health care authorities and health service have focused on suicide prevention. The national patient safety programme I trygge hender 24 - 7 has chosen crisis card {{as one of the}} measures to decrease the prevalence of suicide in mental health care. In cooperation with the national patient safety programme the regional hospital Sørlandet sykehus have developed a mobile application that functions as an electronic crisis card: MINPLAN. The app is available for the operating systems iOS and Android. The object {{of this study is to}} explore how the app may be implemented in mental health care and the research question is: How can the app MINPLAN be implemented as a supplement to the treatment of suicidal patients in mental health care? Method: The study has a qualitative design and data collection has been achieved through semi-structured interviews. The study population is seven health care professionals from the Division of Mental Health in Sørlandet sykehus. Results: Crisis cards are perceived as useful in the follow-up of suicidal patients. The app MINPLAN is perceived as useful and easy to use, and it may <b>lead</b> <b>crisis</b> cards to become more available to patients. The informants reported that they had received little training, and there is a low degree of integration between the app and the work system. Conclusion: MINPLAN is useful and may contribute to an increase in the use of crisis cards, but there is a need for more research into the effectiveness of crisis cards. The implementation is so far insufficient, but better and more tailored training and available super users in every unit may increase use of the app...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out what characterizes {{successful}} and unsuccessful crisis communication. This study focuses on five characteristics derived from crisis management and crisis communication literature: context, responsibility, actors, crisis communication strategy, and ethical apologia. The study was motivated by the lack of multi-case studies in the field of crisis communication research. In addition, this study wanted to emphasise the complex nature of crises. This study utilized three different crisis communication theories with different approaches: Frandsen and Johansen's (2009) Rhetorical arena, Coombs' (2007) Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) and Hearit's (2006) Crisis Management by Apology. In addition, the context was established by exploring the subjects of crisis, risk, and issue. From these theories a research framework was merged and was applied as themes in the analyses of the cases. In order to compare successful and unsuccessful crisis communication, three cases of both types were chosen from a study where communication professionals had mentioned examples of successful and unsuccessful crisis communication cases. This study utilized mixed-methods and case study as research strategies. Case information was collected from secondary, public sources, mainly from newspapers. To analyse the collected data, qualitative and quantitative content analysis was used. As main findings for this study, five characteristics were identified that <b>lead</b> <b>crisis</b> communication to fail more likely than succeed. 1) A risk taken by the company has initiated the crisis. 2) The responsibility assigned to the company is high. 3) The chosen crisis communication strategy does not match the perceived responsibility level. 4) The crisis is complex with many actors. 5) The manner of communication in apologia is lacking. The findings suggest that the crisis communication manager should first analyse the crisis' context, company's perceived responsibility level and the actors in the crisis' rhetorical arena. Based on the analysis, the crisis communication manager should choose the correct crisis communication strategy or strategies and formulate an effective apologia focusing on the manner of communication...|$|E

As the organization experiences expansion through directive leadership, a more structured and functional management system is adopted. However, this <b>leads</b> to a <b>crisis</b> of autonomy.

50|$|Expansion through {{delegation}} (evolutionary phase) <b>leads</b> to a <b>crisis</b> {{of control}} (revolutionary phase). As the organization expands from delegating more responsibilities to lower level managers, top tier directors start to lessen {{their involvement in}} the routine operations, reducing the communication between both levels. This eventually <b>leads</b> to a <b>crisis</b> of control, as lower level managers become accustomed to working without the intrusion of top-level directors. This leads to {{a conflict of interest}} with the directors, who feel that they are losing control of the expanded organization.|$|R

We use three different techniquesânamely, the signaling approach, structural model, and Markov switching model with monthly {{data for the}} period 1992 - 2004. The results show that money market pressure index, real-sector confidence index, and public-sector variables are significant in explaining currency crises. Hence, one can say that banking <b>crises</b> <b>lead</b> to currency <b>crises.</b> Central banks' real-sector confidence index {{may be a good}} leading indicator for currency crises. currency crises, exchange rate pressure index, Markov switching model, money market pressure index, signal approach, structural model,...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} foreign direct {{investment}} on the domestic economy has been widely debated in literature, but a consensus opinion has not emerged. Critics have attributed the Asian banking crisis {{to the growth of}} {{foreign direct investment}} following the liberalization of foreign investment restrictions. Generally, the argument runs that foreign investors create a destabilizing influence on stock prices. Stiglitz (1998) posits that unregulated capital flows render developing economies more vulnerable to fluctuations in supply of international capital. According to Dornbusch and Park (1995), foreign investors tend to follow positive feedback strategies which cause markets to overreact to fundamental changes in value. Radelet and Sachs (1998) attribute the Asian financial crisis to financial panic. Hamann (1999) concludes that currency <b>crises</b> <b>lead</b> to financial <b>crises...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper modifies {{an ad hoc}} index {{originated}} by Eichengreen et al (1995, 1996), {{which is}} often used to document financial crises in emerging markets. By assuming nonlinear dynamics in a system of financial data, we successfully develop an alternative approach that not only captures the essence of the conventional index but also offers an indicator that <b>leads</b> the <b>crises</b> in-sample. This is very important for policy markers of transitional economies like Macedonia, for which the historical macroeconomic data are often inadequate for existing "early warning sign" systems of potential crises. ...|$|R
