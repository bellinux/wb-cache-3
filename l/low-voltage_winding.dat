40|$|Abstract – This paper {{measures}} the hot spot temperatures in a single-phase, 154 kV, 15 / 20 MVA power transformer filled with natural ester fluid using optical fiber sensors and compares them with those calculated by conventional heat run tests. A total of 14 optical fiber sensors were {{installed on the}} high-voltage and low-voltage windings to measure the hot spot temperatures. In addition, three thermocouples were installed in the transformer to measure the temperature distribution during the heat run tests. In the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>winding,</b> the hot spot temperature was 108. 4 °C, calculated by the conventional heat run test. However, the hot spot temperature measured using the optical fiber sensor was 129. 4 °C between turns 2 and 3 on the upper side of the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>winding.</b> Therefore, the hot spot temperature of the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>winding</b> measured using the optical fiber sensor was 21. 0 °C higher than that calculated by the conventional heat run test...|$|E

In order {{to solve the problem}} concerning limitation of ferro-resonance and cumulative over-voltages it has been proposed to use a nonlinear resistance which is brought from the side of  <b>low-voltage</b> <b>winding</b> of the voltage transformer.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>low-voltage</b> microgrids, <b>wind</b> farms and {{photovoltaic}} power stations, the management of medium-voltage distribution grids must face new challenges, since uncoordinated operation of the various power sources may cause excess power flows, under- and over-voltages, unwanted tripping of protections, and unexpected distribution losses. This paper proposes a general and scalable approach to the integrated control of distributed power sources in meshed distribution grids. The main goal is to minimize the power losses and the voltage deviations at grid nodes, {{by taking advantage of}} all the controllable entities...|$|R
50|$|If {{only one}} tap changer is required, {{manually}} operated tap points are usually {{made on the}} high voltage (primary) or lower current winding of the transformer to minimize the current handling requirements of the contacts. However, a transformer may include a tap changer on each winding if there are advantages to do so. For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an off-load tap changer on the primary winding and an on load automatic tap changer on the secondary winding or windings. The high voltage tap is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed. The low voltage tap may be requested to change positions multiple times each day, without interrupting the power delivery, to follow loading conditions on the <b>low-voltage</b> (secondary <b>winding)</b> network.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} elements of “intellectual networks” (Smart Grid) are the systems of monitoring the parameters of electrical equipment. Information-measuring systems (IMS), which described in this paper, were proposed to use together with rapid digital protection against short-circuit regimes in transformer windings. This paper presents an application’s experience of LVI-testing, some results {{of the use of}} Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) to check the condition of transformer windings and infra-red control results of electrical equipment. The LVI method and short-circuit inductive reactance measurements are sensitive for detecting such faults as radial, axial winding deformations, a twisting of <b>low-voltage</b> or regulating <b>winding,</b> a losing of winding’s pressing and others...|$|R
40|$|This paper calculates {{the core}} and copper losses as heating sources of a 24 MVA cast resin transformer, and {{analyzes}} the thermal distribution of the transformer to find out its hot-spot area by FEM program. Since the winding of the transformer is composed with many series and parallel circuits, the analyzing model of the winding is simplified and modelled by axi-symmetric domain. As the results, the maximum temperature is estimated by 137 ℃ in {{the upper part of}} the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>winding.</b> The maximum temperature has discrepancy of approximately 10 ℃, which is able to be considered as an acceptable error range in the design stage of power transformers. For the overall pattern of the temperature distribution is almost same as test results, the analyzing method can be...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This paper {{describes}} an inverter design which provides voltage regulation against variations {{in both the}} input voltage and load impedance. This design modifies the so-called parallel inverter, which consists of two silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) operating in a push-pull arrangement, to include a third regulating SCR. This regulating SCR is controlled by a small self-saturating magnetic amplifier which is driven by a <b>low-voltage</b> <b>winding</b> of the inverter output transformer. The regulating SCR reduces the conduction angle {{of each of the}} parallel-connected SCRs to something less than the normal 180 ° conduction angle {{in order to maintain the}} output voltage constant. The regulating circuitry also reduces the harmonic distortion of the output waveform. Mathematical equations are given which relate the harmonic content of the output waveform to the conduction angle. Circuitry is incorporated into the design to feed back reactive energy associated with the commutating elements to the dc source. This circuitry results in a considerable increase in efficiency, particularly under light load conditions. Waveforms of the various circuit voltages and currents are plotted on the same time base to clarify the regulating mode. Curves are plotted of the output voltage, efficiency and percent harmonic distortion as a function of the load and the input voltage...|$|E
40|$|A mode {{switching}} {{doubly fed}} induction generator (MSDFIG) scheme is {{proposed for the}} purpose of achieving <b>low-voltage</b> ride-through for <b>wind</b> turbines. The MSDFIG operates as a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) under normal condition but upon the detection of a low-voltage incident, the generator is to smoothly transfer to operate under the induction generator mode through the switching in of a set of stator-side crowbar. The MSDFIG automatically reverts back to the DFIG mode when network voltage recovers. A new strategy on the control of the crowbar resistance is included. Analysis shows that the proposed MSDFIG scheme can ride through the complete low-voltage and voltage recovery stages. Effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated through simulation and experiment studies. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} very fast-transient overvoltages that occur because of the capacitive surge transfer from the high-voltage (HV) transformer <b>winding</b> to the <b>low-voltage</b> (LV) transformer <b>winding.</b> The study is done on a 6. 6 kV single-phase test transformer. By applying a pulse with a short rise time at the HV terminal, the voltage at the LV side is measured and calculated. The voltage distribution along the LV winding is calculated by applying the transmission line theory, so that the foils of the LV winding are represented as transmission lines. For the studied transformer with a nominal transformer ratio of 95. 6, a maximum voltage ratio of 3. 3 was measured during the rate of rise of the applied impulse. The present paper also shows that in some specific cases, the mutual inductance between the primary and the secondary side can be ignored during determination of the transients along the secondary winding. The computation and measurement of the voltage at the LV side is validated by making use of the vector fitting method...|$|R
