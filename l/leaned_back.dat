We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E

They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> into our mythology." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{two different}} body {{positions at the}} finish of a stroke during stationary rowing exercise on physiological and kinematic measurements. Nine male and five female rowers volunteered for the study: mean age (± SD), body height and body mass were 27 ± 9 yrs, 180. 5 ± 12. 3 cm and 81. 2 ± 14. 2 kg. The two body positions at the finish were controlled at an upright posture or a novel greater <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> position. All subjects completed 3 different experimental trials on a Concept IID rowing machine at 3 different exercise intensities and comparisons were made between the <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> position at the same stroke rate and the same power output as the upright trial. Power output, heart rate, oxygen uptake, energy expenditure and % efficiency were higher (p< 0. 05) with the greater <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> position at the same stroke rate compared to all other conditions. Range of motion at the hip, ankle, and elbow and the handle velocity and distance moved were greater (p< 0. 05) with the <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> position. In conclusion, a greater <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> posture at the finish during stationary rowing produces a higher power output and improved efficiency at the same stroke rate but at an elevated physiological cost compared to a more upright position. Despite the higher energy expenditure, the relative gain in power output and efficiency with no negative kinematic changes suggests that a greater <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> position at the finish will enhance performance during stationary rowing exercise. Key words: oxygen uptake, efficiency, power output, joint angle, range of motion, rowing...|$|R

2500|$|Aqua Skoot: Invented by Ken Bailey in {{the early}} 1980s, riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled {{up to the top}} of the ride, go down a slide {{consisting}} of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, <b>leaned</b> <b>back.</b> If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. [...] At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was 30' long. [...] The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998, the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. [...] The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.|$|E
