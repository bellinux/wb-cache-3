25|$|Fingerprinting was {{the basis}} upon which the first {{forensic}} professional organization was formed, the International Association for Identification (IAI), in 1915. The first professional certification program for forensic scientists was established in 1977, the IAI's Certified <b>Latent</b> <b>Print</b> Examiner program, which issued certificates to those meeting stringent criteria and {{had the power to}} revoke certification where an individual's performance warranted it. Other forensic disciplines have followed suit and established their own certification programs.|$|E

Fingerprints that have previously been examined and assessed by <b>latent</b> <b>print</b> experts to make a positive identification of suspects have then been re-presented to those same experts in a new context which makes it likely {{that there will be}} no match. Within this new context, most of the fingerprint experts made different judgments, thus contradicting their own previous identification decisions.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} paper is to evaluate the techniques used to collect <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> from documents in Addis Ababa Police Commission and give some recommendations on {{how to cope with}} the problem. The researcher started off by looking at the general orientation of the research and how the research has been done. Then in the next chapter, the meaning and objective of Forensic Investigation, right or mandate to investigate, the meaning of physical evidence and the prints and techniques used internationally to collect <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> are discussed. In the third chapter, the best method of collecting <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> from documents and the method and practice of collecting <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> from documents at Addis Ababa Police Commission Forensic Evidence Collection Department were discussed. Finally, the finding of the research and some critical recommendations were given. <b>Latent</b> <b>prints</b> from documents are very crucial to identifying the suspects and for legal proceedings or the court process. Even if it is known by the police officers, the techniques and the materials they are using to collect <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> are with powders which are less effective. According to the research, the Ninhydrin chemical is the best technique recommended to collect <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> from documents This research paper gives a truly unique perspective on how <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> should be collected from documents...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the word}} latent means hidden or invisible, in modern usage for {{forensic}} science the term latent prints means any chance or accidental impression left by friction ridge skin on a surface, {{regardless of whether}} it is visible or invisible at the time of deposition. Electronic, chemical and physical processing techniques permit visualization of invisible <b>latent</b> <b>print</b> residues whether they are from natural sweat on the skin or from a contaminant such as motor oil, blood, ink, paint or some other form of dirt. The different types of fingerprint patterns, such as arch, loop and whorl, will be described below.|$|E
25|$|When {{friction}} ridges {{come into}} contact with a surface that will take a print, material that is on the friction ridges such as perspiration, oil, grease, ink or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. Pliability of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface and the substance deposited {{are just some of the}} various factors which can cause a <b>latent</b> <b>print</b> to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. The scientific study of fingerprints is called dermatoglyphics.|$|E

Staff found Laude's naked body, partially covered from the waist down, with her neck blackened with strangulation marks and her head in a toilet bowl. Condoms recovered from the bathroom were subjected to DNA testing to determine if the semen it contained matched that of Pemberton. American forensic experts Jessica LeCroy and Derk Dorrien, <b>latent</b> <b>print</b> examiners from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory, revealed that one of the three condoms and a condom wrapper recovered from the motel room had the fingerprints of Pemberton.

2500|$|Brandon Mayfield is an Oregon {{lawyer who}} was {{identified}} as a participant in the 2004 Madrid train bombings based on a fingerprint match by the FBI. The FBI <b>Latent</b> <b>Print</b> Unit processed a fingerprint collected in Madrid and reported a [...] "100 percent positive" [...] match against one of the 20 fingerprint candidates returned in a search response from their Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System. The FBI initially called it an [...] "absolutely incontrovertible match". Subsequently, however, Spanish National Police examiners suggested that the print did not match Mayfield and after two weeks, identified another man whom they claimed the fingerprint did belong to. The FBI acknowledged their error, and a judge released Mayfield, who had spent two weeks in police custody, in May 2004. In January 2006, a U.S. Justice Department report was released which criticized the FBI for sloppy work but exonerated them of some more serious allegations. The report found that the misidentification had been due to a misapplication of methodology by the examiners involved: Mayfield is an American-born convert to Islam and his wife is an Egyptian immigrant, but these are not factors that should have affected fingerprint search technology.|$|E

2500|$|The Degnan {{ransom note}} was first {{examined}} by the Chicago Crime Detection Laboratory, but they couldn't find any usable prints on the note. Captain Timothy O'Connor took the note to the FBI crime laboratory in Washington, D.C. on January 18, 1946 {{with the idea of}} enlisting the FBI's more sophisticated technology in finding any <b>latent</b> <b>prints.</b> The FBI subjected the note to the then advanced method of iodine fuming to raise <b>latent</b> <b>prints.</b> The process was similar in execution to today's polycyanoacrylate [...] "super glue" [...] fuming in which Cyanoacrylate is heated to a vapor. This vapor sticks to the skin oils on the friction ridges of a latent fingerprint. The older Ninhydrin method which is a liquid that is sprayed on paper to detect <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> on paper is similar. The FBI were able to raise two prints which they photographed promptly because, unlike modern polycyanoacrylate, fuming prints revealed by the iodine process fade quickly.

40|$|A Thesis Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirement}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyReproducibility of third level fingerprint detail is important in personal identification. The effect of different substrates on the reproducibility of pore dimensions in inked reference fingerprints was investigated. Photomicrographs of reference prints were taken and pore area was measured repeatedly using appropriate software. Reproducibility of pore area was also studied in <b>latent</b> <b>prints.</b> <b>Latent</b> <b>prints</b> were deposited on chosen absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces and developed using Cyanoacrylate and Ninhydrin to determine pore area reproducibility. Photomicrographs of ridged skin were captured directly by focusing under microscope and pore area reproducibility in these images was studied. Live scans were {{also included in the}} study to see if pore area can be relied upon in live scans at 500 ppi (pixels per inch). Results revealing best third level detail in inked prints were achieved by deposition onto a variety of non-absorbent substrates but inter-print variation indicated that pore area in inked prints deposited onto paper substrates cannot be used reliably in personal identification. In case of <b>latent</b> <b>prints,</b> variation was greater than normal acceptable limits suggesting that pore area is not reproducible in <b>latent</b> <b>prints</b> developed using Cyanoacrylate and Ninhydrin techniques. Results of direct microscopic images also showed too great inter-image variation which has further supported the unreliability of pore area as a tool in personal identification. Live scans at 500 ppi did not prove to be useful in providing good pore detail for study. This study casts doubt on the use of pore area as a reliable identification tool in personal identification and suggests raising the scanning resolution to study pore detail in live scans...|$|R
