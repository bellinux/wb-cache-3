500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She {{wanted to make a}} video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

The Pi 2 oscillation looks <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> superposed <b>on</b> the slow field variations.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} the structures, stabilities and {{electronic}} properties of Si n Li (n= 1 - 10) clusters were {{carried out by the}} density functional theory (DFT). The results show that lithium atom prefers to stay at the surface of cluster and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adsorbed <b>on</b> the bridge site. The binding energies indicate that the stabilities of Si n Li clusters can be enhanced by adsorption of lithium atom. Additionally, lithium atom binding energies show that the interaction between lithium atom and silicon cluster increases as decreasing the cluster size, which is an important factor for the amorphization process upon lithiation of the silicon based anode materials for Li-ion batteries. The ionization potential, electron affinity potential, chemical potential and energy gap of the Si n Li clusters all indicate that Si 4 Li and Si 7 Li <b>are</b> easier <b>to</b> lose α electron to form cationic clusters...|$|R
