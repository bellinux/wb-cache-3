25|$|Interscope gave us, <b>like,</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> bucks last year, and {{we built}} a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. In a retrospective {{review of the}} second season, Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Our Town" [...] a C+, describing it as [...] "scary — but mostly because of what transpires in a chicken processing plant." [...] Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B–, criticizing the clichéd opening sequence—"Haven't we seen this before? <b>Like,</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> times, in dozens of horror movies, and even on this very series"—the bland characters and lack of humor. However, he did compliment {{the fact that the}} plot explained enough of the villain's motives and that the episode had [...] "some sense of a community behind everything". Furthermore, he wrote that the resolution worked well despite again resorting to Scully in danger.|$|E
500|$|Within {{four days}} prior to the release, Yeezus was leaked online. The New York Times wrote that the leak [...] "stirred up a Twitter frenzy" [...] and {{received}} widespread media coverage. The Washington Post commented on {{the significance of the}} leak: [...] "Kanye West’s new album didn’t leak online over the weekend. It gushed out into the pop ecosystem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> barrels of renegade crude — ominous, mesmerizing and of great consequence." [...] Critics were very kind to Yeezus regarding critical reviews, but others viewed the release as [...] "musical and commercial suicide," [...] and [...] "fans live-blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook." [...] The New Yorker Sasha Frere-Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the [...] "lean vibrancy" [...] of the album. [...] "One of the most fascinating aspects of Yeezus arrival is the discursive crisis it's caused, produced by a fast-react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding," [...] wrote The Atlantic columnist Jack Hamilton.|$|E

500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> other songs written {{around the}} D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies... {{it amazes me}} that people still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E
500|$|The {{reworked}} 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times disliked it: [...] "This latest King and I {{might look}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> dollars {{as a regional}} production; on Broadway... it's a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, somewhere along the line, {{there has been a}} serious failure of the theatrical imagination." [...] But Liz Smith enthused: [...] "The King and I is perfect"; and the Houston Chronicle wrote, of the subsequent tour, [...] "The King and I is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey." [...] Critic Richard Christiansen in the Chicago Tribune observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the Auditorium Theatre: [...] "Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [...] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that's a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age." [...] When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the Financial Times called it [...] "a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals".|$|E

2500|$|On May 31, 2008, RCA {{released}} [...] "To Life" [...] as {{a single}} from the album After All These Years. It debuted at number 49 on the Hot Country Songs charts, Arnold's first entry in 25 years and the recording by the oldest person to chart in Billboard magazine. It set {{the record for the}} longest span between a first chart single and a last: 62 years and 11 months ("Each Minute Seems <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Million</b> Years" [...] debuted on June 30, 1945), and extended Arnold's career chart history to seven decades.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said [...] "Written by Alicia Keys and {{produced}} by Swizz Beatz (probably {{best known for}} Beyoncé's 'Check On It' and 'Ring the Alarm'), it's a midtempo disco track with an unabashedly feelgood message. [...] "If he makes you feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> dollar bill," [...] Whitney sings on the chorus, 'Say oh-oh-oh, say oh-oh-oh'. The Voice is deeper and raspier than you might remember, but she's still capable of going for a money note. 'Million Dollar Bill' won't be storming any barns in a hurry, but it's a classy, dignified and thoroughly likeable comeback effort. Whitney, it's {{good to have you}} back." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave a mixed review saying, [...] "The good news on [...] "Million Dollar Bill" [...] is the performance is undeniably the Whitney Houston we all know. [...] The down side is it's all almost too familiar. The arrangement courtesy producer Swizz Beatz is very old school R [...] Alicia Keys has written a song that fits very well with her tradition of [...] "old soul" [...] songs, but Whitney Houston has failed to give it a new twist that would successfully make the old stunningly new again.". He also gave the song 3.5 stars out of five.|$|E
2500|$|Left unimpressed, Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote, [...] "You {{really have}} to feel for Alex Proyas. This guy wears bad luck like the grimy trenchcoats of his protagonists, only his zipper's stuck and he can't seem to shake the damn thing off." [...] In expressing his negativity, he {{believed}} [...] "Dark City looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> bucks (or rather, a million bucks gone to compost), but at its dark heart it's a tedious, bewildering affair, lovely to look at {{but with all the}} substance of a dissipating dream." [...] Left equally disappointed was John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times. Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, you might say that Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising. Dark City is constructed like panels in a Batman book, each picture striving for maximum dread." [...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E
