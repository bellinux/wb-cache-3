A review in 2012 found that a diet high in potassium lowers blood pressure in those with high blood pressure and may improve outcomes in those with normal kidney function, while a 2006 review found evidence to be inconsistent; additionally, the review found no significant reduction in blood pressure overall for people with high blood pressure who were given oral potassium supplementation. Meta-analyses conducted by the Cochrane Hypertension group have found no evidence of an appreciable blood pressure reduction from any combination of calcium, magnesium or potassium supplements; this information stands contrary to prior systematic reviews suggesting that a dietary intake adjustment for each of these may benefit adults with high blood pressure.

CIC (0. 25 [*]mg[*]min− 1 [*]kg− 1 [*]BW) of ANF (0. 5 [*]μg[*]min− 1 [*]BW) alone, given in pharmacological doses, increased Cin significantly in normal sodium rats, whereas the effect of each agent was blunted in <b>low</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>diet</b> rats.

While most complications are dramatically reduced {{it is not}} certain whether the incidence of myocardiai infarction is decreased by treatment or whether {{the severity of the}} infarct is reduced. The prognosis in patients with borderline and mild hypertension varies widely depending on the number of other risk factors present. Patients with mild hypertension and low risk profiles may not obtain enough benefit from treatment to justify the side effects, inconvenience, and expense of such therapy. Such pa-tients should be individually evaluated as to the need and desirability of treatment. Patients who are not treated with drugs should be seen for an annual follow-up to detect progression. <b>Low</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>diets</b> are effective but they are not practical because it is difflcuit to adhere to the required degree of <b>sodium</b> restriction.
