40|$|This article {{responds}} to Dr Klaus Robin's {{article in the}} previous volume. The Trust considers that it need not {{take part in the}} Studbook as animals are solely bred for reintroduction, its own pedigree information is kept, only <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> are bred, and animals are never exchanged or sent to other zoos or collections...|$|R
5000|$|The Olo River {{is rich in}} {{trout and}} is {{populated}} by the Eurasian otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra).</b>|$|R
50|$|Moreover, in the Park {{there are}} 34 species of mammals, {{including}} otters (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> and beavers (Castor fibre).|$|R
50|$|These animals {{probably}} {{were very similar}} and had similar habits to the common European otters (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> and oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea).|$|R
5|$|Mammalian {{species of}} {{interest}} include the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), Eurasian harvest mouse (Micromys minutus), European otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> and water vole (Arvicola terrestris).|$|R
50|$|This {{predominantly}} ash and oak woodland {{is home to}} butterflies {{like the}} rare chequered skipper (Carterocephalus palaemon), {{as well as being}} frequented by otters (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra).</b>|$|R
50|$|There are twenty-five {{species of}} small mammals known to inhabit the reserve, {{including}} the European otter, (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> {{which is on}} the European IUCN Red List.|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of skulls of the Common Otter from western France was studied and compared with skulls {{of the same}} species from Denmark and the Netherlands. No significant differences were found. Age and sex composition of the three collections are given. <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> angustifrons Lataste, 1885, was based on comparison of the skull of a fullgrown Otter from Algeria with the skull of a juvenile Otter from France. Most probably this subspecies (syn. <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> splendida Cabrera, 1906) does not differ from the nominate subspecies...|$|R
2500|$|European otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> a {{carnivore}} well {{adapted to}} {{waters of the}} park, but in decline throughout Europe, it inhabits the watercourses and uses the banks for shelter; ...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} of EU Importance: 13 habitats, including the estuary, spartina swards, salt meadows and embryo dunes. Stripe-necked Terrapin Mauremys leprosa, Otter <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> and Algarvian Toadflax Linaria algarviana ...|$|R
40|$|La llúdria (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> és el major carnívor valencià. Malgrat que la seua distribució disminuí gradualmentdurant la darrera meitat del segle vint i estaven en perill d'extinció, les citacions de llúdria hanaugmentat de manera significativa durant les darreres dècades. Presentem la primera cita de Lutralutra a la desembocadura del riu Millars (E de la península Ibèrica), a pocs metres de la mar Mediterrània. El mustèlid s'identificà per les petjades i els excrements. First {{record of}} the eurasian otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> L.) {{in the mouth of}} the Millars River(eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula) The eurasian otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> is the valencian biggest carnivore. Although its {{distribution}} decreasedgradually throughout {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century and it was on the verge of extinction,otter's citations have significantly increased over recent decades. Here we report the first record ofLutra <b>lutra</b> in the mouth of the Millars River (E of the Iberian Peninsula), just meters away from theMediterranean Sea. The mustelid was identified by its footprints and spraints...|$|R
50|$|The {{inland waters}} would have {{contained}} mammal {{species such as}} Castor fiber (beaver), <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> (otter) and species of fish such as Esox lucius (northern pike) and Siluris glanis (catfish).|$|R
50|$|When Ublaz Mad-Eyes {{sets out}} {{on a mission to}} steal Tears of All Oceans, a set of six spherical rose-pink pearls, from the <b>Lutra</b> otter clan (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> being the Latin name for otters), Grath Longfletch must stand up to the evil pine marten while the Redwallers search for the missing treasures.|$|R
50|$|Mammals are {{represented}} by North African boars (Sus scrofa algira), porcupines (Hystrix cristata), otters (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> Small-spotted genets (Genetta genetta), hares (Lepus capensis), Algerian wolves (Canis anthus algirensis), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes).|$|R
50|$|The only {{native species}} to the Cristina Island marshes is the otter (<b>lutra</b> <b>lutra).</b> Although other rat species (Ondatra zibethicus or muskrat) and mice can be present, they don't exactly belong to this ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian beaver, {{which is}} {{reclaiming}} streams in Touraine after its reintroduction in the Loire about thirty years ago, and the European otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> are {{present on the}} Indre, in Chambourg-sur-Indre, for the 2014-2015 season.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{and rare}} animals include the brown bear (Ursus arctos), golden eagle, common kestrel {{and the black}} stork. Quite common are red deer and wild boars, wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and the otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rare Charophyte, Chara denundata, {{has been}} {{recorded}} in the area, while the Red List [...] species otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> and Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus) have also been observed within the lake district of North Westmeath.|$|R
50|$|The Towy has a {{thriving}} population of otters (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> {{as well as}} many commoner mammal species. Grey seals are common in the lower reaches and sometimes penetrate several miles upriver in pursuit of sea trout and salmon.|$|R
50|$|In the Old World, two otter {{species have}} been {{primarily}} used in otter fishing - the European otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> chiefly in Europe and North Africa, and the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), mostly in South Asia and China.|$|R
50|$|Mammals, such as {{the grey}} seal, common seal, harbour {{porpoise}} (Phocoena phocoena), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> have been reported from the Copeland Islands.|$|R
50|$|Several genetic {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the Japanese river otter should be treated as a distinct species <b>Lutra</b> nippon rather than a subspecies of <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra.</b> However, this reclassification is not yet generally accepted in the absence of further verification.|$|R
50|$|The Natura 2000 report {{mentioned}} fishes {{as there}} are the spined loach (Cobitis taenia), the European weather loach (Misgurnus fossilis) and the European bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus amarus). Observed mammals are the European beaver (Castor fiber) and the European otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra).</b>|$|R
50|$|The fauna is varied: {{roe deer}} (Capreolus capreolus), wolf (Canis lupus), {{partridge}} (Perdix perdix), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> and trout {{are some of}} the numerous species found in the park which are protected by law since 1978.|$|R

50|$|Faunal species include white-rumped vulture, {{leopard cat}} (Prionailurus bengalensis), Eurasian otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>Lutra),</b> and endemic Variegated {{mountain}} lizard (Japalura variegata). Invasion of gold fish (Carassius auratus) has adversely affected the indigenous fauna.There are also 300 {{species of birds}} recorded in the wetland.|$|R

50|$|The {{range of}} plants and {{invertebrates}} support many bird species including golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria), lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and dunlin (Calidris alpina). Other vertebrate species present, include the otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> grass snake (Natrix natrix) and common frog (Rana temporaria).|$|R
50|$|A manga adaptation, titled Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai and {{illustrated}} by Akane Sasaki, began serialization in the May 2012 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. The manga ended serialization in the magazine's May 2014 issue and continued serialization in Dengeki G's Comic between the June 2014 and January 2015 issues. The first volume of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was released on November 27, 2012; two volumes have been released as of July 27, 2013. A second manga, titled Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai: The Little <b>Lutra</b> <b>Lutra</b> {{and illustrated}} by Shiroi Kusaka, was serialized between the July 2012 and June 2013 issues of Kadokawa Shoten's Comptiq. Two volumes of The Little <b>Lutra</b> <b>Lutra</b> were released between December 26, 2012 and June 6, 2013.|$|R
40|$|Seven {{species of}} Mustelidae {{are to be}} found in the south Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) : <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra,</b> Martes martes, Martes foina, Meles meles, Mustela vison, Mustela nivalis and Vormela peregusna. The rarest of these species are the Eurasian otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> and the marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna). The Eurasian otter, one of most {{endangered}} species of the south caucasian fauna, is still suffering under the influence of poaching, habitat loss, disturbance and pollution. No fundamental research has been undertaken on otters in any of the south Caucasian countries and, therefore, data provided in the literature are scarce. Further, no DNA analysis has been undertaken in this part of the world and, therefore, the actual number of subspecies is not clear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This report covers captive {{animal studies}} during period, {{studies in the}} wild {{including}} one on avoidance of otter road traffic casualties commisioned by the Ministry of Traffic, which {{will be used to}} inform new highway building, two surveys and a pollution assay in 6 states showing poor otter numbers correlate with higher PCB levels. A habitat management programme, Otter 2000, establishing migration corridors for otters was initiated. There has been good progress with the revitalisation of the River Ise. The Otter-Zentrum itself has had a very good year, with high visitor numbers and many new births. RESEARCH IN CAPTIVITY At the research station in Hankensbüttel, the following main studies were completed, continued or started (Rogoschik 1992) : • a morphological study of the organs of <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> (Zogall 1992); • an ethological study on the marking behaviour of <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra</b> (Heins 1992); • an ethological study on the prey catching behaviour of <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra,</b> which will run until 1995; • a long-term study on the ontogeny of otter cubs born in captivity, which includes 8 litters; • a study on PCB levels in spraints of otters in captivity was started in 1992 (Reuther 1992 b) and will be continued in 1993...|$|R
50|$|The Sincheon is habitat {{to a large}} {{population}} of birds, including mallard ducks as well as gray herons and little egrets. In addition, it is habitat for the Eurasian river otter, <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra.</b> The herons, egrets and otters all feed on the abundant population of fish.|$|R
50|$|Goričko {{is still}} {{successfully}} resisting the changes {{brought about by}} the human civilization. An evidence of this is the best preserved population of otters (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra)</b> in Slovenia. With extensive water networks as well as standing bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds and marshes, its favorable living conditions are increasing.|$|R
50|$|Species {{that are}} {{endangered}} in other European countries but common in Latvia include: black stork (Ciconia nigra), corncrake (Crex crex), {{lesser spotted eagle}} (Aquila pomarina), white-backed woodpecker (Picoides leucotos), Eurasian crane (Grus grus), Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), Eurasian otter (<b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra),</b> European wolf (Canis lupus) and European lynx (Felis lynx).|$|R
5000|$|The Seomjin {{watershed}} comprises some 4,896.5 km². [...] This area {{includes both}} farmland {{and a great}} deal of pristine mountain country, including the Jirisan area. A wide variety of animals are found along the river, including the European otter, <b>Lutra</b> <b>lutra.</b> Principal tributaries include the Boseong River and Yocheon stream.|$|R
