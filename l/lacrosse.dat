5|$|Box <b>lacrosse,</b> {{also known}} as indoor <b>lacrosse</b> and {{sometimes}} shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of <b>lacrosse</b> played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field <b>lacrosse</b> game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field <b>lacrosse.</b> The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a <b>lacrosse</b> stick, to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber <b>lacrosse</b> ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E
5|$|Briefly in 1939, a {{professional}} box <b>lacrosse</b> league started up in California, called the Pacific Coast <b>Lacrosse</b> Association.

5|$|Even as box <b>lacrosse</b> {{grows in}} the United States, the American goalkeeper is a rarity. The skills {{required}} {{to be a successful}} field <b>lacrosse</b> goaltender and a successful box <b>lacrosse</b> goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another.|$|E
5|$|Field <b>lacrosse</b> is a {{full contact}} outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team. The sport {{originated}} among Native Americans, and the modern rules of field <b>lacrosse</b> were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867. Field <b>lacrosse</b> {{is one of three}} major versions of <b>lacrosse</b> played internationally. The other versions, women's <b>lacrosse</b> (established in the 1890s) and box <b>lacrosse</b> (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Montreal <b>Lacrosse</b> Club member William George Beers codified {{the modern}} game.

5|$|<b>Lacrosse</b> {{is governed}} internationally by the 52-member Federation of International <b>Lacrosse,</b> which {{sponsors}} the World <b>Lacrosse</b> Championships once every four years. A former Olympic sport, {{attempts by the}} international governing body to reinstate it to the Games have been hampered by insufficient international participation and by the existence of separate governing bodies for the men's and women's versions of the sport until 2008. Field <b>lacrosse</b> is played professionally in North America by Major League <b>Lacrosse.</b> It is also played on a high amateur level by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States, the Australian Senior <b>Lacrosse</b> Championship series, and the Canadian University Field <b>Lacrosse</b> Association.|$|E

5|$|Box <b>lacrosse</b> is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor <b>lacrosse</b> are obscure, but its {{invention}} {{has been attributed to}} one Paddy Brennan, a field <b>lacrosse</b> player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Canada, Iroquois Nationals and the United States {{have won}} gold, silver, and bronze {{respectively}} {{in each of}} the World Indoor <b>Lacrosse</b> Championships held. Canada has yet to lose an international game in box <b>lacrosse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Field <b>lacrosse</b> {{involves}} two teams, each competing {{to shoot}} a <b>lacrosse</b> ball into the opposing team's goal. A <b>lacrosse</b> ball {{is made out of}} solid rubber, measuring 7.75 to 8inches (19.7–20cm) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5.25ounces (140–149g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and must carry a <b>lacrosse</b> stick (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.|$|E

5|$|Schmeisser helped {{organize}} and {{played on the}} Mount Washington <b>Lacrosse</b> Club, a highly successful Baltimore-based amateur team. Since there was no professional league, many former college <b>lacrosse</b> stars played for Mount Washington. The club regularly participated in exhibition games against the top intercollegiate programs and very rarely lost. In 1904, Schmeisser and Abercrombie co-authored Lacrosse: From Candidate to Team, a book which became the sport's standard text for the next fifty years. He also helped promote <b>lacrosse</b> at the University of Maryland and the Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|Schmeisser was {{a long-time}} {{official}} of the USILA, and he held positions that included member of the rules committee, chief referee, and president. US <b>Lacrosse,</b> the American sport's governing body, inducted him into the National <b>Lacrosse</b> Hall of Fame in 1957.

5|$|Similar to {{fighting}} in ice hockey, fighting is tolerated in professional box <b>lacrosse.</b> Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In CLA (Canadian <b>Lacrosse</b> Association) play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct. Fighting in youth or club level box <b>lacrosse</b> is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions. In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk <b>lacrosse</b> league, fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable. Violators were {{ejected from the}} game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension.|$|E
5|$|Striebel {{served as}} an {{assistant}} coach for Princeton Men's <b>Lacrosse</b> in 2005.

5|$|The first box <b>lacrosse</b> match {{conducted}} in Australia came about {{as part of}} a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne. The Victorian <b>Lacrosse</b> Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a <b>lacrosse</b> match {{as part of a}} multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931. After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior, it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match. Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia, with P J Lally of the famous Canadian <b>lacrosse</b> stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of {{the rules of the game}} from the VLA Secretary. By 1933, box <b>lacrosse</b> matches were being played in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of <b>lacrosse</b> in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebirth of}} {{professional}} box <b>lacrosse</b> in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with {{the formation of}} the Eagle Pro Box <b>Lacrosse</b> League, which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz. The league originated with four teams: the Philadelphia Wings, New Jersey Saints, Washington Wave, and Baltimore Thunder, and unlike box <b>lacrosse</b> generally, was played during the winter. The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor <b>Lacrosse</b> League (MILL) immediately after its second season, and in 1998 renamed itself again, this time to the NLL. In 1998, the NLL entered into the Canadian market {{for the first time with}} the Ontario Raiders. Although 5 of the league's 9 teams are based in American cities, more than two-thirds of the players are Canadian.|$|E
5|$|The schools {{currently}} meet only in <b>lacrosse,</b> as {{all other}} Johns Hopkins athletics fall under NCAA Division III and all Maryland athletics are Division I. From the late 19th into the 20th century, however, their football teams also competed regularly. More recently, {{the schools have}} played in women's <b>lacrosse.</b>|$|E
