I {{honestly}} don't {{remember much}} of what {{took place during the}} filming of that episode because it was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> peyote fever dream. I remember there was lots of howling, and I came away very sore and scarred. Parts of my anatomy were alarmingly chafed. They say it turned out well. I'm excited to see it." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)" [...] was {{released}} on December 15, 2010. A pregnant Carey, who only moves from the waist up, wears a black laced dress while {{standing in front of}} a green screen, which depict exploding fireworks in the nights sky. Becky Bain for Idolator positively reviewed the video, writing [...] "There is something so endlessly entertaining about watching Mariah Carey do her patented diva theatrics — waving her arms <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> hand model; tenderly stroking her hair; spinning around dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{character}} creator function allowed {{players to}} create {{different kinds of}} combinations in an avatar. The team ensured {{that there were many}} customization options, including allowing players to [...] "dress <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> person". The developers felt that this feature would suit the story, because the game's city enters a state of anarchy, where social norms no longer exist. The team wanted the character creator to feature diversity, so that players could build an avatar based on their own choices. They found the process of introducing diversity challenging. As a result, a system was developed that broke the character creator down into three different categories: mainstream, street (emo and goth), and costume. The team originally added role-playing games-styled stats to the game's costumes, but later decided to scrap that so that players [...] "would just choose what they thought looked cool." ...|$|E

50|$|The first Chase {{series was}} {{successful}} and expanded to two reels (20 minutes); this {{would become the}} standard length for Chase comedies, apart from a few three-reel featurettes later. Direction of the Chase series {{was taken over by}} Leo McCarey, who in collaboration with Chase formed the comic style of the series—an emphasis on characterization and farce instead of knockabout slapstick. Some of Chase's starring shorts of the 1920s, particularly Mighty <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Moose, <b>Crazy</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Fox, Fluttering Hearts, and Limousine Love, are often considered to be among the finest in silent comedy. Chase remained the guiding hand behind the films, assisting anonymously with the directing, writing, and editing.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sheffey’s contemporaries {{agreed that}} {{although}} “he {{was the most}} powerful man in prayer…he couldn’t preach a lick.” He would take a text and never return to it, and his preaching consisted largely of relating personal experiences. [...] Nevertheless, as the Methodist preacher George C. Rankin recalled in his memoirs, although Sheffey “acted more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> man than otherwise,” he “was wonderful in a meeting. [...] He would stir the people, crowd the mourner’s bench with crying penitents and have genuine conversions by the score.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Cho {{launched}} [...] "The Sensuous Woman," [...] a burlesque-style {{variety show}} tour, in Los Angeles on August 10, 2007, with tour dates scheduled through November 3, as of October 10. Scheduled tour stops meant to follow Los Angeles were Chicago, Illinois and New York City. On August 10, 2007 the San Francisco Chronicle reviewed the show, Cho's work, key events in {{her personal life}} and characterized the show thus: [...] "In fact, as bawdy and bad-behaving as the cast gets, the whole show feels more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> family reunion than a performance." ...|$|E
50|$|I'm {{just really}} {{inspired}} by R&B, hip-hop, and alternative music so I {{just wanted to}} combine {{all three of those}} for the sound. And the type of person I am, I just find darkness interesting in a way. I just love songs that sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little <b>crazy,</b> I think it creates an interesting juxtaposition between my voice because it is so bright, and soft, and like pretty, and sweet that I don't want my music to come across sweet or nice. I do like the opposite, so I think of something that's dark and heavy and then I put like sweet and light on top.|$|R

5000|$|Kris from Movie Trailer Reviews gave an A- rating to {{the episode}} {{saying that he}} enjoyed the episode and {{like the way the}} two main plots unfolded. [...] "I like see the {{evolution}} of Christie as well as learning more about what’s going on with Irisa. ...

I do know that {{for the amount of}} stuff we're putting in here, it is certainly not a bad deal. There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game. It doesn't seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March? We're not going away, and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, but sometimes they can't." ...|$|E

Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times considered the film to be an [...] "intensely wrought and immensely satisfying love story" [...] and credited all three performers for [...] "making their [...] yearning palpable". She then appeared in Jodie Foster's black comedy The Beaver alongside Foster and Mel Gibson.

500|$|Vibe magazine's Michael Gonzalez {{gave the}} album a {{favorable}} review, writing, [...] "Love Always is a marvelous musical testament to black {{love in the}} '90s." [...] He enjoyed the production, especially from Rory Bennett, and compared the duo to Frankie Lymon. He noticed K-Ci's lyrics in [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] were {{about his relationship with}} Mary J. Blige stating [...] " [...] wails <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man driven <b>crazy</b> by his missteps." [...] Gonzalez also liked the songs [...] "Don't Rush (Take Love Slowly)", and [...] "You Bring Me Up".

There's just so much dirty weather {{knocking}} {{about the}} world, and the proper thing is {{to go through it}} with none of what old Captain Wilson of the Melita calls 'storm strategy.' The other day ashore I heard him hold forth about it to a lot of shipmasters who came in and sat at a table next to mine. It seemed to me the greatest nonsense. He was telling them how he outmanoeuvred, I think he said, a terrific gale, so that it never came nearer than fifty miles to him. A neat piece of head-work he called it. How he knew there was a terrific gale fifty miles off beats me altogether. It was <b>like</b> listening to <b>a</b> <b>crazy</b> man. I would have thought Captain Wilson was old enough to know better." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mark Deming of the AllMovie {{gave the}} film 2.5/5 stars, saying, [...] "Bunraku {{is a movie}} that's all about visual style, and {{narrative}} and character barely {{fit into the picture}} ... The movie looks <b>like</b> such <b>a</b> remarkable <b>crazy</b> quilt of themes and inspirations that you can't help but wish that writer and director Guy Moshe put half as much effort into his screenplay". Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film one out of five stars, saying, [...] "It should surprise no one that visually quirky, graphic-novelish, pulp-noir action flicks rarely come through the sausage machine intact". Dennis Harvey of Variety also disliked the film, calling it [...] "a pic that's akin to a terrarium of plastic flowers -- gaudily decorative, but airless and lifeless".|$|R

5000|$|Guleserian began {{a longstanding}} {{collaboration}} with writer-director Drake Doremus at AFI, which both men attended {{at the same}} time. In 2006, Guleserian photographed Doremus's thesis project, and they paired up again to shoot numerous commercials and music videos {{in addition to the}} 2009 feature film Spooner. They later collaborated on <b>Like</b> <b>Crazy,</b> <b>a</b> romantic drama film that premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and won the festival's Grand Jury Prize, an achievement that Guleserian later said [...] "opened up a lot of opportunities" [...] for him. One such opportunity was the 2013 romantic comedy About Time, which was the first big-budget studio film Guleserian worked on; previously, he had only shot independent films with smaller budgets. The same year, he returned to work with Doremus as cinematographer on Breathe In, starring Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce. Since Doremus's films are largely improvised, Guleserian filmed these projects unconventionally, with mostly handheld camerawork in takes that usually last over ten minutes.|$|R
