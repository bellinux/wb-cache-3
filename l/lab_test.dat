25|$|The {{neurological}} and kidney-related {{signs and}} symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of TTP. However, unlike aHUS, TTP is primarily an autoimmune disorder in which the presence of an inhibitory autoantibody results in severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWf), a large protein involved in blood clotting, into smaller pieces. (TTP also can be a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This congenital cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency is called Upshaw-Schülman syndrome.) A <b>lab</b> <b>test</b> showing ADAMTS13 activity levels of ≤5% is indicative of TTP.|$|E
25|$|However, many growers, traders, and {{consumers}} reject such <b>lab</b> <b>test</b> numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic {{method of sampling}} batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters. However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.|$|E

500|$|The CSMIP Cape Mendocino {{station was}} {{installed}} in 1978 and was located just [...] from the epicenter on the slope of a ridge in the coast ranges. The instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained firmly secured to the rock platform following the shocks. A landslide came within [...] of the device and left debris on the road, but a lack of large rocks close to the instrument and no cracking of the rocks near the platform left geologists with no clear explanation for the extraordinarily high vertical component reading of 1.85g. The tri-axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into the recording. A post-earthquake <b>lab</b> <b>test</b> of the seismometer and an inspection of the photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that the limit was hit twice, with a maximum deflection of 31mm, as the needle bounced off the unit's mass. An extrapolation of the vertical record led to a maximum acceleration estimate of 2.2g for that site, and the unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity digital device.|$|E

Vinokourov's A test {{revealed}} two different types of red blood cells in his circulatory system indicating he had a blood transfusion prior to the stage. A blood transfusion is meant {{to increase the number of}} red blood cells in the body, improving oxygen flow from the lungs to the muscles. Vinokourov rejected the positive test, blaming the anomaly on excessive blood flow in his thighs following a heavy collision earlier in the Tour. Accordingly, he asked for his B sample to be tested; however, the <b>lab</b> <b>test</b> for locating blood cells from another donor in [...] "old fashioned" [...] homologous transfusions is considered fool-proof.

2500|$|Glucose vs. plasma glucose: Glucose {{levels in}} plasma (one of the {{components}} of blood) are generally 10%–15% higher than glucose measurements in whole blood (and even more after eating). This is important because home blood glucose meters measure the glucose in whole blood while most lab tests measure the glucose in plasma. [...] Currently, there are many meters on the market that give results as [...] "plasma equivalent," [...] even though they are measuring whole blood glucose. [...] The plasma equivalent is calculated from the whole blood glucose reading using an equation built into the glucose meter. This allows patients to easily compare their glucose measurements in a <b>lab</b> <b>test</b> and at home. [...] It is important for patients and their health care providers to know whether the meter gives its results as [...] "whole blood equivalent" [...] or [...] "plasma equivalent." [...] One model measures beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood to detect ketosis for measuring both unhealthy ketoacidosis and healthy nutritional ketosis.|$|E
