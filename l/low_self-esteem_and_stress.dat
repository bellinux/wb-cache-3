Children can suffer from <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> induced symptoms {{as a result of}} test anxiety. The principles of systematic desensitization can be used by children to help reduce their test anxiety. Children can practice the muscle relaxation techniques by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. With older children and college students, an explanation of desensitization can help to increase the effectiveness of the process. After these students learn the relaxation techniques, they can create an anxiety inducing hierarchy. For test anxiety these items could include not understanding directions, finishing on time or marking the answers properly. Teachers, school counselors or school psychologists could instruct children on the methods of systematic desensitization.|$|E

On average females consume less cigarettes per day and choose cigarettes with a lesser nicotine content. Other risk factors include being caucasian, multi-ethnic, American-Indian, or Alaskan Native, as these groups have higher smoking prevalences than other ethnicities. Also, adolescents who are involved in antisocial behaviors, such as fighting, stealing, and using other drugs are more likely to smoke than those who do not engage in antisocial behaviors.|$|R

Throughout the eight sessions, it was found that there were three phases for the acquirement of assertive skills. These were, ① promotion of self-understanding, ② acquirement for the right to assertion, and ③ acquirement of the skills. The patients, who had a <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> high <b>stress</b> level to others, gave priority to reduce their <b>stress</b> onto others <b>and</b> promote their self-understanding through grasping their own feelings and state. On the other hand, some patient's became more aggressive to others due to the fact that the right of assertion exceeded any other reaction. This showed that each patient had his/her own characteristic and they had different ways to attain assertiveness. Therefore there are various ways to approach this and the changes could be made by any of the cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects. Furthermore in this training certified co-leaders held multiple roles. Mainly it was related to individual cares such as talking to each member before the session and one-on-one assistance during the interval. It was revealed that these cares had been working to reduce the patients' tension and to keep them motivated to the session...|$|R
40|$|This {{scholarly}} paper {{explains the}} relationship between child sexual abuse and psychological disorders. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a forceful sexual contact with {{a child who is}} incapable of consenting. The impact of sexual abuse can range from physical to very severe psychological effects. Psychological disorders caused by child sexual abuse include panic disorder, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> post-traumatic <b>stress</b> disorder. The phenomenon of child sexual abuse is shaped by some important theories like behavioral, psychodynamic, attachment, cognitive and integrated theory. These theories may help to develop a sound empirical base through which cost effective strategies can be made to prevent child sexual abuse. Although child sexual abuse is considered as an offensive act in Pakistan, but it is usually hidden in our society. Approximately 3, 861 and 1, 204 child sexual abuse cases were reported in 2012 and 2013 respectively from Pakistan. A series of current cases of child sexual abuse has brought the issue to the limelight. Child sexual abuse affects not only the individual but also the families and societies on large scale. Therefore, an integrated approach focusing on the parents, teachers and medical professionals can be proposed to prevent this issue. Prevention programs such as parenting education, home-visiting programs, public education, and training sessions can be developed. Therefore, it is highly important for the families and communities to work together with the support of stakeholders, so that a voice can be raised against CSA and this will ultimately reduce psychological problems in the society...|$|R
40|$|Self-esteem {{involves}} {{a variety of}} cognitive processes that help people perceive, interpret, and process social information. A central component of people's self-esteem is their sense of belonging and feelings of acceptance. It follows that people react strongly to social rejection and that being attuned to signs of real or potential social rejection can serve a self-protection function. However, being overly attuned and sensitive to social rejection can have a paradoxical effect, whereby aberrant attentional processes {{can contribute to the}} perpetuation of the vicious cycle of <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> The goal of the research presented in this dissertation was twofold: to investigate whether people with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> are more vigilant for rejection information, and to investigate whether a rejection-inhibiting attentional training task that reduces their vigilance for rejection can help buffer against social and performance threats. I hypothesized that people with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> are more vigilant for rejection information than for acceptance information. I also hypothesized that training people, particularly those with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> to inhibit <b>and</b> disengage from rejection promotes effective regulation of emotions and has positive psychological, behavioural, and physiological effects. Results from the first study show that people with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> have a greater attentional bias for rejection than for acceptance information. Across 7 other studies, participants with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> trained to inhibit rejection with a specially designed attentional training task showed a lower rejection bias for rejection information, less feelings of rejection after overt rejection, and less ineffective persistence. Regardless of level of self-esteem, participants trained to inhibit rejection showed less interfering thoughts about rejection while working on a task, higher state self-esteem after having been rejected and experiencing failure, less stress about their final exam, increases in <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> decreases in perceived stress after a stressful work week, lower levels of cortisol, and increases in sales performance. Following a vicious cycle framework of <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> social <b>stress,</b> these results show that attentional bias training can circumvent the experience of social <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> possibly break the vicious cycle of <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Anxiety is {{the most}} common mental health {{disorders}} in the general population. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety, its associated factors and the predictors of anxiety among adults in the community of Selangor, Malaysia. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out in three districts in Selangor, Malaysia. The inclusion criteria of this study were Malaysian citizens, adults aged 18 years and above, and living in the selected living quarters based on the list provided by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOS). Participants completed a set of questionnaires, including the validated Malay version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD 7) to detect anxiety. Results: Of the 2512 participants who were approached, 1556 of them participated in the study (61. 90 %). Based on the cut-off point of 8 and above in the GAD- 7, the prevalence of anxiety was 8. 2 %. Based on the initial multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of anxiety were depression, serious problems at work, domestic violence <b>and</b> high perceived <b>stress.</b> When reanalyzed again after removing depression, <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> high perceived <b>stress,</b> six predictors that were identified are cancer, serious problems at work, domestic violence, unhappy relationship with family, non-organizational religious activity and intrinsic religiosity.

40|$|Results of {{our study}} {{describe}} the long term effects of reduction mammaplasty. Many women with excessively small or large breasts have an altered personal self-image and often suffer from <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> other psychological <b>stresses.</b> This procedure is designed to reduce and reshape large breasts, and since the size, shape, and symmetry of a woman’s breasts can {{have a profound effect}} on hermental and physical well-being it is important to observe the patient’s long-term outcome. Currently, breast reduction surgery is safe, effective and beneficial to the patient. In Croatia, reduction mammoplasty is often excluded from the general health care plan. The distinction between »reconstructive« versus »cosmetic« breast surgery is very well defined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Board of Directors. Unfortunately, the Croatian Health Society has yet to standardize such a distinction. There is an imperative need for evidence-based selection criteria. We retrospectively analyzed data of 59 female patients suffering from symptomatic macromastia who underwent reduction mammaplasty over a 16 year period (1995 until 2011). Our aim was to compare and contrast the various techniques available for reduction mammaplasty and to determine, based on patient outcome and satisfaction, which technique is most suited for each patient. The results {{of our study}} generally reinforce the observation that reduction mammaplasty significantly provides improvements in health status, long-term quality of life, postsurgical breast appearance and significantly decrease physical symptoms of pain. A number of 59 consecutive cases were initially treated with the four different breast reduction techniques: inverted-T scat or Wisa pattern breast reduction, vertical reduction mammaplasty, simplified vertical reduction mammaplasty, inferior pedicle and free nipple graft techniques. The average clinical follow-up period was 6 -months, and included 48 patients. The statistical analysis of the postoperative patient complications revealed a significant positive relationship in regards to smoking. The majority of these complications were wound related, with no significant relationship between patient complications and variables such as age, BMI, ASA score, resection weight of breast parenchyma, nipple elevation, duration of surgery, and type of pedicle. The higher number of complication correlated with a lower volume of parenchyma resection (rho=– 0. 321). Overall satisfaction with the new breast size (79 %), appearance of the postoperative scars (87 %), overall cosmetic outcome score (91 %), overall outcome (100 %), psychosocial outcome (46 %), sexual outcome (85 %), physical outcome (88 %), satisfaction with preoperative information data (92 %), and finally satisfaction with overall care process (96 %) was calculated. As expected, the physical symptoms disappeared or were minimized in 88 % of patients. Each method of breast reduction has its advantages and disadvantages. The surgeon should evaluate each patient’s desires on the basis of her physical presentation. Breast reduction surgery increases the overall personal and social health; not only for the patient, but for their family and friends as well. It is an imperative that every surgeon is aware of this, in order to provide the highest level of care and quality to their patients...|$|R

Whereas the vulnerability model states that <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> contributes to depression, the scar model states that depression erodes self-esteem. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the models are specific for depression or whether they are also valid for anxiety. We evaluated the vulnerability and scar models of <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> depression, <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> anxiety, by meta-analyzing the available longitudinal data (covering 77 studies on depression and 18 studies on anxiety). The mean age of the samples ranged from childhood to old age. In the analyses, we used a random-effects model and examined prospective effects between the variables, controlling for prior levels of the predicted variables. For depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The effect of self-esteem on depression (β = -. 16) was significantly stronger than the effect of depression on self-esteem (β = -. 08). In contrast, the effects between <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> anxiety were relatively balanced: Self-esteem predicted anxiety with β = -. 10, <b>and</b> anxiety predicted <b>self-esteem</b> with β = -. 08. Moderator analyses were conducted for the effect of <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> on depression; these suggested that the effect is not significantly influenced by gender, age, measures of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> depression, or time lag between assessments. If future research supports the hypothesized causality of the vulnerability effect of <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> on depression, interventions aimed at increasing self-esteem might be useful in reducing the risk of depression...|$|R

40|$|Diathesis-stress {{models of}} {{depression}} suggest that <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> stressful events jointly influence {{the development of}} depressive affect. More specifically, the self-esteem buffering hypothesis states that, {{in the face of}} challenging life circumstances, individuals with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> are prone to depression because they lack sufficient coping resources, whereas those with high self-esteem are able to cope effectively and consequently avoid spiraling downward into depression. The authors used data from 3 longitudinal studies of adolescents and young adults, who were assessed 4 times over a 3 -year period (Study 1; N = 359), 3 times over a 6 -week period (Study 2; N = 249), and 4 times over a 6 -year period (Study 3; N = 2, 403). In all 3 studies, <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> stressful events independently predicted subsequent depression but did not interact in the prediction.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Clinical and Health Psychology (DCP) Scope: Individuals {{with high}} impulsivity levels place {{themselves}} and {{people around them}} at risk. For individuals who experience difficulties in effectively managing their impulsive behaviours, it may turn into a lifelong debilitating condition in both clinical and nonclinical populations. Impulsivity is a prominent feature of many psychiatric and developmental disorders: personality disorders (such as Borderline Personality Disorder [BPD]), eating disorders (such as bulimia), mood disorders (such as bipolar disorder [BD]) and substance addiction (such as drug addiction) Parry and Lindsay (2003). Impulsivity, alongside maladaptive coping strategies, hopelessness, cognitive rigidity, problem solving difficulties and hostility, is associated with deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts (Kumaraiah & Bhide, 2001). Impulsivity {{is considered to be}} a lifelong personality trait and a feature of many psychological problems and there seems to be a need to develop and test psychological interventions for this common mental health problem (Wells, Parboteeah, & Valacich, 2011). Therefore, developing an effective treatment program is important and will be of benefit not only to an individual but to a wider society (Grant & Kim, 2003). Purpose: Impulsivity is a prominent feature of many psychiatric and developmental disorders: personality disorders (e. g., Borderline Personality Disorder), eating disorders (e. g., Bulimia), Impulse Control Disorders (ICD) (e. g., Kleptomania), and substance addiction (Drug Addiction). Impulsivity has been associated with lower academic grades, higher aggression, interpersonal violence, impulsive shopping, and stealing in clinical and nonclinical population (Spinella, 2004). Impulsivity is related to the severity of gambling behaviours and is indicative of a future development of pathological gambling (Forbush et al., 2008). Additionally, impulsivity has been associated with self-injurious and suicidal behaviour (Klonsky & May, 2010). Individuals with high levels of impulsivity experience difficulties, such as emotional instability and cognitive distractibility, engaging in behaviours that often result in undesirable outcomes (Gay, Schmidt, & Van der Linden, 2011). Thus, they often feel powerless, weak and ashamed due to the lack of control over their impulsive behaviours (Grant & Kim, 2003). Additionally, such individuals often experience heightened anxiety, depressive moods, <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> increased <b>stress</b> associated with their impulsive behaviours (Grant & Kim, 2003). Therefore, developing an effective treatment program is important and will be of benefit not only to an individual but a wider society (Grant & Kim, 2003). Cognitive Behaviour therapy (CBT) {{is considered to be a}}n effective intervention for impulse control disorders (Moeller & Dougherty, 2002). Treatment studies based on CBT interventions including covert sensitisation, imaginal desensitisation, aversion therapy, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training and relapse prevention were found to be effective in treatment of individuals diagnosed with kleptomania, compulsive buying, or pathological gambling (Hodgins & Peden, 2008). Mindfulness, as a therapeutic tool, has long been recognised as an effective intervention in emotional regulations and is considered to be a core component of a Mindfulness-Based <b>Stress</b> Reduction program <b>and</b> Dialectical-Behaviour Therapy (Peters, Erisman, Upton, Baer, & Roemer, 2011). Based on the current literature, we designed a computerised intervention program aimed at reducing dysfunctional impulsivity in a nonclinical sample. We expect to find a reduction in impulsivity, in particular: a decrease of impulsivity as measured by BIS- 11; an increase in tolerance of delay as measured by Delay Discounting Task; and a reduction in cognitive distortions as measured by the Cognitive Distortion Scale (CDS). Methodology: Eligible participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IMP) and control group (SA). Participants were evaluated prior to initiating the computerised program, upon completion and during a follow up period on measures including: BIS- 11; Cognitive Distortions Scale (CDS); and an online delay discounting task examining hypothetical monetary rewards. Indifference points were calculated and hyperbolic curves were fitted to the indifference points for both groups (IMP vs SA). The study is a mixed experimental design. The between-subject factor is the type of treatment. The within-subject factors are measures of impulsivity, cognitive distortions, social anxiety and delay discounting at time intervals (Pre-treatment, Post-treatment, and 2 weeks follow-up). Results: This study demonstrated that dysfunctional impulsivity in a nonclinical sample can be reduced with the help of computerised Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Mindfulness intervention. In particular, results showed that increases in the tolerance of delay of gratification, reduction in Mind Reading, Shoulds, Confusing Needs and Wants, All-or-Nothing Thinking, Discounting Positives, Personalising, Regret Orientation, Short-term Thinking and Blaming cognitive distortions, as well as reduction in Non-Planning Impulsivity in the intervention group, were observed and sustained at a follow-up evaluation. General Conclusions and Implications: The results of this study highlight the value of an intervention program in addressing dysfunctional impulsivity and contributes to research in the area of decision making, self control, cognitive modification and cognitive therapy regarding the cognitive distortions associated with dysfunctional impulsivity. This is the first study to design and test computerised Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Mindfulness intervention to address dysfunctional impulsivity in a nonclinical sample. Further research should be conducted to expand research in this area utilising larger sample sizes and to test this intervention program with the clinical population...|$|R
