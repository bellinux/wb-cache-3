25|$|Pope John XXIII also {{revised the}} Breviary in 1960, {{introducing}} changes {{drawn up by}} his predecessor Pope Pius XII. The most notable alteration is the shortening of most feasts from nine to three lessons at Matins, keeping only the Scripture readings (the former <b>lesson</b> <b>i,</b> then lessons ii and iii together), followed by either {{the first part of}} the patristic reading (lesson vii) or, for most feasts, a condensed version of the former second Nocturn, which was formerly used when a feast was reduced in rank and commemorated.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I can see him toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest <b>lesson.</b> <b>I</b> can hear him talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E
500|$|This {{time on the}} {{frontier}} ended in July 1889 when {{the family moved to}} Washington, D.C., where Douglas attended the Force Public School. His father was posted to San Antonio, Texas, in September 1893. While there MacArthur attended the West Texas Military Academy, where he was awarded the gold medal for [...] "scholarship and deportment". He also participated on the school tennis team, and played quarterback on the school football team and shortstop on its baseball team. He was named valedictorian, with a final year average of 97.33 out of 100. MacArthur's father and grandfather unsuccessfully sought to secure Douglas a presidential appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, first from President Grover Cleveland and then from President William McKinley. After these two rejections, he was given coaching and private tutoring by Milwaukee high school teacher Gertrude Hull. He then passed the examination for an appointment from Congressman Theobald Otjen, scoring 93.3 on the test. He later wrote: [...] "It was a <b>lesson</b> <b>I</b> never forgot. Preparedness is the key to success and victory." ...|$|E

500|$|Hannah Montana {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who appreciated its overall production. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares enjoyed Cyrus' deliveries of [...] "cute, well-written songs", {{and added that}} the overall project was [...] "sweet, starry-eyed, [...] utterly charming". Jennifer Axman from Common Sense Media shared a similar sentiment, appreciating its [...] "upbeat girl-power messages" [...] and distinguishing [...] "I Learned from You" [...] as a stand-out track for its inspirational lyrics ("I learned from you that I do not crumble / I learned from you that strength is something you choose /.../ There is no question that's a <b>lesson</b> <b>I</b> learned from you"). MSN Music gave the record a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and listed it as an [...] "essential album". However, Chris Willman provided a more mixed review, commenting that Cyrus appeared to [...] "mimic Avril, Ashlee, and Britney simultaneously", and felt {{that the concept of}} leading a double life was [...] "a nice fantasy for Brangelina, but a weird one to push on little girls." [...] David Hiltbrand was also critical of the record, stating that its [...] "generic pop" [...] would irritate adult listeners, but acknowledged that it was [...] "slickly executed" [...] for appealing to its younger audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} {{has worked with}} screenwriter David S. Goyer on all his comic-book adaptations. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer for all of Nolan's films from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Embarking on his own career as a director, Pfister said: [...] "The greatest <b>lesson</b> <b>I</b> learned from Chris Nolan is to keep my humility. He is an absolute gentleman on set and he is wonderful to everyone — from the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect." [...] Lee Smith has been Nolan's editor since Batman Begins, with Dody Dorn editing Memento and Insomnia. David Julyan composed the music for Nolan's early work, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provided the music for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Zimmer scored The Dark Knight Rises, and has worked with Nolan on his subsequent films. Zimmer has said his creative relationship with Nolan is highly collaborative, and that he views Nolan as [...] "the co-creator of the score". The {{director has}} worked with sound designer Richard King and sound mixer Ed Novick since The Prestige. Nolan has frequently collaborated with special-effects supervisor Chris Corbould, stunt coordinator Tom Struthers first assistant director Nilo Otero, and visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin. Production designer Nathan Crowley has worked with him since Insomnia (except for Inception). Nolan has called Crowley {{one of his closest}} and most inspiring creative collaborators. Casting director John Papsidera has worked on all of Nolan's films, except Following and Insomnia.|$|E
2500|$|Alex Sadkin was {{a mentor}} to {{engineer}} and producer Phil Thornalley, who {{would go on to}} work with The Cure, Johnny Hates Jazz, and Natalie Imbruglia. He had a special gift of being able to sense and analyze an artist's inner creative abilities and talents, even if the artist couldn't. Composer-keyboardist Wally Badarou {{had this to say about}} Sadkin: [...] "His dedication to maintaining genuine 'mixes in progress' from the word go, was a great <b>lesson.</b> <b>I</b> made it a system for my subsequent production from then on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goldsmith {{was educated}} at four {{independent}} schools: King's House School in Richmond and The Mall School in Twickenham, followed by Hawtreys School, near Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, and Eton College in Berkshire; He {{was expelled from}} Eton after drugs were found in his room. Goldsmith later said of the event [...] "Cannabis was found in my room. I was guilty throughout my time at school, but on this one occasion I was innocent. But it seemed pointless {{at the time to}} put up any resistance. I learned my <b>lesson,</b> <b>I</b> think you could say." [...] He went on to achieve four A-Levels at Cambridge Centre for Sixth-Form Studies.|$|E
2500|$|Six {{months after}} graduating from Webber Douglas, Dormer won the role of Victoria in Casanova. This was her film debut and it was {{released}} in 2005. The director, Lasse Hallström, {{was so impressed with}} Dormer's comedic timing that he had the script writer expand her part. On the strength of her audition for the role and her performance, she secured a three-film deal with Touchstone Pictures, which was never exercised. In 2005, Dormer had a small part in Distant Shores. After the filming of Casanova, Dormer was out of work for ten months, which she ascribes to [...] "bad representation". She was attached to an independent film which kept being delayed because of financial problems. Taken off the audition circuit, Dormer waitressed and worked in data entry to support herself. She has said that her being out of work for so long [...] "was the best <b>lesson</b> <b>I</b> could have had in the first 12 months of my career".|$|E
2500|$|G. R. S. Mead {{wrote about}} Blavatsky, [...] "I know {{no one who}} detested, more than she did, any attempt to hero-worship herselfshe {{positively}} physically shuddered at any expression of reverence to herselfas a spiritual teacher; I have heard her cry out in genuine alarm at an attempt to kneel to her made by an enthusiastic admirer." [...] Leo Klejn wrote about Blavatsky, [...] "Indefatigability and energy of this woman were surprising. She had a revolutionary's merits." [...] Another person who said Blavatsky was a remarkable woman was a former associate {{and publisher of the}} Theosophical magazine [...] "Lucifer" [...] 1887–1889, Mabel Collins. After leaving the movement she said [...] "She taught me one great <b>lesson.</b> <b>I</b> learned from her how foolish, how 'gullible', how easily flattered human beings are, taken en masse. Her contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as everything else about her, except her marvellously delicate taper fingers. In all else, she was a big woman. She had a greater power over the weak and credulous, a greater capacity for making black appear white, a larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred for those whom she thought to be her enemies, a greater disrespect for les convenances, a worse temper, a greater command of bad language, and a greater contempt for the intelligence of her fellow-beings than I had ever supposed possible to be contained in one person. These, I suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices, I know not." ...|$|E
