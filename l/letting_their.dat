5|$|Moses {{also made}} {{improvements}} to the park itself, building new walkways, paving dirt roads, creating playgrounds, and installing lights. Baseball, soccer, and cricket fields were added in 1938. The Van Cortlandt Stadium was added in 1939 {{on the site of}} a former swamp, and a pool followed in 1970. Moses also landscaped the areas near the Woodlawn and 242nd Street subway stations to attract park visitors from other neighborhoods. During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Moses took aggressive approach to preserving the park's quality. For instance, six mothers were issued court summonses in 1942 after <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> children dig in the park, and two airplane pilots were fined in 1947 for unauthorized airplane landings.|$|E

5|$|The Oakridge {{students}} are placed into learning groups named after animals. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) initially suspects her daughter Juanita (Madison De La Garza), {{who is in}} the Leopards, is among the slow group, whereas Susan (Teri Hatcher) is pleased that her son M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread. While Susan and Gabrielle wait to talk to the principal, they both admit they got carried away and confess fears that they are <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> kids down.|$|E

25|$|Game Four the Vikings {{play the}} third ranked college {{team in the}} league, U.C.D in Belfield. Belfield holds a bit of history for the Vikings as it was here they {{defeated}} the Leylstad commanders {{to become the first}} Irish team to win the Atlantic cup. The Vikings rushed to a 21-point lead in the first quarter, however U.C.D impressed by having a great attitude and not <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> heads drop and battled it out and put more points on the Vikings than any other team in the regular season, 16.

25|$|The primary corroborative sighting, however, {{occurred}} {{ten days}} later (July 4) when a United Airlines crew over Idaho en route to Seattle also spotted five to nine disk-like objects that paced their plane for 10 to 15 minutes before suddenly disappearing. The next day in Seattle, Arnold met with the pilot, Cpt. Emil J. Smith, and copilot and compared sighting details.

Arnold and Cpt.

25|$|The first match had led {{to media}} consternation about the {{appropriateness}} of India's batting strategy. Rahul Dravid had been promoted up the batting order from number three to open along with Wasim Jaffer, while regular opener Dinesh Karthik was dropped prior to the first Test. This was done to create a middle-order vacancy for Yuvraj Singh, who had scored a century in India's previous Test, when he substituted for the injured Sachin Tendulkar. During the first Test, both Dravid and Jaffer failed to pass 20 in either innings, with the former attracting attention for his particularly slow and defensive approach. This allowed the Australian bowling to assert control over the Indian batsmen from the outset and prevent them from gaining the momentum at the outset. Yuvraj also failed; he was particularly fidgety in scoring 0 and 5. The failures of the rearranged line-up prompted calls {{for the return of}} Virender Sehwag, who had been taken on tour as the reserve opener. Sehwag had been dropped from the side in early-2007 and had been unproductive in recent Ranji Trophy matches in India; however, his extremely aggressive approach had been successful against Australia in the past and cricket pundits felt that he could counter-attack the Australian bowlers, rather than <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> new ball attack seize the initiative. Jaffer, Dravid and Yuvraj were all mooted as possible omissions to make way for Sehwag.|$|E

He said the game's combat system would have an unparalleled degree of freedom. The team designed two systems of combat: a [...] "macro" [...] system, which gives players the choice between normal combat, magical attacks, or using the QTE feature to kill a foe; and a [...] "micro" [...] system, where players press a sequence of buttons to perform different attacks. Puzzles were implemented, including self-contained ones that incorporate up to three rooms of the game, and global puzzles that spread across four or five areas. Jaffe compared the game to the popular Prince of Persia series—which also incorporates puzzle and platforming elements—and said that while each puzzle in that series is a slight variation of the last, [...] "each puzzle in God of War is its own beast".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) {{have decided}} to avoid the expense and stress of a wedding and elope to a simple {{courthouse}} ceremony in Youngstown, Ohio without <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> co-workers know.

500|$|Hellyeah {{received}} generally positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{awarded the}} album {{three and a}} half stars out of five, commenting; [...] "Their album is a competent example of its genre, in which Tribbett and Maxwell combine to create crushing riffs over the pummeling rhythm section of Paul, while Gray howls typically enraged, expletive-littered lyrics to songs". However, Ruhlmann believes Hellyeah is not a notable variation from members' previous bands. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album 7 out of 10, praising the track [...] "Matter of Time" [...] for its slashing main riff, and [...] "One Thing" [...] as it [...] "marches to the finish line with a rumbling, crunching wall of guitars worthy of Dimebag himself". Kaye thought that Hellyeah's first studio effort was not equal to any of its members' main output. KNAC contributor Andrew Depedro stated [...] "it's a set of good songs recorded by 5 accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds not <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> pasts define them and those songs {{in one form or another}} speak to you in different ways".|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} medieval Poor Law was the Ordinance of Labourers {{which was}} issued by King Edward III of England on 18 June 1349, and revised in 1350. The ordinance was issued {{in response to}} the 1348–1350 outbreak of the Black Death in England, when an estimated 30–40% of the population had died. The decline in population left surviving workers in great demand in the agricultural economy of Britain. Landowners had to face the choice of raising wages to compete for workers or <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> lands go unused. Wages for labourers rose, and this forced up prices across the economy as goods became more expensive to produce. An attempt to rein in prices, the ordinance (and subsequent acts, such the Statute of Labourers of 1351) required that everyone who could work did; that wages were kept at pre-plague levels and that food was not overpriced. Workers saw these shortage conditions as an opportunity to flee employers and become freemen, so Edward III passed additional laws to punish escaped workers. [...] In addition, the Statute of Cambridge was passed in 1388 and placed restrictions on the movement of labourers and beggars.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the limited}} fuel allowance, the cars were towed to the start line by horses. The first car, a Rolls-Royce being driven by Charles Rolls, started at 9am, and the {{following}} 41 cars were released at one minute intervals. Due to the fuel-saving nature of the event most of the drivers began the race by <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> car coast down the initial slope under its own momentum before engaging gear. Early on the first lap of the race Rolls heard a crunching noise from his gear box and the car stopped. He claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into the gearbox, which had smashed a gear. Rolls claimed that this [...] "was a common trick abroad" [...] but voiced surprise at it happening in an English race. There was further speculation of foul play when {{it was discovered that}} Arnott's Minerva had been tampered with; two spark plugs had been smashed and an air valve bent, causing his engine to overheat. Before the race Rolls and Arnott had been two of the favourites, and The Automobile magazine said that [...] "this unfortunate incident has greatly detracted from the success of the race." ...|$|E

You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes.
