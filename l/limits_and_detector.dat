40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the zero-mode of a quantum field on the {{evolution}} of a particle detector. For a massless scalar field in a periodic cavity, we show that {{the impact of}} the zero mode on the Unruh-DeWitt <b>detector</b> <b>and</b> its derivative-coupling generalisation is necessarily nonvanishing but can be made negligible in some limits, including those commonly occurring in non-relativistic quantum optics. For the derivative-coupling detector this can be accomplished by just tuning the zero mode's initial state, but the standard Unruh-DeWitt detector requires a more subtle and careful tuning. Applications include an inertial detector with arbitrary velocity, where we demonstrate the regularity of the ultrarelativistic <b>limit,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>detector</b> with uniform acceleration.

40|$|A high-sensitivity {{detection}} method for optical power fluctuations is demonstrated based on photodetection in reflection of an optical resonator {{with a specific}} impedance matching. That resonator is used to reduce the carrier power reflected by the resonator while preserving the power fluctuation sidebands for frequencies above the resonator bandwidth. A sensitivity of 7 × 10 − 10 Hz− 1 / 2 for relative power fluctuations was achieved with only 3 mA of detected photocurrent and 99. 6 % of the power remained for downstream experiments. As in the widely used ac coupling of electrical signals, this technique overcomes dynamic-range <b>limits</b> <b>and</b> reduces <b>detector</b> noise associated with large carrier amplitudes of the optical field...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} reliable detection {{in the presence of}} impulsive noise. We base our derivation on the noise model that explicitly includes two parts, one of them being Gaussian to model thermal noise and the other being uniform to model the rare impulses. We have investigated two versions of the resulting robust <b>detectors,</b> <b>and</b> it turns out that for energy detector limiting, the noise works best; there is no difference in performance of nullifying <b>detector</b> <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>detector</b> in case of coherent detection, and finally, in case of correlation matrix-based detectors, the nullifying approach works best. The detectors perform almost as well as the ordinary detectors, derived for Gaussian noise if the noise actually is Gaussian.|$|R

The cyan line shows the performance of the <b>limiting</b> <b>detector</b> <b>and</b> the red line that of the nullifying detector in impulsive noise. The black and the magenta lines are for the sign correlation <b>and</b> the Huber <b>detectors,</b> respectively.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{possibilities}} {{what to do}} with the samples greater than √(η) resulting in slightly different algorithms. First, we can limit the signal at level √(η). This approach will be referred to as limiting detector. Second, we can replace the samples grater than √(η) with zeros. This is referred to as nullifying detector. To distinguish between the two detectors, we introduce a variable κ which takes value one the <b>limiting</b> <b>detector</b> <b>and</b> value zero in case of the nullifying detector. We shall investigate these options closer in the sequel of the paper.|$|R

40|$|A kernel based {{procedure}} for correcting experimental data for distortions {{due to the}} finite resolution <b>and</b> <b>limited</b> <b>detector</b> acceptance is presented.

Cross-validation is used to determine an optimal value for this parameter. A numerical example with a simulation study of systematical and statistical errors is presented to illustrate the procedure.

The correlation {{is determined by}} its classical expression with one decisive difference: we sum up coincidences for each pair individually. We analyze the effects of decoherence, <b>detector</b> efficiency <b>and</b> polarizer thresholds in detail. The Bell inequalities are violated in these simulations. The violation depends crucially {{on the threshold of}} the polarizer switches and can reach a value of 2. 0 in the limiting case.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{based on}} a Mixture Density Model for correcting experimental data for distortions due to finite resolution <b>and</b> <b>limited</b> <b>detector</b> acceptance is presented. Addressing {{the case that the}} solution is known to be non-negative, in the approach presented here, the true distribution is estimated by a weighted sum of probability density functions with positive weights and with the width of the densities acting as a regularisation parameter responsible for the smoothness of the result. To obtain better smoothing in less populated regions, the width parameter is chosen inversely proportional to the square root of the estimated density. Furthermore, the non-negative garrotte method is used to find the most economic representation of the solution. Cross-validation is employed to determine the optimal values of the resolution and garrotte parameters. The proposed approach is directly applicable to multidimensional problems. Numerical examples in one and two dimensions are presented to illustrate the procedure. Comment: 26 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{oscillations}} of neutrinos {{in a model}} in which the neutrino is coupled to a localized, idealized source <b>and</b> <b>detector.</b> By varying the spatial and temporal resolution of the source <b>and</b> <b>detector</b> {{we are able to}} model the full range of source <b>and</b> <b>detector</b> types ranging from coherent to incoherent.

This method can easily be extended to study the oscillations of other particles such as the neutral K and B mesons. We find that this approach gives a reliable way to treat the various ambiguities which arise when one examines the oscillations from a wave packet point of view. We demonstrate that the conventional oscillation formula is correct in the relativistic <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> that several recent claims of an extra factor of 2 in the oscillation length are incorrect.

40|$|In {{this article}} we study a {{particular}} method of detection of chirp signals from coalescing compact binary stars [...] the so-called dynamical tuning, i. e. amplification of the signal via tracking of its instantaneous frequency by the tuning of the signal-recycled detector. A time-domain consideration developed for signal-recycled interferometers, in particular GEO 600, describes the signal and noise evolution in the non-stationary detector. Its non-stationarity is caused by motion of the signal recycling mirror, whose position defines the tuning of the detector. We prove that the shot noise from the dark port and optical losses remains white. The analysis of the transient effects shows that during the perfect tracking of the chirp frequency only transients from amplitude changes arise. The signal-to-noise-ratio gain, calculated in this paper, is ~ 16 for a shot-noise <b>limited</b> <b>detector</b> <b>and</b> ~ 4 for a detector with thermal noise.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} and numerical tomographic {{study on the}} influence of lateral beam coherence <b>and</b> <b>limited</b> <b>detector</b> resolution on the size of voids in copper is presented. Several scans of the same sample were performed at ID 15 A of ESRF under pink beam conditions and different sample-detector distances. The tomographic images were segmented using a gradient based method and then the same voids appearing in subsequent volumes were identified through image-correlation. It was found that the segmented void size is smaller at short detector distances, but it saturates at values of about 160 - 200 mm. Simulations show that the phase contrast available at larger distances enhances the intensity gradient at void-matrix interfaces leading to a proper segmentation if gradient based algorithms are used. For distances involved in the present experiment the true size of voids with diameters in the 4. 7 - 12 mu m range is not altered by phase contrast effects. The smaller apparent void size (by about 15 - 20 %) obtained at short distances (20 - 50 mm) is a result of low signal to noise ratio of the corresponding reconstructions...|$|R
