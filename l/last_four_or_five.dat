[...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror."

[...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E

50|$|Banana pipistrelles are insectivorous, feeding {{primarily}} on beetles and small moths. They fly {{close to the}} ground, typically between 2 and 5 m high and catch insects in mid-air.

Echolocation in banana pipistrelles consists of steep, frequency modulated calls <b>lasting</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> milliseconds, with a dominant frequency of about 43 kHz.
