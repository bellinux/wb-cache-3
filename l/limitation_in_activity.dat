40|$|Cerebral palsy is a {{classification}} of permanent disorders that concerns {{the development of}} human movement and posture. <b>Limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> is primarily attributed to non-progressive damage that occurs during {{the growth of the}} fetal / infant brain, particularly to the cerebellum which responsible for motor control. The degree of paralysis associated with cerebral palsy ranges from muscular weakness, nerve damage, loss of sensation, depth perception, and to involuntary movements (i. e. trembling or shaking). Although there is no known cure for cerebral palsy, physical and occupational therapies are often used to restore, maintain, and promote optimum physical function. This study discerns the physiological responses for those characterized with cerebral palsy from both passive and dynamic standing therapies. Although, their rehabilitative approaches are distinguished by joint immobilization versus reciprocal loading, the evaluation of each are used to demonstrate an integrative method for proprioceptive training and postural control. This is achieved by the use of a multi-therapy suspension system as developed in this body of research...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} effec-tiveness of ultrasound guided injection in the man-agement of Morton’s Metatarsalgia. Patients clinically diagnosed with interdigital Morton’s neuroma were treated with ultrasound guided injection of local anaesthetic and steroid. Fifty four patients were available for follow-up, and all had detailed telephone questionnaires completed. These questionnaires included a pre and post injection symptom score, and Johnson Satisfaction score. The results indicate that 69 % of patients had ultra-sound diagnosis of Morton’s neuroma and 31 % had an ultrasound diagnosis of intermetatarsal bursa. Mean follow-up was 11. 4 months. Sixty seven percent of the patients were satisfied with the results of treat-ment. At follow-up 63 % of patients had no <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> levels, and had no need to modify shoe wear. Of all patients included in the study, only three have gone on to require surgery for ongoing symp-toms. Although some studies have suggested that nei-ther injection nor imaging have a role in the treat-ment of Morton’s neuroma, this study, however, demonstrates that ultrasound guided placement of local anaesthetic and steroid in either an inter-metatarsal bursa or Morton’s neuroma gives a good short and medium term symptom relief and in the majority of cases avoids or at least delays the need for surgery...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the course of}} <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> over five years follow-up and identify predictors of future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Relevance: Although cross sectional research on determinants of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is robust <b>in</b> patients with OA, high quality longitudinal research on the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> over time and predictors of future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is surprisingly limited. Knowledge about the courseof <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> over time and predictors of future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is important for both patients and clinicians. Based on this information clinicians can identify patients {{who are at risk}} for future functional decline and prognosticate future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, more insight in the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and predictors of future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is the basis for improving treatments and rehabilitation of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Participants: Elderly patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis according to radiological criteria or clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (n = 288) were recruited at rehabilitation centres and hospitals. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study with five years follow-up was conducted. The main outcome measures were self-reported and performance based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Prognostic factors were demographic and clinical data, body functions, co morbidity, cognitive functioning, avoidance of activity and social support. Measurements were conducted at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years follow-up. Analysis: All analyses were performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). To identify predictors of future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities,</b> univariate GEE analyses were performed. Potential predictors with a univariate p-value that was {{less than or equal to}} 0. 15 were entered into a multivariable model, after which backward elimination of predictors was used to remove non-significant predictors (p to remove≥ 0. 10). All analyses were performed separately for patients with knee OA and patients with hip OA. Results: Both in patients with knee and hip OA, the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remained fairly stable over a period of five years. Avoidance of activity, increased pain, a higher morbidity count, a higher age, a longer disease duration, a reduced muscle strength and range of joint motion at baseline predicted more future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with knee OA. In patients with hip OA, avoidance of activity, increased pain, a higher morbidity count, a higher age, a higher educational level and a reduced muscle strength at baseline predicted more future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Conclusions: The course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remains fairly stable over a period of five years in elderly patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis. However, at individual level there is considerable variation. Predictors of more future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> include avoidance of activity, increased pain, higher morbidity count, lower muscle strength, and a higher age. Implications: The study findings can help clinicians prognosticate future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with hip or knee OA and identify patients who are at risk for more future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: to {{describe}} the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> elderly patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, and (ii) to identify age related factors that predict the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted. Patients (n= 288) with hip or knee OA were recruited from rehabilitation centres and hospitals (departments of orthopaedics, rheumatology and rehabilitation). Apart from demographic and clinical data, physical impairments (pain, muscle strength and range of joint motion: ROM), comorbidity, cognitive dysfunction and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (both self reported (WOMAC) and observed (timed walking test) were assessed. Statistical analyses included multilevel analysis, univariate regression analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Results: Preliminary results showed that in operated patients self reported functioning improved, where as observed functioning remained unchanged. In patients, that had not undergone surgery, <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> did not change. No {{differences were found between}} hip and knee OA. The course of self reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> was significantly associated with change in ROM hip flexion {{during the first year of}} follow-up, change in pain during the first year of follow-up and morbidity count. Furthermore, muscle strength hip abduction, change in muscle strength hip abduction during the first year of follow-up, morbidity count, cognitive function, age and BMI were associated with observed <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Conclusion: Patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee show differences in the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Some of the patients improve, where as others show no changes or worsening of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> This difference can be partly explained by the fact that some of the patients underwent surgery and others did not. In not operated patients, the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remained unchanged. Patients that had had surgery reported improvement. Furthermore, protective factors and risk factors for the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> were identified.

With tight closeout dates imposed upon surveys such as the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, an annual national health survey sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and increasing negative feelings toward participation in surveys by the public, "late " and "difficult " cases may potentially become nonrespondents and may subsequently affect the estimates. In the 1998 NHIS, 1, 197 interviews out of 38, 209 interviewed households were completed after the official interviewer closeout date (15 days beyond the assignment starting date) and identified as "late " interviews. 1, 475 interviews were classified "difficult " interviews because they required more than 9 contacts. We found that characteristics of these late/difficult interviews are different from the non-late/difficult cases at both the household and person level.

40|$|The ageing of the {{population}} is unprecedented in human history and still continuing. Average life expectancy has doubled in most human populations over past 20 th century. The number of people aged 60 years and over in the UK is projected to increase from 12 million (20 % of {{the population}}) in 2001 to 18 million in 2031 (30 % {{of the population}}). The societal consequences are substantial. Issues include employment, for example, duration of active working life and duration of post retirement years, education, taxation and savings, pensions, and social structures. Health in an older population is a major issue, as this will influence the ability of older people to continue making active contributions as well as the amount and duration of dependency and need for long term care at the end of life. The risk of disability and ill health tends to increase with increasing age. By age 75 or so about half the population have some <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> and about a fifth are unable to carry out some major activity. Much current debate concerns how best to treat, support, and care for, the projected great increase in persons with impairments, disability and handicap resulting from the ageing of the population. These numbers are projected to increase two to threefold over the next few decades. However, such morbidity projections are highly sensitive to small changes in incidence and prevalence of disability. Large international variations and secular trends indicate a large proportion of disability associated with ageing is potentially preventable or at least postponeable and research indicates that modifiable environmental factors, particular lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity and smoking and infection may play a major role. A central challenge must be how we ensure optimal physical and psychological functioning at older ages in {{as many people as possible}} and identify policies that help maintain health and inde-pendence in an ageing population...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} where the target {{population}} has been older adults suffering from osteoporosis related fractures were firstly to study the association between functional impairment due to pain, and activity expressed as walking speed (WS) and Timed Get up and-Go (TUG), and to examine the associations between functional impairment and social participation (SP) {{and quality of life}} (QoL). Secondly, to study the association between activity and SP and QoL. Thirdly, to study the effect of informal and/or formal support on SP. In study I activity 3 years after trauma and stratified for pain was examined. For fractured, both with and without pain, higher WS was noted for subjects with the last fracture more than 3 years ago compared to subjects fractured less than 3 years ago. The median time for fractured in pain and a trauma more than 3 years ago walking 15 m at a self selected speed was 14 s compared to 20 s (p = 0. 04) for subjects in pain and fractured less than 3 years ago. Both fracture and pain independently explained levels of WS. In study II the association between functional impairment and SP and QoL was investigated. QoL included Life satisfaction index A (LSI- A) and SF- 12 consisting of a mental component (MCS) and a physical component (PCS). Fractured with and without pain were compared to non-fractured controls and in 12 out of 21 activities fewer fractured in pain took part compared to controls. Regarding QoL, fractured in pain scored lower for MCS, PCS and LSI-A, compared to controls. In study III the association between WS, TUG and QoL and SP was examined. In a logistic regression model adjusting for confounders, significant associations remained between SP and WS, TUG where an increased probability of taking part increased with a faster performance. In study IV the extent of SP due to formal and/or informal care was examined. Adjusted odds ratios for SP using non support as a reference, showed that subjects with informal support did not have a lower probability for participating while subjects with informal and/or formal support had a significant lower probability for SP. In conclusion, fractured had a <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity.</b> For both fractured with and without pain a limitation in WS was observed up to three years after trauma suggesting that there is rehabilitation potential the first years after fracture. A health condition with fracture and a functional impairment due to pain, or a deterioration WS or TUG are associated with a restriction in SP and a lowered QoL. The results also substantiate the influence of informal support i. e. care given by relatives and friends have decisive influence to maintain SP and thereby an active lifestyle...|$|E

MethodsSelf-reported <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> was assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index (WOMAC) function subscale in 316 patients with knee or hip pain or evidence of OA on knee or hip radiographs. Body structures and functions were evaluated during clinical and radiological assessments. Illness perceptions and mental health were assessed with the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and the mental component summary score of the RAND 36 -item Health Survey, respectively. For each patient an expected WOMAC function score was calculated, using an equation based on a multivariate model {{of the association of}} body structures and functions with <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> ResultsThe median (interquartile) self-reported WOMAC function score was 22. 2 (9. 6 – 43. 5). Ninety-one patients reported more and 120 patients reported less <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> than expected. Patients with lumbar spine degeneration, physical or exercise therapy and high IPQ-R identity, consequences and chronic timeline scores had an increased risk to report more <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> than the expected range.

DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study with 3 years of follow-up. Measurements were conducted annually. Statistical analyses included t tests, univariate regression analyses, and multivariate regression analyses. SETTING: Rehabilitation centers and hospitals (Departments of Orthopedics, Rheumatology, and Rehabilitation) in The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N= 237) with hip or knee OA. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-perceived change, self-reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and observed <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (timed walking test). Prognostic factors: demographic data, clinical data, body function (pain, muscle strength, range of motion [ROM]), comorbidity, and cognitive functioning (cognitive decline, memory, attention). RESULTS: Self-reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> measured by the WOMAC improved slightly after 3 -year follow-up. In knee OA, reduced ROM at 1 -year follow-up (beta=. 120), increased pain at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 177), and higher morbidity count (beta=-. 180) predicted worsening of self-reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>In</b> hip OA, reduced ROM at 1 -year follow-up (beta=. 201 for hip external rotation and beta=. 144 for knee extension), increased pain at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 134), higher morbidity count (beta=-. 220), or the presence of moderate to severe cardiac disease (beta=-. 214) and poorer cognitive functioning (beta=. 181) predicted worsening of self-reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Performance-based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> measured by the timed walking test did not change after 3 years of follow-up.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Physiotherapy) - MSc(Physio) Stroke is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} {{globally}} and the consequences on human and economic health are of major concern. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine and explore the participation restrictions experienced by stroke patients. The study populations were stroke patients living within the community in Western Cape, South Africa. A mixed methods approach was used to collect data in this study which consisted of two phases. For the first phase, the descriptive, observational cross sectional design was used to determine the participation restrictions of stroke patients living within the community and the factors associated with community with respect to integration. In this phase, an interviewer- administered questionnaire was used to collect data; the instrument for this study is the standard World Health Disability Assessment Schedule 2. 0 (WHODAS 2. 0) for disability assessment which includes the International Classification of Functioning Health and Disability (ICF) concept in disability assessment which has been tested and found to be reliable and valid, to determine various participation restrictions among stroke patients living in the society. While in the second phase of this study, two focus group discussions were conducted at the selected community health centre; these participants were conveniently selected from those who participated in the first phase of the study. This was conducted to retrieve in-depth information on difficulties encountered in participating in daily life situations. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Chi square and Anova t-test was used to determine the association between the demographics statistic and participation restrictions. Alpha level was set at 0. 05. For qualitative findings, audiotaped interviews and note taken were transcribed and translated into English; the expressed ideas were coded and reduced into subthemes, themes and categories. Ethical clearance and permission to conduct study was sought, consents from participants were sought, clearly stating the right to participate and withdraw from the study was respected and anonymity and confidentiality has been ensured. The result of the study showed that participants encountered difficulty with cognition, (23. 3 % of participants reported severe difficulty in learning a new task; 20 % reported severe difficulty analyzing and finding solution to day to day activities), mobility (34 % acknowledged difficulty walking a long distance like one kilometer after stroke), self-care (44 % indicated difficulty staying alone for few days after stroke, while the majority, 61 % complaints of difficulty with getting dressed by self), getting along with people with the majority of the difficulties (36 %) are sexual activities, household activities with major complaints (46. 6 % and 31. 4 %, for severity and exemption respectively) in getting needed household work done, severe difficulty (51. 7 %) reported in relaxation and pleasure after stroke, 50. 8 % been financially restrained after stroke, 40 % with difficulty in joining in the community activities, 39. 2 % severely affected by people perception towards them and 25. 8 % of the participants indicated extreme time spent on health; all difficulties investigated within the society 30 days after the incidence of stroke. However, the result of the qualitative phase reported the participation restrictions experienced by the participants. Difficulty in cognition was reported, which promotes indiscipline among family members. <b>Limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> level such as in mobility (walking for a long distance, standing from a sitting position), in self-care (washing the whole body, eating, staying alone after stroke), in getting along (maintaining friendship, sexual activities), in household activities and work activities was reported. Participants experienced difficulty in joining in community activities, emotional fluctuations, poor perception of attitudes of others after stroke, excessive use of time on health conditions, increased financial impact of health condition and burden impact on family was reported. Environmental barriers such as transportation and toilet facilities were reported.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND), {{which is}} also known as {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes a wide range of symptoms but the evidence base for the effectiveness of the symptomatic treatment therapies is limited. OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews of all symptomatic treatments for MND. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on 15 November 2016 for systematic reviews of symptomatic treatments for MND. We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data. The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, {{but it is not clear}} whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison "usual activities", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with "usual activities" or "usual care" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND. None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas. We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life).

Results: Self-reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were significantly associated with pain, muscle strength knee extension, range of motion (ROM) hip flexion and morbidity count. Performance-based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (timed walking test) were significantly associated with ROM (knee flexion, hip flexion and knee extension), muscle strength hip abduction, pain, cognitive functioning and age. Conclusions: Self-reported <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> hip or knee OA are largely dependent on pain {{and to a lesser extent}} on range of joint motion, muscle strength and comorbidity. Performance-based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> are largely dependent on range of joint motion and muscle strength, and to a lesser extent on pain, cognitive functioning and other factors. These findings point to the role of body functions <b>in</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> OA of the hip or knee. Although less important, comorbidity and cognitive functioning play a role as well. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Method: A {{longitudinal}} {{cohort study}} with 5 years follow-up was conducted. Patients (n = 288) were recruited at rehabilitation centers and hospitals. The main outcome measures were self-reported and performance-based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Prognostic factors were demographic and clinical data, body functions, comorbidity, cognitive functioning, avoidance of activity and social support. Measurements were conducted at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years follow-up. Results: Both {{in patients with}} knee and hip OA, the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remained fairly stable {{over a period of}} 5 years. Avoidance of activity, increased pain, more comorbidity, a higher age, a longer disease duration, a reduced muscle strength and range of joint motion at baseline predicted more future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with knee OA. In patients with hip OA, avoidance of activity, increased pain, more comorbidity, a higher age, a higher educational level and a reduced range of motion at baseline predicted more future <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Conclusions: The course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remains fairly stable over a period of 5 years in elderly patients with hip or knee OA.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the mediating role of reduced muscle {{strength in the}} relationship between avoidance of <b>activity</b> and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: A longitudinal cohort study with 5 years follow-up was conducted. Patients with knee or hip OA (n = 288) were recruited at rehabilitation centers and hospitals. Self-reported and performance based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities,</b> avoidance of activity and muscle strength were assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years follow-up. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analyses were used to evaluate mediation. Results: In patients with knee OA, reduced knee extensor muscle strength mediated the relationship between avoidance of <b>activity</b> and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>In</b> patients with hip OA reduced hip abductor muscle strength mediates the relationship between avoidance of <b>activity</b> and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Conclusion: The results of this longitudinal study support the theory that avoidance of activity leads to deterioration of muscle strength and consequently to more <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with knee and hip OA.

40|$|IntroductionUnderstanding {{longitudinal}} {{relationships among}} multiple chronic conditions, <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> of daily living, and health-related {{quality of life}} is important for identifying potential opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention among older adults. MethodsThis study assessed longitudinal associations between multiple chronic conditions and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> of daily living on health-related quality of life among older adults (22 ̆ 030565 years) from 2004 through 2006, using data from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (N = 27, 334). ResultsUsing a longitudinal path model, we found the numbers of chronic conditions at baseline and 2 -year follow-up were independently associated with more <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> of daily living at 2 -year follow-up. <b>In</b> addition, more <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> of daily living at 2 -year follow-up were associated with worse health-related quality of life during the follow-up time period. The association between multiple chronic conditions and indices of health-related quality of life was mediated by changes <b>in</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> of daily living. ConclusionBoth baseline and new multiple chronic conditions led to worse health <b>in</b> terms of <b>activities</b> of daily living and health-related quality of life and should be considered important outcomes to intervene on for improved long-term health. In addition, public health practitioners should consider addressing classes of multiple chronic conditions by using interventions designed to reduce the emergence of multiple chronic conditions, such as physical <b>activity,</b> reductions <b>in</b> smoking rates, and improved and coordinated access to health care services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether psychological and social factors predict the course of <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> elderly patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, in addition to established somatic and cognitive risk factors. Methods A longitudinal cohort study with a follow-up period of three years was conducted. Patients (N = 237) with hip or knee osteoarthritis were recruited from rehabilitation centers and hospitals. Body functions, comorbidity, cognitive functioning, <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and psychological and social factors (mental health, vitality, pain coping and perceived social support) were assessed. Statistical analyses included univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Psychological and social factors were added to a previously developed model with body functions, comorbidity and cognitive functioning. Results In knee OA, low vitality has a negative impact on the course of self-reported and performance-based <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities,</b> after controlling for somatic and cognitive factors. In hip OA, psychological and social factors had no additional contribution to the model.

40|$|Abstract Background This study aims to {{contribute}} to the knowledge of the influence of comorbidity in OA. The objectives of the study were (i) to describe the prevalence of comorbidity and (ii) to describe the relationship between comorbidity (morbidity count, severity and the presence of specific diseases) and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and pain <b>in</b> elderly patients with knee or hip OA using a comprehensive inventory of comorbidity. Methods A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted, in which 288 elderly patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis were included. Apart from demographic and clinical data, information about comorbidity, <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (WOMAC, SF- 36 and timed walking test) and pain (VAS) was collected by questionnaires and tests. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, multivariate regression techniques, t -tests and one-way ANOVA. Results Almost all patients suffered from at least one comorbid disease, with cardiac diseases, diseases of eye, ear, nose, throat and larynx, other urogenital diseases and endocrine/metabolic diseases being most prevalent. Morbidity count and severity index were associated with more <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and with more pain. The presence of most of the moderate or severe diseases and obesity was associated with <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> or with pain. Conclusion The results of this study emphasize the importance of comorbidity in the rehabilitation of elderly patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Clinical practitioners {{should be aware of the}} relationship of comorbidity with functional problems in OA patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between perceived <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> walking-related daily <b>activities,</b> walking ability (capacity), {{and the amount of}} daily walking (performance) in persons affected by leprosy and to identify their determinants. Design: A cross-sectional study. Subjects: Thirty-nine persons affected by leprosy. Methods: Perceived limitations were assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Schedule 11, domain "getting around". Walking capacity was assessed as covered distance in 6 min. Walking performance was recorded as mean strides/day with the Stepwatch(TM) 3 Activity Monitor. Potential determinants were sensory function, foot deformities, joint mobility, ankle muscle strength and co-morbidity. Results: Perceived <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> walking-related <b>activities</b> were significantly correlated with walking capacity (r=- 0. 47; p < 0. 01) but not with walking performance, although walking capacity significantly correlated with walking performance (r= 0. 38; p < 0. 05). Various foot impairments independently contributed to reduced walking capacity and, to a lower degree, to perceived <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and performance. Conclusion: People affected by leprosy perceive <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> walking-related <b>activities</b> that are determined by a reduced walking ability and the severity of foot impairments. Since perceived <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> walking-related <b>activities</b> were not related to walking performance, perceived limitations are apparently weighted against the individual's need...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} people {{affected by}} leprosy with impairments after completing multidrug therapy for leprosy, {{and to assess}} their <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> conducting daily <b>activities</b> by applying the Screening of Activity Limitation and Safety Awareness (SALSA) scale. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed of all residents of a medium-sized city who were treated for leprosy from 1998 to 2006. A specific questionnaire was applied to obtain general and clinical data and the SALSA scale {{was used to assess}} <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Impairments were assessed using the 'World Health Organization leprosy disability grading system' (WHO-DG). Findings: Of the 335 people affected by leprosy treated in the period, 223 (62. 1 %) were located and interviewed. A total of 51. 6 % were female {{with a mean age of}} 54 years (SD +/- 15. 72) and 67. 9 % had up to 6 years formal education. The borderline form predominated among interviewees (39. 9 %) and 54. 3 % suffer from associated diseases with hypertension (29. 1 %) and diabetes (10. 3 %) being the most common. Pain was reported by 54. 7 % of interviewees. By multiple logistic regression analysis, associations were found between <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and being female (P < 0. 025), family income <= 3 minimum wages (P-value < 0. 003), reports of major lesions (P-value < 0. 004), pain (P-value < 0. 001), associated diseases (P-value < 0. 023) and the WHO-DG (P-value < 0. 001). Disabilities, as identified using the WHO-DG, were less common (32 %) than <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> as evaluated by the SALSA scale (57. 8 %). Conclusion: <b>Limitations</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> proved to be common in people affected by leprosy and were. associated with low income, being female, reported major lesions, disability, disease and pain.
