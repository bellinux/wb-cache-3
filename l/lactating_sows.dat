40|$|BACKGROUND: In rats, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that treatment with activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARalpha) disturbs metabolic adaptations during lactation, which in turn lead to a reduction of milk fat content and gains of litters during the suckling period. It has not yet been investigated whether agonists of PPARalpha are impairing milk production of <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> in a similar manner as in rats. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of treatment with clofibrate, a strong synthetic agonist of PPARalpha, on milk composition and litter gains in <b>lactating</b> <b>sows.</b> RESULTS: Twenty <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet with supplementation of 2 g of clofibrate per kg of diet (clofibrate group). In the clofibrate group, mRNA concentrations of various PPARalpha target genes involved in fatty acid utilization in liver and skeletal muscle were moderately up-regulated. Fat and energy content of the milk and gains of litters during the suckling period were not different between the control group and the clofibrate group. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that treatment with clofibrate induces only a moderate up-regulation of PPARalpha target genes in liver and muscle of <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> and in turn might have limited effect on whole body fatty acid utilization. This may be the reason why clofibrate treatment did not influence milk fat content and gains of litters during the suckling period. Thus, the present study indicates that activation of PPARalpha induced either by native agonists such as dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids or a by negative energy balance might be largely uncritical in <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> with respect to milk production and litter gains in <b>lactating</b> <b>sows...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Lactating</b> <b>sows</b> {{have been}} shown to develop typical signs of an {{inflammatory}} condition in the liver during the transition from pregnancy to lactation. Hepatic inflammation is considered critical due to the induction of an acute phase response and the activation of stress signaling pathways like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), both of which impair animal´s health and performance. Whether ER stress-induced UPR is also activated in the liver of <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> and whether dietary fish oil as a source of anti-inflammatory effects n- 3 PUFA is able to attenuate hepatic inflammation and ER stress-induced UPR in the liver of sows is currently unknown. Based on this, two experiments with <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> were performed. The first experiment revealed that ER stress-induced UPR occurs also in the liver of sows during lactation. This was evident from the up-regulation of a set of genes regulated by the UPR and numerically increased phosphorylation of the ER stress-transducer PERK and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF 2 alpha and IkappaB. The second experiment showed that fish oil inhibits ER stress-induced UPR in the liver of <b>lactating</b> <b>sows.</b> This was demonstrated by decreased mRNA levels of a number of UPR-regulated genes and reduced phosphorylation of PERK and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF 2 alpha and IkappaB in the liver of the fish oil group. The mRNA levels of various nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated genes encoding inflammatory mediators and acute phase proteins in the liver of <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> were also reduced in the fish oil group. In line with this, the plasma levels of acute phase proteins were reduced in the fish oil group, although differences to the control group were not significant.

Forty-eight F₁ crossbred <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> (Large White x Swedish Landrace) were assigned to four treatment on the basis of litter order and weight. During pregnancy all the sows were fed the same diet. They were group fed in indoor concrete pens equipped with self-feeders and automatic waterers.

Both experimental diets were based on corn and soybean meal and were formulated to contain 0. 88 % TID lysine (0. 97 % total lysine). Thus, the TID TSAA:lysine ratios were 50 and 65 % for the two experimental diets, respectively. Both experimental diets contained 0. 37 % L-lysine HCl, with other amino acids (isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) added to ensure that TSAA were the first limiting amino acids. Sows were farrowed in three farrowing groups and were randomly allotted to the dietary treatments on the basis of parity. The <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> fed the 0. 57 % T had greater ADFI than did sows fed the 0. 44 % TSAA diet (P< 0. 05). Sow weight loss was not affected by lactation treatment, but sows fed the diet with more TSAA had greater (P< 0. 02) litter weight gain, heavier (P< 0. 01) litter weaning weights, and heavier (P< 0. 06) individual pig weaning weight than did sows fed the 0. 44 % TSAA diet. These data indicate that the basal diet can be used in future experiments to titrate the TSAA requirement of the sow. Results also indicate that the TID TSAA requirement is greater than 0. 44 % and the TSAA:lysine ratio is greater than 50 % for <b>lactating</b> <b>sows.</b> Because amino acid recommendations from the NRC (1998) suggest that the TID TSAA:lysine ratio is approximately 48 %, more research is warranted to more adequately determine the TID TSAA:lysine ratio for <b>lactating</b> <b>sows...</b>|$|E

Weights of sows post-farrowing and at weaning were lower (P< 0. 03) when predicted with the previous allometric model developed from growing pigs and sows than their actual weights or weights predicted using the lactating sow model. Likewise, absolute residuals for post-farrowing and weaning weights using a previous allometric model developed from growing pigs and gestating sows were greater (P< 0. 02) than those of the lactating sow model. There were no differences (P< 0. 89) between the predicted weights using the lactating sow model and their actual weights.

Experiment 1 established a nutrient database and evaluated the quality and consistency of five ethanol plants in the Western Plains region. Each sample was analyzed for AA, DM, CP, crude fiber, crude fat, ash, NDF, ADF, Ca, P, trace minerals, GE, and starch. In addition, DE, ME, and NE were calculated. Experiments 2 and 3 evaluated the effects of sorghum DDGS on nursery pig performance. In Exp. 2, pigs fed sorghum- or corn-based diets performed similarly; however, as sorghum DDGS increased ADG decreased (linear, P < 0. 01). A DDGS×grain source interaction (quadratic, P = 0. 03) was observed for G:F. In corn-based diets, G:F was identical for pigs fed 0 to 30 % DDGS, but worsened in pigs fed 45 % DDGS. In sorghum-based diets, G:F was best for those fed 0 % DDGS, but worsened at higher levels. In Exp. 3, pigs fed corn- or sorghum-based diets performed similarly; however, pigs fed DDGS gained less (P < 0. 03) than those fed basal diets. Experiment 4 evaluated the effects of sorghum DDGS in sorghum- or corn-based diets on finishing pig growth performance, carcass characteristics, and fat quality. Increasing sorghum DDGS reduced (linear; P < 0. 01) ADG and increased (linear; P < 0. 01) backfat IV. Pigs fed the sorghum-based diet with 30 % sorghum DDGS had decreased backfat IV (P < 0. 01) than those fed the sorghum-based diet with corn DDGS. Experiment 5 evaluated the effects of sorghum DDGS on <b>lactating</b> <b>sow</b> and litter performance. Overall, ADFI increased in corn-based diets when DDGS were added, but decreased in sorghum-based diets resulting in a tendency (P < 0. 08) for a DDGS × grain source interaction. Pig weaning weights were lower (P < 0. 06) for sows fed diets containing DDGS compared with those fed the basal diets. Adding sorghum DDGS reduced pig performance, and sow lactation performance; therefore, its inclusion in swine diets needs to be evaluated on an income over feed cost basis...|$|R

Sixty-two crossbred multiparous sows (LandraceXYorkshire) were used. Thirty-three and twenty-nine sows were studied {{in their second}} parity and third parity respectively. The three dietary treatments were: (1) the control diet containing 15 % CP and 0. 75 % lysine, (2) a diet containing 13 % CP and 0. 75 % lysine (0. 60 % natural+ 0. 15 % synthetic), and (3) a diet containing 13 % CP and 0. 60 % lysine. They were fed twice daily and allowed ad libitum access to food and water throughout a 28 day lactation from parturition until weaning. The results of this experiment showed that body weight and backfat losses of the sows from farrowing to weaning were significantly affected (p< 0. 01) by reducing dietary protein. Neither average daily feed intake nor weaning to estrus interval of sows were significantly different among treatments.

40|$|Piglets {{are born}} with reduced plasma {{concentrations}} of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 -OH-D(3)) and are thus highly predisposed to vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, sow milk contains little vitamin D, and the slow intestinal vitamin D absorption of sows limits the efficacy of dietary vitamin D supplementation. Hence, the neonate depends, to a large extent, on the vitamin D stores built up in fetal tissues from maternal sources. The current study was undertaken to evaluate whether the source and quantity of dietary vitamin D provided to the gestating and <b>lactating</b> <b>sow,</b> and also directly {{in the form of}} creep feed to the piglet, would influence the vitamin D status, growth performance, and skeletal development of piglets. A total of 39 primiparous and multiparous sows were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments (13 in each treatment), supplemented with either 5 or 50 μg of the commonly used cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) or 50 μg of 25 -OH-D(3) per kilogram of feed. By wk 3 of lactation, piglets were offered a creep diet with vitamin D supplementation according to the treatment of the dam, and they were offered the same creep diets after weaning at d 35 of age until they reached a BW of approximately 20 kg. When dietary 25 -OH-D(3) was provided, circulating concentrations of 25 -OH-D(3) in piglet serum increased (P 0. 05) were observed between the 2 other groups. After weaning, ADFI was greater (P < 0. 05) and growth performance tended (P = 0. 08) to improve when doses of 50 μg/kg were administered, regardless of the vitamin D source. In conclusion, supplementation of the diet with 50 μg/kg of either source of vitamin D was proved to be adequate in meeting the needs of gestating sows and in permitting the accumulation of vitamin D in fetal tissues, as well as for normal skeletal mineralization and growth in the offspring. Furthermore, the markedly improved vitamin D status of piglets whose mothers received 25 -OH-D(3) possibly resulted from greater tissue reserves present at birth and a greater availability of vitamin D when released from those stores...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of chelated iron supplementation on gestating and <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> and on their suckling and weaned piglets. Reproductive traits, piglet performance, hematological parameters, and the iron concentrations in colostrum, milk, and stillborn livers were measured. Ninety-six sows were subjected to one of three treatment groups. Group T 1 comprised pregnant and <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> treated with diets supplemented with inorganic iron (551 mg Fe/kg) and suckling piglets administered 200 mg of injectable iron dextran. Group T 2 was the same as T 1, except that sows after 84 days of gestation, <b>lactating</b> <b>sows,</b> and suckling piglets were fed a diet supplemented with 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron, and suckling piglets were administered injectable iron dextran. Group T 3 was the same as T 2 but without injectable iron dextran for suckling piglets. During the nursery phase, all of the weaned piglets were penned with their original groups or treatments and received isonutritive and isocaloric feeds. Piglets from the T 2 and T 3 groups also received an additional 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron via their feed. There were no differences among the treatments for reproductive traits or the iron concentrations in the colostrum, milk, or liver. The piglets that did not receive the injectable iron dextran showed the poorest performance during the pre-and post-weaning phases and showed the poorest hematological parameters of the suckling piglets. The chelated iron supplementation is insufficient to meet piglet demand. The iron dextran supply is necessary for suckling and weaned piglets...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{relationships between}} peripheral progesterone and Insulin-like Growth Factor- 1 (IGF- 1) concentrations {{during the early}} luteal phase in sows. Data were derived from three experiments, one with primiparous weaned sows (n = 21) and two with multiparous sows that either ovulated during lactation (n = 23) or after weaning (n = 12). The sows that ovulated during lactation did so due to an intermittent suckling regime (inhibition of suckling for 12 h each day from day 14 of lactation) or due to treatment with PG 600. IGF- 1 concentrations varied considerably among experiments, and were {{the lowest in the}} multiparous sows, regardless of whether they were weaned or lactating: 68 ± 5 and 85 ± 8 ng/ml in the two experiments with multiparous sows vs 188 ± 15 ng/ml in the primiparous sows. Progesterone concentrations were lowest for the <b>lactating</b> <b>sows.</b> Overall, the increase in progesterone during the early luteal phase was strongly correlated with IGF- 1 concentrations (r = 0. 7). However, the correlation was low in multiparous <b>lactating</b> <b>sows</b> (r = 0. 28; p < 0. 10) and nonsignificant in multiparous weaned sows (r = 0). The weaned multiparous sows had IGF- 1 levels comparable to lactating multiparous sows, but higher progesterone levels. In conclusion, these data show a positive relationship between peripheral IGF- 1 and progesterone concentrations in vivo during the early luteal phase. In <b>lactating</b> <b>sows,</b> IGF- 1 concentrations are probably a limiting factor for progesterone secretion, although other factors may be involve...|$|E

40|$|Maturational {{changes during}} the {{follicular}} {{phase of the}} porcine oestrous cycle were investigated in spontaneously cycling gilts. The results revealed considerable variation in the morphological and biochemical development of dominant follicles in the early follicular phase. This asynchrony was emphasised by the marked differences in follicular fluid steroid concentrations and LH binding to granulose cells and theca tissue between follicles of identical size within the same ovary. The nature of this variation may have great significance on our present understanding of asynchronies in embryo development. On {{the basis of the}} variables assessed in this study, those follicles destined to ovulate or to become atretic were only readily distinguishable on Day 20 of the oestrous cycle, suggesting that the selection of the preovulatory population continues over a 4 day period from about Day 16 to Day 20 of the cycle and, furthermore, that the selection process involves some initial maturation even in those unselected follicles that ultimately join the atretic pool. Leading on from this study, the control of the initiation of follicular development in <b>lactating</b> primiparous <b>sows</b> was examined by assessing the relationships between ovarian activity and circulating hormone levels following manipulation of the suckling stimulus. In the first experiment, piglet suckling behaviour and follicular development were 'investigated following a reduction in litter size to five piglets (split-weaning), seven days before weaning at 21 days post-partum. Overall, morphological and biochemical follicular development were significantly advanced (p < 0. 001) in the treatment sows. The significantly (p < 0. 001) greater concentration of follicular fluid oestradiol in follicles recovered from the split-weaned sows suggested that the supply of androgen substrate was probably limiting production of this steroid in the control animals. It was proposed that the latter was due to inadequate gonadotrophin stimulation. The comparative ethological study revealed that the remaining split-weaned piglets 'multiple-suckled' quarters vacated by their heavier litter mates. Despite a constant suckling frequency, suckling intensity was reduced in the split-weaned litters as evidenced by a regression in mammary tissue growth in the dams. In a subsequent experiment, further manipulation of the suckling stimulus was achieved by physically restricting the number of mammary quarters available to the piglets. Canvas sheeting strapped around the anterior quarters of one group of sows (cover) limited the five piglets remaining after split-weaning to suckle only the posterior quarters. An investigation of circulating hormone levels, 12 hours before and 48 hours after the start of treatment, revealed that, compared to the split-weaned and control sows, LH levels were significantly (p < 0. 001) elevated in the cover sows with a concomitant significant (p < 0. 001) depression in circulating prolactin. Although split-weaning induced a similar endocrine response in several sows, this effect was short-lived and overall, levels of both hormones were similar in the split-weaned group to those recorded in the control sows. The concentration of oxytocin, released at suckling was unaffected by litter size or the intensity of mammary stimulation. Ovarian activity at weaning was significantly enhanced in the cover (p < 0. 001) and split-weaned (p < 0. 001) groups. Hence, it was concluded that the critical factor influencing hormone levels and follicular development in the <b>lactating</b> <b>sow</b> was the neural intensity of the suckling stimulus. The cumulative data of the lactation experiments suggest that in practice, serious consideration should be given to the use of litter size reduction as a means of effectively improving the performance of the primiparous sow and her litter during lactation...|$|R
40|$|Weaning causes {{oxidative}} stress in piglets. Endogenous and exogenous vitamin E (vit E) participates to theneutralization of pro-oxidant molecules in the organism. This study aimed {{to analyze the}} effect of weaning conditions {{on the evolution of}} plasma vitamin E concentration on piglets. In trial A, piglets born from 12 litters were weaned at either 21 (W 21) or 28 (W 28) days of age in optimal (OC) or deteriorated (DC) conditions (n= 16 per group). Piglets from OC group originating from 2 litters were housed by 4 (0. 39 m 2 /pig) in cleaned and disinfected pens. Those from DC group originating from 4 litters were housed by 8 (0. 20 m 2 /pig) in dirty pens after a waiting time of 4 h at 20 °C. From 12 to 61 days of age, blood was collected and pigs were weighed weekly and then at 88, 119 and 147 days of age. In trial B, piglets (n= 288 from 144 sows) from 16 commercial farms were weaned at 28 days of age. Blood samples were collected when piglets were 26 - (on sows and piglets) and 33 -days old (on piglets only). In both trials, weaning led to a dramatic drop of the plasma concentration of vit E (P 0. 05). After weaning, vit E concentration remained stable until 147 days of age. In trial B, piglet plasma concentration of vit E at 26 days of age was not associated with <b>lactating</b> <b>sow</b> vit E concentrations (P> 0. 05) and was different between farms (P< 0. 001). The higher plasma concentration of vit E before weaning could be explained by the high vit E content in colostrum and milk leading to the saturation of body fat reserves of the piglet. At weaning, the high requirements of vit E for antioxidant purposes as well as low feed intake, lower fat content of the feed compared to milk and lower activity of enzymes involved in vit E absorption could explain the dramatic drop of plasma vit E. The relatively low concentrations of vit E until slaughter age could reflect an incomplete reconstitution of body reserves. To conclude, weaning led to a drop of plasma concentration of vit E whatever the weaning conditions indicating dramatic changes in vit E statusand metabolism at weaning...|$|R
40|$|Productivity of sows has {{increased}} worldwide, {{especially during the}} last decade. Sows have been changed genetically to produce larger litters. It was hypothesized that including feed intake or feed efficiency during lactation or both in the breeding objective for dam lines is necessary to facilitate sow’s future increase of unproblematic production of grower-finishers that efficiently convert feed into meat. Increasing feed intake of sows is one solution to prevent excessive mobilization from body stores. As a result of selection for leaner pigs with higher feed efficiency, however, feed intake tends to decrease because high leanness and high feed efficiency are genetically associated with low appetite. There is a risk, therefore, that feed intake during lactation reduces due to selection for lean and efficient finishing pigs. In this thesis a model was developed to estimate the energy efficiency of a <b>lactating</b> <b>sow</b> based on on farm observations enabling large scale data recording. Increasing energy efficiency during lactation might be a solution to overcome the apparent contradiction of the desired direction of selection for feed intake during growing-finishing and lactation. Increased energy efficiency during lactation will yield more milk output given the feed intake and mobilization from body stores. To study the consequences of selection, heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated for fertility, lactation performance and growing-finishing characteristics. For growing-finishing characteristics the genetic models contained social interactions and for lactation feed intake, environmental sensitivity was studied as well. The main conclusion of a simulation of a breeding program in pigs was {{that it is possible}} to achieve a balanced genetic progress in fertility, lactation performance and growing-finishing characteristics. Genetic regulation of feed intake during growing-finishing is to a large extend different from genetic regulation of feed intake during lactation. Results of this thesis show that feed intake of sows during lactation is not an immediate risk for further improvement of more and heavier piglets. Higher piglet production is still on its way via the genetic pipeline and will continue to increase by selection for more and heavier piglets. Selection for increased milk production or litter weight gain is preferred; this will lead to increased protein and energy demands as well. At all events, sows need to eat more and be more efficient at the same time to keep up with this increased demand. It is a question of tuning the breeding objective in order to optimize the relation between feed intake and body weight losses during lactation.  ...|$|R
