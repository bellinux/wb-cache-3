40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} voltage changes on beam patterns of low-beam headlamps. Seven different types of filament <b>lamps</b> were <b>tested.</b> The voltages used were 12. 0, 12. 8 and 13. 5 V. The photometry was performed from 20 ° left to 20 ° right, and from 5 ° down to 5 ° up, all in steps of 0. 5 °. The main {{finding of this study}} is that, for all seven <b>lamps</b> <b>tested,</b> voltage changes between 12. 0 V and 13. 5 V caused light output to change by the same proportion throughout the beam pattern. Therefore, for filament lamps, it is reasonable to use a single constant for all values in a beam pattern when converting a headlighting specification at one voltage to a specification at a different voltage, at least if the voltages in question are between 12. 0 V and 13. 5 V. The constants obtained across the seven <b>lamps</b> <b>tested</b> were similar to each other.

50|$|In 2009, Natural Resources Canada {{released}} a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. The report states that at 3 cm distance, the recommended daily exposure to ultraviolet radiation for skin and eye damage (if looking directly at the lamp) was attained between 50 minutes and 5 hours {{depending on the type}} of lamp. The report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. The report also states that most bare-spiral <b>lamps</b> <b>tested</b> gave off more UV than the 60 watt incandescent <b>lamp</b> <b>tested,</b> but that the encapsulated (double envelope) CFLs emitted less UV radiation. At 30 cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 Watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. The report states that the threshold limit values used represent otherwise healthy individuals who are not experiencing any hypersensitivity conditions or exposed to substances that increase UV sensitivity. Outdoor sunlight can supply the maximum recommended daily UV exposure in 20 to 100 minutes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Entamoeba histolytica, the causative {{agent for}} {{amoebiasis}} {{is a considerable}} burden to population in the developing countries where it accounts for over 50 million infections. The tools for detection of amoebiasis are inadequate and diagnosis relies on microscopy which means a significant percent of cases remain undiagnosed. Moreover, tests formats that can be rapidly applied in rural endemic areas are not available. Methods: In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal test (LAMP) based on 18 S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was designed with extra reaction accelerating primers (stem primers) and compared with the published LAMP and PCR tests in detection of E. histolytica DNA in clinical samples. Results: The stem <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> indicated shorter time to results by an average 11 min and analytical sensitivity of 10 − 7 (30 pg/ml) compared to the standard LAMP and PCR which showed sensitivities levels of 10 − 5 (3 ng/ml) and 10 − 4 (30 ng/ml) respectively using tenfold serial dilution of DNA. In the analysis of clinical specimens positive for Entamoeba spp. trophozoites and cysts using microscopy, the stem <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> detected E. histolytica DNA in 36 / 126, standard <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> 20 / 126 and PCR 17 / 126 cases respectively.

40|$|Haemophilus parasuis is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} Glässer’s disease, which is characterised by ﬁbrinous polyserositis, meningitis and polyarthritis, causing severe economic losses to the swine industry. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal ampliﬁcation (<b>LAMP)</b> <b>test</b> {{was developed to}} improve the speciﬁcity, facility and speed of diagnosis of H. parasuis isolates. The LAMP assay rapidly ampliﬁed the target gene within 50 min incubation at 63 °C in a laboratory water bath. The LAMP amplicon could be visualised directly in the reaction tubes following the addition of SYBR Green I dye. The detection limit of this LAMP method was 10 CFU/mL, which was 10 times more sensitive than the earlier 16 S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test conducted by Oliveira, Galina and Pijoan (2001), and no cross-reactivity was observed from other non- H. parasuis strains. This <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> was evaluated further on 187 clinical specimens from pigs suspected of being infected with H. parasuis.

40|$|Control {{of human}} African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is {{dependent}} on accurate {{diagnosis and treatment of}} infected patients. However, sensitivities of tests in routine use are unsatisfactory, due to the characteristically low parasitaemias in naturally infected individuals. We have identified a conserved sequence in the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) of the sub-genus Trypanozoon and used it to design primers for a highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (<b>LAMP)</b> <b>test.</b> The test was used to analyse Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples from HAT patients. The RIME LAMP assay was performed at 62 °C using real-time PCR and a water bath. DNA amplification was detectable within 25 min. All positive samples detected by gel electrophoresis or in real-time using SYTO- 9 fluorescence dye could also be detected visually by addition of SYBR Green I to the product. The amplicon was unequivocally confirmed through restriction enzyme NdeI digestion, analysis of melt curves and sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the RIME LAMP assay was equivalent to 0. 001 trypanosomes/ml while that of classical PCR tests ranged from 0. 1 to 1000 trypanosomes/ml. LAMP detected all 75 Trypanozoon isolates while TBR 1 and two primers (specific for sub-genus Trypanozoon) showed a sensitivity of 86. 9 %. The SRA gene PCR detected 21 out of 40 Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates while Trypanosoma gambiense-specific glycoprotein primers (TgsGP) detected 11 out of 13 T. b. gambiense isolates. Using clinical samples, the <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> detected parasite DNA in 18 out of 20 samples which included using supernatant prepared from boiled blood, CSF and direct native serum. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the LAMP assay coupled with the ability to detect the results visually without the need for sophisticated equipment indicate that the technique has strong potential for detection of HAT in clinical settings.

Heat lamps with the same power output do not necessarily produce the same temperature profiles on the heated surface because {{the shape of the}} temperature profiles was shown to be greatly affected by the lamp lens prescription. At a lamp height of 45. 7 cm (18 in.), the net usable area (NUA) for the piglets was 0. 102, 0. 155, 0. 146, 0. 275, 0. 139 and 0. 113 m 2 (1. 10, 1. 67, 1. 57, 2. 96, 1. 50, and 1. 22 ft 2), respectively, for 100 W Retrolite (100 CZ 20), 125 W Hogslat (125 HOG), 125 W SLI Lighting (125 SLI), 175 W Retrolite (175 CZ 20), 175 W Phillips (175 PLP), and 250 W SLI Lighting (250 SLI). The 175 CZ 20 had the largest NUA and was the most efficient lamp on the basis of NUA per rated Watt. Although the 250 SLI had the largest lamp heated area, it and the 175 PLP were the least efficient lamps due to the large hotspots they produced. Lamp height affects the size of heated area, hotspot area and NUA for most of the <b>lamps</b> <b>tested.</b> These results suggest that in a commercial swine farrowing system, the 175 CZ 20 has the most potential among the incandescent heat <b>lamps</b> <b>tested</b> for meeting the thermal needs of the piglets and improving energy efficiency of the localized supplemental heating...|$|R

In the present study, a <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> was designed from the serum resistance-associated (SRA) gene of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, {{the cause of the}} acute form of African sleeping sickness, and used to detect parasite DNA from processed and heat-treated infected blood samples. The SRA gene is specific to T. b. rhodesiense and has been shown to confer resistance to lysis by normal human serum. The assay was performed at 62 °C for 1 h, using six primers that recognised eight targets. The template was varying concentrations of trypanosome DNA and supernatant from heat-treated infected blood samples. The resulting amplicons were detected using SYTO- 9 fluorescence dye in a real-time thermocycler, visual observation after the addition of SYBR Green I, and gel electrophoresis. DNA amplification was detected within 35 min. The SRA <b>LAMP</b> <b>test</b> had an unequivocal detection limit of one pg of purified DNA (equivalent to 10 trypanosomes/ml) and 0. 1 pg (1 trypanosome/ml) using heat-treated buffy coat, while the detection limit for conventional SRA PCR was ∼ 1, 000 trypanosomes/ml. The expected LAMP amplicon was confirmed through restriction enzyme RsaI digestion, identical melt curves, and sequence analysis. The reproducibility of the SRA LAMP assay using water bath and heat-processed template, and the ease in results readout show great potential for the diagnosis of T. b. rhodesiense in endemic regions...|$|E
