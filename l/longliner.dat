They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of fish. Decked areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 metres deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{population}} structure, reproductive biology, age and growth, {{and diet}} of shortfin makos caught by pelagic <b>longliners</b> (2005 – 10) and bather protection nets (1978 – 2010) in the south-west Indian Ocean were investigated. Themean fork length (FL) of makos measured by observers on <b>longliners</b> targeting tuna, swordfish and sharks was similar, and decreased {{from east to}} west, with the smallest individuals occurring near the Agulhas Bank edge, June to November. Nearly all makos caught by <b>longliners</b> were immature, with equal sex ratio. Makos caught by bather protection nets were significantly larger, males weremore frequent, and 93 %ofmales and 55 %of females weremature. Agewas assessed from band counts of sectioned vertebrae, and a von Bertalanffy growthmodel fitted to sex-pooled length-at-age data predicted a birth size (L 0) of 90 cm, maximum FL (LN) of 285 cm and growth coefficient (k) of 0. 113 y 1. Males matured at 190 cm FL, aged 7 years, and females at 250 cm, aged 15 years. Litter sizes ranged from nine to 14 pups, {{and the presence of}} gravid females in bather protection nets suggested that some pupping occurred in shelf waters. Teleosts (mainly Trachurus capensis) occurred in 84 % of stomachs collected on <b>longliners,</b> whereas elasmobranchs (63. 5 %) were most common in samples collected from bather protection nets, followed by teleosts (43. 1 %) and cephalopods (36. 5 %).

5000|$|According to Ramsay, {{shark finning}} in Costa Rica is [...] "A multi-billion dollar industry, {{completely}} unregulated. We traced {{some of the}} biggest culprits to Costa Rica.

[...] In response to poor incomes and pressure, local fisherman are forced into harvesting shark fins, despite only getting about one dollar per pound on an average, {{less than a third of}} its total retail value. [...] Corrupt politicians are silenced with a fee to ignore government regulations. The practice involves sharks being caught by a horizontal drag line with many baited hooks, known as longline fishing. According to biologist Jorge Ballestero of the Costa Rican Sea Turtle Restoration Project (Pretoma) “Costa Rica has become intricately linked to this trade for two reasons: It has the biggest <b>longliner</b> fleet in the hemisphere, and it allows international vessels dedicated to the exploitation and trade of shark fins to land here.” ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Longliners</b> – use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built <b>longliners</b> can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale <b>longliners</b> handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|R
25|$|Wet-fish <b>longliners</b> – {{keep the}} caught {{fish in the}} hold in the fresh/wet condition. The fish is stored in boxes and covered with ice, or stored with ice in the fish hold. The fishing time of such vessels is limited, so they operate close to the landing place.|$|R
50|$|In some {{unstable}} fisheries, {{such as the}} Patagonian toothfish, fishermen may {{be limited}} to as few as 25 hooks per line.
