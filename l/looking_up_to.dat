25|$|The Elect in Paradise {{shows the}} elect in ecstasy <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> music-making angels. The few extant drawings, made in {{preparation}} for this fresco, are kept in the Uffizi in Florence. They show each figure in various positions, indicating that Signorelli must have used real models in the nude to portray his figures.|$|E
25|$|Aaron, {{the brother}} of Moses, is on the first icon {{on the right side}} of the tier. He {{represented}} the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Israelites. In his right hand he holds a crosier decorated with flowers, and a thurible in his left. The next image depicts Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, with a fleece. In the Old Testament, an angel appeared to Gideon, telling him that he would save his tribe from the invading Midianites. Gideon asked for proof of God's message; he laid a fleece of wool on the ground and asked the Lord to make the fleece wet and keep the ground dry by next morning, if the victory were to be his. Next morning the fleece was wet and the ground was dry; Gideon demanded a second test in which the fleece should remain dry while dew covered the rest of the ground and this also happened. Later this narrative was understood as a reference to Jesus' birth. In these explanations the fleece stood for Mary, and the dew signified Christ. King Solomon is portrayed on the next icon. He was the son of King David, and he holds an image signifying the First Temple of Jerusalem. The Old Testament credits Solomon with its completion. Another unidentified icon stands close to Solomon's painting. The aged man reaching for the sky is probably Jeremiah, son of a landowner. In the Bible Jeremiah was chosen to prophesy God's anger at the Israelites who worshiped idols. He had to prepare his people for the fall of Jerusalem and for being enslaved. Knowing the fate of his tribe he is usually depicted as an old, worn man <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the skies, praying for God's forgiveness. The next icon shows a traditional depiction of Isaiah, in which an angel touches his lips. According to the iconographical traditions the angel fills Isaiah's lips with fire to preach his prophecies without fear. In another interpretation the fire refers to the Book of Isaiah, in which he mentions the burning anger of God. The last icon on the Prophets tier depicts a young man wearing a turban. It is the last uncertain icon in the row, probably portraying Habakkuk. He holds a package containing the stew he took for Daniel when he was in the lion's den with the help of an angel.|$|E
500|$|New {{character}} Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) {{prepares for}} a book club meeting in a modern suburban home. The club is in a heated discussion of Stephen King's Carrie, when they are interrupted by what sounds like an earthquake. The group leaves Juliet's house and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), previously known as [...] "Henry Gale" [...] to the survivors, appears along with Ethan Rom (William Mapother), <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> watch Oceanic Flight 815 break apart in mid-air. Ben quickly orders Goodwin (Brett Cullen) and Ethan to join the survivors, stay undercover, and provide [...] "lists in three days." [...] The camera zooms out to reveal that the suburb is actually on the Island and is inhabited by The Others, while in the background the smoke trail of the midsection and tail section of Flight 815 can be seen.|$|E

500|$|Above {{these rooms}} {{was the great}} chamber, the main room which formed the {{ceremonial}} centre of the house. In the north wing was the brewhouse and the parlour, with two chambers above them, the latter possibly used by Dorothy Wynn as her bedroom. The private bedrooms for the family and guests were each equipped with a fireplace, an important status symbol in the period. The roof attics of the house contained {{a great deal of}} space for accommodating the household servants. The attic above the great chamber has a grand timber roof with arch-braced collar trusses, joined using an unusual system called [...] "double pegging", which is only used in the Conwy valley during the late 16th century. It appears that the great chamber's ceiling was originally supposed to be open, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the timbers with the trusses visible, but a mistake {{in the construction of the}} walls meant that one side of the chamber no longer fitted smoothly with the timbers, creating an ugly appearance; a plaster ceiling was then added to hide the error.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2004, Murphy {{married his}} long-time girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, an artist {{whom he had}} met in 1996 {{at one of his}} rock band's shows. The couple live in Ireland with their two sons. Murphy often works in or near the city and has {{expressed}} no desire to move to Hollywood. He prefers not to speak about his personal life and did not appear on any live TV chat shows until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland's RTÉ to promote Perrier's Bounty yet still remained reserved. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience [...] "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome". He intentionally practices a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: [...] "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk". Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Liam Neeson, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the latter like a [...] "surrogate movie dad". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.|$|E
500|$|Various {{scenes in}} Hot Fuzz feature {{a variety of}} action film DVDs such as [...] and scenes from Point Break and Bad Boys II. Wright {{revealed}} {{that he had to}} get permission from every actor in each video clip, including stunt men, to use the clips and {{for the use of the}} DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios. The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said, [...] "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into people's heads... It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face." [...] Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof, in that [...] "They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] The film also includes various references to The Wicker Man, in which Edward Woodward had played a policeman tough on law and order.|$|E

Today, Bowen is estranged from his parents and several relatives, instead <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his childhood friend Quinn Crozier and to Robert and Sandra Thrash, a Los Angeles couple whom he regards as his adoptive parents. In 2004, Bowen married Yardley Barbon, a Miami native of Cuban descent, and the couple had two sons, Ojani (born September 7, 2005) and Ozmel (born June 9, 2007). The two divorced in 2012.

He is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys and the University of Texas at Austin Longhorns football team. He runs the Bruce Bowen Foundation, an organization set up to provide scholarships and bursaries. In 2006, he received a college degree in communications from Cal State Fullerton; he had also taken classes at the University of Texas at San Antonio. He has stated that he wants to become a teacher. In 2011, Bowen was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was hired as the color analyst for the Los Angeles Clippers.|$|E
500|$|Homer takes Bart's sons to a {{cryonics}} {{facility where}} Grampa has been frozen alive {{to prevent a}} disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them [...] in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well. Meanwhile, Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia's private world. Entering it, Lisa is overjoyed to find that Zia has hung a poster of her next {{to a series of}} posters depicting historical women who have made a difference in the world. When Zia arrives, Lisa thanks her for <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her and the two reconcile at last, and secretly hides her life as a party poser. With the conflicts resolved, Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo. Marge arrives with Maggie, who has given birth to a baby girl. The Simpsons gather into a group just as the family pets (who have evolved greatly over the past thirty years) take the new photo.|$|E
500|$|Born {{and raised}} by his single mother in Southern Houston, Texas, Lecrae moved often early in life, living in San Diego, Denver, and Dallas. He has stated {{that he would go}} to church with his Christian grandmother, but {{considered}} it for [...] "older people" [...] and said it [...] "wasn't for me." [...] Lecrae never met his father, who ended up becoming a drug addict. In the song [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", Lecrae reveals that when he was almost eight, a female baby sitter sexually molested him, an incident which Lecrae believes distorted his view of sexuality, influencing his later promiscuous lifestyle. Experiencing abuse and neglect during his childhood, Lecrae used his ability to rap as a source of significance. According to Lecrae, his grandmother would not allow him to watch rap music videos on television, but he would sneak in late at night. It was in these videos that Lecrae found individuals to look up to. Lecrae states that [...] "there were no Martin Luther Kings or Malcolm Xs, they had all passed away so I had Tupac." [...] After being shown a gun by his uncle, Lecrae began <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> gangsters and turned to a life of crime. Lecrae remembers taking a BB gun and standing in the street pointing it to a car, frightening the female driver, simply for fun. At 11 years old, he started writing music for a rhythm and blues group formed by some neighbors. His first track, written for a neighborhood crush, emulated the style of Tupac, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest. At the age of 16, he started taking drugs, fighting, was arrested in high school for stealing, and eventually ended up on a gang list. Lecrae tried [...] "pretty much every drug there was to try" [...] except for heroin and crack cocaine.|$|E

2500|$|Ringwald {{has stated}} {{that she was very}} aware of her public image during her teen years and that she tried to be a good role model for her fans. When asked about For Keeps (1988), Ringwald said, [...] "I didn't want to give the wrong message to teenagers. I sort of felt a certain {{responsibility}} – I mean, I was a very, very famous teenager and I thought a lot of teenagers were <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and emulating me, and I really didn't want to make a movie that said in any way that having a baby at that age was going to be easy."

2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, we closed ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell on his heels and he remained there, his head uncovered, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the sky. The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could be heard over the stamping of feet. [...] Forward! cried a soldier. So we all marched forward, moving faster and faster in our race towards the abyss.|$|E
2500|$|Demetriade {{continued}} to play the unconventional poet, well-integrated in {{the atmosphere of the}} era's literary cafes. He embraced the peculiar lifestyle of literary bohemia. Writing in 1902, Macedonski described him as a [...] "jester" [...] who could prove himself [...] "bitter", also noting that Demetriade's day started [...] "at 3 o'clock in the afternoon". Such depictions were puzzling for the reading public, who wondered whether Macedonski was not in fact mocking his disciple. However, Demetriade remained among the most loyal Macedonskians, to 1904 and beyond. The younger Symbolist Mihail Cruceanu, who met Demetriade in Macedonski's salon in 1905, recalls him as a [...] "Mefisto", who readily imparted his erotic escapades with the Literatorul crowd. He notes: [...] "We the young ones we were <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him with much curiosity and sympathy, as he appeared to us as an elegant and fortunate satyr whose astuteness we could never match. But seeing as we were fatigued by the stories' emotionalism, we left for home at midnight, leaving him alone with his complete menu, to consume till dawn. Or so they tell me, since I, the aspiring poet, always went to bed before that time." ...|$|E
