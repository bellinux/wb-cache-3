5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing {{a significant percentage of}} the provincial highway network.|$|E
5|$|Budgetary {{restraints}} in the 1990s {{forced the}} provincial government to sell off or download many highways to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> or, {{in the case of}} Highway407, to a private consortium.|$|E

40|$|Government in America {{has gone}} through three {{distinct}} fiscal systems {{in the last two}} hundred years. Each system utilized a dominant revenue source, and had a distinctly active <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> The changing structure <b>of</b> <b>government</b> by <b>level</b> seems to be related to changing revenue structures. When new taxes become important, the relative importance <b>of</b> each <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> changes. On the other hand, growth in the overall size <b>of</b> <b>government</b> is not directly related to the structure of revenues or the distribution <b>of</b> activity by <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> Government growth is the result of long term commitments to provide education, transportation, social welfare services, old age security, and military forces. ...|$|R

5|$|The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is {{the highest}} internal-control {{institution}} of the Communist Party of China (CPC), tasked with enforcing internal rules and regulations and combating corruption and malfeasance in the Party.

5|$|The highway {{remained}} unchanged {{for over three}} decades, {{with the exception of}} a Connecting Link agreement established between the MTO and the City of Barrie. However, during the late 1990s, the MTO transferred many highways to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> as a cost-cutting measure.

5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> and the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E

On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive {{under the direction of the}} National Anti-Corruption Observatory. There are several high corruption risk areas in Cameroon, for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} NY360 was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June20.

Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November26, 2007.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY394 was {{extended}} northwestward to Barcelona, overlapping NY17.

On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY394 from Westfield to Barcelona was transferred from Chautauqua County to New York State {{as part of a}} highway maintenance swap between the two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|NY177 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally extended from US11 in Adams Center to NY12 west of the village of Lowville. When the portion of I-81 near Adams Center was completed in the late 1950s, NY177 was extended westward over a county-maintained highway to meet the new expressway at exit42. On August1, 1979, ownership and maintenance of NY177 between I-81 and US11 was transferred from Jefferson County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

5|$|NY195 {{remained}} unchanged up to April10, 1980, when the designation was officially {{removed from the}} route.
