40|$|This paper {{explores the}} uses and abuses of relying upon <b>legislative</b> <b>fact</b> {{evidence}} to prove a violation of a claimant’s constitutional rights. The Supreme Court of Canada has stated that, in the criminal law context, an accused is entitled to challenge a law that violates the constitutional rights of third parties but that applies in a constitutionally sound manner {{with respect to the}} accused. This principle spawned the conventional wisdom that in order to obtain a declaration that a statute is invalid, a litigant must present voluminous <b>legislative</b> <b>fact</b> evidence to demonstrate that the statute unjustifiably limits rights of third parties. However, the Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford stated that proof that a law violates a single individual’s Charter rights could be sufficient for the law to violate a constitutional norm. This paper discusses how the conventional wisdom that constitutional challenges should be supported by an array of <b>legislative</b> <b>fact</b> evidence might be displaced by the Court’s decision in Bedford. It also discusses the rationale and political viability of invalidating a law when the evidence shows that the law is “substantially constitutional and peripherally problematic”...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to show that rules of {{evidence}} are often unworkable in s.   1  Canadian Charter cases. A survey reveals that courts tend to use these rules selectively when a party attempts to demonstrably justify a reasonable limit to a guaranteed right or freedom. A parallel is made with the Supreme Court of Canada's flexibility in admitting extrinsic material in constitutional references. American law is useful in that it establishes the key distinction between adjudicative <b>facts</b> and <b>legislative</b> <b>facts.</b> Rules of evidence apply only to the former category. <b>Legislative</b> <b>facts</b> correspond to facts needed for a s. 1 demonstration. It should be recognized in Canada that rules of evidence are inapplicable to such facts because of the specific purpose and importance of judicial reasoning in Charter cases...|$|R
40|$|Law making {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} important function of the higher courts in civil law matters. This observation leads {{to the question of}} whether the law making function is nevertheless carried out in a “classical” legal-principled way or whether the courts increasingly employ a political-formative style. To answer this question, one should not only focus on the content of the courts’ reasoning but also on their procedural-institutional framework. From that perspective, the processing of so-called <b>legislative</b> <b>facts</b> is a key issue in determining the role of courts between legal reasoning and social engineering.

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{question}} of how much appellate deference is due to “legislative” facts, or broad social facts about the world, established by the district courts.

In the vast literature on the subject, a fundamental point has received scant attention. In the recent rulings that have stoked the present controversy, the Supreme Court has employed foreign law not as law, but rather merely as evidence of a <b>legislative</b> <b>fact</b> made relevant by domestic constitutional law. Commentators, however, have largely directed {{their attention to the}} merits of a genuine constitutional comparativism in which foreign law serves {{as a model for the}} creation of domestic constitutional doctrine. Many commentators have advocated just such an approach, and at least one sitting Justice has joined in this chorus in both extrajudicial commentary and in a dissenting opinion. But to date, the Court has yet to take this much-mooted step, perhaps due to an awareness of the complex theoretical challenges such an approach would raise.

40|$|This essay reviews David L. Faigman’s Constitutional Fictions: A Unified Theory of Constitutional Facts (Oxford U. P. 2008). Constitutional Fictions is {{a highly}} {{original}} book that promises to (and should) have {{an enormous impact on}} both constitutional law scholarship and practice. The book focuses on the methods, or lack thereof, that the Court employs in receiving evidence and resolving disagreements about questions of fact in constitutional cases. In doing so, the book does the legal profession an invaluable service by identifying and articulating the many frequently unspoken questions that arise in the context of judicial consideration and resolution of legislative facts in constitutional cases. The book also documents the largely unremarked ubiquity of these questions, the wide variety of circumstances in which they occur, and the depth of the theoretical issues they implicate. Professor Faigman accomplishes all this in crisp, lucid, and admirably concise prose. Nor could Professor Faigman’s book be more timely. Several of the Roberts Court’s most salient and controversial constitutional decisions have turned on questions of <b>legislative</b> <b>fact.</b> Constitutional Fictions treats an important topic with impressive insight. But it will not be the last word on the subject. When Constitutional Fictions finally comes round to normative and prescriptive analysis of the status quo, Faigman shies away from the broader implications of his critique. After reviewing Professor Faigman’s arguments, this review essay explores how alternative analyses might compel more sweeping changes than he suggests...|$|E
40|$|The United States 2 ̆ 7 {{commitment}} to adversarial justice is {{a defining feature of}} its legal system. Standing doctrine, for example, {{is supposed to}} ensure that courts can rely on adverse parties to present the facts courts need to resolve disputes. Although the U. S. legal system generally lives up to this adversarial ideal, it sometimes does not. Appellate courts often look outside the record the parties developed before the trial court, turning instead to their own independent research and to factual claims in amicus briefs. This deviation from the adversarial process is an important respect in which the nation 2 ̆ 7 s adversarial commitment is more myth than reality. This myth is problematic for many reasons, including the fact that it obscures the extent to which some of the most significant cases the Supreme Court decides, such as Citizens United v. FEC, rely upon 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 that have not been subjected to rigorous adversarial testing. The adversarial myth exists because the U. S. legal system 2 ̆ 7 s current procedures were designed to address adjudicative facts-facts particularly within the legislative facts-more general facts {{about the state of the}} world. Recognizing knowledge of the parties-but many cases turn instead on this distinction between adjudicative and legislative facts helps identify those cases in which existing practices undermine, rather than promote, adversarial justice. This Article concludes with suggestions for reform, including liberalizing standing doctrine when legislative facts are at issue. If courts are going to turn to nonparties for help in resolving disputes of <b>legislative</b> <b>fact,</b> it is better that they be brought into the process earlier so the factual claims they offer can be rigorously tested...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A., History) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. This thesis {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the activities of the radical Los Angeles anti-interventionist group the Friends of Progress (FOP) during the 1940 s. This group, while advocating non-intervention, also sympathized with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and aggressively attacked the Roosevelt administration. Embracing the belief that sinister international forces were poised to destroy the American way of life, the FOP adopted fascist propaganda to facilitate their campaign to inform and arouse the American public. Their use of Nazi propaganda before and during World War II signified not only the influence of Hitler and Nazism but also the prevalence of conspiratorial politics in Californian society. The same climate of paranoia that influenced the FOP also infused the efforts by state and federal officials to eradicate radical wartime dissent and un-Americanism. A byproduct of southern California???s radical politics of the 1930 s, the influence of radical Right movements is critical to understanding California???s radical wartime dissent???and its suppression???at the onset of World War II. A number of historians have addressed the volatile nature of radical politics during the tumultuous 1930 s; however, many analyses either emphasize the re-emergence of the Left in U. S. politics or the larger radical Right organizations such as the German American Bund, Father Charles Coughlin???s Union for Social Justice, or Huey Long???s Share the Wealth movement. Less known are the smaller groups, like the FOP, that arose after the eradication of larger radical movements {{at the hands of the}} federal government. Additionally, the onset of World War II often serves as a demarcation line separating the political unrest of the Great Depression from the unifying experience of World War II. This work emphasizes southern California???s radicalism of the 1930 s and its continuing influence on California radicalism at the onset of World War II. This thesis draws primarily on legislative records from the California Department of Justice, in particular the records of the Attorney General, and California Appellate Court Third District records housed at the California State Archives. These records provided an uncontested framework for establishing events chronologically and conceptualizing details underpinning key aspects in the trial. Also important was the report of the California Joint <b>Legislative</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Committee from 1943, which chronicled California???s investigations into subversive activities using the testimonies of Committee investigators, investigators from public organizations and suspected subversives. Other primary resources included contemporary accounts and political tracts, as well as articles from the Los Angeles Times and Time magazine. Finally, secondary accounts also informed my analysis, with a reliance on the work of Richard Hofstadter, Carey McWilliams, Kevin Starr, and David M. Kennedy. The analysis of the Friends of Progress uncovered not simply a radical Right group ultimately indicted and convicted of subversion under California law at the onset of World War II. Rather, the FOP also exemplified the continuity between southern California???s radical Right movements of the 1930 s and their continuation in the form of smaller anti-war organizations as the U. S. entered World War II. The association of radical Right groups with extremism, anti-Semitism, and Nazism fed the ongoing perception of Fifth Column infiltration and fueled California???s anti-subversion efforts during World War II.

40|$|With {{three decades}} of {{jurisprudence}} to Canada’s account, the authors consider the common law doctrine of stare decisis in Charter litigation. They ask whether, notwithstanding prior higher court authority on the issue, a trial court that is satisfied {{that there has been}} a significant and material change in social and <b>legislative</b> <b>facts</b> should conduct Charter analysis anew on the record before it, in light of the role played by such facts in section 1 analysis in particular. They conclude that the constitutional imperative imposed by section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 obliges a trial court satisfied of such a change to distinguish a prior Charter decision and subject the law to a section 1 analysis unencumbered by precedent to determine whether the law in question remains constitutional. The authors offer the view that doctrinal, institutional and remedial considerations all support an approach whereby the trial court would conduct a full section 1 analysis, leaving the appellate courts to fulfil their traditional function of reviewing both the trial court’s finding {{that there has been a}} significant and material change in <b>legislative</b> and social <b>facts,</b> and its section 1 analysis...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the implications of the}} U. S. Supreme Court's 2011 ruling in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association for the future use of social science evidence and communication research to supply <b>legislative</b> <b>facts</b> supporting laws that target harms allegedly caused by media artifacts. The Brown majority set the bar for the relevance of social science evidence exceedingly high - perhaps too high, the article suggests - while Justice Stephen Breyer, in contrast, adopted a much more deferential approach in a dissent that embraced the evidence proffered by California. The article also reveals an apparent inconsistency in Justice Antonin Scalia's approach to social evidence when comparing his majority opinion in Brown against his opinion just two years earlier in Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations, Inc. Ultimately, the article asserts that communication scientists hoping to influence both legislative bodies and jurists should view Brown as a wake-up call to do two things: 1) educate lawmakers and jurists about whether and when social science research can adequately resolve complex questions about media-caused harms; and 2) jettison research that lacks real-world generalizability and legal relevance...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutionality}} of federal legislation sometimes {{turns on the}} presence and sufficiency of congressional findings of predicate facts, such as the effects of conduct on interstate commerce, state discrimination justifying the abrogation of sovereign immunity, or market failures justifying intrusions on free speech. Sometimes a congressional committee makes these findings in legislative history. Other times, Congress recites its findings in a statutory preamble, thus enacting its findings as law. Surprisingly, the Supreme Court has not distinguished between enacted and unenacted findings in deciding how much deference to accord congressional findings. This is striking because the difference between enactedness and unenactedness is so vigorously contested on questions of statutory interpretation, with textualists objecting to any reliance on legislative history and even purposivists conceding some risks. Both formal and functional considerations suggest that the enactedness line should be significant for constitutional questions as well. This is not because Congress has some comparative advantage in finding <b>legislative</b> <b>facts</b> more reliably than other governmental institutions, which is pervasively assumed but unrealistic. Rather, Congress 2 ̆ 7 s strongest claim for judicial deference is that legislative findings are highly normative and hence squarely within the legislative power.

40|$|In this Article, {{we argue}} that the U. S. Supreme Court should route most Federal Rules of Civil Procedure issues through the notice-and-comment {{rulemaking}} process of the Civil Rules Advisory Committee instead of issuing judgments in adjudications, unless the Court can resolve the case solely through the deployment of traditional tools of statutory interpretation. While {{we are not the}} first to express a preference for rulemaking on civil procedure issues, we advance the position in four significant ways. First, {{we argue that}} the Supreme Court in the civil procedure arena is vested with powers analogous to most administrative agencies. Second, building upon this insight, we present a justification for favoring rulemakings over adjudications by analogy to administrative law. Third, we couple this preference for rulemaking over adjudication with three criteria detailing when this presumption should apply. Namely, we conclude that civil procedure issues are better resolved by reference to the Advisory Committee if the issue (a) requires an interpretation of a rule that rests substantially upon <b>legislative</b> <b>facts,</b> (b) calls for the resolution of a Chevron step-two-like ambiguity, or (c) seeks a resolution that approximates a legislative rule. Only when traditional tools of statutory interpretation—text, history, and purpose—will resolve a case should the Court retain its disposition in the adjudicatory form. Fourth, we offer the mechanisms for pragmatically achieving this preference for rulemaking both under existing law as well as through a new “referencing” procedure, without unduly constraining the flexibility needed by lower courts to implement the civil rules effectively. In so doing, we contend that expanding the Court’s use of rulemaking not only should result in better rules but should also bolster the democratic legitimacy of the Court’s civil-rules decisionmaking...|$|R
40|$|A panel, at the National Lawyers Convention, {{discussed}} procedure as {{it relates}} to First Amendment rights. The panel set forth how First Amendment procedures have historically protected First Amendment substance and discussed modern applications of the issue. For example, the prior restraint doctrine, overbreadth doctrine, the allocation of the burden of proof and relaxation of ripeness rules have important implications for challenging restrictions on speech and defending against libel and defamation. The interaction of free speech and due process is often seen in litigation involving civil harassment orders, or civil protection orders. In many jurisidictions the definition of harassment permits the finding that harassment can be based solely on speech, meaning speech itself can provide a basis for liabilty. In addition, speech may be restricted as a remedy in litigation addressing harassment. Investigations of wrongdoing in the realm of campaign finance law and political speech cases can also have serious implications for speech, both reputational and legal. Further cases involving political speech and campaign finance once exclusively litigated in the civil arena, are now the subject of criminal investigations and prosecutions. This is particularly problematic where many issues in this area remain unsettled. Good lawyering is particularly important in First Amendment cases. Ineffective assistance of counsel can be considered as great an evil in First Amendment cases as in criminal cases. Unfortunately, practicing lawyers often do not understand the process by which constitutional facts are pleaded and proved in First Amendment cases and this problem begins with the way Constitutional Law 101 is taught in law schools. In proving facts in First Amendment litigation the question becomes how does the government prove its justification of a restriction on speech or how does one opposing the government’s restriction on speech respond when the government asserts certain interests as being their justification. In First Amendment litigation the government often relies on <b>legislative</b> <b>facts</b> – newspaper reports, television stories, and criminal cases discussed in the media, arguably the government should be obligated to present more than rumors and speculation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Following the June 2012 European Council {{decision}} {{to place the}} ‘Single Supervisory Mechanism’ (SSM) within the European Central Bank, the general presumption in the policy discussions has been {{that there should be}} ‘Chinese walls’ between the supervisory and monetary policy arms of the ECB. The current <b>legislative</b> proposal, in <b>fact,</b> is explicit on this account. On the contrary, however, this paper finds that {{there is no need to}} impose a strict separation between these two functions. The authors argue, in fact, that a strict separation of supervision and monetary policy is not even desirable during a financial crisis when the systemic stability of the financial system represents the biggest threat to a monetary policy that aims at price stability. In their view, the key problem hampering the ECB today is that it lacks detailed information on the state of health of the banking system, which is often highly confidential. Chinese walls would not solve this problem. Moreover, in light of the fact that the new, proposed Supervisory Board will be composed to a large extent of representatives of the same institutions that also dominate the Governing Council, the paper finds that it does not make sense to have Chinese walls between two boards with largely overlapping memberships. In addition, it recommends that some members of the Supervisory Boards should be “independents” in order to reduce the tendency of supervisors to unduly delay the recognition of losses...|$|R
40|$|When {{we started}} {{the work on the}} EU {{directives}} and their impact on Cultural heritage, we had a very simple solution in mind. This solution had the working title “The Directive of general exemption for cultural heritage”. As we started unravelling the extent of the problem and the legal basis for the EU directives we found that such a directive was not feasible. The cultural sector is subject to the principle of subsidiarity. The question of subsidiarity is the question of what decisions belong at EU level and which decisions belong at the national level. In short this subsidiarity defines culture and cultural heritage laws and regulations as a national prerogative; not part of the EU competencies or <b>legislative</b> system. This <b>fact</b> is elaborated in the article in “ 2. 1. Some elements of the EU treaty whith relevance to cultural heritage and EU Directives”. Cultural policies and therefore cultural heritage {{is not part of the}} EU Treaty and cannot, therefore, be regulated through a Directive. Therefore a Directive of general exemption for cultural heritage would have no legal basis in the EU Treaty. The conflicts ensuing from the implementation of the EU Directives, on one hand, and sound heritage conservation practice, on the other hand, takes place at national, rather than at EU or international level. The conflict stems from EU Directives from policy areas that are within the EU competencies; such as international trade competition, personal and public health, safety, and conservation of the natural environment.

Stations be-came free to jump wavelengths, and many did. Within seven months, some 200 new stations emerged. The resulting chaos demanded a remedy. In November 1926, the Chicago Tribune’s WGN obtained a court injunction against an interloper, protect-ing its use of a frequency under common law. But neither policymakers nor the large commercial stations saw this as the preferred solution. In December 1926, Congress passed a statute requiring all broadcasters to waive any vested rights in frequencies, and in February 1927 the Radio Act established the Federal Radio Commission. Evolving into the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, the agency would administratively determine what use could be made of airwaves according to “public interest, convenience, or necessity”—a standard put forward by the fledgling National Association of Broadcasters (Dill, 1938). The 1927 legislation represented a bargain between policymakers, who ob-tained influence over programming (including such regulations as the “equal time rule ” and, later, the “fairness doctrine”), and radio station owners, who enjoyed rent protection via regulatory barriers to entry (Hazlett 1990, 1997, 2001 a). Con-sumers were not well-represented in this <b>legislative</b> bargain: in <b>fact,</b> one of the first actions taken by the Federal Radio Commission was to reject an expansion of th...|$|R
5000|$|In 1951 Iturmendi was {{nominated}} Minister of Justice. By {{that time the}} regime had already mitigated its terror, with capital punishments and executions becoming an exception rather than a rule; the basic Francoist legislation had already been in place. Iturmendi focused on regulations which stabilised the system further on: finetuning of the Civil Code, Ley de Jurisdicción Contencioso-Administrativa, Ley de Sociedales de Responsabilidad Limitada, Ley de Expropriación Forzosa, Ley de Venta de Bienes and Ley de Adopción (which acknowledged women's family rights). He endorsed the foral tradition of Álava and Navarre (though not this of Biscay and Gipuzkoa), developing legal infrastructure for semi-autonomous governance, a compromise between foralist recommendations of the Congreso Nacional de Derecho Civil in Zaragoza in 1946 and Franco's own preference for centralism and his animosity to the Basque and Catalan aspirations. In 1956 the syndicalist hardliners produced the last serious attempt to convert the regime into a fully totalitarian system; José Arrese drafted the law which would dramatically increase the powers of Falange. Iturmendi sided with the army, the Church and particularly the monarchists; as a Traditionalist he believed that a monarch {{should be free to}} appoint any government he deems proper. He wrote a few notes to Franco arguing against the proposal and stating that [...] "the state should represent all Spaniards, even those not affiliated to the Movement"; he also denounced features resembling Soviet-style regimes like these of the USSR, Poland, Yugoslavia or China. Iturmendi countered Arrese with his own set of <b>legislative</b> proposals, in <b>fact</b> drafted by López Rodó. The climax led to the cabinet reshuffle, sidetracking of Arrese, adoption of a vague Ley de Principios del Movimiento Nacional (1958) and ultimately the power shifting to the technocrats.|$|R
