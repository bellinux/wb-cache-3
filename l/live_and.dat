5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for Saturday Night <b>Live,</b> <b>and</b> that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown.

5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice <b>live</b> <b>and</b> {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} case for {{including}} losses of foreign (non-U.

The inclusion of losses of such foreign <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> settlements in cost benefit analysis (CBA) could have large implications not only for U.

This Article discusses internet-based surveys that are a first step toward filling the empirical void in the literature regarding the measurement of U.
