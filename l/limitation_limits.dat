40|$|Recent {{earthquakes}} {{have confirmed}} {{the role played}} by infills in the seismic response of reinforced concrete buildings. The control and limitation of damage to such nonstructural elements is a key issue in performance-based earthquake engineering. The present work is focused on modeling and analysis of damage to infill panels, and, in particular, it is aimed towards linear analysis procedures for assessing the damage <b>limitation</b> <b>limit</b> state of infilled reinforced concrete frames. First, code provisions on infill modeling and acceptance criteria at the damage <b>limitation</b> <b>limit</b> state are reviewed. Literature contributions on damage to unreinforced masonry infill panels and corresponding displacement capacity are reported and discussed. Two procedures are then proposed aiming at a twofold goal: (i) the determination of 'equivalent' interstory drift ratio limits for a bare frame model and (ii) the estimation of the stiffness of equivalent struts representing infill walls in a linear model. These two quantities are determined such that a linear model ensures a reliable estimation of seismic capacity at the damage <b>limitation</b> <b>limit</b> state, providing the same intensity level as that obtained from nonlinear analyses carried out on structural models with infills. Finally, the proposed procedures are applied to four-story and eight-story case study-infilled frames, designed for seismic loads according to current technical codes. The results of these application examples are presented and discussed...|$|R

The review used these findings to inform the development of an exercise warm-up program. However, the validity of the findings is limited, as the review had several methodological limitations [22]. Notably, the literature search was inadequately reported, narrow search terms were used, only one database was searched, there were no clear eligibility criteria for study selection, and the risk of bias of included trials was not assessed [22, 23].

Methods A total of 50 prepubertal subjects (25 children with SP and 25 healthy control subjects) were studied. The effects of stress were studied by comparing cortisol responses to a psychosocial stressor, consisting of a public speaking task. Results Children with SP showed an elevated cortisol response to the psychosocial stressor as compared with healthy controls. Trait but not state anxiety levels are associated with higher HPA axis activity. <b>Limitations</b> <b>Limited</b> sample size.

40|$|Abstract: Effective {{pain relief}} is an {{essential}} component of a patientâ€™s peri-operative care package. Good analgesia has been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, respiratory and thrombo-embolic complications following surgery. Satisfactory analgesia facilitates early patient ambulation following surgery, which may reduce in-patient stay. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems are a well established standard therapy for acute post-operative pain; however some practical <b>limitations</b> <b>limit</b> their clinical utility. The fentanyl inotophoretic transdermal system (ITS) is a novel self-contained needle-free PCA device, which delivers boluses of fentanyl transdermally. This system has been shown to provide analgesia equivalent to conventional PCA modalities, with unique design features that may confer advantages to patients and staff, including facilitating patient mobilization in the post-operative phase. This review will discuss the technology of iontophoretic systems, the pharmacology of transdermal fentanyl delivery, and some practical implications of the fentanyl ITS...|$|R
