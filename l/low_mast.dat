40|$|BACKGROUND: Number of {{intratumoral}} {{mast cells}} predicts survival in various cancers. The prognostic significance of such mast cells in surgically treated prostate cancer is unknown. METHODS: Mast cell densities were determined in prostate cancer samples {{of more than}} 2, 300 hormone-naïve patients using a tissue microarray format in correlation with clinical follow-up data. Mast cells were visualized immunohistochemically (c-kit). All patients were homogeneously treated by radical prostatectomy at a single institution. RESULTS: Mast cells were present in 95. 9 % of the tumor samples. Median mast cell number on the tissue spot was 9 (range: 0 - 90; median density: 31 mast cells/mm(2)). High mast cell densities {{were significantly associated with}} more favorable tumors having lower preoperative prostate-specific antigen (P = 0. 0021), Gleason score (P < 0. 0001) and tumor stage (P < 0. 0001) than tumors with <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> cell densities. Prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival significantly (P = 0. 0001) decreased with decline of mast cell density showing poorest outcome for patients without intratumoral mast cells. In multivariate analysis mast cell density narrowly missed to add independent prognostic information (P = 0. 0815) for prostate-specific antigen recurrence. CONCLUSION: High intratumoral mast cell density is associated with favorable tumor characteristics and good prognosis in prostate cancer. This finding is consistent with a role of mast cells in the immunological host-defense reaction on prostate cancer. Triggering mast cell activity might expand immunotherapeutic strategies in prostate cancer...|$|E

There is {{a direct}} {{correlation}} between dermal mast cell prevalence in dorsal skin of different mouse strains and susceptibility to UVB-induced systemic immunosuppression; highly UV-susceptible C 57 BL/ 6 mice have a high dermal mast cell prevalence while BALB/c mice, which require considerable UV radiation for 50 % immunosuppression, have a <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> cell prevalence. There is also a functional link between the prevalence of dermal mast cells and susceptibility to UVB- and cis-urocanic acid (UCA) -induced systemic immunosuppression. Mast cell-depleted mice are unresponsive to UVB or cis-UCA for systemic immunosuppression unless they are previously reconstituted at the irradiated or cis-UCA-administered site with bone marrow-derived mast cell precursors. cis-UCA does not stimulate mast cell degranulation directly. Instead, in support of studies showing that neither UVB nor cis-UCA was immunosuppressive in capsaicin-treated, neuropeptide-depleted mice, cis-UCA-stimulated neuropeptide release from sensory c-fibers which, in turn, could efficiently degranulate mast cells. Studies in mice suggested that histamine, and not tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), was the product from mast cells that stimulated downstream immunosuppression. Histamine receptor antagonists reduced by approximately 60 % UVB and cis-UCA-induced systemic immunosuppression. Indomethacin administration to mice had a similar effect which was not cumulative with the histamine receptor antagonists. Histamine can stimulate keratinocyte prostanoid production. We propose that both histamine and prostaglandin E(2) are important in downstream immunosuppression; both are regulatory molecules supporting the development of T helper 2 cells and reduced expression of type 1 immune responses such as a contact hypersensitivity reaction.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} clinical {{or biological}} associations between mast cell density, blood clotting, angiogenesis, and survival {{of patients with}} advanced ovarian cancer. Methods. Tumor tissue sections were assessed for mast cell density by staining for mast cell tryptase, blood clotting by staining of thrombosed blood vessels, and angiogenesis by CD 34 expression. Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazard statistical analyses were used. Results. 44 women with stage III-IV ovarian cancers had tumor blocks available for immunohistochemical analysis. Higher mean vessel density (MVD) (> 11 vessels/ 400 x field) predicted for better survival than lower MVD (<= 11 vessels/ 400 x field) (P = 0. 004). Women whose tumors had low levels of peri-tumoral mast cell infiltration had a mean survival of 40. 6 months compared to 50. 6 months in those whose tumors had high levels (P = 0. 47). Tumors with higher MVD and high peri-tumoral mast cell infiltration had a mean survival of 80. 3 months compared to 37. 8 months in those with <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> cell density or low MVD (P = 0. 015). Patients with tumors showing a low degree of blood clotting had a mean survival of 45. 5 compared to 45. 1 months in those with tumors showing {{a high degree of}} blood clotting (P = 0. 91). There was no significant association between angiogenesis and mast cell density (P = 0. 123). In multivariate analysis, higher MVD remained as a significant prognostic factor for improved survival after adjusting for clotting and mast cell density. Conclusions. Our data suggest that peri-tumoral mast cell infiltration in tumors with high MVD predicts for improved survival in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to gather species-specific data on mast-cell density and {{distribution}} in camel small intestine under different fixation conditions and to elucidate the presence and cross-reactivity of tryptase in the camel small intestine using human specific anti-tryptase antibody. Tissue specimens from the jejunum, duodenum, and ileum were obtained from 9 healthy, 9 - 12 months old, male camels. Specimens were fixed either with carnoy’s fluid or formalinbuffered solution and stained with either methylene blue or immunohistochemically to identify mast cells. The present study demonstrated for the first time, the presence and cross-reactivity of tryptase in the camel small intestine using a specific mouse anti-human tryptase antibody. Mast cells were detected in all histological layers of the camel small intestine (mucosal, submucosal, muscularis externa and serosa). Among all locations examined in the duodenum, ileum and jejunum, no significant difference was observed in mast-cell counts among the lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, muscularis externa and the serosa.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} sources of auxiliary propulsion for merchant ships is wind assisted propulsion by means of a kite to provide a force to the vessel. A dynamically flown kite can generate up to 25 times the force of a static aerofoil or kite of the same planform area. A kite attached to a relatively <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> also generates a much smaller heeling moment than a conventional sailing rig and occupies much less deck area – making it suitable as a retro-fit also. Advances in control technology allow a kite to be flown dynamically with minimal (or ideally no) crew intervention. The intention {{of this study is to}} quantify the benefits in reduced fuel consumption and balance these against the potential safety risks in order to determine the feasibility of kiteassisted propulsion of merchant ships. The potential environmental benefits are assessed in terms of energy savings and CO 2 reductions. In order to simulate correctly the forces provided by a kite to the ship, a model of the dynamically flown kite is required. The assumptions and performance of a model of kite dynamics are presented and validated through comparison to experimental data. This model is integrated with a hydrodynamic model of the ship to determine a drift angle and consequent resistance increase together with the thrust required from the propeller in this (off design) condition. Using realistic engine performance data the power required by the propeller and fuel consumption in the ‘kite flying’ mode are determined. This model of the integrated kite/ship/propeller/engine system is applied in a case study to a small merchant vessel. Overall fuel-savings are investigated for a trans Pacific route. A formal safety assessment is carried out to identify hazards and possible mitigation strategies to address key hazards are discussed. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) {{seeds and}} oak (Quercus spp.) acorns are both {{important}} fall food sources {{for a variety}} of wildlife in the Sierra Nevada, but both have variable mast production and are in decline. Sugar pines are in decline due to white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) infection and oaks are in decline due to fire exclusion and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) predation. To examine how a change in availability of seed and acorn crops from these trees could have a cascading effect on associated wildlife, we studied their relationship to black bear (Ursus americanus) fall ranges in Sequoia National Park, California. The distribution of seed-bearing sugar pines overlaps with the bears&# 8217; summer range, whereas acorn-bearing oaks occur at lower elevations. We used GPS collars and field observations to collect location data on ten wild, adult, female bears during the summer and fall of both 2005 and 2006, and then compared these data on habitat use with the Park&# 8217;s vegetation map of available habitat. 				 				 					 						Results 					Our results indicate that the inter-annual variability in the availability of these natural foods is closely related to the seasonal ranges of black bears. In the fall of 2005, when blue and black oak acorns were scarce but other acorns were abundant, bears remained within their summer ranges to feed on sugar pine seeds. In the fall of 2006, when blue oak acorns were abundant, bears shifted out of their summer ranges to feed on acorns and forego sugar pine seeds, even though the seeds were more abundant than in 2005. Incidents between humans and black bears were highest in 2006 while bears were moving between their summer ranges and the oak belt. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					In the fall, black bears make heavy use of both sugar pines and oaks. Although they prefer acorns to sugar pine seeds, the loss of either food source would lead to an increased dependence on the other. When both are unavailable due to continued decline or simultaneously <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> crops, an increase in human-bear incidents is likely...|$|E

As assessed by morphometric analysis of Carnoy's solution-fixed, methylene blue-stained tissue sections, the density of mast cells in the stomach mucosa, stomach submucosa, and spleen of +/+ mice reached maximal levels by 8 weeks of age, whereas the density of mast cells in the skin, extraparenchymal airway walls, and lung parenchyma did not reach maximal levels until 18 weeks of age. When 8 -week-old W/Wv mice were infused with 2 × 107 bone marrow cells from +/+ mice, mast cells appeared in the stomach mucosa and submucosa after 2. 5 weeks, in the spleen and extraparenchymal airway walls after 5 weeks, and in the lung parenchyma after 10 weeks. Twenty weeks after bone marrow infusion, the mast cell densities in the spleen, stomach mucosa, and stomach submucosa were seven-, 13 -, and five-fold greater, respectively, than those in age-matched +/+ mice, but were eight-, two-, and five-fold lower in the skin, extraparenchymal airway walls, and lung parenchyma, respectively. Thus, those tissues that in +/+ mice reached maximal mast cell densities earlier exhibited abnormally high mast cell densities in BM→W/Wv mice, and those that reached maximal mast cell densities later in +/+ mice had abnormally <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> cell densities in BM→W/Wv mice.

Groups were euthanatized at 3, 6, 9, or 12 weeks, when tissues were fixed and secretions were collected for culture and antibody analysis. Immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to a soluble lipophosphoglycan (LPG) –containing surface antigen (TF 1. 17) demonstrated antigen uptake by uterine epithelial cells. Lymphoid nodules were detected below antigen-positive epithelium. Little IgG 2 antibody was detected but IgG 1, IgA, IgM, and IgE T. foetus–specific antibodies increased in uterine secretions at weeks 6 and 9 after infection. This was inversely proportional to subepithelial mast cells numbers and most animals cleared the infection by the sampling time after the <b>lowest</b> <b>mast</b> cell count. Furthermore, soluble antigen was found in uterine epithelium above inductive sites (lymphoid nodules). Cross-linking of IgE on mast cells by antigen and perhaps LPG triggering appears to have resulted in degranulation.

40|$|Background: Neo-angiogenesis is an {{essential}} process in physiological and pathological conditions. However, it is a complex process. Several studies demonstrated that intra-tumoural microvessel number is {{a significant predictor of}} metastasis and clinical outcome in many tumours, including oral malignancies. The immuno-surveillance cells, mast cells and eosinophils are implicated in the biological behaviour of tumours. Nevertheless, their function in tissues is uncertain. Mast cells are involved in homeostatic regulation of blood vessels as well as host defence. In some malignancies, high mast cell density has been found to correlate with favourable prognosis. However, others reported unfavourable associations. Tumour associated tissue eosinophilia is a well-known phenomena. It has been associated with good and poor prognosis. However, the role of eosinophils in tumours remains controversial. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} investigate the prognostic value of microvessel, mast cell and eosinophil densities in the context of clinico-pathological parameters and survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Materials and Methods: Anti-CD 105 and anti-tryptase monoclonal antibodies were utilized to highlight and count microvessels and mast cells respectively in 81 cases of tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Eosinophils were demonstrated using carbol chromotrope histochemical stain. The densities were counted per mm 2 and correlated with patients’ outcome and other clinico-pathological parameters using non-parametric tests and student’s t-test. Clinically, the cases were divided into 4 main groups depending on survival time, lymph-node or distant metastasis. Results: The 5 year survival was significantly lower in patients with a <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> cell density than those with a high density (p= 0. 006, Kruskal-Wallis test). The survival group-A demonstrated significantly higher mast cell and microvessel numbers than group-D (p= 0. 007, student’s t-test) respectively. Patients with well- differentiated squamous cell carcinoma had significantly higher numbers of mast cells when compared to patients with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (p< 0. 05, student’s t-test). The lymph node involvement correlation between the survival group-A and survival group-D was also significant (p= 0. 001, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusion: Data from this study indicates that accumulating mast cells in tumours play a part in inhibiting tumour progression and is potentially angiogenic in tumours...|$|E
40|$|Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) are a flightless, nocturnal parrot {{endemic to}} New Zealand. Thought to be extinct within their natural range, kakapo are {{currently}} listed as nationally critical. The current population of 86 individuals is {{managed by the}} Department of Conservation’s National Kakapo Team on two offshore islands in southern New Zealand, with all females of breeding age on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou). Kakapo only breed once every two to five years, coinciding with the mast fruiting of specific plant species. On Codfish Island, the proportion of adult female kakapo that breed in rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) fruiting years {{is dependent on the}} quantity of fruit produced, with fewer females attempting to breed during <b>low</b> <b>mast</b> years. The purpose of this research is to investigate why only some adult female kakapo breed in low rimu fruiting years on Codfish Island, specifically assessing if foraging home range size and/or habitat selection influence breeding. A total of 506 location points were collected at night for 18 adult female kakapo between March and May 2006. These were used to estimate foraging home ranges and to assess if kakapo select for particular types of vegetation. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used to determine the relative importance of habitat variables in the distribution of female kakapo and to predict areas of suitable breeding habitat when rimu fruit is limited. The breeding success of individuals in 2005, a low rimu mast year, was used to identify if differences in home ranges or habitat selection occurred between breeding and non-breeding females. The large variation in foraging home range sizes recorded in this research was consistent with previous studies. Foraging home range sizes were on average twice the size for breeders than for non-breeders, suggesting that adult female kakapo may be limited in their ability to breed {{by the size of the}} area they occupy. Adult female kakapo did not randomly use vegetation on Codfish Island as some vegetation types were not used, while others were common inside foraging home ranges. Adult female kakapo utilise a broad niche and are capable of surviving in a wide range of habitats. However, breeding females were more specialised in their niche requirements than non-breeders, with breeders utilising areas with higher abundances of mature rimu trees. Females occurred in high elevation, flat areas of the island but this may have been because this is where appropriate vegetation types occurred. During low rimu mast years, breeding adult females were predicted to occupy habitat in high elevation, plateau areas with a high abundance of rimu. Areas identified as sub-optimal habitat for breeding included the coastal areas, the lower elevation area of the main valley and some ridgelines. The home ranges of all 10 breeding females contained some optimal habitat, while females who did not breed were more likely to be located in sub-optimal habitat. Although there were significant areas of optimal breeding habitat not occupied by adult female kakapo, other kakapo may have been present in these areas. To increase the proportion of females that breed in low rimu mast years, it may be necessary to remove sub-adult females or surplus adult males living in optimal breeding habitat from the island. Alternatively, females in sub-optimal breeding habitat could be fed supplementary foods or transferred to other islands where there is unoccupied suitable breeding habitat available...|$|E

Therefore, {{we need a}} better knowledge of regeneration patterns and processes (seed production and dispersal, regeneration niche) of such rear-edge stands to assist their long-term conservation. Seed rain patterns were studied in two structurally contrasting sites: an even-aged pure stand (Las Eras) and an uneven-aged mixed silver fir-beech (Fagus sylvatica) stand (Gamueta) over 8 and 12. years, respectively. Seed production experienced a greater synchrony in years of high seed production than when crops were <b>low,</b> suggesting <b>masting</b> behavior in both sites. Seed inverse modeling methods resulted in dispersal curves differing between sites, with estimates of mean dispersal distances of 9. 9 and 21. 5. m for the pure and mixed stands, respectively.

The most detailed illustrations are to be found on the 'ship fresco' at Akrotiri on the island of Thera (Santorini) preserved by the ash fall from the volcanic eruption which destroyed the town there.|$|R
40|$|Muciii {{attention}} has been given to the possible relationship between mast cells and tumours, and several investigators have studied the occurrence and distribution of mast cells in and around various human tumours. Staemmler (1921) observed them in many cases of mostly epithehal benign and mahgnant tumours, and Cornil and AEchon (1924) in two out of six cases of Von Reckhnghausen's neurofibromatosis. <b>Low</b> numbers of <b>mast</b> cells have been observed by Higuchi (I 930) in fibroadenomas as weR as in breast carcinomas; on the other hand they were found in large numbers on the border line between non neoplastic tissue and carcinoma. Similarly Janes and McDonald (1 948) observed them only occasionally {{at the edge of a}} carcinomatous tissue, and yet in greater numbers in the normal tissues surrounding the frankly neoplastic lesion. Mast cells were also frequently seen in the periphery of gastric carcinomas by Corbetta (1951). Bruni and Ofivi (1951) found fewer mast cells in tumours of the parotid gland than in the corresponding normal glandular tissue. In a study carried out by Bozzo (1953) on several cases of uterine myomas, great numbers of mast cells were found to b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different concentrations of mast cell chymase on the transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 /Smad signaling pathway in skin fibroblasts. Cultured skin fibroblasts were treated with various concentrations of chymase for different time periods. A 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to assess the rate of cell proliferation. In addition, protein expression in the fibroblasts was measured using western blot analysis. Chymase was shown to enhance the proliferation of skin fibroblasts following incubation for 48, 72 and 96 h (P< 0. 01). Furthermore, high concentrations of mast cell chymase were shown to enhance the mRNA and protein expression levels of TGF-β 1 after long‑term (≥ 6 h) incubation. In addition, high concentrations of mast cell chymase increased P-Smad 2 / 3 and Smad 2 / 3 protein expression. By contrast, <b>low</b> concentrations of <b>mast</b> cell chymase increased Smad 7 protein expression. Therefore, the results demonstrated that high concentrations of mast cell chymase facilitated the transduc-tion of the TGF-β 1 /Smad signaling pathway in skin fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|Mice (BALB/c) {{exposed to}} picryl {{chloride}} (PiCl) on their shaved abdomen and untreated animals were after 7 days exposed to daily aerosolized trinitrophenylated dog serum albumin (TNP-DSA). Mice exposed to PiCl tended to respond earlier and more strongly with both delayed hypersensitivity (DH) and IgG antibodies in serum and bronchial washings than did mice exposed to aerosol only. Picryl chloride sensitization resulted in spontaneously proliferating {{axillary lymph node}} cells, {{which could not be}} further stimulated with antigen or mitogen. Histological examination of lung tissue of aerosol-sensitized animals revealed an increase in mononuclear cells and mast cells around bronchioli and mucous cells, particularly in those animals exposed for prolonged periods and sensitized with PiCl prior to aerosol. Sensitization of mice with aerosolized TNP-DSA administrated in two 2 - and 1 -week periods with a 4 -week interval responded with DH and IgG antibody in a dose dependent fashion irrespective of presensitization with PiCl. In bronchial washings IgG antibodies were found particularly after two 2 -week periods of exposure. The cells taken from the axillary or brachial lymph nodes showed spontaneous proliferation. Culture of the cells to achieve mast cell maturation resulted in no or very <b>low</b> numbers of <b>mast</b> cells in the lymph nodes...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{interleukin}} (IL) - 17 {{in cancer}} remains controversial. In {{view of the}} growing interest in the targeting of IL- 17, knowing its cellular sources and clinical implications is crucial. In the present study, we unraveled the phenotype of IL- 17 expressing cells in cervical cancer using immunohistochemical double and immunofluorescent triple stainings. In the tumor stroma, IL- 17 {{was found to be}} predominantly expressed by neutrophils (66 %), mast cells (23 %), and innate lymphoid cells (8 %). Remarkably, T-helper 17 (Th 17) cells were a minor IL- 17 expressing population (4 %). A similar distribution was observed in the tumor epithelium. The Th 17 and granulocyte fractions were confirmed in head and neck, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, breast, lung, and colon carcinoma. An above median number of total IL- 17 expressing cells was an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-specific survival in early stage disease (p = 0. 016). While a high number of neutrophils showed at trend toward poor survival, the <b>lowest</b> quartile of <b>mast</b> cells correlated with poor survival (p = 0. 011). IL- 17 expressing cells and neutrophils were also correlated with the absence of vaso-invasion (p < 0. 01). IL- 17 was found to increase cell growth or tightness of cervical cancer cell lines, which may be a mechanism for tumorigenesis in early stage disease. These data suggest that IL- 17, primarily expressed by neutrophils, predominantly promotes tumor growth, correlated with poor prognosis in early stage disease. Strikingly, a high number of Th 17 cells was an independent prognostic factor for improved survival (p = 0. 026), suggesting Th 17 cells are part of a tumor suppressing immune response...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma and allergy {{and the failure}} of host defence in patients suffering from secondary airway infections are still largely unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether the presence of allergic rhinitis or susceptibility to recurrent sinusitis affects the structural and cellular changes in nasal mucosa during natural colds and convalescence. We compared the mucosal changes in biopsy samples during acute natural colds (days 2 – 4 of illness) and convalescence (3 weeks later) in patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 9), patients with susceptibility to sinusitis (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 20). We saw similarly increased numbers of mucosal T and B lymphocytes and mast cells and increased vascular density during the acute colds compared to convalescence in all the three groups. The allergic subjects had elevated levels of eosinophils in the acute phase (P = 0 · 03), and the allergic and sinusitis-prone subjects had elevated levels of epithelial T cells (P = 0 · 04) and <b>low</b> levels of <b>mast</b> cells (P = 0 · 005) in convalescence compared to the control group. The sinusitis-prone subjects lacked intraepithelial cytotoxic cells in convalescence. In the allergic subjects, the reticular basement membrane was thicker in the acute phase compared to the convalescence (P = 0 · 05). These results suggest that various cells of the airways, including inflammatory and structural cells, are involved during viral respiratory infections in subjects with allergic rhinitis. The small numbers of mast cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes in the sinusitis-prone subjects may be related to their susceptibility to bacterial complications...|$|R
