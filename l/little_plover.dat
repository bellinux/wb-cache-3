One <b>little</b> <b>plover</b> {{is the object}} of my firm adherence. [...] I pass his nest every day, and if you saw how he files by me, and almost into my face, crying and flapping his wings, to direct my attention from his little treasure, you would have as kind a heart to him as I. To-day I saw him not, although I took my usual way; and I am afraid that some person has abused his simple wiliness and harried (as we say in Scotland) the nest. I feel much righteous indignation against such imaginary aggressor. However, one must not be too chary of the lower forms. To-day I sat down on a tree- stump at the skirt of a little strip of planting, and thoughtlessly began to dig out the touchwood with an end of twig. I found I had carried ruin, death, and universal consternation into a little community of ants; and this set me a-thinking of how close we are environed with frail lives, so that we can do nothing without spreading havoc over all manner of perishable homes and interests and affections; and so on to my favourite mood of an holy terror for all action and all inaction equally - a sort of shuddering revulsion from the necessary responsibilities of life. We must not be too scrupulous of others, or we shall die. Conscientiousness is a sort of moral opium; an excitant in small doses, perhaps, but at bottom a strong narcotic.|$|E

40|$|Groundwater pumping is {{substantially}} impacting streamflows and water levels in lakes and wetlands {{in parts of}} Wisconsin. This issue differs from the large regional drawdown issues {{in the northeast and}} southeast, where water level declines are mainly in the confined or semi-confined systems not well connected to surface waters. The problem has been well documented in the central sands region of the state (parts of Portage, Waushara, Waupaca, Adams, and Marquette Counties), where 20 % of the stateâ€™s groundwater is pumped from over 3000 high capacity wells, dominantly for irrigation (Buchwald 2009). Dozens of lakes and potentially hundreds of stream miles may be affected. Some lakes have completely dried, most notably Long Lake near Plainfield. Others have suffered varying degrees of ecological impacts. Recreation has been impaired, for instance, in Portage County where the county swimming beach at Wolf Lake has been closed for about 8 years. The <b>Little</b> <b>Plover</b> River, a Class I trout stream and Exceptional Resource Water in Portage County, dried in parts during 2005 - 2009. Statistical approaches and groundwater flow modeling indicate that area streams and lakes would have had continuous and healthy flows and water levels in the absence of groundwater pumping in the area.

40|$|Capsule <b>Little</b> Ringed <b>Plovers</b> {{breeding}} in South Sweden migrate {{towards the}} southeast in the autumn, via the Middle East, to winter in Saharan and sub-Saharan locations or in India, while the spring migration is more directly towards the north. Aims To study the migration routes and wintering area of <b>Little</b> Ringed <b>Plovers</b> (Charadrius dubius) breeding in South Sweden, and {{to investigate the}} migration strategy and speed for this little studied shorebird. Methods We use light-level geolocators to track the year-round movements of <b>Little</b> Ringed <b>Plovers</b> breeding in South Sweden. Results Autumn migration proceeded towards the southeast, in three birds via lengthy stopovers in the Middle East, followed by movements towards the west and southwest to final winter destinations in Africa, while one male made a long stopover in northwestern Iran before migrating to India. The birds wintering in Africa probably stayed at freshwater locations in the Sahara or just south or north of the Sahara. Spring migration was more directly back to the breeding area. Overall migration speeds were similar during autumn and spring migration at about 189 and 209 km/day, respectively. The migration was carried out mainly as many short flights between stopovers. In particular, autumn migration was longer than the direct distance between breeding and wintering sites. Conclusions This study shows that the geolocator method can successfully be used with relatively small (40 g) shorebirds. We found that a local population of <b>Little</b> Ringed <b>Plover</b> may have widely differing wintering sites (low connectivity), from sub-Saharan Africa to the Indian subcontinent. The migration strategy of the <b>Little</b> Ringed <b>Plover,</b> with multiple short flights, deviates from that of many other long-distance migrating shorebirds that, instead, make {{one or a few}} long flights...|$|R
