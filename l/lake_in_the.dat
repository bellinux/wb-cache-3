5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors {{could also be used}} to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming.

The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E

It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E

40|$|Historical flood events {{produced}} <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mojave River watershed {{in southeastern}} California and represent climatic {{conditions similar to}} those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Quaternary when perennial <b>lakes</b> formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mojave Desert. Historical lakes are related to tropical and subtropical sources of moisture and an extreme southward shift of storm tracks.
