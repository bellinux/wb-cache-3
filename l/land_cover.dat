5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
5|$|The vast {{area of the}} National Park and {{the present}} lack of road {{infrastructure}} make remote sensing the only means for monitoring the human activities {{in the area and}} their impact on the ecosystem. An analysis has begun by taking a detailed picture of the territory covering at least the following items: orography and slopes, road networks, <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> and use, human settlements, and tourist sites. The use of remote sensing and geographic information system techniques is of essential value for the park's management and constitutes the basis for further evaluations and impact analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E

5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in <b>land</b> <b>cover.</b> The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E

These waveform features were used as attributes of training data for generating the RF prediction model. The RF prediction model was applied to predict the types of <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> in Miyun area as trees, buildings, farmland and ground. The classification results of these four types of <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> were obtained according to the ground truth information acquired from CCD image data of the same region.

40|$|With {{expanding}} urbanization, {{there has}} been an increase in manipulation of the environment by activities such as construction and landscaping. The consequences of these alterations on carbon efflux are important in understanding urban impact on the global carbon cycle from soils. This study aims to help quantify carbon efflux in urban soil from different <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> over a 6 -month time span. Using a standard chamber method carbon efflux was recorded for 12 different sites over 3 different <b>land</b> <b>covers.</b> No difference in carbon efflux amongst the <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> was found, most likely due to the high variation among samples. The data suggests with further research and more troubleshooting significant differences will be seen in the warmer seasons between the cover types. ...|$|R
40|$|MODIS {{enhanced}} vegetation index (EVI) {{and land}} surface temperature (LST) are key indicators for monitoring vegetation cover changes in broad ecosystems. However, {{there has been}} little evaluation of these indices for detecting changes in a range of <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> in tropical regions. In this study, we investigated the characteristics and seasonal responses of LST and EVI for four different <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> in Lao tropical forests: native forest, rubber plantation, mixed wooded/cleared areas and agriculture. We calculated long-term averages of MODIS LST and EVI 16 -day time series and compared their monthly transitions over the seven-year period from 2006 to 2012. We also tested whether these indices can be used to classify these four <b>land</b> <b>covers.</b> The findings demonstrate the complex interrelationship of LST and EVI and their monthly transitions for different land covers: they each showed distinctly different intra-annual LST and EVI variations. Native forests have the highest EVI, and the lowest LST throughout the year. In contrast, agricultural areas with little or no vegetation cover have the highest LST. The transition of LST/EVI for the <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> other than native forests showed marked seasonality. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed that there was high overall accuracy of separation of <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> by these indices (86 %). The encouraging results indicate that the combined use of MODIS LST and EVI holds promise for improving monitoring of changes in a Lao tropical forest.

25|$|The planet's {{major changes}} to <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> since 1750 have {{resulted}} from deforestation in temperate regions: when forests and woodlands are cleared {{to make room for}} fields and pastures, the albedo of the affected area increases, which can result in either warming or cooling effects, depending on local conditions. Deforestation also affects regional carbon reuptake, which can result in increased concentrations of CO2, the dominant greenhouse gas. Land-clearing methods such as slash and burn compound these effects by burning biomatter, which directly releases greenhouse gases and particulate matter such as soot into the air.|$|E
