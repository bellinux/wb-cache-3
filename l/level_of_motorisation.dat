5000|$|After the war, the Dutch {{army had}} to be rebuilt and modernised, with a far higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation.</b> Also {{equipment}} {{had to be}} found for the expeditionary army fighting the colonial war in the Dutch East Indies, the Indonesian War of Independence. For the reconnaissance units armoured cars {{were taken from the}} various Allied army dumps present on Dutch territory, of the British Humber Mk IV, American Staghound and Canadian Otter Light Reconnaissance Car types. Though these had been obtained for scrap value in the Spring of 1946, their condition was so poor that the maintenance effort needed to keep the rusty equipment operational proved to be prohibitively expensive. To solve this problem, Humber Mk IVs had to be bought from the UK. The General Staff therefore already in June 1946 considered the question whether it then would not be cheaper to restart production of the DAF M39. For the moment it was however decided to procure the American M8 Greyhound, use the Canadian Lynx version of the Daimler Armoured Car present on the dumps and to combine the turrets of old Humber cars with the more mechanically reliable Canadian Fox Armoured Car hulls, that also could be obtained from army dumps, resulting in the so-called [...] "Humfox" [...] hybrid vehicle.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{efforts are}} being made to apply “best practice” or "good practice" {{measures}} to road safety problems in less motorised countries, due to the magnitude and rapid growth of road crashes in these countries associated with rapidly increasing motorisation. This involves the transfer of knowledge and expertise, which has been developed mainly in highly motorised countries, to countries which differ from highly motorised countries in many more respects than their income or their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation.</b> This paper first outlines {{the nature of these}} differences and their impacts in broad terms, based on research conducted as part of ongoing doctoral studies. Second, following on from Professor Sigua’s preceding paper 1, the findings of the research are applied to the road safety situation in the Philippines. It should be noted at the outset that the research conducted so far has not focused specifically on the Philippines, so that the aim is to raise pertinent questions about the broader context of road safety in the Philippines, not to make strong recommendations for implementation of particular measures...|$|E
40|$|Internationally, people aged 65 {{and over}} are forming a rapidly {{increasing}} proportion of society (Heenan, 1993). New Zealand is no exception.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the number of elderly people in western European and other industrialised {{countries}} has been increasing. These demographic processes will continue. The growing share of elderly people in the population will lead to new challenges for ageing societies, particularly when the baby-boom generation retire. As a result, elderly people have become a focal point of interest in politics and science, and consequently in transport research. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a comprehensive overview of empirical findings on the mobility behaviour of seniors - today, in the past and in the future - followed by a simulation of the future transport demand of seniors, taking into account their changing motorisation rates and travel behaviour. The article is divided in two main parts. The first part provides a systematic overview of existing empirical findings and outlines expected effects in the near future derived from these findings. In the second part, we estimate the future travel demand using the TAPAS simulation model (travel activity pattern simulation). This microscopic model allows us to see how the overall travel demand will change, particularly due to demographic change - in response to altered population structures on the one hand and altered <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> or modified behaviour in the group of elderly people on the other. The results allow us to separate the demographic effects from the effects caused by increasing motorisation and changing behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Ethiopia {{has one of}} Africa’s {{fastest growing}} non-oil {{producing}} economies and an increasing <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> (AfDB, OECD, UNDP, & UNECA, 2012). This rapidly increasing mobility has created some unique road safety concerns; however there is scant published information and related commentary (United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 2009). The objective {{of this paper is}} to quantify police-reported traffic crashes in Ethiopia and characterise the existing state of road safety. Six years (July 2005 - June 2011) of police-reported crash data were analysed, consisting of 12, 140 fatal and 29, 454 injury crashes on the country’s road network. The 12, 140 fatal crashes involved 1, 070 drivers, 5, 702 passengers, and 7, 770 pedestrians, totalling 14, 542 fatalities, an average of 1. 2 road user fatalities per crash. An important and glaring trend that emerges is that more than half of the fatalities in Ethiopia involve pedestrians. The majority of the crashes occur during daytime hours, involve males, and involve persons in the 18 - 50 age group—Ethiopia’s active workforce. Crashes frequently occur in mid blocks or roadways. The predominant collision between motor vehicles and pedestrians was a rollover on a road tangent section. Failing to observe the priority of pedestrians and speeding were the major causes of crashes attributed by police. Trucks and minibus taxis were involved in the majority of crashes, while automobiles (small vehicles) were less involved in crashes relative to other vehicle types, partially because small vehicles tend to be driven fewer kilometres per annum. These data illustrate and justify a high priority to identify and implement effective programs, policies, and countermeasures focused on reducing pedestrian crashes...|$|E
40|$|Aim. This study {{suggests}} {{a set of}} methodologies to combine different indicators of road safety into a single index. The RSDI is a simple and quick composite index, which may become a significant measurement in comparing, ranking and determining road safety levels in different countries and regions worldwide. Design. One particular concern in designing a Road Safety Development Index (RSDI) is {{to come up with}} a comprehensive set of exposure and risk indicators which includes as far as possible the main parameters in road safety related to human-vehicle-road and country patterns instead of considering few and isolated indicators such as accident rates. The RSDI gives a broad picture compared to the traditional models in road safety.  Challenges. The differences in definitions, non-collection of data, no reliability of data and underreporting are problems for the construction of RSDI. In addition, the index should be as relevant as possible for different countries of the world, especially in developing countries. Empirical study. This study empirically compares the road safety situation and trends between ten Southeast Asian countries and Sweden for the period 1994 - 2003. Methodologies. Eleven indicators are chosen in RSDI, which have been categorised in nine dimensions. Four main approaches (objective and subjective) are used to calculate RSDI and determine which one is the best. One approach uses equal weights for all indicators and countries, whereas the other approaches give different weights depending on the importance of indicators. Findings. The thesis examines the RSDI for the ten ASEAN countries and Sweden in 2003. The results from this study indicate a remarkable difference between ASEAN countries even at the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation.</b> Singapore and Brunei seem to have the best RSDI record among the ASEAN countries according to the indicators used, while Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam show lower RSDI records. Conclusions. The RSDI results seem very promising and worth testing further applications with bigger samples of countries and from different parts of the world.

40|$|Volume I: This {{report is}} part of the ‘Policy’ Work Package of the DaCoTA project (www. dacotaproject. eu). The ‘Policy’ Work Package is {{designed}} to fill in the gap in knowledge on road safety policy making processes, their institutional framework and the data, methods and technical tools needed to base policy formulation and adoption on scientifically-established evidence. This document provides the results of a detailed analysis of a survey conducted with a large panel of stakeholders. The aim was to assess what they considered to be priorities and necessities in terms of scientific data, information, and tools to conduct their road safety activities. The aim is to improve our knowledge of the items that {{should be included in the}} ERSO website or that are included in the website already but deserve being highlighted somewhat. Concrete recommendations are eventually made that should contribute to the ERSO’s usefulness for a wide variety of road safety actors. The present report builds on a model that has been previously defined in the same Work Package to formally describe the Road Safety Management process, and to couple it with scientific input. This model conceives road safety management as involving 4 key tasks: (1) Fact Finding; (2) Programme Development; (3) Preparing Implementation; (4) Monitoring and evaluation. For each type of task, scientific support may prove necessary, either in terms of data, tools for the treatment of these data, training tools, or other decision-support tools (see Muhlrad, Gitelman, & Buttler, 2011 for a detailed description of the road safety management model used). The Road Safety Management model has first served as basis for the interview of a panel of road safety experts (see Muhlrad &, Dupont, 2010 for a complete report of the interview analysis). Their answers served as basis to design a questionnaire which was meant to be submitted to a wider array of stakeholders involved in road safety. This questionnaire contained questions concerning the background of the stakeholders and, structured around the 4 road safety management tasks listed above, a list of possible data, information, and tools that could be used as input for the different tasks. The stakeholders answering the questionnaire were asked to rate each of these items’ level of priority for the type of road safety activities that they were performing along with its availability. In total, 512 stakeholders returned the questionnaire. A first description of the results can be found in Machata, Barnes, & Jahi, 2011. The present deliverable contains the results of a further in-depth analysis of the stakeholders’ answers to that survey. In a first step, common dimensions underlying the priority and availability ratings of the tools listed in the questionnaire have been identified. Then, in a second step, these dimensions were used to identify “groups” (clusters) among the stakeholders. Finally, it was investigated whether the groups formed on the basis of the underlying priority-availability dimensions were associated with variation in the background characteristics of the stakeholders (country, type of organisation they were working for, type of road safety activities in which they were involved). Each of these analysis steps was performed in 2 different ways: Firstly, treating the priority and availability ratings separately, and secondly, by recoding the priority and availability ratings so as to recombine them into a common scale (the higher the score on this new scale, the more the item is considered to be a priority and to be unavailable). For this reason, the second type of data treatment is referred to as the “needs analysis”. The results revealed that meaningful dimensions can be identified that summarize the priority-availability ratings of the items included in the questionnaire in an efficient way. This was the case both when the priority and availability ratings were treated separately or recombined into a “needs” scale. Although the content of the dimensions identified varies somewhat depending on the type of data treatment, most of them display important similarities in content. Other dimensions, on the other hand, emerge more specifically when analysing the availability ratings or the combined “needs” scale. These dimensions furthermore ease the grouping of the stakeholders on the basis of their priority and availability ratings of the more than 50 items originally listed in the questionnaire. Working exclusively on the priority ratings, 4 different clusters were identified: ? Cluster 1 representing the stakeholders with “low priority for everything”; ? Cluster 2 representing the stakeholders considering that data and models are specifically important, ? Cluster 3 includes stakeholders that tend to assign “high priority for everything, but especially implementation”, ? Cluster 4 corresponds to stakeholders assigning high priority to in-depth data mostly The investigation of the relation between the different clusters the stakeholders are assigned to and their background characteristics reveals no clear relation with the type of country they originate from. They are however more clearly related to the type of organisation the stakeholders work for, e. g. stakeholders from the industry appear to be over-represented in the 4 th cluster, while those from associations and interest groups tend to be over-represented in the third one and stakeholders working in national or regional administrations tend to be over-represented in cluster 2. On the basis of availability ratings, 3 clusters were identified: ? The first one groups stakeholders who basically declare that information on costs and benefits of measures are available, but that models are not. ? Cluster 2 corresponds to stakeholders declaring that models are available, but that data and definitions are needed. ? Finally, stakeholders in Cluster 3 request information about the costs and benefits of measures. Again, the investigation of background characteristics reveals little association with the countries the stakeholders work in, but a stronger relationship with the type of organisation they work for. Stakeholders from both research institutes and national/regional organisations tend to be over represented in the first cluster, but under-represented in the third one, while stakeholders from associations and interest groups tend to be over-represented in the second cluster. Finally, when working with the combined “needs” scale, 6 clusters are identified: ? Cluster 1 “needs for most items, especially accident and infrastructure analysis”; ? Cluster 2 “moderate needs for all”, ? Cluster 3 “High needs for models, moderate needs in other, implementation unimportant”, ? Cluster 4 “No needs for models, moderate needs in implementation” ? Cluster 5 “Low importance of implementation and models, moderate needs in crash causation” ? Cluster 6 “High needs for implementation but no use of accident and infrastructure analyses The stakeholders in the first cluster only rarely state that data and tools are of “high importance” for their professional activities, do not seem to use databases (national and international) much, and tend to declare more that they are “very satisfied” with the data and resources currently available. This cluster does not clearly relate to any particular type of organization, of road safety activity, or of country. The stakeholders in Cluster 2 generally consider data and tools to be important in their daily road safety activities, report making substantial use of databases (international and national). Stakeholders involved in sensitization activities tend to be better represented in this cluster and generally consider scientific input to be relatively important for their professional activities, without showing a marked preference for any particular type of information. Stakeholders involved in research and working for road safety organizations tend to be over-represented in Cluster 3. This cluster is the one with the highest proportion of respondents declaring that tools are very important for their road safety activities and tending to assign very high priority to statistical models. Cluster 4 is also characterized by a substantial proportion of stakeholders involved in research activities. They stress — although to a moderate extent — the needs for information about the implementation of measures, the safety impacts of measures and on accident analysis with regard to road infrastructure. Cluster 5 contains the highest proportion of policy makers, along with a higher proportion of respondents from the industry. These stakeholders generally tended to consider all data and information types as less important (especially information related to the implementation of measures and statistical models), but they stressed more the importance of accident causation information and information on the safety impacts of measures. Finally, the stakeholders in Cluster 6 did not report using databases much. This cluster is, along with Cluster 5, the one containing the highest share of policy makers. Clearly “sensitization” is a dominant activity among these respondents. They insisted on the importance of information related to the implementation of measures and, on the other hand, on the lesser importance of accident and infrastructure analysis. The report ends on a discussion of the implications that the analyses’ results have for the ERSO. On the basis of an overview of the dimensions identified on the basis of the stakeholders ratings, concrete recommendations are made for the future development of ERSO, in terms of project results whose accessibility and visibility should be ensured on the website (EU-funded, national projects or other international research initiatives), but also in terms of data collection. / Volume II: The main objective of the DaCoTA project with respect to road safety management systems was to investigate the road safety management framework in European countries in order to help promote “good practice” and optimize management processes. Within this context, the road safety management investigation model proposed by Muhlrad et al. (2011) is based on several “good practice” criteria, defined by an exhaustive literature review, aiming to address the need for optimized road safety management systems, leading to better road safety performance, in a changing environment. In this research, road safety management systems have been thoroughly investigated in 14 European countries in 2010, by means of interviews with both governmental representatives and independent experts in each country who filled in an extensive DaCoTA questionnaire on the degree to which the various road safety management systems meet the “good practice” criteria. The questions related to five main areas of Road Safety Management: ? Institutional organisation, coordination and stakeholders’ involvement ? Policy formulation and adoption ? Policy implementation and funding ? Monitoring and evaluation ? Scientific support and information, capacity building A shorter version of the DaCoTA questionnaire has also been prepared in collaboration with the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC). This questionnaire includes 11 key questions similar to those of the original DaCoTA questionnaire and was dispatched to the PIN panel of the ETSC, i. e. the 30 high level national experts from ETSC network of member organisations. The combined use of the two questionnaires allowed on the one hand the coverage of basic road safety management elements for all European countries (DaCoTA/ETSC-PIN questionnaire), and on the other hand the full in-depth analysis for a subset of European countries (DaCoTA questionnaire). The data was analyzed in two ways: ? Qualitative analysis: making a thorough analysis and cross-checking of the questionnaire responses and related comments of both the governmental representatives and the independent experts, in order to draw a reliable and accurate picture or “profile” for each country, and allowing in-depth country comparisons for selected key items. ? Quantitative analysis: using statistical methods to identify patterns, correlations and rankings of countries, as regards both the road safety management characteristics, and the relationship between road safety management and road safety performance. The two types of analyses had therefore different yet complementary objectives, and their combination allowed for full exploitation of the wealth of data gathered by the DaCoTA team. More specifically, the present research contributes the following analyses and results: ? Road safety management country profiles: road safety management systems in the 14 European countries are analysed and compared to a reference “good practice” system, meeting all the criteria defined in DaCoTA, on the basis of the extensive DaCoTA questionnaire. Road safety management structures and outputs are described according to the policy-making cycle (agenda setting, policy formulation, adoption, implementation and evaluation) and set against the background of a typical hierarchical national government organization. ? Country comparisons: country comparisons are carried out for all 30 European countries for specific issues within each area of road safety management, in order to understand how the different countries in Europe handle their road safety management systems and whether the model developed under DaCoTA can serve as a useful tool for comparing different national solutions. For this analysis, apart from the DaCoTA questionnaire, the DaCoTA/ETSC-PIN data, as well as additional data sources from the literature, were also exploited. ? Clustering of countries on the basis of road safety management components: statistical clustering techniques are used to group and rank the 14 European countries on the basis of their level of availability of the various road safety management “good practice” elements, separately for each one of the five areas of the DaCoTA questionnaire. A final global ranking of countries in terms of their road safety management system as a whole is also presented. ? Statistical models linking road safety management with road safety performance: regression models were develop in order to test whether road safety management is associated with road safety performance, within the framework of the SUNflower methodology for road safety management systems. Different road safety outcomes (fatalities, reduction in fatalities, Safety Performance Indicators - the intermediate outcomes) were tested against road safety management indicators and other background variables. The results of the DaCoTA analyses on road safety management systems suggest that, although a number of “good practice” elements can be established as regards road safety management structures, processes and outputs, it is not possible to identify one single “good practice” model at national level. Best performing countries are not always ranked best in terms of road safety management components. On the other hand, the proposed “good practice” criteria seem to work as regards the worst performing countries. One clear finding is that similar performance in road safety management can be achieved by means of differing structures and implementation processes. Similarly, similar road safety performance in terms of final outcomes (i. e. fatalities) may be the “result” of substantially different road safety management systems. Despite the differences in European road safety management systems, there have been several elements that emerged as more critical “good practice” criteria, such as the presence of a strong lead agency, the efficiency of the implementation — monitoring — evaluation part of the policy making cycle, the embedding of programmes in sustainable and results-focused structures and processes, and the distribution and coordination of responsibilities between federal, regional and local levels. Especially the implementation, funding, monitoring and evaluation elements showed the lowest level of availability in the European countries and appear to be the most problematic sections of the road safety management systems. When examining the relation between road safety performance and road safety management in the different countries, there appeared to be little or no effect of road safety management features on safety performance, and background indicators (GDP, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation)</b> were dominant over road safety management effects. However, road safety management was found to be (weakly) associated with safety performance indicators (SPIs), reflecting the operational level of road safety in each country — these are considered “intermediate” outcomes, affecting in turn the “final” outcomes, i. e. road safety casualties. The weak relationship between road safety management and road safety performance is attributed to the fact that the European countries do not exhibit big differences in road safety performance, and no big differences in road safety management overall - a minimum acceptable level exists in both cases. Another factor that should be taken into account is the time of observation. In some countries, road safety management components may be so recent that they hadn’t yet had the time to deploy their full potential; or they may have been around for such a long time that their impact has already gradually faded away. Moreover, the evolution of road safety management may be associated with the evolution of road safety performance, but no data was available to examine this temporal dimension. Another finding concerns the differences observed between expert’s and government’s responses, the latter tending to be more positive, especially as regards the role of the parliament, the availability of programmes, the resources and funds allocation, the reporting procedures, the information of citizens etc. It was concluded that expert responses may reflect an independent and more objective view and that future analysis might better use experts’ opinion as a prime source. On the basis of the results of the present research, the following key messages and recommendations can be outlined: ? Recommendations at national and local level 8 Develop objective knowledge of RSM within countries 8 Decentralisation with care 8 Establishment of an Independent Lead Agency 8 Inter-sectoral and vertical coordination 8 Continuous stakeholders consultation 8 Vision and strategy is crucial for creating a road safety culture, but implementation is the critical step towards road safety improvement 8 Strengthen the link from policy formulation to policy adoption 8 Regular monitoring and evaluation 8 Resources and funding 8 Knowledge-based policies 8 Capacity building & training 8 Handle road safety management in times of recession ? Recommendations at European level 8 Adopting the safe systems approach 8 Exploiting the synergies of road safety and environmental policies 8 Adoption of serious injury reduction targets 8 Focusing on the essentials, leaving the details to the individual countries 8 Strengthening the role of ERSO 8 Publication of a Road Safety Management Good Practice Manual 8 Building on the existing framework and improving where necessary 8 Political will and commitment from all stakeholders. / Volume II: The main objective of the DaCoTA project with respect to road safety management systems was to investigate the road safety management framework in European countries in order to help promote “good practice” and optimize management processes.

40|$|Based on {{existing}} literature, a system thinking approach {{was used to}} set up a conceptual model on the interrelationships among the components influencing adolescent road mortality, distinguishing between components at the individual level and at the system level. At the individual <b>level</b> the role <b>of</b> risk behaviour (sometimes deliberate and sometimes from inexperience or other non-deliberate causes) in adolescent road mortality is well documented. However, {{little is known about the}} extent to which the ‘road system’ itself may also have an impact on younger adolescents’ road mortality. This, by providing a safe or unsafe road environment for all road users (System-induced exposure) and by allowing access to high-risk vehicles at a young or older age through the legal licensing age. This study seeks to explore these relationships by analysing the extent to which the road mortality of 10 to 17 year olds in various jurisdictions can be predicted from the System-induced Exposure (SiE) in a jurisdiction and from its legal licensing age to drive motor vehicles. SiE was operationalized as the number of road fatalities per 105 inhabitants/all ages together, but excluding the 10 to 17 year olds. Data on road fatalities during the years 2001 through 2008 were obtained from the OECD International Road Traffic Accident Database (IRTAD) and from the USA NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database for 29 early and 10 late licensing jurisdictions. Linear mixed models were fitted with annual ‘Adolescent road mortality per capita’ for 2001 through 2008 as the dependent variable, and time-dependent ‘SiE’ and time-independent ‘Licensing system’ as predictor variables. To control for different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation,</b> the time-dependent variable ‘Annual per capita vehicle distance travelled’ was used as a covariate. Licensing system of a jurisdiction was entered as a categorical predictor variable with late licensing countries as a baseline group. The study found support for the protective effects of SiE on adolescent safety. If SiE increased by one unit, the mortality rate of 10 to 17 year olds increased by 0. 487 units. No support was found for a protective effect of late licensing for this age group. Thus, compared to young adolescents who are allowed to drive motor vehicles in early licensing jurisdictions, late licensing does not provide extra protection for pre-license adolescents. This finding is probably the result of the high risks associated with alternative transport modes, such as moped riding and bicycling. Also, the fact that the study only included risks to young adolescents themselves and did not include the risks they might pose to other road users and passengers may have contributed to this finding, because such risks are greater when driving a motor vehicle than riding a moped or a bicycle. Therefore, to advance our understanding of the impact of licensing systems, more study is needed into the benefits of early or late licensing, thereby considering these wider effects as well.

40|$|The Russian {{retail trade}} sector has {{adjusted}} {{itself to the}} new free market conditions within an extremely short period of time. Different purchasing habits and completely new forms of companies have developed. Thousands of kiosks have been set up. In the form of kiosk complexes, these often take over the exclusive supply function for large tenement estates with considerably more than 100 000 inhabitants. It is rare to find shopping malls around {{the borders of the}} city or in the "green belt", such as {{can be found in the}} new Länder of Germany, in major Russian cities. Using the example of two city districts in St. Petersburg, the causes and conditions, as well as the regional location patterns for the formation of these ephemeral institutions were examined. The kiosk trade has developed to become a permanent aspect of the entire municipal retail trade system. In addition to the drastic deficit in sales' space, the lack of starting capital, the state regimentation and the greater <b>level</b> <b>of</b> flexibility of running a kiosk, the causes for the formation of this phenomenon are to be found primarily in the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>motorisation</b> and the preferred use of public transport by the population. Consequently, the larger shop location complexes, which demonstrate the range of goods to be found in a shopping centre, have been set up in the metro stations, followed by the locations of bus and tram stops, close to the stationary trade installations, as well as at cross-roads with pedestrian footbridges. The most important precondition for the operation of a kiosk is: the kiosk trade will become more efficient in a direct proportionate relationship to the spatial proximity and the daily quantities of passers-by, recruited from all social classes.

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen rapid {{change in the}} urban {{transport}} of many eastern Asian cities. Some cities have been hailed internationally as transport success stories while others have become known for their intense traffic crises {{to the extent of}} threatening both their environmental qualities and economic performance. Accordingly, there is great interest in better understanding urban transport patterns in the large cities of eastern Asia. However, the literature lacks clear internationally comparable information on these cities and their transport systems. A review of the literature on land use and transport in Asian cities reveals many misunderstandings and inaccurate interpretations of the current situation in these cities. This thesis attempts to redress this lack of sound urban data and to improve policy interpretations by focusing on nine major cities in Pacific Asia (Bangkok, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Surabaya and Tokyo). The study provides an international comparative perspective on these cities using a large set of data on urban transport, land use and economic factors, as part of a wider study on 46 international cities. A historical review of transport and urban development between 1900 and the 1960 s found that, {{by the end of the}} period, most of the Asian cities were more vulnerable to problems from an influx of private vehicles than Western cities had been at the equivalent stage in their motorisation. This greater vulnerability was primarily due to higher densities and greater dependence on road-based public transport in most Asian cities, which could be described as “bus cities”, an archetype that is developed in the thesis. This archetype is found to be useful in better understanding Asian cities in relation to more Western-based theories of city evolution based on the dominant transport technology, as well as helping to interpret past and present transport problems. Analysis of comparative transport and other data for 1990 found that the Asian cities in the sample generally had much lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> private vehicle use than European, Canadian, Australian and American cities in the international sample. This is in line perhaps with general expectations, though not without significant variations within the group. The Asian cities also generally had greater roles for public transport and non-motorised transport and much higher urban densities than cities in the other regions, though variations were again significant. A detailed investigation of the special opportunities and challenges for transport of the highdensity urban forms of most of the Asian cities reveals new insights on the root causes of transport problems in such cities. High density offers the opportunity to foster successful public transport and non-motorised accessibility. However, it also means that very high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> motorised traffic per unit of land area (and hence intense traffic impacts) can emerge quickly, even if vehicle use per capita remains low. Traffic congestion can also emerge rapidly as dense cities motorise. This is a result, not just of poorly developed road systems, but of the fact that road capacity per capita is inherently low in dense cities. This research thus challenges notions in the literature that congestion problems in Asian cities can be solved by road expansion. It establishes, through sound comparative urban data, that there are inherent limits to road provision in dense cities. Contrasting urban transport strategies or models were identified within the Asian sample of cities. In particular, upper-middle-income cities, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, were shown to have experienced very rapid motorisation and to have had little success in increasing the relative roles of public transport and non-motorised modes. These trends have led to a severe mismatch between emerging car and motorcycle-oriented transport patterns and the pre-existing highdensity urban form, especially in Bangkok. This “unrestrained motorisation” model is contrasted with the experiences of wealthier Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, which have all restrained and slowed the pace <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> to some extent and enhanced the role of public transport. In all four cities, 1990 <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> and vehicle use were low relative to their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> income. This “restraint” model takes advantage of the transport opportunities that are inherent in existing dense urban forms while avoiding many of the problems. It is also shown to have encouraged, or complemented, the evolution of public transport-oriented patterns of urban development. Jakarta, Surabaya and Manila face the choice of following either of these models, but appear more likely to follow Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, unless policy changes are made. The study then reviews key choices and policies in urban transport in the nine Asian cities over recent decades. It identifies which have been most decisive in defining the models “chosen” by each city. Although many decisions are important, the thesis argues that a particularly crucial choice is the decision of whether or not to restrain private vehicle ownership and use. The Asian cities following the “restraint” model began to restrain private vehicles at an early stage in their motorisation and generally well before they had developed high-quality or high-capacity public transport systems. This challenges the common view that a city must already have a first-class public transport system before traffic restraint can be effective or politically acceptable. In fact, this study suggests that early introduction of traffic restraint can facilitate the gradual development of well-functioning transport systems, including mass transit systems. Insights drawn from the results of this study potentially have important implications for transport and urban policy debates in low-income and middle-income cities everywhere, particularly those that are beginning to motorise quickly from previously low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> vehicle ownership...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the interdependence of transport strategy and the portion of urban land given over to traffic attains its full meaning only {{in the light of}} drastically different spatial/physical characteristics of world cities. Advocates of the pro-automobile transport strategy are persistent in their support of the hypothesis that along with the increase in the degree <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> <b>of</b> a population, the share of urban land needed for transport unavoidably increases. But it is exactly this spatial aspect that makes transport strategy of the large, proautomobile oriented US cities (that occupy few thousand square kilometres and have extremely low population densities), completely inadequate for the compact, densely populated cities of developing countries and countries in transition. Distinctive features of large cities of the developing world and countries in transition: monocentric, compact spatial structure and extremely high urban densities, are the main causes of extremely high volumes of motorized traffic per unit of urbanized area (in spite of their very low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> motorization). Supply of urban roads per capita in these metropolises is not going to significantly improve, whatever length of new urban roads they (manage to) construct. That makes them completely unsuitable for pro-automobile transport strategy and, at the same time, very suitable for development of light rail and metro systems, and rigorous traffic limitation policy.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that {{many studies have}} criticised Smeed’s model because it only {{concentrates}} on the <b>motorisation</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> country and ignores the impact of other variables (cf.

40|$|When {{observing the}} {{development}} and operation of modern cities, one can quickly {{come to the conclusion}} that in the recent years the chief factor of the spatial-structural transformation of cities in Poland (though not only there) and the spatial behaviour of their residents has been motorisation, and more precisely, the car. This is so because the car, while facilitating and intensifying mobility, makes it possible to draw places of residence apart from those of goal implementation. The ever-growing number of cars moving around a city leads to disturbances in street traffic, makes the service of residents worse, causes many road accidents, and brings about unfavourable qualitative changes in the environment. That is why in many recent conceptions of urban development there appear measures intended to restrict the use of cars, which is one of the ways leading to the construction of ‘a city for people’.
