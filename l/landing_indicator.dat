40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Conceptual Framework for the Development of Global <b>Land</b> <b>Indicators.</b> It was compiled for the Global <b>Land</b> <b>Indicators</b> Initiative (GLII) {{as part of}} the technical assistance that the Natural Resources Institute at the University of Greenwich provided to GLTN / UN-Habitat in the GLII process from January to May 2015. Its purpose is to assist agreement on a set of commonly agreed global <b>land</b> <b>indicators</b> intended to monitor key aspects of land governance and land tenure security, so that all concerned stakeholders can contribute to a common monitoring effort at global, country, project and local levels. It includes clarification of the meanings of key land tenure terms and concepts, discussion of purposes and objectives of land monitoring, analysis of feasibility issues and a theory of change of how land monitoring to support improved tenure security and land governance improvements can support development goals. Since the conceptual framework and an associated list of indicators was continuing discussions have focussed on incorporation of headline indicators proposed to measure land tenure security into the framework of indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which resulted in acceptance of GLII’s proposed indicators of tenure security at Indicator 1. 4. 2 in the SDG framework under Goal 1, Ending Poverty. Various elements of this conceptual framework that are pertinent to GLII’s mission and mandate of making global land monitoring a reality will necessarily be subject to further development by GLII participating experts and organisations...|$|R

40|$|The grazing {{lands of}} {{northern}} Australia contain a substantial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock {{due to the}} large land area. Manipulating SOC stocks through grazing management has been presented as an option to offset national greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and other industries. However, research into the response of SOC stocks {{to a range of}} management activities has variously shown positive, negative or negligible change. This uncertainty in predicting change in SOC stocks represents high project risk for government and industry in relation to SOC sequestration programs. In this paper, we seek to address the uncertainty in SOC stock prediction by assessing relationships between SOC stocks and grazing <b>land</b> condition <b>indicators.</b> We reviewed the literature to identify <b>land</b> condition <b>indicators</b> for analysis and tested relationships between identified <b>land</b> condition <b>indicators</b> and SOC stock using data from a paired-site sampling experiment (10 sites). We subsequently collated SOC stock datasets at two scales (quadrat and paddock) from across northern Australia (329 sites) to compare with the findings of the paired-site sampling experiment with the aim of identifying the <b>land</b> condition <b>indicators</b> that had the strongest relationship with SOC stock. The <b>land</b> condition <b>indicators</b> most closely correlated with SOC stocks across datasets and analysis scales were tree basal area, tree canopy cover, ground cover, pasture biomass and the density of perennial grass tussocks. In combination with soil type, these indicators accounted for up to 42 % of the variation in the residuals after climate effects were removed. However, we found that responses often interacted with soil type, adding complexity and increasing the uncertainty associated with predicting SOC stock change at any particular location. We recommend that caution be exercised when considering SOC offset projects in northern Australian grazing lands due to the risk of incorrectly predicting changes in SOC stocks with change in <b>land</b> condition <b>indicators</b> and management activities for a particular paddock or property. Despite the uncertainty for generating SOC sequestration income, undertaking management activities to improve land condition is likely to have desirable complementary benefits such as improving productivity and profitability as well as reducing adverse environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of riparian buffers to protect {{water quality and}} fish habitat in agricultural areas is well documented. However, when setting protection and restoration priorities {{it is not easy}} for community groups and governments to assess which buffers are the most effective and why. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a set of easily measured indicators that could be used to set priorities. Land-based indicators that other studies have shown to have an effect on riparian buffer functions and can be quickly measured in a Geographic Information System (GIS) were selected. Indicators were measured at two scales: the reach and riparian corridor. These indicators were compared with water quality and in-stream physical habitat to assess their ability to predict in-stream conditions in three watersheds in the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia. Six key indicators were identified that predict the effectiveness of the riparian buffer. Significant relationships were found between percent channelization, percent forest and percent agriculture and dissolved oxygen; the number of barns per kilometer and ammonia; forest cover conditions and stream temperature; and percent of forest cover and the number of pieces of large woody debris and habitat complexity. <b>Land</b> <b>indicator</b> conditions of the reach were found to be better predictors of in-stream physical habitat, whereas <b>land</b> <b>indicator</b> conditions of the riparian corridor were found to be better predictors of water quality.

The mire hydrology of this relatively small bog was heavily influenced by forestry changes in the area. The climate signal was therefore obscured.

40|$|With this UFOPLAN {{project on}} <b>land</b> use <b>indicators,</b> the German Federal Environment Agency aimed at further {{developing}} indicators from a consumption perspective {{in support of}} Germany’s sustainability strategy, covering both area-based and impact-oriented <b>land</b> footprint <b>indicators.</b> The project also aimed at calculating selected <b>land</b> footprint <b>indicators</b> for Germany and the EU. These indicators should provide an improved understanding of the global teleconnections of consumption and land use relevant for policy making towards achieving sustainable land use. This synthesis report presents the key results from this project. First, we present a structured overview of existing approaches for estimating land footprintsand describe their technical and structural characteristicsas well as their strengths and weaknesses. This leads to the specification of a hybrid methodology as the preferred calculation approach. In the second part, we present the developed innovative hybrid land footprint method, consisting of a global land flow accounting and trade model capturing commodity flows in physical units to track embodied land along global supply chains. For non-food commodities the supply chains were complemented by an environmental input-output model. This method was {{used to calculate the}} cropland, grassland and forestland footprint of Germany and the EU. Finally, an overview of existing indicator systems for representing the environmental impacts of land use was provided and their complementary usage to extend area-based land footprints was discussed.

We answer this and related questions with respect to Karnataka, an Indian state showing signs of agrarian distress. Using the participatory impact assessment (PIA) method involving farmers, researchers and voluntary workers, we {{assess the impact of}} recent policy-driven farming practices. The land use functions (LUFs) framework, which resembles the ecosystem services framework, was adapted in the PIA to address multidimensional sustainability in agricultural landscapes. During the PIAs, participants ranked LUFs in the order of their perceived importance and projected the impact of different practice–policy scenarios on chosen indicators corresponding to each LUF. Three farming scenarios, namely organic, conventional (chemically intensive) and mixed input practices were assessed for their projected impacts on selected indicators of each LUF. The LUF ranking reveals that while stakeholder priorities vary, they remain contrasting to the common policy focus of profit and productivity maximisation.

40|$|The {{required}} {{increase in}} agricultural production to meet future food demand will further increase pressure on <b>land</b> resources. Integrative <b>indicators</b> {{of the current}} status of the agricultural production capacity of land and their change over time are needed for promoting land management practices to maintain or improve land productivity and a sustainable use of natural resources. It is argued that such <b>land</b> quality <b>indicators</b> should be obtained with a holistic systems-oriented approach. Two <b>land</b> quality <b>indicators</b> are elaborated that deal with (1) yield gaps, i. e. the difference of actual yield and yield obtained under optimum management practices, or yields determined by the land-based natural resources, and (2) a soil nutrient balance, i. e. the rate with which soil fertility is changing. The yield gap is based on the calculation of land-based cereal productivity at three different levels in terms of potential, water limited, and nutrient limited production, considering weather, soil and crop characteristics. These modelled production levels do not incorporate socio-economic aspects, which may impede agricultural management in its effort to release stress because of inadequate soil fertility, water availability and/or occurrence of pests and diseases. Therefore, location specific actual yield levels are also considered. Besides an evaluation of the actual status of the land, {{it is important to consider}} the rate of change. The quantification of changes in soil nutrient stocks is crucial to identify problematic land use systems. The soil nutrient balance, i. e. the net difference between gross inputs and outputs of nutrients to the system, is used as measure for the changes. The indicator for the soil nutrient balance combines this rate of soil nutrient change and the soil nutrient stock. Indicators for yield gaps and soil nutrient balances are defined, procedures for their quantification are described and their general applicability is discussed...|$|R
