Hall Field next to Hollins Wood is also found on 19th-century tithe maps. At some <b>later</b> <b>time,</b> the seat moved eastwards to Bradwall Hall.|$|E

The first ten episodes of season three aired Thursdays at 8:00p.m. ET in the US on FOX, a terrestrial television network; however, from January 12, 2006 onwards, The O.C. was shifted to a <b>later</b> <b>time</b> of Thursdays at 9:00p.m. ET.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a <b>later</b> <b>time</b> he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E

5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game at a <b>later</b> <b>time</b> with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E
5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune.

Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days <b>later</b> <b>Time</b> magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a <b>later</b> <b>time,</b> and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, our {{extrapolation}} {{of the power}} law to the much <b>later</b> <b>times</b> used in the DTP measurements could be proven to yield very satisfactory results regarding SUR/SUV correction. Therefore, our assumption is that a power law with b≈ 0.3 remains valid for AIF modelling also at late times. The good performance of the correction procedure for the DTP data (acquired with a different scanner at much <b>later</b> <b>times</b> and also reconstructed differently) provides strong evidence for this conjecture. Despite these promising results, further investigations are desirable to further support the assumed power law behavior of the AIF at <b>later</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R

5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{general area}} of the villages of Dalj, Erdut and Aljmaš was {{targeted}} by an artillery bombardment between 3:00a.m. and 4:30a.m. on 1 August 1991. Croatian sources indicate that the artillery fire was coming from units assigned to the JNA 51st Mechanised Brigade deployed on the left bank of the Danube River, on the territory of Serbia, {{as well as the}} Croatian Serb TO. The JNA report on the events prepared for Croatian authorities denies that the JNA artillery took part in the bombardment, and indicates a somewhat <b>later</b> <b>time</b> of the initial fighting, placing it at 4:10a.m. Witness testimony given at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) trial of Slobodan Milošević supports the timeline placing the initial combat at 3:00a.m.|$|E

5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. Two or three more doses are required at a <b>later</b> <b>time</b> for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue.

If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E

5|$|All but 4 of the {{scheduled}} 120 games were played. The four games {{that were not}} played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round. Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents. Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a {{decision as to whether}} the games would be rescheduled to a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> Just prior to the final round of scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{professional}} wrestling championship, it was won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler {{because of a}} storyline. All title changes occurred at JCP or WCW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Danny Miller, who defeated Ole Anderson on February 27, 1974, in the finals of a tournament. Booker T holds the record for most reigns, with six. Rick Steamboat's second reign ended due to vacancy for unknown reasons. The day on which the reign ended is also unknown, although {{it is known that}} the reign began on June 10, 1978, and came to a close sometime in 1980. As such, if the reign ended on January 1, 1980, or any <b>later</b> <b>time</b> during 1980, then Steamboat's second reign is the longest in the title's history, at over 570 days. Five different reigns are tied for the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at one day.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers {{also tend to be}} more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to the}} direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E

5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{develops}} its narrative thread {{through the}} actions of its player-controlled protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa. Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water. The game world {{is made up of}} several distinct regions, most of which are connected via the city of Tairon, which functions as a hub. Access to these regions are obtained by fighting enemies, finding keys, or solving puzzles, inspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda video games. Dragon busts scattered throughout the regions provide the means to save player progress, permitting gameplay to be resumed at a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a <b>later</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
