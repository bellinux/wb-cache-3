5000|$|The double {{planetary}} gear system incorporates an input sun gear connected to the driver’s steering wheel, two {{planetary gear}}s, an output sun gear connected to the steering pinion, and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the input sun gear, thought the planetary gears (sharing a common <b>lay</b> <b>shaft)</b> to the output sun gear with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|E
5000|$|The B8 A4 {{is built}} on {{a variant of the}} Audi Modular Longitudinal Platform, a {{platform}} which is also used in the Audi A5 coupé. Whilst prior A4 chassis were limited in wheelbase due to the relationship between the engine, transmission and front axle, the MLP allows for a reduced front overhang, resulting in a greater wheelbase length without the same increase in overall length. This effectively redistributes the centre of gravity slightly rearwards, improving handling by better balancing vehicle mass between the front and rear axles. The estimated static front:rear weight ratio of the B8 A4 is approximately 55:45, depending on body style and engine. The relocation of the steering rack in front of the axle also improves handling over previous A4 platforms. Key to the implementation of MLB is the novel mounting of the differential in front of the clutch. This is achieved by driving the flywheel/clutch remotely by means of a 'top hat' shaped drive plate, between which the differential <b>lay</b> <b>shaft</b> passes, whilst power transmission to the final drive is via an inclined transfer shaft which runs the length of the transmission unit. Whilst the platform retains Audi's [...] "overhung" [...] engine mounting position, the front axle is now 152mm further forward than the previous B6/B7 generation platform. [...] The transfer shaft however has the effect of creating a large [...] "bulge" [...] {{on one side of the}} transmission tunnel, which on right-hand drive versions forces the pedals to be badly offset, which has attracted criticism from the British motoring press in particular.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Figure  8 that the {{spectrum}} of the intact gear only contains the frequencies of the input shaft, <b>lay</b> <b>shaft,</b> and output shaft, whereas the local defect excites the rotary frequency and its harmonic of the defect gear shaft.|$|E
5000|$|The Ford MTX-75 (M TransaXle), is a 5-speed {{transmission}} {{developed by}} Ford Motor Company for its larger-engined {{front wheel drive}} models. [...] "75" [...] refers to the distance in millimeters between the main and <b>lay</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By 2007, New Jersey Transit had {{upgraded}} their P40DC {{units with}} updated prime movers {{to match the}} [...] of the successor P42DC. This was done by readjusting {{the position of the}} <b>lay</b> <b>shafts</b> within the prime mover.|$|R

30|$|In the {{spectrum}} of the defect case shown in Figure  11, the frequency component of 10  Hz is the rotating frequency of the input shaft, whereas the predominant frequency of 6.5  Hz is the interference component inspired by other excitation in the gear chain, which covers the frequency components of the <b>lay</b> <b>shaft</b> and output shaft.|$|E

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the many {{individual}} pits transferred to larger mine complexes with central shafts, at which point the sinking of inclined shafts and the mixing of layout and equipment with the workings was abandoned entirely. The central, vertical <b>shafts</b> <b>lay</b> in the host rock (usually in the hanging wall), just as permanently established as the main gangways (usually in the footwall).|$|R
60|$|One of {{the immense}} gray granite <b>shafts</b> <b>lay</b> in the piazza, {{on the verge}} of the area. It was a great, solid fact of the Past, making old Rome {{actually}} sensible to the touch and eye; and no study of history, nor force of thought, nor magic of song, could so vitally assure us that Rome once existed, as this sturdy specimen of what its rulers and people wrought.|$|R
60|$|Taurus Antinor's {{eyes were}} narrowed beneath his {{frowning}} brows {{as he tried}} to pierce the gloom that <b>lay</b> beyond that <b>shaft</b> of light. He could hear heavy breathing proceeding from there and the muttering of curses, and anon he was able to spy a bundle of stained silken clothes that lay in a heap and which seemed to shrink and to shrivel, to tremble and to cower on the altar steps: a bundle of rags and a gleam of flaccid flesh which stood for the majesty of Cæsar.|$|R
50|$|M'Neill {{found the}} victims {{in a field}} 1.2 mi from Gatton. Michael and Theresa 'Ellen' were lying back-to-back, within 2 ft of each other. Norah lay in the same east/west orientation, on a neatly spread rug, 28 ft to the east. Both women had their hands tied behind their backs with handkerchiefs. Forming a triangle, the sulky faced south, 17.5 ft from Michael and 36 ft from Norah. The horse {{had been shot in}} the head and still <b>lay</b> between the <b>shafts.</b> Their legs were {{arranged}} with the feet pointing west. This signature behaviour has never been repeated in Australian crime and, like the Gatton Murders themselves, remains a mystery.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} assembly of stocks, sails, windshaft, brake wheel etc. is supported on two bearings. The neck bearing supports {{by far the}} largest fraction of the weight. This is a plain bearing which supports the majority of the vertical component of the weight of the {{rotating assembly}}. The bearing block is of solid brass construction and is lubricated with animal fat. The <b>shaft</b> <b>lays</b> in a shallow groove of the neck bearing block and is kept in position by the weight of the rotating assembly. The tail bearing supports the remainder of the vertical weight and any (horizontal) thrust generated by the wind. The neck bearing does not react any thrust forces.|$|R
50|$|Dominick Noone was {{originally}} from the Ballinamore {{area in the}} east of County Leitrim. Whilst in Derrygonnelly, he {{became a member of}} an illegal Catholic organisation known as the Ribbonmen, an agrarian reform group, but subsequently became an informer for the British Crown. It was on his evidence in 1826 that a number of fellow members were 'transported' to Australia. Despite police protection, he was invited to a wedding party, but then kidnapped and murdered and his body thrown down into the depths of the Sumera. The authorities suspected that his body <b>lay</b> in the <b>shaft,</b> and a man named Cavanagh from Castlecoole, a townland on the outskirts of Enniskillen, accepted a substantial reward to descend the shaft in a rope and creel. Noone's body was found at a depth of 190 ft, and retrieved. The body was then carried to a chapel for a wake but local people blocked the doorway preventing entrance. The murderers of Noone were never caught despite the offer of a £100 award.|$|R
50|$|The {{area that}} is now Meddersheim was settled {{as far back as}} Celtic and Roman times, and perhaps even earlier. Various archaeological finds of {{remnants}} of a Roman estate on Römerstraße (“Roman road”), extensive foundations and an ancient watermain bear witness to this. The current clump village arose in Frankish times (6th century) at a favourable, flat site as a crossroads outside the River Nahe’s floodplain. Until the 13th century, the village of Meddersheim belonged to the Archbishops of Mainz, then passing by way of pledge to the Waldgraves at the Kyrburg (castle). They held it until the French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th century. It was administered by a Mainz Schultheiß who was responsible to the Burgrave at Disibodenberg, or beginning in 1240 in Sobernheim, and thereafter, beginning in 1279 at Castle Böckelheim. In 1239, there was a serious dispute between the Archbishop and the Counts in the Nahe region, who opposed the Prince-Archbishop-Elector’s political reach into the Nahe region. Moreover, there was the disagreement over the pledge of Meddersheim with Kirschroth, which was always bound with Meddersheim. Although the Archbishop redeemed both villages, the Waldgrave at the Kyrburg, as heir to the Counts of Saarbrücken, did not wish to give them up. The Archbishop prevailed, but later, one of his successors pledged the Schultheißerei once again, this time for good. The feudal and tithing rights were always shared out among several lordships. The oldest part of the church, the steeple, comes from the 12th century, while the nave, after several conversions and additions, comes from 1756. Particularly worthy of mention are the pulpit from the 18th century, the 1753 Stumm organ and the 16th-century baptismal font. In 1798, the French overran the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank and imposed their own administrative system on the land. Meddersheim became the seat of a mairie (“mayoralty”) in the Canton of Meisenheim, which also comprised Kirschroth and Staudernheim, and which lay in the Department of Sarre. No later than Napoleonic times, something akin to gavelkind - equal division of land among heirs - was introduced. This led to splintering of businesses and in many cases to impoverishment among smallhold farmers. After Napoleon had been driven out in 1814, Meddersheim was, after a short transitional time, assigned {{under the terms of the}} Congress of Vienna in 1816 to the Oberamt of Meisenheim, and it was then furthermore the seat of an Oberschultheißerei. Thus did Meddersheim become with the Oberamt of Meisenheim an exclave of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. In 1866, it passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Then, in 1869, the region passed to the Kingdom of Prussia, and Meddersheim now belonged to the Meisenheim district in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the Rhine Province. In 1919, after the First World War, the Bürgermeistereien (“Mayoralties”) of Meddersheim and Merxheim were merged. After the Meisenheim district was dissolved in 1932, the Amt (as it had been called since 1927) no longer existed. In 1935, Meddersheim had the same municipal administration - as it were, a “personal union” at the municipal level - but in 1940, the former Amt of Meddersheim was merged with the Amt of Sobernheim, from which arose the Verbandsgemeinde of Sobernheim in 1969. On Lehmkaut (a street), remnants of a brickworks could still be seen until the 1960s. Made here, right in the village, were field-fired bricks. In Andreas Gottfried’s former potter’s shop, pottery was made until 1968. The flax that was extensively grown here on the heaths, whose poorer soils were subjected to controlled burns, was retted in a great flax-retting tank, which is believed to have been communally organized. In the area of Brechkaut and Brechlöcher (laneways?) there were major brick kilns, and at their ends <b>lay</b> the hot-air <b>shaft</b> measuring about 2 × 3 m on which the flax was retted so that it could then be scutched and heckled. The former herdsmen’s houses of the herding association have been gone since the 1950s. Listed for a time within Meddersheim’s limits were five mills and one pig farm. At the Ilsberg was a quarry. The red shale sandstone were quarried until some time towards the end of the 18th century, whereafter yellow-grey quarried sandstone from surrounding villages was used. In the Reformation, the inhabitants of Meddersheim became Protestant under the then local lordship. During renovations at Saint Martin’s Evangelical church in 1964, the Baroque screen around the altar was removed. For generations, the church was shared. During Catholic Mass, the gate was closed. A few epitaphs, a ceiling-high sacramental shrine in the Gothic quire and a Stumm organ, together with a series of pictures on the gallery bear witness to the wealth of this winegrowing, farming and craft village. In 1960, Meddersheim had some 750 inhabitants. By 2010 it was nearly 1,400.|$|R
