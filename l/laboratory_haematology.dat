40|$|International audienceAbstract The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{defined the}} process of care for {{haematological}} malignancies in Improving Outcomes Guidance for Haematological Oncology 2003. The most challenging recommendation has been the requirement to develop integrated laboratory services for accurate diagnosis. This {{is an area of}} NICE guidance that has not been fully achieved. The unified concept of haematological malignancy is recent and based on an understanding of the cellular pathology of the bone marrow and immune systems. Historical UK pathology practice has previously resulted in the separation of <b>laboratory</b> <b>haematology</b> from histopathology and of liquid and tissue specimens. Proposals for re-integration and centralisation with specialist-led, centralised diagnostic and reporting services challenge the fragmented historical model. Accuracy and certainty of diagnosis remains problematic, particularly applying to lymphomas, with evidence that accuracy of diagnosis is slowly improving but still only approaches 85 %. There is a potentially significant human and financial cost of diagnostic errors. No nationwide, validated and comparable epidemiology/population based data exist for accurate and complete ascertainment of new cases of haematological cancers, service planning or clinical outcomes monitoring. This article examines the original rationale behind the NICE guidance and outlines the key components and processes of an integrated diagnostic service...|$|E

40|$|Acute leukaemia is a {{neoplastic}} {{disorder of}} haematopoietic precursors {{characterized by a}} rapid clinical course and a relatively high early death rate in spite of recent therapeutic progress. Prompt and reliable diagnostic and prognostic assessment has a favourable impact on patient outcome. Diagnostic suspicion relies on {{signs and symptoms of}} bone marrow failure or quali-/quantitative abnormalities of blood cells, which are accurately detected by modern automated counters. Cytomorphological examination of a stained blood and bone marrow film {{plays a key role in}} the diagnostic process, with relevant additional information coming from immunophenotyping of blast cells. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic data are the basis of prognostic stratification. In this context, a coordinated intervention of specialized laboratories combining solid expertise in each field involved in the diagnostic work-up is essential; at the same time, the availability of all the required technologies at the same hospital structure would probably lack efficiency due to the low number of tests performed. The organization of laboratory networks, either at regional or national level, especially in the context of clinical trials, may offer a great opportunity for centralization of more sophisticated technologies in reference laboratories, each highly specialized in a particular field of investigation and all interconnected.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have {{gradually}} replaced single studies {{as the highest}} level of documented effectiveness of health care interventions. Systematic reviewing is a new scientific method, concerned with the development and application of methods for identifying relevant literature, analysing the material while increasing validity and precision, and presenting and discussing the results {{in a way that does}} justice to the research question and to the available evidence. The objective of this study was to review the systematic reviews in laboratory medicine, to evaluate the methods applied in these reviews and the applicability of guidelines of the Cochrane Methods Working Group on Screening and Diagnostic Tests, and identify areas for future research. METHODS: All the systematic reviews in the field of clinical chemistry and <b>laboratory</b> <b>haematology</b> that could be identified in Medline, EMBASE and other literature databases up to December 1998, were evaluated. RESULTS: We studied 23 reviews of diagnostic trials. Although all reviews share the same basic methodology, there was a wide variation in the methods applied. There was no consensus on the quality criteria for inclusion of primary studies. The results of the primary studies were heterogeneous in most cases. This was partly due to design flaws in the primary studies, but was also inherent in the diverse study designs in diagnostic trials. We observed differences in the analysis of the factors that cause heterogeneity of the results, and in the summary statistics used to pool the data from the primary studies. The additional diagnostic value of a test, after other test results are taken into consideration, was only addressed in one study. CONCLUSION: This overview of 23 reviews of diagnostic trials identifies areas in the methods of systematic reviewing where consensus is lacking, such as quality rating of primary studies, analysis of heterogeneity between primary studies and pooling of data. Guidelines need to be improved on these point...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: PFA- 100 © {{is useful}} for {{monitoring}} various congenital and acquired platelet dysfunctions, {{and the effect of}} aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However the lack of clinical outcome correlation remains the weakness of this monitor. We previously showed arthroplasty patients taking NSAIDs preoperatively have a wide range of PFA- 100 ©closure times(Ng KFJ et al., 2008) but the different closure times does not seem to correlate with intraoperative blood loss(Ng KFJ et al., 2007). This study aims to correlate different preoperative PFA- 100 © closure times in these patients with postoperative blood loss as measured by drain output, and thus provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its clinical relevance in surgical patients. METHODS: With IRB approval, we recruited patients taking NSAID and undergoing total knee arthroplasty. All patients were allowed to continue the NSAID up to the time of surgery. No LMWH was used. Preoperative blood was taken for PFA- 100 © ADP and epinephrine closure times (ADPCT and EPICT) measurement immediately before surgery. In some patients, the PFA- 100 ©measurement was repeated with the blood sample haemodiluted by 20 % with saline in vitro. Non-closures were assigned ADPCT or EPICT values of 300 s. In addition, preoperative platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen concentrations (FIB) were measured. Surgery was performed by the same group of surgeons in a standardised manner under general anaesthesia. No deliberate hypotension was performed and body temperature was maintained. Before skin closure one drain under low suction was placed. Postoperative output in the drain and surgeon assessment of ease of haemostasis were the outcome measures. Linear correlation was sought between ADPCT and EPICT and these outcome measures. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 30 patients were recruited (age, 66. 3 ± 8. 6; BMI, 27. 4 ± 5. 3; M/F, 7 / 23), representing 51 knee arthroplasties. Mean ADPCT was 120 ± 60 s and EPICT was 199 ± 79. 6 s. There was significant correlation between EPICT, but not ADPCT and drain output in the ward (r = 0. 30; P = 0. 03). The correlation becomes stronger in the haemodiluted sample (r = 0. 42; P = 0. 01). ADPCT also become correlated with drain output in the haemodiluted sample (r = 0. 41; P = 0. 02). There was no correlation between platelet count, PT, aPTT, FIB or surgeon assessment and drain output. CONCLUSIONS: Although previously found not to predict intraoperative blood loss, the EPICT of the PFA- 100 © predicts postoperative drain output in patients taking NSAIDs and undergoing total knee arthrosplasty. The sensitivity of the prediction seems to improve with in vitro haemodilution of the sample before measurement, which probably reflects the clinical postoperative condition better. The lack of proven clinical relevance of the PFA- 100 © has been a major limitation of this monitor. PFA- 100 ©closure times has never been correlated with blood loss during surgery, except in open heart surgery 3. This study provides the first evidence that the PFA- 100 © can actually predict bleeding perioperatively in general surgical patients. It is a useful monitor of platelet function in patients taking NSAIDs presenting for non-cardiac surgery.
