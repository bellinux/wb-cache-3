500|$|... "Till I Die" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Becky Bain of Idolator appreciated the [...] "nice blend of electro and R" [...] {{music in the}} song, writing that it [...] "has a unique sound that's both experimental and easy to <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> to". Andrew Martin of Complex magazine described [...] "Till I Die" [...] as a [...] "laid-back, summer-primed production", while Becca Longmire of Entertainment Wise viewed it as a potential hit. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush complimented the song for having a [...] "nice R groove" [...] and added that [...] "it will certainly get some spins on urban radio". Bene Viera of VH1 praised Brown's verse, writing that [...] "he's seriously {{going to make some}} rappers step up their game". Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review magazine called it one of the many [...] "excellent collaborations" [...] on Fortune.|$|E
500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night. Upon finishing their initial drafts, they presented them {{to the rest of the}} band, who worked on writing parts for their own instruments. In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that was given to me, because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to listen to this, really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> a lot.' All that. Just to see it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Stefani's then-husband Gavin Rossdale {{speaking}} in French and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics describe Stefani talking about [...] "flying first class" [...] and [...] "livin' like a queen". She talks about being luxuriously in love and calls her lover Limousine and Treasure Chest. She talks about the increasing passion {{between her and her}} partner, and says, [...] "Our passion it just multiplies" [...] and [...] "got in the fifth gear, baby". In the chorus she tells that love is getting expensive and she and her partner have to work hard night and day to be rich in love, and after working hard, when they <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> together, they get the payback. After the second verse, the song gets slower and Stefani repeats [...] "Cha-ching, cha-ching" [...] four times alternated with lines talking about getting [...] "hooked up with the love" [...] and [...] "hydroponic love". The song ends with Rossdale speaking more lines in French.|$|E

500|$|He often played {{supporting}} roles, {{rather than}} the lead part. He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." [...] Film critic Pauline Kael declared that [...] "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Silver {{composed}} {{music for}} a television commercial for the drink Tab. Early in 1964, Silver visited Brazil for three weeks, an experience he credited with increasing {{his interest in}} his heritage. In the same year, he created a new quintet, featuring Joe Henderson on tenor saxophone and Carmell Jones on trumpet. This band recorded most of Silver's best-known album, Song for My Father, which reached No. 95 on the Billboard 200 in 1965, and {{was added to the}} Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Recordings and personnel changes – sometimes expanding the band to a sextet – continued in the mid-1960s. In 1966, The Cape Verdean Blues charted at No. 130. The liner notes to the album Serenade to a Soul Sister (1968) included lyrics (written but not sung), indicating a new interest for Silver. His quintet, by then including saxophonist Bennie Maupin, trumpeter Randy Brecker, bassist John Williams, and drummer Billy Cobham, toured parts of Europe in October and November 1968, sponsored by the U.S. government. They also recorded one of Silver's last quintet albums for Blue Note, You Gotta Take a Little Love. The Penguin Guide to Jazzs retrospective summary of Silver's main Blue Note recordings was that they were of a consistently high standard: [...] "each album yields one or two themes that haunt the mind, each usually has a particularly pretty ballad, and they all <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> on a deep pile of solid riffs and workmanlike solos." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Vice Admiralty Court was a {{prerogative}} court {{established in}} the early 18th century in the colony of New South Wales, which {{was to become a}} state of Australia. [...] A vice admiralty court is in effect an admiralty court. [...] The word “vice” {{in the name of the}} court denoted that the court represented the Lord Admiral of the United Kingdom. [...] In English legal theory, the Lord Admiral, as vice-regal of the monarch, was the only person who had authority over matters relating to the sea. [...] The Lord Admiral would authorize others as his deputies or surrogates to act. [...] Generally, he would appoint a person as a judge to sit in the Court as his surrogate. [...] By appointing Vice-Admirals in the colonies, and by constituting courts as Vice-Admiralty Courts, the terminology recognized that the existence and superiority of the “mother” court in the United Kingdom. [...] Thus, the “vice” tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the “mother” court. [...] In the case of the New South Wales court, a right of appeal <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> to the British Admiralty Court, which further reinforced this superiority. [...] In all respects, the court was an Imperial court rather than a local Colonial court.|$|E
2500|$|The November 1988 {{edition of}} Top magazine, run by Tower Records, {{included}} a review by Simon Young who thought Enya had produced [...] "a fine, peaceful New Age album, which works best when her voice-from-heaven is matched with subtle electronic pools {{of sound and}} layer upon layer of breathy, Clannadesque backing vocals". Jonathan Takiff, for the Philadelphia Daily News, started his review with: [...] "When this old world starts getting you down, just lay on ... Watermark ... and drift away to a blissful state", of which Enya brings a [...] "fusion of old sod balladry and modem technology to another plateau, with a magical, mysterious brew that could be dubbed [...] "New Age Irish" [...] or [...] "Celtic Ambient"". Takiff picked [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] as the stand out song, and called [...] "River" [...] a [...] "blissful intrumental". He concluded with: [...] "There's nothing uptempo to ever jar the hypnotic ebb and flow. Just <b>lay</b> <b>back</b> and let this music roll all over you." [...] In a review printed in The Boston Globe, Steve Morse wrote about the album highly. He called the record a [...] "series of lush dreamscapes that team the vocal beauty of Irish traditional song with multitracked synthesizer tones", and compared it to works from fellow ambient and new age artists Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Brian Eno. Its sound, he thought, is [...] "beautiful" [...] and noticed a recurrence of the imagery of water throughout. Morse concluded, [...] "This is an album of atmospheres – true mood music for the soul".|$|E

5000|$|Other {{critics were}} more {{forgiving}} of the albums lyrics while equally heartened by the records musicality. Writing for Drop-D Magazine, critic Paul Watkin gave the album a favorable review, describing it as [...] "straight out, rapid fire punk, {{with the boys}} <b>laying</b> <b>back</b> into the crunchy guitars to highlight the choruses and screaming out back-up vocals." [...] Watkin concludes that [...] "FYULABA is good and sincere and has some things to say." ...|$|R

5000|$|Marshall teaches {{and advocates}} a {{pitching}} method he developed that he [...] "believes could completely eradicate pitching-arm injuries." [...] He wants pitchers {{to have a}} smooth transition. To pitch the arm has to externally rotate (hand <b>lays</b> <b>back)</b> before the ball accelerates. With traditional pitchers the thrower often lifts his elbow before his hand (also called scapula loading); {{this leads to the}} ball coming up late and the arm to externally rotate late. The elbow will be accelerated forward while the hand still goes backward, which creates enormous stress on the arm.|$|R
