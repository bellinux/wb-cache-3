25|$|All this {{tends to}} characterise “L’Adone” as a {{labyrinth}} of entangled situations without any real structure. The lengthy Canto XX, which takes place after the protagonist's death, serves to undermine any pretence to narrative unity. But this very lack of unity constitutes Marino's narrative innovation. The poet composes his work using various levels and passes from one episode to the next without any apparent <b>logical</b> <b>connection,</b> basing the links solely on a language rich in hyperboles, antitheses and metaphors.|$|E
25|$|The {{advocates of}} the Tübingen School have intensively {{examined}} the scattered evidence and testimony in the sources in order to reconstruct the principles of Plato's unwritten doctrines. They see in these teachings the core of Plato's philosophy and have reached a fairly settled picture of their fundamentals, though many important details remain unknown or controversial. A notable feature of the Tübingen paradigm is the contention that the unwritten doctrines are not unrelated to the written doctrines, rather there is a close and <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> between them.|$|E

There is no <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> between these two complexes of ideas, and scholars do not have any answers to the question whether the dead would remain for some time in the grave and later depart for the realm of the dead, what the purpose of the grave goods was, or if the ship in the barrow was to transport the deceased {{to the realm of}} the dead.|$|E

500|$|Otto Rössler, a German {{chemistry}} {{professor at}} the University of Tübingen, argues that micro black holes created in the LHC could grow exponentially. On 4 July 2008, Rössler met with a CERN physicist, Rolf Landua, with whom he discussed his safety concerns. Following the meeting, Landua asked another expert, Hermann Nicolai, Director of the Albert Einstein Institute, in Germany, to examine Rössler's arguments. Nicolai reviewed Otto Rössler's research paper on {{the safety of the}} LHC and issued a statement highlighting logical inconsistencies and physical misunderstandings in Rössler's arguments. Nicolai concluded that [...] "this text would not pass the referee process in a serious journal." [...] Domenico Giulini also commented with Hermann Nicolai on Otto Rössler's thesis, concluding that [...] "his argument concerns only the General Theory of Relativity (GRT), and makes no <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> to LHC physics; the argument is not valid; the argument is not self-consistent." [...] On , a group of German physicists, the Committee for Elementary Particle Physics (KET), published an open letter further dismissing Rössler's concerns and carrying assurances that the LHC is safe. Otto Rössler was due to meet Swiss president Pascal Couchepin in August 2008 to discuss this concern, but it was later reported that the meeting had been canceled as it was believed Rössler and his fellow opponents would have used the meeting for their own publicity.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviews of}} the film were mostly {{positive}} (receiving an 83% rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes), Mulholland Drive was not without its detractors. Rex Reed of The New York Observer {{said that it was}} the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it [...] "a load of moronic and incoherent garbage." [...] In New York, Peter Rainer observed, [...] "Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it's still a pretty moribund ride... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while." [...] In The Washington Post, Desson Howe called it [...] "an extended mood opera, if you want to put an arty label on incoherence." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety found much to praise—"Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best"—but also noted, [...] "the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland... for the final 45minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from Twin Peaks and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement." [...] James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: [...] "Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us." [...] Film theorist Ray Carney notes, [...] "You wouldn't need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldn't need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls." ...|$|E

Thus, the poultry were outside of Congress's authoritative reach unless Schechter's business had a direct and <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> to interstate commerce, per the Shreveport Rate Case. Hughes used a direct/indirect effect analysis to determine the Schechters' business was not within the reach of congressional regulation.|$|E

Believing, like many other children, that nobody cared particularly for him, except to RESTRAIN him, discovering, as children do, much sooner than we complacently imagine, that love and preference have no <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> with desert or character, Clarence became boyishly reckless.

6000|$|But {{the worst}} and widest {{impediment}} still remains. It is the predominance of a popular philosophy, at once the counterfeit and the mortal enemy of all true and manly metaphysical research. It is that corruption, introduced by certain immethodical aphorisming eclectics, who, dismissing not only all system, but all <b>logical</b> <b>connection,</b> pick and choose whatever is most plausible and showy; who select, whatever words can have some semblance of sense attached to them without the least expenditure of thought; in short whatever may enable men to talk {{of what they do}} not understand, with a careful avoidance of every thing that might awaken them to a moment's suspicion of their ignorance. This alas! is an irremediable disease, for it brings with it, not so much an indisposition to any particular system, but an utter loss of taste and faculty for all system and for all philosophy.

60|$|This great idea, then, is the {{backbone}} of all folk-lore--the idea that all happiness hangs on one thin veto; all positive joy depends on one negative. Now, {{it is obvious that}} there are many philosophical and religious ideas akin to or symbolised by this; but it is not with them I wish to deal here. It is surely obvious that all ethics ought to be taught to this fairy-tale tune; that, if one does the thing forbidden, one imperils all the things provided. A man who breaks his promise to his wife ought to be reminded that, even if she is a cat, the case of the fairy-cat shows that such conduct may be incautious. A burglar just about to open some one else's safe should be playfully reminded that he is in the perilous posture of the beautiful Pandora: he is about to lift the forbidden lid and loosen evils unknown. The boy eating some one's apples in some one's apple tree should be a reminder that he has come to a mystical moment of his life, when one apple may rob him of all others. This is the profound morality of fairy-tales; which, so far from being lawless, go to the root of all law. Instead of finding (like common books of ethics) a rationalistic basis for each Commandment, they find the great mystical basis for all Commandments. We are in this fairyland on sufferance; it is not for us to quarrel with the conditions under which we enjoy this wild vision of the world. The vetoes are indeed extraordinary, but then so are the concessions. The idea of property, the idea of some one else's apples, is a rum idea; but then the idea of there being any apples is a rum idea. It is strange and weird that I cannot with safety drink ten bottles of champagne; but then the champagne itself is strange and weird, if you come to that. If I have drunk of the fairies' drink it is but just I should drink by the fairies' rules. We may not see the direct <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> between three beautiful silver spoons and a large ugly policeman; but then who in fairy tales ever could see the direct <b>logical</b> <b>connection</b> between three bears and a giant, or between a rose and a roaring beast? Not only can these fairy-tales be enjoyed because they are moral, but morality can be enjoyed because it puts us in fairyland, in a world at once of wonder and of war.|$|E

Twenty undergraduate Psychology students participated in this preliminary study in investigating domain knowledge and content presentation influence on Hypertext (web) site traversal behavior. Classical data analysis (ANOVA) were used to explore these qualitative phenomena.
