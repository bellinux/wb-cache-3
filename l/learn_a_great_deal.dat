5|$|During their expeditions aboard Mir, {{the astronauts}} carried out various experiments, {{including}} growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds {{of photographs of}} the Earth spinning serenely beneath them. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the aging station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks. In all, the American astronauts would spend almost a thousand days aboard Mir, allowing NASA to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> about long-duration spaceflight, particularly {{in the areas of}} astronaut psychology and how best to arrange experiment schedules for crews aboard space stations.|$|E
5|$|The first Space Shuttle {{flight to}} Mir was a {{rendezvous}} mission without docking on STS-63. This was followed {{during the course}} of the project by a total of 9 Shuttle-Mir docking missions, from STS-71 to STS-91. The Shuttle rotated crews and delivered supplies, and one mission, STS-74, carried a docking module and a pair of solar arrays to Mir. Various scientific experiments were also conducted, both on shuttle flights and long-term aboard the station. The project also saw the launch of two new modules, Spektr and Priroda, to Mir, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed NASA and the Roskosmos to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> about how best to work with international partners in space and how to minimize the risks associated with assembling a large space station in orbit, as would have to be done with the ISS.|$|E

Mikhail Botvinnik, three times world chess champion, wrote in his book Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning that the Kotok–McCarthy program's [...] "rule for rejecting moves was so {{constituted}} that the machine threw the baby out with the bath water." [...] The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt, who later wrote Mac Hack, which beat a person in tournament play, and more recently, from Hans Berliner, when he looked back on it in 2005. During the Cold War, Kotok-McCarthy played (and lost to) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs.|$|E

2500|$|After Kennedy {{graduated}} from Harvard in 1912 with an A.B. in economics, {{he took his}} first job as a state-employed bank examiner; this allowed him to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> about the banking industry. In 1913, the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, was under threat of takeover. Kennedy borrowed $45,000 ($ today) {{from family and friends}} and bought back control. At age 25, he was rewarded by being elected the bank's president. Kennedy told the press he was [...] "the youngest" [...] bank president in America.|$|E

Despite its controversial story, {{the film has}} been praised by film critics such as Ebert, who said: [...] "The Birth of a Nation {{is not a bad}} film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> about film, and even something about evil." [...] The website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% approval rating.|$|E

2500|$|A {{search engine}} takes {{all of its}} users and assigns each one a {{specific}} ID number. Those {{in control of the}} database often keep records of where on the Internet each member has traveled to. [...] AOL’s system is one example. AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isn’t known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch.

[...] Nissenthall and his bodyguards failed to enter the radar station due to strong defences, but Nissenthall was able to crawl up {{to the rear of the}} station under enemy fire and cut all telephone wires leading to it. This forced the crew inside to resort to radio transmissions to talk to their commanders, transmissions which were intercepted by listening posts on the south coast of England. The Allies were able to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> about the location and density of German radar stations along the channel coast thanks to this one single act, which helped to convince Allied commanders of the importance of developing radar jamming technology. Of this small unit, only Nissenthall and one other returned safely to England. After the war Jack Nissenthall shortened his surname to Nissen.|$|E
2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, {{but it is a}} matter of being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing. [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.|$|E
