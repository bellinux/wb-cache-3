500|$|Cameron {{said that}} he wanted to make [...] "something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the {{adventure}} and all that" [...] but also have a conscience [...] "that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the way you interact with nature and your fellow man". He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. Everybody seems to know a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> everything and that's how we process information now. This just reflects that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1991 Miguel {{released}} his eighth studio album, Romance, {{a collection of}} classic boleros, the oldest of which originated in the 1940s. The album, which was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre {{and was the first}} record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance. When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied [...] "I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> those boleros that everyone knows". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to [...] "discuss the works, the themes, and melodies;...The creation of an album has to be part of me or else I {{would not be able to}} interpret it, or sing in it".|$|E
500|$|To promote Beyond the Sea, Spacey and Phil Ramone {{devised a}} 12-city United States concert tour titled An Evening Celebrating the Music of Bobby Darin, which {{consisted}} of Spacey performing with a 19-piece band. [...] "It's me singing Bobby and talking about Bobby and talking a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the movie," [...] Spacey explained in June 2004. Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's another thing {{to go out and}} attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good." [...] The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.|$|E
500|$|Around 1895, {{football}} {{was introduced in}} the Philippines by English sportsmen. [...] In addition, some Filipinos sent to college in Hong Kong and China returned home and taught their friends a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the game of football. [...] Within a year, there were two or three football clubs established in Manila. In 1898, the U.S. Navy battleship Maine was anchored in Havana harbor to protect the Americans from a riot between Cuba and Spanish officers, and after the ship sank resulting in significant casualties, the Americans declared war against Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War. They damaged every ship in Manila Bay, This ended Spanish colonization of the Philippines, and replaced the colonizing Spaniards with Americans. When the war broke out, those football teams disbanded and abandoned the city, either to save themselves and their families from the bombardment they expected at any moment, or to cast their lot with the Filipino troops outside the city limits. After the war when peace reigned again, six football teams were formed, among them the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, and the Manila Jockey Club. In 1906, the Sandow football team was established (further developed as Sandow Athletic Club in 1909).|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} The Lion King was {{conceived}} in late 1988 during {{a conversation between}} Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider {{on a plane to}} Europe to promote Oliver & Company. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea. The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink. Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, [...] "It is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> myself." [...] In November of that year Thomas Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari, and afterwards, Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle. The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah, and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends. Simba would also not leave the kingdom but become a [...] "lazy, slovenly, horrible character" [...] due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under, decided to attach himself to the project [...] "because lions are cool". Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to [...] "an animated National Geographic special".|$|E
500|$|Castiel {{typically}} displays {{very little}} emotion and always exhibits an extremely somber disposition. Although {{it has been}} suggested angels possibly do not possess the ability to truly feel emotion, Castiel frequently exhibits affection towards Dean. This attachment and growing ability to feel even causes him to be [...] "demoted", as his superiors fear emotions are clouding his judgment. Throughout his appearances in the fourth season, he also seems to, at the very least, come close to expressing regret, hesitance, and anger several times, and has once quietly laughed at a joke Dean made in [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester". Actor Misha Collins feels, through Dean, [...] " [...] learning a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> humanity and re-learning something about [...] own humanity from that exposure. So...there's a humanizing of Castiel going on." [...] Castiel begins having an internal struggle between what is right and what is wrong, and whether or not to obey orders from Heaven. Collins feels this is because interactions with Sam and Dean have made the angel [...] "uncertain" [...] and [...] "more fragile". Collins believes Castiel envies Dean's decisiveness and desires to emulate him. Having lost his connection to Heaven in the fifth season, Castiel's humanization seems to have quickened by the episode [...] "Free to Be You and Me", as he appears extremely anxious while in a whorehouse, is visibly distraught when asking Dean for help, and refers to the Archangel Raphael as [...] "my little bitch". Despite becoming very arrogant when he becomes the [...] "new God", Castiel still shows his caring side and ultimately returns the souls to Purgatory and shows remorse for his actions, promising to Dean {{to find a way to}} redeem himself in Dean's eyes, showing that he cares about how Dean views him. After losing his memory, Castiel is more human than ever, but still displays some of his emotionless side. [...] After his memory returns, he shows real regret when he can't undo the damage he did to Sam and essentially sacrifices himself to save him out of remorse for his actions. After Castiel wakes up from his catatonic state, he is now depicted as insane with tendencies to ramble about random topics. [...] However, parts of Castiel's original personality are still shown with him still being happy to help Sam and Dean out and still knowledgeable about various supernatural things, but not willing to actually fight anymore even when his life is threatened. Castiel describes himself as [...] "bad luck" [...] and doesn't believe he should be around the Winchesters as a result. After traveling to Purgatory, Castiel regained his sanity, but still carries a lot of guilt about his previous actions. He is also now less distant from Sam and Dean and more appreciative of human things such as television.|$|E

2500|$|Nintendo World Report {{described}} the Mario Artist series as a [...] "spiritual successor to Mario Paint". IGN collectively describes the Mario Artist suite as a layperson's analog to professional quality graphics development software. They {{state that the}} combination of the 64DD's mass writability and the Nintendo 64's 3D graphics allows Nintendo to [...] "leave CD systems behind", by offering [...] "something that couldn't be done on any other gaming console on the market" [...] to people [...] "who want to unleash their creative talents and perhaps learn a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> graphics design on the side". The designer of Paint Studio, Software Creations, roughly estimates that 7,500 copies of that game may have been sold.|$|E
2500|$|Vocalist Ronnie Radke {{had been}} hinting on Twitter {{that the group}} {{had been working on}} the band's second album, with tweets such as [...] "You guys don't {{understand}} how many light years my next album is from the last one". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, [...] "The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind." [...] During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also {{said in an interview that}} the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang!
