ABSTRACT: Door closing mechanisms are used in all building venues using air conditioning systems to reduce thermal losses. One of the closing mechanisms is the torsional type. The visco-elastic characteristics of the closing mechanism may exhibit certain sort of nonlinearities from its <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The dynamics of the door with nonlinear characteristic with positive and negative deviation from the <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the door closing mechanism are studied. The system dynamics are defined by a nonlinear ordinary second-order differential equation which is solved using Runge-Kutta 4 technique through the MATLAB environment. Two types of nonlinearity are considered depending on the deviation from the <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the closing mechanism. One type reveals dynamic behaviour {{similar to that of}} overdamped linear dynamic system while the other type reveals dynamic behaviour similar to that of underdamped linear dynamic system. The second type has large effect on the door dynamics where the maximum deviation in the door dynamic response may exceed 700 % from the <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the door...|$|R

For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic).</b> Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.. [...] Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.|$|E

The first iteration of the model is based on our observation that for sufficiently large s-boxes, the best <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> usually involves one active s-box per round. We obtain a result which allows us to compute an upper bound on the probability that linear cryptanalysis using such a characteristic is feasible, {{as a function of the}} number of rounds. We then generalize this result, upper bounding the probability that linear cryptanalysis is feasible when any <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> may be used (no restriction on the number of active s-boxes). The work of this paper indicates that the basic SPN structure provides good security against linear cryptanalysis based on linear characteristics after a reasonably small number of rounds. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Differential and linear {{cryptanalysis}} are {{the general}} purpose tools to analyze various cryptographic primitives. Both techniques {{have in common}} that they rely {{on the existence of}} good differential or <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The difficulty of finding such characteristics depends on the primitive. For instance, AES is designed to be resistant against dif-ferential and linear attacks and therefore, provides upper bounds on the probability of possible <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics.</b> On the other hand, we have primitives like SHA- 1, SHA- 2, and Keccak, where finding good and useful characteristics is an open problem. This becomes particularly in-teresting when considering, for example, competitions like CAESAR. In such competitions, many cryptographic primitives are waiting for anal-ysis. Without suitable automatic tools, this is a virtually infeasible job. In recent years, various tools have been introduced to search for charac-teristics. The majority of these only deal with differential characteristics. In this work, we present a heuristic search tool which is capable of find-ing <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics</b> even for primitives with a relatively large state, and without a strongly aligned structure. As a proof of concept, we ap-ply the presented tool on the underlying permutations of the first roun...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} new general {{techniques}} for practical security evaluation against differential and linear cryptanalysis for an extensive class of block ciphers {{similar to the}} cipher GOST. We obtain upper bounds of the average differential and <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> probabilities for an arbitrary GOST-like cipher. The obtained bounds have similar form to the upper bounds of the average differential and <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> probabilities known for some Markov Feistel ciphers. But, the expressions of our bounds contain new parameters (different from the classical differential and linear probabilities) of the cipher’s s-boxes. These parameters are very natural for GOST-like ciphers, since they inherit {{the type of operation}} (key addition modulo 2 m) used in these ciphers. The methods our proofs are based on are of independent interest and can be used for investigation both of a wider class of block ciphers and of a wider class of attacks. Application of our results to GOST shows that maximum values of the average differential and <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> probabilities of this cipher (with 32 rounds and some s-boxes) are bounded by 2 − 59. 57 and 2 − 42, respectively. The last two estimates of practical security of GOST against the differential and linear cryptanalysis are not quite impressive. But, as far as we know, they are the best of such estimates obtained by an accurate mathematical proof. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} {{security}} of the block cipher Camellia against differential attack and linear attack. The security of Camellia against these attacks has been evaluated by upper bounds of maximum differential characteristic probability (MDCP) and maximum <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> probability (MLCP) calculated by the least numbers of active S-boxes which are found by a search method[2]. However, we found some truncated differential paths generated by the method have wrong properties. We show a new evaluation method for truncated differential and linear paths to discard such wrong paths by using linear equations systems and sets of nonzero conditions. By applying this technique to Camellia, we found tighter upper bounds of MDCP and MLCP for reduced-round Camellia. As a result, 10 -round Camellia without F L/F L − 1 has no differential and <b>linear</b> <b>characteristic</b> with probability higher than 2 − 128. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In IACR ePrint 2014 / 747, {{a method}} for {{constructing}} mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models whose feasible regions are exactly the sets of all possible differential (or <b>linear)</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{for a wide range}} of block ciphers is presented. These models can be used to search for or enumerate differential and <b>linear</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a block cipher automatically. However, for the case of SIMON (a lightweight block cipher designed by the U. S. National Security Agency), the method proposed in IACR ePrint 2014 / 747 is not exact anymore. That is, the feasible region of the MILP model constructed for SIMON contains in-valid differential characteristics due to the dependent input bits of the AND operations, and these invalid characteristics must be filtered out by other methods. This is a very inconvenient process and reduces the level of automation of the framework of MILP-based automatic differen-tial analysis. In this paper, by using quadratic constraints or constraints from the H-representation of a specific convex hull, we give {{a method for}} constructing mixed-integer (non) linear programming models whose feasible regions are exactly the sets of all valid differential characteristics for SIMON. The technique presented in this paper may be also useful for other ciphers.

This study suggests that H needs to be adopted as a criterion of hydraulic similitude for modeling sediment (bed-load) transport in alluvial channels. © 2006 ASCE...|$|E
