The aim was to investigate the effect of the cone <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> on the flow pattern and t 500.

These forces are scaled or specified prior to the object moving, that is, before sensory feedback information about the object 2 ̆ 7 s weight is available. Sensorimotor memories are relied on to provide relevant information about an object 2 ̆ 7 s density and weight if the object was previously manipulated. It is well established that young adults accurately scale their forces based on visual size cues. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if old adults scale their forces to the size of the object or if they rely on sensorimotor memory of the previous object 2 ̆ 7 s weight. There are reports of impaired visuomotor programing for grasp and lift in old adults. In the present study old and young subjects were required to lift four different sized bottles of constant density from a force plate and then place the object on a shelf. Two experiments were performed. Experiment one featured blocks of lifts for three bottles in the following order: large, small and medium. Experiment two took place fifteen minutes after experiment one and featured a bottle slightly larger than the medium bottle used at the end of the experiment one. The second experiment addressed whether imperceptible changes in size cause changes in predictive force scaling. Peak load force rate in the first force pulse (prior to lift-off) was measured for each lift of the objects with the focus being on the initial and last lift of each bottle. Both experiments presented a significant effect for bottle size on <b>lift</b> force <b>rates.</b> This result was found regardless of age. It provides additional support that young adults accurately scale their <b>lift</b> force <b>rate</b> based on the visual size cues of the object. Old adults also demonstrated scaling of their <b>lift</b> force <b>rates</b> based on bottle size which failed to support the hypothesis that old adults would merely reproduce their <b>lift</b> force <b>rates</b> from the previous lift with a different object. While both young and old scale lift forces to object size, the old demonstrated a trend for utilizing high <b>lift</b> force <b>rates</b> throughout the experiment as well as greater differences in <b>lift</b> force <b>rate</b> between the initial lift with an object and the final lift with the same object. Most subjects utilized a target strategy in which they produced a single peak <b>lift</b> force <b>rate</b> pulse.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} stable trunk kinematics, humans must generate appropriate motor {{patterns to}} effectively control muscle force and stiffness {{and respond to}} biomechanical perturba-tions and/or neuromuscular control errors. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand physiolog-ical variables such as muscle force and stiffness, and how these relate to the downstream production of stable spine and trunk movements. This study was designed to assess the local dynamic stability of spine muscle activation and rotational stiffness patterns using Lyapunov analyses, and relationships to the local dynamic stability of resulting spine kinematics, during repetitive lifting and lowering at varying combinations of <b>lifting</b> load and <b>rate.</b> With an increase in the load lifted at a constant rate there was a trend for decreased local dynamic stability of spine muscle activations and the muscular contribu-tions to spine rotational stiffness; although the only significant change was for the full state space muscle activation stability (p< 0. 05). With an increase in <b>lifting</b> <b>rate</b> with a constant load there was a significant decrease in the local dynamic stability of spine mus-cle activations and the muscular contributions to spine rotational stiffness (p 0. 001 for all measures).

40|$|The present Master's Thesis {{describes}} a {{further development of}} a Network Solver that checks if a certain oil rate is feasible for a given reservoir pressure. Reservoir pressure and surface formation rates are the inputs to the Solver. These inputs may be generated from software (Eclipse or similar) or tables. In the "main. m" script of the Solver all inputs and properties of the fluids (at surface), the reservoir and the network may be specified by the user. If the production rate cannot be attained with the given input data, the Solver tries to find a gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> {{that will make the}} production feasible. If the maximum gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> is exceeded, the formation rate will be lowered until a feasible solution is found. Economics is not part of this Solver yet, thus instead of comparing oil- and gas prices to find the optimal solution, the Solver assumes that "oil is more valuable than gas". Therefore, once the maximum gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> is exceeded, the gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> will be kept at maximum while the Solver is trying to find the highest formation rate possible. The Network Solver consists of two main parts: A simulator that, based on mathematical correlations, calculates pressure values in the entire network for the given inputs, and an Optimizer that tries to find the best, feasible formation- and lift rates. Only the Network Simulator is further developed in this master thesis project, the Network Optimizer is unchanged. Four additions have been made to the Network Solver: A mechanistic approach for pressure drop calculations have been included {{as an alternative to the}} Beggs and Brill method, heat transfer calculation and temperature drop have been included in the pipes, a Compositional Model has been included as an alternative to the the black oil model, and a simple reservoir Material Balance Model has been added. The mechanistic pressure drop calculations are shown to be more accurate than the Beggs and Brill method. The calculated pressure and temperature profiles correspond well with commercial software used in industry. The Compositional Model provides accurate calculations of local fluid properties, but the runtime is slow compared to the black oil model. The Material Balance Model is a simple, but useful addition to the software suite. It has its limitations, but works well together with the Network Solver. The Network Solver developed may be further improved by including an economical aspect, by improving the runtime of the Compositional Model, and by exchanging the Material Balance Model for a more elaborate material balance program...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the steps taken to develop normal strength (30 - 80 MPa) selfcompacting concrete mixes with 20 mm maximum size aggregate. For the selfcompacting concrete mixes with 20 mm maximum size of aggregate fulfilment {{of the flow}} and cohesiveness criteria are found insufficient for the mix design. It is found that they must additionally meet the passing ability criterion. A Lagrangian particle based method, the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), is used to simulate the flow of SCC mixes. An incompressible SPH method is employed to simulate the flow of such non-Newtonian fluids whose behaviour is described by a Bingham-type model, in which the kink in the shear stress versus shear strain rate diagram is first appropriately smoothed out. The basic equations solved in the SPH are the incompressible mass conservation and Navier-Stokes equations. The yield stress of SCC mixes is predicted in an inverse manner using the SPH simulation methodology and matching the measured and simulated t 500, tstop and the final spread of the cone flow test. It is found that the yield stress of SCC mixes varies only slightly {{with an increase in}} the characteristic compressive strength of the mix. The plastic viscosity on the other hand shows a marked increase. The latter was estimated by a micromechanical procedure proposed by Ghanbari & Karihaloo (2009) based on the measured viscosity of the cement paste alone and on the volume fractions of the mix constituents. The SPH simulation methodology was also used for predicting the distribution of large coarse aggregates in the cone spread. This distribution was found to be indeed very similar to that revealed in the cut sections of the hardened test cone spread. These large coarse aggregates had been painted with non-toxic non-water soluble paints prior to being used in the test mix. The simulation of SCC mixes revealed that the cone <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> in the slump flow test has a significant effect on the flow pattern and the measured t 500.

40|$|Reservoir {{models are}} used for {{understanding}} and prediction of reservoir performance. The Jette dynamic reservoir model were not capable of representing reservoir performance at Jette and experienced problems with prediction of reservoir performance. Oil production at Jette were overestimated and it was of interest to history match the Jette dynamic reservoir model {{in order to increase}} understanding and obtain a more realistic representation of the reservoir. 	In this thesis, the upscaled Jette dynamic reservoir model from project work by Lorentzen (2013) has been manually history matched. Perturbations to the model have been performed in a trial and error fashion, in accordance with the most recent geologic understanding and knowledge of the Jette reservoir. Attention has been focused on validation of model input as well as only making realistic changes to the model in order to obtain a reasonable representation of the Jette reservoir. 	Most perturbations during history matching of the Jette dynamic reservoir model were performed using Petrel, a complementary software to the ECLIPSE 100 reservoir simulator used to run the Jette model. During validation of input, reservoir characterization were improved by replacing the old fluid model with two new fluid models and establishing a compartmentalized reservoir by inclusion of sealing faults. As a result of this, new lift curves were created in order to run the model constrained by tubinghead pressure during prediction of reservoir performance. Updates to well completions were also needed. The main history matching parameters have been permeability, aquifer size and connectivity in addition to vertical flow barriers representing black shales and calcite stringers. Permeability has been perturbed according to interpreted well tests in order to promote linear flow. 	The Jette dynamic reservoir model is considered to be successfully history matched. Well D- 1 H is capable of accurately replicating historical performance data when running constrained from both allocated oil rate and tubinghead pressure. Well E- 1 H also experience a reasonable match. However, with a slight mismatch in water production and bottomhole pressure from 15 th of November 2013, possibly caused by an overestimate of oil in the model. 	Prediction of reservoir performance at Jette, using the history matched model, were performed for the period between 1 st of March 2014 and 1 st of January 2020. Prediction runs were constrained by tubinghead pressure and no seam effect was observed when crossing over from history mode. However, oil production in well E- 1 H is slightly overestimated. A total of four prediction scenarios were selected to investigate the effect of gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> at Jette, they found oil production to increase with increasing gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate.</b> 	History matching of the Jette dynamic reservoir model has established {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms controlling reservoir behavior at Jette.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of smart fields new tools for {{monitoring}} and field management were needed. Integrated asset modelling allows improving {{the understanding of the}} field’s performance and production network, fluid flow behaviour and optimization at any stage and level during the life of the field. This approach enables the optimization of production by adjusting control parameters taking into account surface facilities constraints and the interactions between surface and subsurface systems. Using material balance modelling as a tool for history matching, the Fensfjord reservoir showed that the North and West tanks are behaving as separate compartments. There is some communication between the South and Central tanks and that the aquifer is giving some support to the North and South but not to the Central tank. In this work, given the design of the integrated model and the hierarchical structure of the software it is best to define the objective function, control variables and constraints within each application which has its own optimizer.

The field presents several unique challenges, such as low reservoir pressure, very shallow reservoir depth and remoteness from the available infrastructure. The study used a homogeneous reservoir simulation model built during the Specialization Project. Some of the crucial data, such as porosity, permeability and horizontal-to-vertical permeability ratio had a huge uncertainty involved in it. In order to account for this, 27 reservoir models {{with a combination of}} those uncertain properties were constructed and integrated with the 3 production network models. As a result, 81 integrated models were run and the oil production data was then used to evaluate the NPV (Net Present Value) of each of the considered cases. 3 production network models have been used for the analysis wells with no artificial lift, wells with gas lift and subsea multiphase boosting. Gas <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> optimization study was conducted to maximize the production and the economics of this development option. Multiphase booster pump power requirements, which would meet the field operational conditions were also determined. NPV was set as an objective to decide on the most preferable development alternative. The capital expenditures for each of the development options were estimated with a commercial software, which was available for a limited period. The CAPEX values were then used in NPV calculations. A simplified EXCEL tool was also developed for estimation of capital expenditures. The motivation for this was to have a robust tool for CAPEX calculations after the student license of the commercial software was set to expire. The output of the developed simplified tool was then compared to and tuned with the output from the commercial software.

40|$|Gas-solid risers {{have been}} {{extensively}} used as multiphase reactors in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system such as {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC). In FCC, a riser facilitates cracking reactions which take place between fluidized catalyst and vaporised vacuum gas oil. Similarly in CFBC, combustion of coal particle occurs in the riser. The gas-solid flow hydrodynamics in riser plays a dominant role in governing {{the conversion of the}} chemical process, and in turn the performance of the CFB system. Therefore, several experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the hydrodynamics of riser. Since experimental studies have been costlier and time consuming, detailed hydrodynamic modelling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a promising alternative to investigate flows in riser. Two types of CFD models can be identified i. e. (i) Eulerian-Langrangian (EL) and (ii) Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) models. The Eulerian-Eulerian model considers both phases as interpenetrating continua. As a result, it allows a use of grid size larger than length scales of the flow structures. Therefore, this approach requires less computational power, and can handle large-scale geometry. Due to its computational edge, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach has been widely used to conduct the CFD simulations of gas-solid flows in riser. A literature review on the previous simulation studies revealed several shortcomings, and therefore, investigations on the impact of different modelling parameters were found to be necessary before applying the EE model to industrial-scale simulations. In this study, the EE gas-solid flow model has been used to carry out CFD simulations of risers. The effect of modelling parameters such as boundary conditions, drag models and solid phase closure models have been investigated. Finally, the EE model has been used to carry out industrial scale simulation of the lift engager to study the parametric effect of the lift gas velocity on the catalyst <b>lift</b> <b>rate.</b> The effect of inlet boundary conditions was investigated by using three different types of inlets for both gas and solid phases. The inlet arrangements {{had a profound effect on}} mixing patterns of two phases and energy balances in 2 D riser. Furthermore, the effect of wall boundary conditions was also studied by considering the wall as a partial-slip or no-slip wall for the solid phase. A 3 D full-scale riser was also simulated by implementing the boundary conditions similar to the experimental set-up. Although both 2 D and 3 D simulations could qualitatively predict the radial profiles of solid velocity and volume fraction, they could not predict even qualitative trend of the axial profile of solid volume fractions. Previous studies (Yang et al., 2004, Andrews Iv et al., 2005) showed that the conventional drag model such as that of Gidaspow’s could not capture the axial heterogeneity; however a use of the multiscale drag could remove this draw back. Thus, the drag derived using the energy minimization multi-scale approach was evaluated in another part of the study. The structure-based drag models could capture both axial and radial profiles of voidages, but only qualitatively. Furthermore, the use of different cluster diameter correlations with the EMMS framework gave more accurate predictions with reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the EE model was applied to study hydrodynamics of a complex industrial-scale lift engager. In this part, the effect of lift gas velocity on the catalyst <b>lift</b> <b>rate</b> and fluctuations therein were investigated to optimise operating gas velocity. Before conducting the parametric study, the effects of modeling parameters such as drag models and frictional pressure models on the hydrodynamics of the lift engager were also investigated. In summary, the study has been conducted by performing rigorous CFD simulations of both 2 D and 3 D risers. The effects of modelling aspects such as boundary conditions and drag models on the hydrodynamics predictions were investigated. The EE model with a structured-based drag from the EMMS model was found to be more effective in capturing an inherent heterogeneity of riser flows. However, the quantitative disagreements between the flow predictions and experimental data still persist...|$|E

This {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the prolonged effect of wearing the Oxylog System from Morgan Scientific, Inc. during a series of four manual material handling tests. The lift tests were performed by 12 males (average age of 23 years); each participant completed a 15 -minute submaximal step test and a series of four lifting tests at two different lift rates (8 and 16 lifts/min) for an hour duration each. The lift test protocol used in this study was designed to accurately simulate a repetitive manual material handling task commonly found in industry settings. Lift rates were selected to resemble the work rates commonly observed in material handling environments. Heart rate was directly measured during all four tests; for two tests, the Oxylog system was worn to directly measure the working V. 02; the resulting heart rate data was compared to the heart rates resulting when the participant wore only the heart watch. For this test design, V. O 2 values were estimated using linear regression from the submaximal step test results. The averages of the participants' heart rates were consistently higher during the tests while wearing the Oxylog for both lift rates. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for working heart rate found that there was a difference between the average heart rate values for 16 lifts/min (p = 0. 0 1 6); however, at 8 lifts/min, the difference was not significant (p = 0. 109). Statistical analysis comparing estimated versus measured working V. 02 indicates that there was no difference between V. 02 while the Oxylog was worn compared to when it was not worn for both lift rates (p = 0. 1081 for 8 lifts/min; p 0. 2408 at 16 lifts/min).

This second addition, which was represented by the use of lifting thresholds that were adjusted at each surface grid point in response to the removal or deposition of dust, led to enhanced variability in the timing and peak. magnitude of major dust storms produced in the model. These dust storms were realistic in many respects, and the observed global dust storm freq uency of occurrence of roughly one in every three years was approximately reproduced by the model, but an artificial threshold decrease rate was required to maintain dust lifting on a multiannual timescale - this was believed to be due to inaccuracies in the net cross-equatorial dust flux, which showed a strong bias towards the northern hemisphere. Significant changes were seen in model dust <b>lifting</b> <b>rates</b> when the influence of a heterogeneous surface roughness length was included in the wind stress scheme, and the need for more sophisticated sub-gridscale methods in future dust lifting schemes, to cope with this and other effects, was noted. The inclusion of radiatively active water clouds in model runs also affected dust <b>lifting</b> <b>rates,</b> particularly in the vicinity of the polar caps in autumn, winter and spring. The dynamics behind the formation of small, cap-edge dust storms during these periods were examined in detail, and it was found that a cessation in dust lifting activity that occurs around winter solstice does so due to a combination of the radiative effects of global dust loading and polar hood ice clouds, and zonal variations in midlatitude topography. The direct interaction between dust and ice, in the form of nucleation and scavenging, was investigated. It was found that scavenging by water ice, if it is suitably efficient, could significant ly reduce t he dust content of the winter polar regions. However, the dust and ice vertical profiles measured in the aphelion cloud belt by Mars Climate S?under were not reproduced by the model with any of the possible scavenging efficiencies used. It appears that scavenging cannot provide an explanation for the existence of sharply defined, elevated dust layers at low latitudes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Kinetics of {{molecular}} oxygen / Au (001) surface interaction {{has been studied}} at high temperature and near atmospheric pressures of O 2 gas with in situ x-ray scattering measurements. We find that the hexagonal reconstruction (hex) of Au (001) surface lifts to (1 x 1) {{in the presence of}} O 2 gas, indicating that the (1 x 1) is more favored when some oxygen atoms present on the surface. The measured <b>lifting</b> <b>rate</b> constant vs. temperature is found to be highest at intermediate temperature exhibiting a 'volcano'-type behavior. At low temperature, the hex-to-(1 x 1) activation barrier (Eact = 1. 3 (3) eV) limits the lifting. At high temperature, oxygen adsorption energy (Eads = 1. 6 (2) eV) limits the lifting. The (1 x 1) -to-hex activation barrier (Ehex = 0. 41 (14) eV) is also obtained from hex recovery kinetics. The pressure-temperature (PT) surface phase diagram obtained in this study shows three regions: hex at low P and T, (1 x 1) at high P and T, and coexistence of the hex and (1 x 1) at the intermediate P and T.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of uniform large-area highly crystalline organic semiconductor thin films that show outstanding carrier mobilities remains {{a challenge in}} the field of organic electronics, including organic field-effect transistors. Quantitative control over the drying speed during dip-coating permits optimization of the organic semiconductor film formation, although the kinetics of crystallization at the air-solution-substrate contact line are still not well understood. Here, we report the facile one-step growth of self-aligning, highly crystalline soluble acene crystal arrays that exhibit excellent field-effect mobilities (up to 1. 5 cm V - 1 s - 1) via an optimized dip-coating process. We discover that optimized acene crystals grew at a particular substrate lifting-rate in the presence of low boiling point solvents, such as dichloromethane (b. p. of 40. 0 °C) or chloroform (b. p. of 60. 4 °C). Variable-temperature dip-coating experiments using various solvents and <b>lift</b> <b>rates</b> are performed to elucidate the crystallization behavior. This bottom-up study of soluble acene crystal growth during dip-coating provides conditions under which one may obtain uniform organic semiconductor crystal arrays with high crystallinity and mobilities over large substrate areas, regardless of the substrate geometry (wafer substrates or cylinder-shaped substrates). © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{objective}} of this thesis work is to obtain the optimum gas injection rate which yields the maximum oil production. Obtaining the optimum gas injection rate is important because excessive gas injection rate reduces oil production rate and increases operation cost. To obtain the optimum gas injection rate for achieving the maximum oil production, all wells had been modelled by Prosper program and network solver calculation had been performed by Gap program. Flash data of recombined reservoir fluid had been used for PVT matching. All available well test data including current well test data had been considered for quality checking. Since the reservoir parameter is continuously changing from inception of production, current well test data was the focus for using in the well model. It was found that current well test data for all wells had been matched nicely with calculated data in Prosper. Deviation range was below 3 %. For correlation comparison of VLP, Petroleum Expert 2 was found very close to well test data for all well models. Parameter 1 and 2 was close to unity. While matching surface flow line in Gap program, Duckler Flanning was found the best fit correlation for production and test flow line. Calculated manifold pressure was compared with the measured well head pressure and found very close results. Currently oil is producing from eight wells of Varg field on which seven wells are producing with gas lift system. Presently average oil production rate of Varg field is around 2500 Sm 3 /day with gas <b>lift</b> injection <b>rate</b> around 600 x 103 Sm 3 /day. From simulation result of GAP program, maximum oil production rate was achieved 2867. 0 Sm 3 /day at gas <b>lift</b> injection <b>rate</b> of 661. 4 x 103 Sm 3 /day. At 500 x 103 Sm 3 /day gas <b>lift</b> injection <b>rate,</b> Gap calculates 2686 Sm 3 /day oil production rate. It has been observed from the simulation result that well A- 05 A is producing without gas lift injection due to low water cut. Production optimization and <b>lift</b> gas allocation <b>rates</b> achieved by this thesis work shows quite close results with current status of all producing wells. In Varg field, all produced oil is processed by both production and test separators. For finding out the best combination for obtaining the maximum oil production, producing wells had been passed through different combinations of wells and separators. From this work, maximum oil production had been achieved by flowing well A- 05 A and well A- 07 through the test separator and remaining six wells through the production separator...|$|R

The expected profits from customers are important informations for the companies in giving acquisition/retention decisions and developing different strategies for different customer segments. Most of these decisions can be made through intelligent Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. We suggest embedding an intelligent Customer Profitability (CP) model in the CRM systems, in order to automatize the decisions that are based on CP values. Since one of the aims of CP analysis is to find out the most/least profitable customers, this paper proposes to evaluate the performances of the CP models based on the correct classification of customers into different profitability segments. Our study proposes predicting the segments of the customers directly with classification-based models and comparing the results with the traditional approach (value-based models) results. In this study, cost sensitive classification based models are used to predict the customer segments since misclassification of some segments are more important than others. For this aim, Classification and regression trees, Logistic regression and Chi-squared automatic interaction detector techniques are utilized. In order to compare the performance of the models, new performance measures are promoted, which are hit, capture and <b>lift</b> <b>rates.</b> It is seen that classification-based models outperform the previously used value-based models, which shows the proposed framework works out well...|$|R
40|$|Land {{salinity}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} abiotic constraints that affect negatively crop production worldwide. Medicago genus, mostly composed by annual species, is of a real interest in improving soil fertility and maintaining pastures for livestock. We assessed adaptive traits for salt tolerance in 40 contrasted populations belonging to 6 Medicago species. In a common site, trial was performed in saline and non-saline soils where functional and fitness traits were recorded. Only M. ciliaris populations survived in the saline soil, highlighting the negative effect of even low salt levels at plant lift. ANOVA and PCA revealed that <b>lifting</b> <b>rate,</b> length branch at flowering time and total pod number might be involved in salt tolerance. The response to salt stress of Medicago was further studied by analyzing germination kinetics of 37 populations under five ranges of NaCl concentrations from 0 to 200 mM, during 7 days. Kaplan-Meier survivor curves and Cox PH models indicated that time to 50 % germination, germinability and germination synchrony are affected by the increase of salts. The risk of non-germinated seeds depends on species, populations and NaCl concentrations. Altogether, these results show that both salt level and exposition duration affect the phenotypical traits. Local adaptation may partly explain the patterns of salt tolerance. M. ciliaris is the most tolerant species, with a relatively high level of intraspecific variability for most studied traits...|$|R
