5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. <b>Local</b> <b>resource</b> competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{identified}} the available <b>local</b> <b>resources</b> for extension {{education and the}} constraints {{in the use of}} these <b>local</b> <b>resources</b> in Nkonkobe <b>local</b> Municipality. The survey was conducted in the peri-urban areas of Fort Beaufort, Alice, Seymour, Balfour, Hogsback and Middledrift from 7 th to 29 th September 2010 by interviewing 58 farmers on the identification of <b>local</b> <b>resources</b> and their perception of constraints in the use of <b>local</b> <b>resources.</b> The study revealed that there are <b>local</b> <b>resources</b> embedded in the area for use in Extension teaching and learning. The perception of constraint (inadequate access to <b>local</b> <b>resources)</b> increased significantly with age (P = 0. 04) and farm experience (P = 0. 045). The fundamental strategies for a successful Extension work should be to develop a process which not only creates co-operative platforms for the use of <b>local</b> <b>resources</b> for rural improvement, but also reinforces farmerâ€™s ingenuity and inspires them to learn and accept innovation. The available <b>local</b> <b>resources</b> in Nkonkobe <b>Local</b> Municipality are well distributed in the community and are important for the achievement of educational goals in Extension teaching and learning...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} key {{differences}} in {{management of resources}} in the global commons {{from those of the}} commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level. [...] Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools {{are less likely to be}} relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. [...] Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in externalities between more <b>local</b> <b>resource</b> uses and uses of global-level resources.|$|E
60|$|The {{place has}} formed, then, the {{headquarters}} of the Chelsea circle of hospitality to the exiled, the broken, and the bewildered; and if I may speak of having taken home the lesson of their state and the sense of their story, it is by meeting them in the finest club conditions conceivable that I {{have been able to do}} so. Hither, month after month and day after day, the unfortunates have flocked, each afternoon; and here the comparatively exempt, almost ashamed of their exemption in presence of so much woe, have made them welcome to every form of succour and reassurance. Certain afternoons each week have worn the character of the huge comprehensive tea-party, a fresh well-wisher discharging the social and financial cost of the fresh occasion--which has always festally profited, in addition, by the extraordinary command of musical accomplishment, the high standard of execution, that is the mark of the Belgian people. This exhibition of our splendid <b>local</b> <b>resource</b> has rested, of course, on a multitude of other resources, still local, but of a more intimate hospitality, little by little worked out and applied, and into the details of which I may not here pretend to go beyond noting that they have been accountable for the large housed and fed and clothed and generally protected and administered numbers, all provided for in Chelsea and its outer fringe, on which our scheme of sociability at Crosby Hall itself has up to now been able to draw. To have seen this scheme so long in operation has been to find it suggest many reflections, all of the most poignant and moving order; the foremost of which has, perhaps, had for its subject that never before can the wanton hand of history have descended upon a group of communities less expectant of public violence from without or less prepared for it and attuned to it.|$|E
