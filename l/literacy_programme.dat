40|$|Literacy {{is a key}} {{outcome of}} education. Although {{literacy}} is a basic human right, and, can {{lay the foundation for}} further education and training, there is still a high number of illiterate people in South Africa. Black rural women form the majority of non-literates in the country and this has a negative impact {{on the development of the}} country. This means that rural women are still marginalized and stay in conditions of squalor because they are unemployed, poor and lack skills required by the labour market. This study focuses on the importance and benefits of <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> to the empowerment of black rural women. It was conducted in two rural areas of Mopani District Municipality, in Greater Giyani. Rural women who have been socially excluded and benefited less from the growing economy need to be empowered through <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> to stand up and fight poverty, ill health and other social ills they face. The qualitative method was employed where participants were involved in focus group and one on one interviews so as to evaluate the effectiveness of the <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes.</b> The results of the study indicate that <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> did empower women to a certain extent because they have gained functional skills and they involve themselves in community development programmes. However, the engagement of all stakeholders in the provision of quality <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> can emancipate rural women so that they may take their rightful places in society.

The prevailing popular conviction is that acquisition of literacy by individuals leads to positive and unproblematic social outcomes – the autonomous view of literacy (Street, 1984). This study forms a critique of this view, arguing, based on empirical evidence, that literacy is ideologically and culturally embedded in social practices and as such varies according to the social context. This is the ideological view of literacy (Street, 1984). This research employs an interdisciplinary approach constructed from the key notions of New Literacy Studies, Multiliteracies and Critical Literacy. The empirical research uses a qualitative research methodology based on a critical literacy ethnography informed by data gathered through interviews (with facilitators, learners, technicians and local leaders), classroom observations and document analysis.

40|$|Family <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} popular pedagogical tool utilised by policy makers to help address the literacy needs of families with low skill competencies and who are viewed as economically and socially underachieving. Taking a comparative case study approach, in this research I consider what benefits family <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> have for the literacy skills of families. Drawing on Bourdieu's habitus (1993) and field (1977) and Bourdieu, Coleman (1988) and Putnam's (2000) notions of social capital, in this research I compare family <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> in selected case study areas within England, Ireland and Malta. The objectives are to establish differences and similarities in policy rationale, the characteristics of delivery and learner engagement. Predominantly qualitative in nature, the research consisted of 94 semi-structured interviews with actors involved in family <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> across the three areas including coordinators, practitioners, learners, ex-learners, non-participating fathers and children's teachers. Interviews were supplemented and triangulated by a range of other data sources including a number of classroom observations. Family <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> across the three areas exhibited many similarities: the content of sessions; the underlying policy rationale for offering and funding programmes; the motivation of learners for attending; benefits reported by learners; and difficulties faced by practitioners. In addition, parents attending were mainly mothers. Some differences were also found, mainly between Ireland {{and the other two}} participating areas. For example, in Ireland different types of locations were used and children were not usually present. However, the main difference was not cultural, but political, between the desired policy outcomes, and the motivation of learners. The evidence suggests that, regardless of the cultural context, there is a mismatch or at least a lack of awareness between the two, with learners predominantly motivated to attend to help their children, whilst policy objectives primarily seek to address inadequate literacy levels, as part of wider social inclusion strategies.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 130 - 143). The paper {{deals with}} the role of literacy materials in adult education in two Cape Town public libraries, namely Bellville South and Milnerton public libraries. Adult education is education that is provided to adult who lack basic education. It involves the teaching of writing, reading, calculation skills and developmental and functional skills such as income generation skills. <b>Literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> are supported by both teaching and reading materials that are usually made available in public libraries and literacy classes. The objectives of the study were to investigate the availability of locally produced literacy materials for use in <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> in public libraries, the types and features of these materials and the suitability of literacy materials in acquisition of literacy skills. Milnerton and Bellville South public libraries were used as case studies because they had <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> and <b>literacy</b> materials in their libraries. The Stikland Learning Centre was also included because it was partly managed by the Bellville South librarian. The enrolled learners in these <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes,</b> facilitators, librarians and providers were interviewed using face to face interviews. Publishers, (Viva Books. New Readers Project and Project literacy) were also interviewed. The study showed that both public libraries provided <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> that aim to equip the learners with survival and functional skills. Although they also provided literacy materials to support and maintain the literacy skills, such materials were not sufficient in literacy classes because some learners did not have literacy materials in their classes. The available reading materials in public libraries also need to be adapted so that they can meet the educational and cultural needs of the users. The research also showed that {{there are two types of}} literacy materials, namely learning or instructional and reading or informational materials. Learning materials include study guides, manuals and worksheets. They are usually provided by the literacy providers and their main aims are to support the acquisition of literacy skills and they are also used for assessment purposes. Reading or informational materials are usually provided by the public libraries and they are used to maintain the newly acquired skills. The availability of these materials is important for the success of <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> and to avoid relapse into illiteracy. These materials are published by various publishers such as New Readers Project (NRP), Viva Books. Project Literacy (literacy provider) and government departments such as the Department of Education. They are published in various South African languages. Both learning and reading materials were characterized with simple languages, colourful pictures and large fonts, aiming to equip learners with the developmental and survival skills that are based on their daily activities. The learners' daily activities included reading the bus/train schedule, writing CVs and job searching related skills, reading medical prescription and reading road signs. The use of either local languages or official language in these materials is determined by the needs of the learners and the language that is used in their <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{both the}} {{information}} {{needs of the}} identified communities of Damonsville and Onverwacht and {{the contents of the}} selected Afrikaans <b>literacy</b> ABET <b>programmes</b> in order to determine whether the contents addresses the identified information needs. Educators need to develop material that is relevant and appropriate, for example, content that addresses the information needs of the targeted learners. The results of this content analysis were aligned with the information needs assessments carried out in the communities of Onverwacht and Damonsville. These two communities were chosen because of their close proximity to Pretoria and the high level of illiteracy prevailing in these two mainly Afrikaans-speaking communities. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies were used in the study. Two communities of Damonsville and Onverwacht were chosen as data collection sites so as to reveal their information needs through the use of questionnaires. The data collected was analysed by using descriptive and statistical tabulation for quantitative and content analysis methods and then compared. The main research question of the study is, “What are the information needs of the Afrikaans pre-literate adult learners of both Damonsville and Onverwacht communities and how can the content of adult literacy training material be tailored to match the information requirements of the identified communities?”. From the data derived from empirical study conducted, a list of activities which serve as information needs of both communities was compiled and could then be used when designing instructional tutorials so as that the content could match the specified needs of the identified communities. From the content analysis of the three <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes,</b> findings have indicated that there exist no correlation between the information needs of the identified communities and the contents of the <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes.</b> The researcher argues this shortcoming as a major implication to instructional design. Based on the findings of a comparison between the content of the Afrikaans <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> and the information needs of the people in Onverwacht and Damonsville, a learning programme in the form of two lesson plans were compiled in which the identified information needs of the learners determined the content. Recommendations for the improvement of the content of <b>literacy</b> <b>programmes</b> {{that could be used in}} future were also made. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
