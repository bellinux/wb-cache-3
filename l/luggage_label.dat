Her luggage {{consisted}} of a black box, and of a well-worn leather bag which she carried in her hand. The name on the box (recently written on a new <b>luggage</b> <b>label,</b> as the color of the ink and paper showed) was a very good name in its way, common to a very great number of ladies, both in Scotland and England. It was [...] "Mrs. Graham." ...|$|E

50|$|The new {{organisation}} {{and staff}} were quickly assembled and the scheme launched. Applications for {{children would be}} made through schools throughout the country. They would travel alone and be accompanied by selected teachers or escorts {{at a ratio of}} one to every 15 children, in addition to nurses and doctors. They would travel to the port of embarkation and be accommodated in a hostel, where final medical checks were made. In order to embark rapidly; the usual formalities were dispensed with, there would be no passports. Each child was given a <b>luggage</b> <b>label</b> with its C.O.R.B. number and as each child embarked they were given an identity disc, also with its C.O.R.B. number.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} {{technologies have}} been used to reduce the time and manpower to input data manually i. e. Barcode, smart card, radio frequency identification (RFID), biometric technology and optical character recognition. Currently RFID {{has become one of the}} hottest technologies implemented in a wide range of application i. e.; these include road tolls, bus and trains payment, security tags and <b>luggage</b> <b>labels</b> used in some airports. In Malaysia, the usage of this technology has not yet been expanded; It is only used as a personal identity in the working place, smart tag in PLUS highway and price tags in market. Based on the above-described overview on RFID, this study attempts to apply the technology in online supervision system to ease the school /university management system to monitor the interest group. The OSS system used the main component of passive RFID system, database management system and online networking. When the RFID tags pass through the RFID reader, the system will record the data from the RFID tag to the database systems. Then the data will be sent online to the management for the supervision of students. This system will ease the school/university management people to monitor the availability of each student in the interest zone and this enhance the school management procedures, monitor the interest group movement automatically and increase the safety of students...|$|R
60|$|Smoke Printing.--When other {{apparatus}} {{is not at}} hand, a method of obtaining very clear impressions is to smoke a plate over a lighted candle, to press the finger on the blackened surface, and then on an adhesive one. The following details must, however, be borne in mind: the plate must not be smoked too much, {{for the same reason}} that a slab must not be inked too much; and the adhesive surface must be only slightly damped, not wetted, or the impression will be blurred. A crockery plate is better than glass or metal, as the soot does not adhere to it so tightly, and it is less liable to crack. Professor Bowditch finds mica (which is sold at photographic stores in small sheets) to be the best material. Certainly the smoke comes wholly off the mica on to the parts of the finger that touch it, and a beautiful negative is left behind, which can be utilised in the camera better than glass that has been similarly treated; but it does not serve so well for a plate that is intended to be kept ready for use in a pocket-book, its softness rendering it too liable to be scratched. I prefer to keep a slip of very thin copper sheeting in my pocket-book, with which, and with the gummed back of a postage stamp, or even the gummed fringe to a sheet of stamps, impressions can easily be taken. The thin copper quickly cools, and a wax match supplies enough smoke. The folders spoken of (p. 42) may be smoked instead of being inked, and are in some cases preferable to carry in the pocket or to send by post, being so easy to smoke afresh. <b>Luggage</b> <b>labels</b> that are thickly gummed at the back furnish a good adhesive surface. The fault of gummed paper lies in the difficulty of damping it without its curling up. The gummed paper sold by stationers is usually thinner than <b>luggage</b> <b>labels,</b> and still more difficult to keep flat. Paste rubbed in a very thin layer over a card makes a surface that holds soot firmly, and one that will not stick to other surfaces if accidentally moistened. Glue, isinglass, size, and mucilage, are all suitable. It was my fortune as a boy to receive rudimentary lessons in drawing from a humble and rather grotesque master. He confided to me the discovery, which he claimed as his own, that pencil drawings could be fixed by licking them; and as I write these words, the image of his broad swab-like tongue performing the operation, and of his proud eyes gleaming over the drawing he was operating on, come vividly to remembrance. This reminiscence led me to try whether licking a piece of paper would give it a sufficiently adhesive surface. It did so. Nay, it led me a step further, for I took two pieces of paper and licked both. The dry side of the one was held over the candle as an equivalent to a plate for collecting soot, being saved by the moisture at the back from igniting (it had to be licked two or three times during the process), and the impression was made on the other bit of paper. An ingenious person determined to succeed in obtaining the record of a finger impression, can hardly fail altogether under any ordinary circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Ray Savage, {{reporter}} for a sensational magazine in London is assigned over his objections {{to investigate a}} pretty blonde hat-check attendant's suicide. Inquiring at Jane Hale's place of work he learns that someone from her past had recognized her, and she was afraid. Finding a <b>luggage</b> <b>label</b> on her suitcase, he follows the lead to a dubious hotel where the manager tells him someone had taken a shot at her while she was staying there. From there he goes to her former place of work, then {{to the home of}} her friend at work who tells him that Miss Hale regularly called her mother, long distance. Following the number to a sanatorium where questioning Mrs. Hale yields nothing, but the cooperative administrator tells him the upscale neighborhood Jane was living before she went on the run.|$|E
6000|$|The {{top drawer}} {{contained}} a complete collection of carpenter's tools in miniature, relics probably of the far-distant {{time when the}} Major was a boy, and when parents or friends had made him a present {{of a set of}} toy tools. The second drawer was filled with toys of another sort--presents made to Major Fitz-David by his fair friends. Embroidered braces, smart smoking-caps, quaint pincushions, gorgeous slippers, glittering purses, all bore witness to the popularity of the friend of the women. The contents of the third drawer were of a less interesting sort: the entire space was filled with old account-books, ranging over a period of many years. After looking into each book, and opening and shaking it uselessly, in search of any loose papers which might be hidden between the leaves, I came to the fourth drawer, and found more relics of past pecuniary transactions in the shape of receipted bills, neatly tied together, and each inscribed at the back. Among the bills I found nearly a dozen loose papers, all equally unimportant. The fifth drawer was in sad confusion. I took out first a loose bundle of ornamental cards, each containing the list of dishes at past banquets given or attended by the Major in London or Paris; next, a box full of delicately tinted quill pens (evidently a lady's gift); next, a quantity of old invitation cards; next, some dog's-eared French plays and books of the opera; next, a pocket-corkscrew, a bundle of cigarettes, and a bunch of rusty keys; lastly, a passport, a set of <b>luggage</b> <b>labels,</b> a broken silver snuff-box, two cigar-cases, and a torn map of Rome. [...] "Nothing anywhere to interest me," [...] I thought, as I closed the fifth, and opened the sixth and last drawer.|$|R
6000|$|Chivalry {{might be}} called the baptism of Feudalism. It was an attempt to bring the justice and even the logic of the Catholic creed into a {{military}} system which already existed; to turn its discipline into an initiation and its inequalities into a hierarchy. To the comparative grace of the new period belongs, of course, that considerable cultus of the dignity of woman, to which the word [...] "chivalry" [...] is often narrowed, or perhaps exalted. This also was a revolt against one of the worst gaps in the more polished civilization of the Saracens. Moslems denied even souls to women; perhaps from the same instinct which recoiled from the sacred birth, with its inevitable glorification of the mother; perhaps merely because, having originally had tents rather than houses, they had slaves rather than housewives. It is false to say that the chivalric view of women was merely an affectation, except in the sense in which there must always be an affectation where there is an ideal. It is the worst sort of superficiality not to see the pressure of a general sentiment merely because it is always broken up by events; the Crusade itself, for example, is more present and potent as a dream even than as a reality. From the first Plantagenet to the last Lancastrian it haunts the minds of English kings, giving as a background to their battles a mirage of Palestine. So a devotion like that of Edward I. to his queen was quite a real motive in the lives of multitudes of his contemporaries. When crowds of enlightened tourists, setting forth to sneer at the superstitions of the continent, are taking tickets and <b>labelling</b> <b>luggage</b> at the large railway station at the west end of the Strand, I do not know whether they all speak to their wives with a more flowing courtesy than their fathers in Edward's time, or whether they pause to meditate on the legend of a husband's sorrow, {{to be found in the}} very name of Charing Cross.|$|R
