30|$|Through {{grouping}} certain {{life events}} together and separating others, the women create structure {{and meaning in}} their narratives. The women demarcate the ending and beginning of these life chapters by clearly narrated turning points. These turning points provide {{an explanation for the}} shift of one life chapter to the next, either explaining a negative or a positive transition. Zeynep, a 49 -year old Turkish marriage migrant, for example states: “Yes, after the divorce it all started. [….] I was healthy, until… [claps in her hands] the divorce.” Monique, a 43 -year old Dutch woman, indicates it even more clearly describing it as a turning point; “The day my mother died, that was.. That was the turning point. That’s when it all started, the headaches, not going to work and then <b>losing</b> <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> everything”.|$|R

5000|$|The song centres on fraud, {{the ones}} who commit it and {{the ones who}} are its victims. The song's protagonist tells a story of how he has to [...] "Scam - that's the way to stay alive", because he himself was a victim of a one, as heard in a verse ("See, I had to <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> car, <b>job,</b> wife, dog, and home,/debts and threats on the telephone"). However, it also tells how {{politicians}} also lie to their people, giving false promises, and abusing their own powers.|$|R
5000|$|When white colonialists like Cecil Rhodes {{first saw}} the ruins, they saw them {{as a sign of}} the great riches that the area would yield to its new masters. Gertrude Caton-Thompson {{recognised}} that the builders were indigenous Africans, but she characterised the site as the [...] "product of an infantile mind" [...] built by a subjugated society. Pikirayi and Kaarsholm suggest that this presentation of Great Zimbabwe was partly intended to encourage settlement and investment in the area. The official line in Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s was that the structures were built by non-blacks and the government censored archaeologists who disputed this. According to Paul Sinclair, interviewed for None But Ourselves: I was the archaeologist stationed at Great Zimbabwe. I was told by the then-director of the Museums and Monuments organisation to be extremely careful about talking to the press about the origins of the Great Zimbabwe state. I was told that the museum service was in a difficult situation, that the government was pressurising them to withhold the correct information. Censorship of guidebooks, museum displays, school textbooks, radio programmes, newspapers and films was a daily occurrence. Once a member of the Museum Board of Trustees threatened me with <b>losing</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> if I said publicly that blacks had built Zimbabwe. He said it was okay to say the yellow people had built it, but I wasn't allowed to mention radio carbon dates... It was the first time since Germany in the thirties that archaeology has been so directly censored.|$|R

Indeed to have such a will for heaven, is an admirable {{advantage}} to a man that undertaketh a race hither. A man that is resolved, and hath his will fixed, saith, 'I will do my best to advantage myself; I will do my worst to hinder my enemies; I will not give out as long as I can stand; I will have it, or I will <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> life.'

He'll just hand me a pass to Bellevue and tell me to come back when I get cured. I might turn in a story about a sea serpent wiggling up Broadway, but I haven't got the nerve to try 'em with a pipe like this. A get-rich-quick scheme--excuse me--gang giving back the boodle!

40|$|I shall simply begin my {{introduction}} to a literary masterpiece {{with a letter}} sent to me by a client. His name has {{been changed to protect}} his privacy. Dear Dr. Algernon, I am Balan. I am a factory worker of Singapore Inc. We produce all types of electronic stuff including radios and hand phones. Recently, I got into big trouble at the factory and I am worried I may <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> I was accused of defamation and of disloyalty and everyone hates me now. [...] . Dr. Algernon, I am confused. Am I a disloyal worker or just someone who's afraid of rocketing costs? Reply Well, my dear Balan, I do not think you are being disloyal at all.

40|$|The clinic's theme, "Human Aspects of Library Automation," {{implies that}} {{personnel}} considerations {{will be addressed}} throughout the conference. Other speakers have addressed and will be discussing certain personnel aspects e. g., fear and resistance, ergonomics, training, and staff involvement. Earlier clinics have addressed personnel topics also, particularly the 1983 clinic on professional competencies. 1 This paper will expand {{on some of these}} topics and address the impact of technology on library personnel in the context of traditional areas of human resource management. Personnel issues can be viewed in two ways from that of the employer or employee. Sometimes these viewpoints are divergent, sometimes in harmony. Administrators tend to be concerned more with organizational structure, work flow, personnel costs, and productivity. Workers are concerned more with questions such as, "Will I <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> because of automation? Will I be reclassified? Will I be paid more? What effect will this have on my health? Will I feel less valued, dehumanized because of machines?" I hope to address both sides. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|I {{had to be}} patient. If I didn’t allow my eyes to wander, I could briefly catch {{a glimpse}} of one taking the jump. I saw three: amazing. I had never seen the salmon run before, nor did I know it was in my backyard. For 16 years I lived in this city in two {{separate}} spans of my life. Only today did I take a walk along the Humber River and witness the salmon run, thanks to a chance encounter with our course administrator who taught me about this yearly ritual. It was a welcome distraction from the weight of anxiety about the exam I was here to write in less than 24 hours. I checked myself into the Old Mill for a quiet night’s sleep. My kids thought it was the most curious thing that their mom was studying. After all, I had already finished university and had a job. Why would I need to study? I spent the last few months trying to explain why I would voluntarily subject myself to hours of studying, missing precious hours at the pool or on the lake during family vacation time. Last year, I submitted my application to write the first Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) General Internal Medicine (GIM) certification exam. I was a true skeptic. I did not buy into the idea that GIM was unique from Internal Medicine (IM), so how could there be a valid exam distinguishing the two specialties? “You should write the exam, ” was the advice from my senior colleague in the upper echelons of our college. I perceived a conflict of interest. Or was it a warning that ultimately my career and billings would depend on having this new designation of General Internist to validate my credentials? No one knew. But I do know that I won’t do something “just because. ” Nor did I believe I would suddenly <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> because I didn’t have the new certification. If I did not write and pass, however, I would have to order new business cards that reflected my new identity, dropping the “General ” from General Internist. However, if my family and friends are any indication, my patients are equally unaware of the distinction between IM and GIM, and so whether I woul...|$|E
