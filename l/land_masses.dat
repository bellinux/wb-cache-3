5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (insolation) {{at the upper}} atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and <b>land</b> <b>masses.</b> The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
5|$|The bronze quoll (D. spartacus) is {{the only}} mammal found in the Trans Fly ecoregion, but not in {{northern}} Australia. It {{is found in the}} southern part of New Guinea south of the Fly River. Rising sea levels due to an increase in global temperature caused a land bridge that once connected Australia and New guinea to be covered up with water. A 2007 study conducted by the University of New South Wales suggests the bronze quoll is closely related to the western quoll, their ancestors diverging with the separation of <b>land</b> <b>masses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American <b>land</b> <b>masses,</b> or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Cristobal had minimal effect to any <b>land</b> <b>masses.</b> Its remnants brought unsettled conditions to Bermuda, including a 45mph (72km/h) wind gust at the Bermuda International Airport. The combination of moisture from Cristobal {{and a cold}} front produced 2.78inches (71mm) in a 24‑hour period. The interaction between the remnants of Cristobal and a high pressure system over the Mid-Atlantic States produced rip currents and 4foot (1.2m) waves along the south shore of Long Island, New York; three people drowned from the rip currents. Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds {{in association with the}} storm; the vessel with the sign WUQL reported sustained winds of 47mph (76km/h) from the west-southwest on August 7.|$|E
5|$|Because Tropical Depression Ten never {{approached}} land as {{a tropical}} cyclone, no tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for any <b>land</b> <b>masses.</b> No effects, damages, or fatalities were reported, and no ships reported tropical storm-force winds {{in association with}} the depression. The system did not attain tropical storm status; as such, it was not given a name by the National Hurricane Center. The storm partially contributed to the formation of Hurricane Katrina, which became a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall in Louisiana, causing catastrophic damage. Katrina was the costliest hurricane, and one of the five deadliest, {{in the history of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distance}} {{away from any}} major <b>land</b> <b>masses,</b> Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. On September16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained {{by one of the}} aircraft. As it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September21, resulting in the deaths of 80crew members on board. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. The hurricane's long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records.|$|E

5|$|Luthor sends his moll, Kitty, to {{distract}} Superman, {{allowing him to}} steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the hypocenter to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor {{plans to use the}} Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be forced to use his new land. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between <b>land</b> <b>masses.</b> Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> between the Eurasian continents and the North Pole, and confirmed the general character of the north polar region as a deep, ice-covered sea. Although Nansen retired from exploration after this expedition, the methods of travel and survival he developed with Johansen influenced all the polar expeditions, north and south, which followed in the subsequent three decades.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, {{cyclones}} were active for a total of 40days, and severe tropical cyclones were active for a total of 19days, both above average. A total of five tropical disturbances formed during 2002, of which two were cyclones. The first disturbance of the season, Tropical Depression 17F, along with another depression, 01F, formed well {{before the start of the}} cyclone season on July 3 and October 21 respectively. Cyclone Yolande was the first cyclone of the season, forming on November 29, but did not impact any <b>land</b> <b>masses.</b> In December, two disturbances formed, Tropical Depression 03F and Cyclone Zoe. The latter was the season's strongest cyclone and the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, affecting areas of the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major <b>land</b> <b>masses,</b> insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E
