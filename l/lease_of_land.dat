25|$|Although {{coal and}} iron had been {{extracted}} for some centuries, the first industrialisation of mining in the Afan Valley was in 1811 when Samuel Lettston obtained a <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> at Cwmavon and in 1819 established a blast furnace there in 1819. Part of the output was conveyed to Aberavon on the Mynydd Bychan tramroad, a horse-operated wooden waggonway {{that had been}} in existence since about 1750. In 1824 transport efficiency was improved by the opening of {{what became known as the}} Cwmavon Tramroad, three miles in length and again horse-operated.

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century, Æthelred and Æthelflæd {{fortified}} Worcester, with the permission of King Alfred and at the request of Bishop Werferth, described in the charter as [...] "their friend". They granted the church of Worcester a half share of the rights of lordship over the city, covering land rents and the proceeds of justice, and in return the cathedral community agreed in perpetuity to dedicate a psalm to them three times a day and a mass and thirty psalms every Saturday. As the rights of lordship had previously belonged fully to the church, this represented the beginning of transfer from episcopal to secular control of the city. In 904 Bishop Werferth granted a <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the city to Æthelred and Æthelflæd, to be held for the duration of their lives and that of their daughter Ælfwynn. The land was valuable, including most of the city's usable river frontage, and control of it enabled the Mercian rulers to dominate over and profit from the city.|$|E

Petit, turned on the abstruse point of whether the felony, i.e. Hales' suicide, had occurred during Sir James' lifetime or after his death. In 1562 the court ruled in favour of Petit. Plowden published a full report of the case in 1571. According to Baker Hales v.

This area was later to form part of what was later known as Spike Island. By 1851 Hutchinson was employing 100 men. His first works manager was Henry Deacon but Deacon left to found his own alkali factory nearby in 1853. When Hutchinson arrived in Widnes there was plenty of available labour, partly because of the immigration of Irish unskilled men due to the potato famine.|$|E

The first mention of the mill was in an indenture dated 19 April 1721 where the <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that had been enclosed for {{the building of a}} windmill was sold to Joseph Nash, miller of Halstead for £11. The mill was marked on Warburton, Bland and Smyth's map dated c1724. The mill was conveyed to Joseph Nash Jr in April 1772, who promptly mortgaged the mill for £100. Thomas French, miller of Halstead, purchased the mill for £135 on the death of the mortgagee c1734. French sold the mill in 1774 to Bartholomew Brown, of Wethersfield for £170. In 1784 John Tabor loaned £100, with the mill as security. The mill was to be run by the Brown family for three generations, ending with John Brown who died in September 1829.|$|E
