25|$|For {{various reasons}} {{it has become}} quite {{difficult}} to accurately assess reserves on more than simple <b>loan</b> <b>instruments,</b> and this plus the regional differences has tended to discourage standardizing any reserve rules at the global BIS scale. Historically, the BIS did set some standards which favoured lending money to private landowners (at about 5 to 1) and for-profit corporations (at about 2 to 1) over loans to individuals. These distinctions reflecting classical economics were superseded by policies relying on undifferentiated market values – {{more in line with}} neoclassical economics.|$|E
30|$|Dettling and Kearney (2014) {{found that}} an {{increase}} in housing prices decreases the birthrates of non-homeowners and increases the birthrates of homeowners. The latter potentially occurs because a rise in housing price increases home equity for owners. Home equity can, in turn, be extracted through mortgage refinancing or obtaining a home equity loan/line of credit. One reason I find less positive fertility impacts on homeowners in this paper (as compared to Dettling and Kearney) {{could be due to}} such <b>loan</b> <b>instruments</b> being less readily available in the 1980 s—the time period in which this paper is based.|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research has referred {{to the concept of}} strategic default {{in the context of the}} syndicate structure and pricing of various <b>loan</b> <b>instruments.</b> Despite such references and imputed effects in the syndicated loan market, no study to our knowledge has specifically quantified the strategic default variable. Our study first identifies a latent variable entitled the propensity to strategically default. A latent variable is a hypothesized and unobserved concept that can only be approximated by observable or measured variables. We then combine this propensity to strategically default variable with a sample of loans that experience an amendment favorable to the borrower. Our identification of a strategic default is the combination of the propensity latent variable and a borrower-favorable amendment. If our measure of strategic default is legitimate and the loan market responds in a manner prescribed by previous studies, we should observe subsequent syndicate structure to be less concentrated, the loan having higher credit spreads and shorter weighted average deal maturities. The status of the paper is as follows. The sample for the study is complete. I...|$|E

40|$|Authors {{analyzed}} {{different conditions}} {{and the level of}} development of business, which exist in post-socialist countries by using international methodologies like “Doing business” and “BDO International business compass”. The main aim of the article is to reveal the main features of every economy analyzed by different criteria for identification the level of business development and its constraints in 2012 - 2016 in such countries as Czech Republic, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine. The presented analysis proves that some countries hold the leading positions for performing business represented by Estonia, Georgia, Czech Republic and not favourable conditions for such countries as Moldova and Ukraine. The list of advantages of the mentioned methodologies was described, among which the big databases, different categories of parameters, possibilities to overview risks and market potential, opportunities to make relevant comparisons are available. The disadvantages include lack of corruption level assessment methods and availability of financial and <b>loan</b> <b>instruments</b> for business.

40|$|The goal of {{the article}} lies in {{identification}} of influence of globalisation upon efficiency of financial and <b>loan</b> <b>instruments</b> that ensure regulation and stimulation of employment {{and the role of}} transaction costs in these processes. To achieve the goal, the article shows how globalisation processes, which take place in the sphere of the financial sector, influence the real economy and employment of the population, identifies positive and negative sides of this influence. The article conducts analysis of causes and effects of the financial and economic crisis {{from the point of view}} of the theory of transaction costs, in the process of which the role of specific types of these costs in the processes that took place was ascertained. In the course of the study the article reveals negative influence of the growing disproportion between the public and private transaction costs of the risks of financial and economic instability, especially in the countries with the transformation economy, and justifies the necessity of stabilising mechanisms of the international financial market with the aim of elimination of the marked transaction disproportions such as introduction of a special tax on financial transactions or establishment of the double currency course: less flexible – for servicing trading operations, and more flexible – for regulation of financial flows. Studies of negative effects of integration processes allowed formation of directions of the state policy, which would prevent dangerous consequences of interference of the foreign capital with the financial sector and would protect the Ukrainian labour market from influence of negative effects of integration processes...|$|E
40|$|At {{the spring}} 2003 {{meetings}} of the IMF and World Bank {{it was decided to}} push ahead with the contractual approach to smoothing the process of sovereign debt restructuring by encouraging the more widespread use of collective action clauses (CACs) in international bonds. This decision was shaped by Mexico’s successful launch the preceding March of a $ 1 billion global bond, subject to New York law but featuring CACs, and by subsequent issues with similar provisions from a number of other emerging market countries. In this paper we reassess the efficacy of this strategy for addressing problems of crisis resolution. We concentrate on two questions, drawing on both theory and new empirical evidence. First, are speculative credits likely to follow investment grade countries in adding CACs to their <b>loan</b> <b>instruments?</b> While our analysis of sources of resistance to contractual innovation creates reasons for hoping that Mexico’s pathbreaking issue may have broken an important logjam, both theory and evidence highlight the moral hazard associated with restructuring-friendly provisions for countries with poor credit. They suggest that CACs may raise the cost of borrowing for countries with poor credit ratings, especially in periods when sentiment toward emerging markets is relatively unfavorable, leaving them slow to embrace these provisions. Second, are CACs sufficient to solve problems of cross issue coordination among creditors, the so-called aggregation problem? The market appears to be most concerned about aggregation with respect to poor credits with very limited market access. However, because investors may not anticipate the relapse of good credits into repayment difficulties, cross issue coordination may become a problem for other issuers as well. We therefore conclude {{that there is a need}} to encourage the development of super-collective action clauses, bondholders committees, and a code of creditor conduct. ...|$|E

If the result is negative, Case III profits are taken as nil, with the negative result being treated as non-trading debits. Similar calculation rules apply to <b>loans,</b> derivatives, financial <b>instruments</b> and intangibles that are taxed under Case I (although losses are treated as a Case I expense rather than non-trading debits).|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} discrimination in home mortgage originations by exam-ining {{the performance of}} mortgage loan portfolios. This approach follows from the theoretical foundations of the economics of discrimination (Becker, 1971). The basic premise is that biased lenders will require higher expected profits for loans to minor-ity borrowers and hold minority applicants to underwriting standards in excess of those required for other applicants. Thus discrimination results in lower expected default costs for loans originated for marginally qualified nonminority borrowers. This study employs a rich FHA data set, comprising {{a large number of}} individual loan records, to evaluate the performance of mortgage borrowers. Results of the analysis fail to find evidence of better performance on loans granted to minority borrowers. Indeed, black borrowers are found, all else being equal, to exhibit a higher likelihood of mortgage default than other borrowers. These findings argue against allegations of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending. Many recent studies of mortgage lending activity have documented large and persistent racial disparities, including the provision of information to prospective home loan appli-cants, mortgage <b>loan</b> <b>instrument</b> selection, and the loan application decision process.
