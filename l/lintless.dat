500|$|The main process {{building}} surpassed The Pentagon as {{the largest}} building in the world, with a floor area of , and an enclosed volume of [...] [...] Construction required [...] of concrete, and [...] of gas pipes. Because uranium hexafluoride corrodes steel, and steel piping had to be coated in nickel, smaller pipes were made of copper or monel. The equipment operated under vacuum pressures, so plumbing had to be air tight. Special {{efforts were made to}} create as clean an environment as possible to areas where piping or fixtures were being installed. J. A. Jones established a special cleanliness unit on 18 April 1944. Buildings were completely sealed off, air was filtered, and all cleaning was with vacuum cleaners and mopping. Workers wore white <b>lintless</b> gloves. At the peak of construction activity in May 1945, 25,266 people were employed on the site.|$|E
40|$|Over {{ninety percent}} of the value of cotton comes from its fiber; however, the genetic {{mechanisms}} governing fiber development are poorly understood. Due to their biochemical and morphological diversity in fiber cells cotton fiber mutants have been useful in examining fiber development; therefore, using the Ligon <b>Lintless</b> (Li- 1) mutant, a monogenic dominant cotton mutant with very short fibers, we employed the high throughput approaches of microarray technology and real time PCR to gain insights into what genes were critical during the secondary cell wall synthesis stage. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the normal TM- 1 genotype and the near isogenic Li- 1 revealed that over 100 transcripts were differentially expressed at least 2 -fold during secondary wall biogenesis, although the genetic profile of the expansion phase showed no significant differences in the isolines. Of particular note, we identified three candidate gene families-expansin, sucrose synthase, and tubulin—whose expression in Li- 1 deviates from normal expression patterns of its parent, TM- 1. These genes may contribute to retarded growth of fibers in Li- 1 since they are fiber-expressed structural and metabolic genes. This work provides more details into the mechanisms of fiber development, and suggests the Li gene is active during the later stages of fiber development. Copyright © 2009 James J. Bolton et al.

40|$|Cotton fiber is {{an ideal}} model for {{studying}} plant cell elongation. To date, the underlying mechanisms controlling fiber elongation remain unclear due to their high complexity. In this study, a comparative proteomic analysis between a short-lint fiber mutant (Ligon <b>lintless,</b> Li 1) and its wild-type was performed to identify fiber elongation-related proteins. By 2 -DE combined with local EST database-assisted MS/ MS analysis, 81 differentially expressed proteins assigned to different functional categories were identified from Li 1 fibers, of which 54 were down-regulated and 27 were up-regulated. Several novel aspects regarding cotton fiber elongation can be illustrated from our data. First, {{over half of the}} downregulated proteins were newly identified at the protein level, which is mainly involved in protein folding and stabilization, nucleocytoplasmic transport, signal transduction, and vesicular-mediated transport. Second, a number of cytoskeleton-related proteins showed a remarkable decrease in protein abundance in the Li 1 fibers. Accordingly, the architecture of actin cytoskeleton was severely deformed and the microtubule organization was moderately altered, accompanied with dramatic disruption of vesicle trafficking. Third, the expression of several proteins involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) was activated in Li 1 fibers, indicating that the deficiency of fiber cell elongation was related to ER stress. Collectively, these findings significantly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms associated with cotton fiber elongation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} ethylene in the response of cotton to high temperature using cotton genotypes with genetically interrupted ethylene metabolism. In the first experiment, Sicot 71 BRF and 5 B (a <b>lintless</b> variant with compromised ethylene metabolism) were exposed to 45 °C, either by instantaneous heat shock or by ramping temperatures by 3 °C daily for 1 week. One day {{prior to the start}} of heat treatment, half the plants were sprayed with 0. 8 mM of the ethylene synthesis inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG). In a subsequent experiment, Sicot 71 BRF and a putatively heat-tolerant line, CIM 448, were exposed to 36 or 45 °C for 1 week, and half the plants were sprayed with 20 μM of the ethylene precursor, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid, (ACC). High temperature exposure of plants in both experiments was performed at the peak reproductive phase (65 – 68 days after sowing). Elevated temperature (heat shock or ramping to 45 °C) significantly reduced production and retention of fruits in all cotton lines used in this study. At the termination of heat treatment, cotton plants exposed to 45 °C had at least 50 % fewer fruits than plants under optimum temperature in all three genotypes, while plants at 36 °C remained unaffected. Heat-stressed plants continued producing new squares (fruiting buds) after termination of heat stress but these squares did not turn into cotton bolls due to pollen infertility. In vitro inhibition of pollen germination by high temperatures supported this observation. Leaf photosynthesis (Pn) of heat-stressed plants (45 °C) measured at the end of heat treatments remained significantly inhibited, despite an increased leaf stomatal conductance (gs), suggesting that high temperature impairs Pn independently of stomatal behavior. Metabolic injury was supported by high relative cellular injury and low photosystem II yield of the heat-stressed plants, indicating that high temperature impaired photosynthetic electron transport. Both heat shock and ramping of heat significantly reduced ethylene release from cotton leaf tissues measured at the end of heat treatment but modulating ethylene production via AVG or ACC application had no significant effect on fruit production or retention in heat-stressed cotton plants. Instead, high temperature accelerated fruit abortion by impairing pollen development and/or restricting leaf photosynthesis...|$|E
