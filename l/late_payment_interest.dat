40|$|The essay {{points out}} that {{over-indebtedness}} and its related issues regarding consumers protection cannot be tackled simply by public law regulations, nor by insolvency provisions alone, {{such as the ones}} contained in Law n. 3 / 2013 and in similar statutory instruments enacted in many European countries: contract law rules can help preventing over-indebtedness and also offer remedies once the debtor has become over-indebted. Nevertheless over-indebtedness challenges traditional contract law concepts and rules. Notably, with regard to prevention of over-indebtedness, the Italian legislator has failed to put in place specific remedies in case of non-performance of the “hybrid” duties, to assist the borrowers and to assess their creditworthiness, which have been set on lenders by the Directives on credit for consumption purposes and mortgage credit; at the same time, the provisions on standard unfair contract terms, usury and <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> <b>interest</b> do not suffice to protect debtors from the risk of over-indebtedness: those rules address only certain types of harmful conducts by lenders and, in order to be applied to a wider range of cases, they need to be complemented by the principle that compels the creditor to exercise his rights and defenses in conformity with good faith and that forbids any abus du droit (Article 1175 Italian Civil Code). Moreover, traditional contract law remedies do not offer an effective protection in case of bounded rationality of the borrower or exploitation by the lender of the consumer’s information asymmetry or economic distress. Once the condition of over-indebtedness has occurred, the unforeseeable events causing the difficulty or inability to repay (financial hardship) do not excuse the debtor in case of breach of contract under the rules on general obligations. In order to cure the problem, {{in the context of the}} specific relationship between creditor and debtor, the adjustment of the contract’s terms can be regarded as the most effective remedy: the debtor is entitled to the modification of the contract terms under the principle of good faith. Conclusively, the Author argues that insolvency law remedies – discharge among them – should be seen as a last resort means of protection, a form of social insurance, applicable in case of failure of all other remedies. The insolvency perspective is indeed aimed at tackling a social problem, while, on the contrary, the implications of the relationship between the borrower and the lender should be addressed at an earlier stage, by the rules on credit contracts supplemented by the general principles of contract law...|$|E

Many critics of credit card fees - including a number of US Senators - have argued that credit card penalty fees reflect banks' market share. Using a unique data set we find that fees are increasing in customer risk which supports the position of defenders of penalty fees, such as banks. However, our finding that fees are increasing in a bank's market share is consistent with the concerns expressed by politicians and regulators. We also find card penalty fees are direct substitutes for card interest rates. Credit cards Penalty fees <b>Late</b> <b>payment</b> fees <b>Interest</b> rate...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are examined {{in an analysis}} of habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> of trade credit by UK small firms. Multivariate logistic regression is employed to test the influence of variables expected to discriminate between small firms which pay late habitually and those which never or only occasionally pay late. Case studies extend quantitative analysis by validating interpretation of the results and providing explanations for unexpected outcomes. The results provide strong evidence of a financing demand for habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment.</b> There is a positive relationship between habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and difficulty obtaining bank finance and <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> by debtors and a negative relationship with the use of long term sources of finance. The influence of relationships between customer and supplier is shown to be complex. A concentrated supplier base is shown to be positively associated with <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and case studies provide evidence that this is because increased knowledge of suppliers' credit management procedures is used to pay late without penalties. The implications of this result for the large number of firms that do not enforce their statutory right to <b>interest</b> on <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> are highlighted.

This led to the study’s problem statement that stipulates that, the construction industry; particularly emerging contractors generally experience <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> from clients and employers. This {{is due to the}} fact that emerging contractors are vulnerable to failing as these contractors have limited financial resources and experience. The primary objective of the study was to develop a better understanding of the implications of <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> by the government on emerging construction contractors. The study therefore investigated the experiences of emerging construction contractors in the Eastern Cape. The secondary objectives of the study were: to identify the reasons for <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> by the public sector; determine the payment norms applicable to, and expectations of emerging construction contractors; establish construction contractors’ experiences with government payment methods; and to examine the implications of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> on emerging contractors and their businesses. The study was conducted within a qualitative research paradigm. The participants were identified through non-probability snowball sampling. The sample consisted of five emerging construction contractors mainly from the Civil Engineering and General Building sectors in the Eastern Cape.
