5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion was the <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> {{of one of}} the columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|In early March, No. 6 Commando {{moved with}} the rest of the 1st Commando Brigade to Venray where they carried out rehearsals for Operation Plunder, the {{crossing}} of the Rhine. Over the course of two weeks training was undertaken at a creek near Wansum and on 23 March 1945 the assault took place, with the objective being the capture of the town of Wesel. No. 6 Commando went across in the second wave on board storm-boats crewed by engineers. They came under fire almost immediately and as a result of this, and several mechanical failures, a number of boats were sunk before they reached the landing site at Grav Islet, where the <b>lead</b> <b>unit,</b> No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando had established a bridgehead. Ultimately the majority of the commandos made it to the form up point and No. 6 Commando passed through the marines' positions to lead the advance into the town from the north-east, marking the route as they went with white tape. Over the course of the next two days the commandos took control of the town and repelled a number of German counterattacks, before Wesel finally fell late on 25 March.|$|E
50|$|On the PC (DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms), two {{encodings}} became {{established for}} Japanese and Traditional Chinese {{in which all}} of singletons, <b>lead</b> <b>units</b> and trail units overlapped: Shift-JIS and Big5 respectively. In Shift-JIS, <b>lead</b> <b>units</b> had the range 81-9F and E0-FC, trail units had the range 40-7E and 80-FC, and singletons had the range 21-7E and A1-DF. In Big5, <b>lead</b> <b>units</b> had the range A1-FE, trail units had the range 40-7E and A1-FE, and singletons had the range 21-7E (all values in hexadecimal). This overlap again made processing tricky, though at least most of the symbols had unique byte values (though strangely the backslash does not).|$|R

25|$|In 2004 it was {{reported}} that the work on the submarine was moving forward, but due to the priority given to the new SSBN , the <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> of the class Severodvinsk would not be ready before 2010. In July 2006 the deputy chairman of the Military-Industrial Commission, Vladislav Putilin, stated that two Yasen-class submarines were to join the Russian Navy before 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} Iraq in February 2004 and {{took control of}} the Al Anbar province in western Iraq; it was the <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> in Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury in 2004. During February and March 2005, the division was relieved by the 2nd Marine Division concluding the largest relief in place {{in the history of the}} Marine Corps. In 2006, the division again deployed to Iraq as the ground combat element for I MEF in the Al Anbar province. It returned to MCB Camp Pendleton in early 2007.|$|E

25|$|The Alfonso XII {{class had}} three masts and two funnels. They were unarmored, but their hulls were built with a French-style {{cellular}} system with 12 watertight bulkheads. The Ferrol-built ships {{were the first}} two steel-hulled cruisers built in that yard. The main guns were built by Hontoria and mounted in sponsons. The torpedo tubes were fixed; one was on each beam, two were forward, and one was aft. The class {{took a long time}} to complete; the <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> was delayed for five years by material shortages and took ten years from keel-laying to commissioning.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1948, the 9th {{received}} its first Convair B-36A Peacemaker, the initial production {{version of the}} bomber, followed by a second B-36 on 12 July.

The 7th Bombardment Wing was designated as the <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> in the formation led by Major General Roger M. Ramey, Eighth Air Force commander. The 9th flew three B-29s in that formation.|$|E
25|$|Pickett {{realized}} his position was untenable after he learned between 9:00p.m. and 10:00p.m. that Bartlett's brigade {{was on its}} way to reinforce Sheridan, exposing his force to flanking Union infantry attack. So Pickett withdrew to Five Forks by 5:00a.m., giving up any advantage his attack on Sheridan might have gained. Bartlett's brigade was only the <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> for all of Griffin's and Crawford's divisions which were put on the march later that night and would have trapped Pickett's force between them and Sheridan's troops. This would have given the Confederate force no apparent alternatives other than surrender or flight to the west. Pickett's retreat gave him an opportunity to defend Five Forks and the South Side Railroad.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863) {{was fought}} during the Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War {{by a small}} Union Army cavalry {{detachment}} of two companies (87 troops) of the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry and advance units of Confederate Major General J.E.B. Stuart's Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Stuart's <b>lead</b> <b>unit</b> {{on the day of}} the battle was the 1st North Carolina Cavalry Regiment (9th State Troops) of Major General Wade Hampton's division of 2,000 men. The main body of three divisions, often still referred to at this time as brigades, of the Confederate Cavalry Corps, about 40 percent of the total troops, was moving toward the Potomac River, soon after the start of the ride of his best divisions through and around the Union Army of the Potomac on their way to Pennsylvania. The skirmish occurred near the village of Fairfax Court House in Fairfax County, Virginia on June 27, 1863.|$|E

(The Band of the Philippine Scouts appeared at the 1905 inaugural of Theodore Roosevelt, but did not lead the procession.) The 1909 inaugural parade occurred in a record-setting snowstorm, and was the first time most of the bandsmen had seen snow. Afterwards, The New York Times wrote of the band's appearance: ...|$|E

500|$|On 17August the Germans {{started to}} {{withdraw}} northwards. The divisional commander {{had already decided}} that the 3rd Parachute Brigade would lead the advance along the interior road. Their objective was to capture Bures, cross the River Dives and secure the area between there and Dozulé. At 03:00 the brigade attacked the retreating Germans. By 08:00 the 8th and 9th Battalions had captured Bures, and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion moved through the Bois de Bavant. The bridges in Bures had been blown up previously, and it took the brigade's engineers until the afternoon to build a crossing. By 21:00 the brigade had crossed the Dives and halted with the 8th Parachute Battalion out in front at Goustranville. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was behind them, and the 9th Parachute Battalion in reserve. The next day the brigade met heavy resistance just beyond Goustranville, on the Dives Canal and at Dozulé train station. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion {{had taken over the}} advance and were ordered to seize four bridges crossing the canal. The assault began at 22:00; at 22:35 the railway bridge in the north had been captured, and by midnight all four bridges were secured with 150 prisoners taken. The 9th Parachute Battalion then passed through the Canadians and crossed the next water obstacle without boats, as they found the water was only [...] deep. At 01:00 on 19August they reached Dozulé. It was not until 07:00 on 21August that the advance restarted, with the objective of Pont-l'Evêque on the River Touques. After a hard battle the 8th Parachute Battalion captured Annebault, and the 5th Parachute Brigade then took over as the division's <b>lead</b> <b>unit.</b> On 24August [...] the [...] 3rd Parachute Brigade and 4th Special Service Brigade captured Beuzeville, and the 5th Parachute Brigade reached Pont Audemer, which was the division's last objective. On 27August the division was ordered to concentrate in the area between Honfleur and Pont Audemer and prepare to return to England.|$|E
