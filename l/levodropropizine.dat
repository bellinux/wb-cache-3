40|$|Abstract Background Cough {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} symptoms in children and is the most common symptom for which children visit a health care provider. Methods This is an observational study on acute cough associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in children. The study evaluates the epidemiology and impact of cough on quality of sleep and children's activities, and the outcome of cough with antitussive treatments in pediatric routine clinical practice. Study assessments were performed through a pediatric cough questionnaire (PCQ), developed by the Italian Society of Cough Study. A total of 433 children visited by family care pediatricians for acute cough due to a URTI were enrolled in this study, with mean age of 6. 1 years (SD 3. 6). Cough type, duration, severity and frequency, cough impact on sleep disturbances of children and parents and on school and sport activities were assessed at baseline. In a subset of 241 children who were either treated with antitussive drugs (<b>levodropropizine</b> n = 101, central antitussives n = 60) or received no treatment (n = 80), the outcome of cough after 6 days was analyzed in terms of resolution, improvement, no change, or worsening. Descriptive analysis, χ 2 test, and multivariate analysis with stepwise logistic regression were performed. Results Cough disturbed sleep in 88 % of children and 72 % of parents. In children treated with cough suppressants, the duration, type, intensity, and frequency cough were similar at baseline in the two groups respectively treated with <b>levodropropizine</b> and central antitussives (cloperastine and codeine). Both <b>levodropropizine</b> and central drugs reduced cough intensity and frequency. However, percentage of cough resolution was higher with <b>levodropropizine</b> than with central antitussives (47 % vs. 28 % respectively, p = 0. 0012). Conclusions Acute cough disturbs sleep in most children and their parents. Both <b>levodropropizine</b> and central antitussives reduced cough intensity, with <b>levodropropizine</b> producing a higher cough resolution rate. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Levodropropizine</b> is a {{recently}} developed, peripherally active antitussive agent which {{is widely used}} in clinical practice. In order to obtain further information on the spectrum of activity of this compound in experimental clinical models, a double-blind controlled study was carried out to evaluate the potential effect of the drug against cough and bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of an ultrasonically nebulized solution of distilled water in patients with obstructive lung disease. Twenty patients were randomly divided into two groups, which received <b>levodropropizine</b> (60 mg t. i. d.) or placebo respectively for 7 consecutive days. Parameters evaluated at baseline and {{on the last day}} of treatment included (i) results of respiratory function tests (FEV 1, IVC, FVC, TIFF, PEF, MEF 75, MEF 50, MEF 25) performed before the stimulation test with nebulized water; (ii) total number of coughs during a 2 -hour period after the stimulation test; (iii) bronchial responsiveness, quantified by calculating the volume of nebulized water required to induce a 20 % reduction of FEV 1 below the basal level. At pretreatment, the tussive response was very similar in the two groups. A significant decrease in number of coughs (from 34. 4 +/- 8. 4 at baseline to 15. 6 +/- 4. 9 post-treatment, p < 0. 01) was observed after administration of <b>levodropropizine,</b> whereas placebo treatment produced no significant effect (number of coughs: 29. 6 +/- 4. 9 at baseline vs 24. 8 +/- 9. 6 post-treatment, N. S.). Bronchial responsiveness decreased significantly (compared to baseline) in both treatment groups, without any significant difference between drug and placebo. Respiratory function tests were not significantly affected by either treatment. It is concluded that <b>levodropropizine</b> effectively antagonizes the cough response induced by inhalation of distilled water without affecting bronchial responsiveness in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease...|$|E
40|$|Cough {{associated}} with acute and chronic respiratory conditions {{is common in}} patients of all ages. Levocloperastine is a novel antitussive with a pharmacological profile distinct {{from that of the}} racemic DL-cloperastine. Levocloperastine with its dual mechanism of action acts on both the central bulbar cough Centre and on peripheral receptors in the tracheobronchial tree, In preclinical studies. levocloperastine demonstrated antitussive effects similar to those observed with codeine. In acute and repeated-dose toxicity studies, levocloperastine was well tolerated in rodents and dogs, with no clinically significant cardiovascular or gastrointestinal adverse events, The pharmacokinetic behaviour of levocloperastine. best described by a two-compartmental model with absorption phase. {{is similar to that of}} the racemic compound DL-cloperastine. In clinical trials, levocloperastine had a faster onset of action and produced greater reductions in the intensity and frequency of cough compared with DL-cloperastine, codeine and <b>levodropropizine.</b> The antitussive effects (reduction in intensity and frequency of cough) of levocloperastine were observed after the first day of treatment in patients of all ages. In children, levocloperastine reduced night-time awakenings and irritability; in adults, it was also effective in treating ACE-inhibitor cough. Levocloperastine was generally well tolerated. There was no evidence of clinically significant central adverse events, whereas drowsiness, dry mouth and nausea were reported with comparator agents (<b>levodropropizine,</b> codeine, DL-cloperastine). Levocloperastine represents an effective alternative to currently used antitussive agents with the added advantage of faster onset of action and improved tolerability in all patient groups...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cough {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} for which patients seek medical attention from primary care physicians and pulmonologists. Cough is an important defensive reflex that enhances the clearance of secretions and particles from the airways and protects the lower airways from the aspiration of foreign materials. Therapeutic suppression of cough may be either disease-specific or symptom related. The potential benefits of an early treatment of cough could include the prevention of the vicious cycle of cough. There has been a long tradition in acute cough, which is frequently due to upper respiratory tract infections, to use symptom-related anti-tussives. Suppression of cough (during chronic cough) may be achieved by disease-specific therapies, but in many patients it is often necessary to use symptomatic anti-tussives, too. According to the current guidelines of the American College of Chest Physician on "Cough Suppressants and Pharmacologic Protussive Therapy" and additional clinical trials on the most frequent anti-tussive drugs, it should be possible to diagnose and treat cough successfully in a majority of cases. Among drugs used for the symptomatic treatment of cough, peripherally acting anti-tussives such as <b>levodropropizine</b> and moguisteine show the highest level of benefit and should be recommended especially in children. By improving our understanding of the specific effects of these anti-tussive agents, the therapeutic use of these drugs may be refined.

40|$|Cough is a {{distressing}} symptom {{in patients}} with cancer and difficult to manage in practice. Hence, {{the aim of this}} review is to assess and synthesise the available literature in the management of cough in cancer patients, in order to improve on practice recommendations. Studies with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. An extensive literature search yielded 17 studies for evaluation. Eight of them were about the use of brachytherapy (a technique were a radiation source is placed inside the bronchus in the lung or next to the area requiring treatment), use of laser resection or photodynamic therapy (a treatment that uses a drug plus a special type of light to kill cancer cells). Nine more studies assessed the effects of a number of different medication, including codeine and morphine. Overall, the research was of poor quality with significant methodological problems, hence no credible evidence is available in the literature to guide practice. Acknowledging these limitations, brachytherapy was found to be helpful in a variety of radiation doses in selected patients. Also some pharmacological treatments were found to be helpful particularly with regards to morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, <b>levodropropizine,</b> sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate linctus (a cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias and some reported side effects. No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions in the management of cough in cance...|$|E

40|$|Cough {{remains a}} major unmet clin. need, and preclin. animal models are not {{predictive}} for new antitussive agents. We {{have investigated the}} mechanisms and pharmacol. sensitivity of ozone-induced hypertussive responses in rabbits and guinea pigs. Ozone induced {{a significant increase in}} cough frequency and a decrease in time to first cough to inhaled citric acid in both conscious guinea pigs and rabbits. This response was inhibited by the established antitussive drugs codeine and <b>levodropropizine.</b> In contrast to the guinea pig, hypertussive responses in the rabbit were not inhibited by bronchodilator drugs (b 2 agonists or muscarinic receptor antagonists), suggesting that the obsd. hypertussive state was not secondary to bronchoconstriction in this species. The ozone-induced hypertussive response in the rabbit was inhibited by chronic pretreatment with capsaicin, suggestive of a sensitization of airway sensory nerve fibers. However, we could find no evidence for a role of TRPA 1 in this response, suggesting that ozone was not sensitizing airway sensory nerves via activation of this receptor. Whereas the ozone-induced hypertussive response was accompanied by a significant influx of neutrophils into the airway, the hypertussive response was not inhibited by the antiinflammatory phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast at a dose that clearly exhibited anti-inflammatory activity. In summary, our results suggest that ozone-induced hypertussive responses to citric acid may provide a useful model for the investigation of novel drugs for the treatment of cough, but some important differences were noted between the two species with respect to sensitivity to bronchodilator drugs...|$|E
