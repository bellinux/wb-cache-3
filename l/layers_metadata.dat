40|$|We {{present a}} novel form of intra-volume {{directory}} layering with hierarchical, inheritance-like namespace unification. While each layer of an OLFS volume constitutes a subvolume {{that can be}} mounted separately in a fan-in configuration, the entire hierarchy is always accessible (online) and fully navigable through any mounted layer. OLFS uses a relational database to store its <b>layering</b> <b>metadata</b> and either a relational database or any (virtual) host file system as its backing store, along with metadata and block caching for improved performance. Because OLFS runs as a virtual file system in user-space, its capabilities are available to all existing software without modification or special privileges. We have developed a reference implementation of OLFS for FUSE based on MySQL and XFS, and conducted performance benchmarking against XFS by itself. We explore several applications of OLFS, such as enhanced server synchronization, transactional file operations, and versioning...|$|R
40|$|Video {{surveillance}} {{systems are}} growing {{in size and}} complexity. Such systems typically consist of integrated modules of different vendors {{to cope with the}} increasing demands on network and storage capacity, intelligent video analytics, picture quality, and enhanced visual interfaces. Within a surveillance system, relevant information (like technical details on the video sequences, or analysis results of the monitored environment) is described using metadata standards. However, different modules typically use different standards, resulting in metadata interoperability problems. In this paper, we introduce the application of Semantic Web Technologies to overcome such problems. We present a semantic, <b>layered</b> <b>metadata</b> model and integrate it within a video surveillance system. Besides dealing with the metadata interoperability problem, the advantages of using Semantic Web Technologies and the inherent rule support are shown. A practical use case scenario is presented to illustrate the benefits of our novel approach...|$|R

Specifically, we are developing a <b>layered</b> <b>metadata</b> reference model to describe multi-media entertainment data and the architectures supporting it. Further, we are building a prototype distributed multi-media delivery system which utilises intelligent, distributed caching mechanisms to improve accessibility, performance and reliability while minimising storage space and network utilisation. The metadata reference model feeds into the decision making capabilities of the data delivery system to improve system performance, through staging and migration.

This <b>layer</b> called Preservation <b>Metadata</b> <b>Layer</b> (PML) uses PREMIS semantics as the common language to overcome archival systems differences, and to transmit out of its original context, relevant preservation information about content objects comprising an AIP. Since a repository, following the OAIS reference model, usually provides resources with metadata container objects, the experiment performed an analysis on commonly used container formats, in order to enable the traceability of semantics from a local to extra-local level, and the technological understandability of alien AIPs. The analysis has allowed {{the definition of a}} PML data model, laying the production of prototypes.

40|$|Backup is cumbersome. To be effective, backups {{have to be}} made {{at regular}} intervals, forcing users to {{organize}} and store a growing collection of backup media. In this paper we propose a novel Peer-to-Peer backup system, PeerStore, that allows the user to store his backups on other people's computers instead. PeerStore is an adaptive, cost-effective system suitable for all types of networks ranging from LAN, WAN to large unstable networks like the Internet. The system consists of two layers: <b>metadata</b> <b>layer</b> and symmetric trading layer. Locating blocks and duplicate checking is accomplished by the <b>metadata</b> <b>layer</b> while the actual data distribution is done between pairs of peers after they have established a symmetric data trade. By decoupling the metadata management from data storage, the system offers a significant reduction of the maintenance cost and preserves fairness among peers. Results show that PeerStore has a reduced maintenance cost comparing to pStore. PeerStore also realizes fairness because of the symmetric nature of the trades...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this article, we {{will discuss}} certain {{specific}} aspects of information systems that lend themselves to infusion of artificial intelligence methods and techniques. We recognize three information layers in an information/knowledge base system, i. e. the ontology (or ontic) <b>layer,</b> the <b>metadata</b> <b>layer,</b> and the data layer. The word ontology refers to a branch of metaphysics that explores the nature of Being. Following Martin Heidegger (German philosopher 1889 - 1976), we use the word “ontic ” to refer to “being ” in the restricted sense, in this case an information system. The three layers represent a conceptual hierarchy from higher to lower levels of abstraction (or from lower {{to higher levels of}} specificity.) The ontic layer may be domainindependent, comprising generic organizing concepts of any knowledge base or may be domainspecific, e. g. ontology of a tourist information system. The Ontic Layer. This normally refers to the layer, which contains high-level concepts that organize the upper parts of a generic knowledge base. But it may also refer to the organizing elements of a domain-specific knowledge area such as a tourist knowledge base. Thus, the distinction between the ontic layer and the domain knowledge layer is that the former contains the vocabulary and the conceptual building blocks in the knowledge base and the latter contain...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} schema {{layer of}} a Database Management System (DBMS) {{can be modified}} to produce results that {{do not reflect the}} data actually stored in the database. For example, table structures may be corrupted by changing the metadata of a database, or operators of the database can be altered to produce incorrect results when used in queries. Such incorrect results may lead to a forensic examination to determine the cause of the problem. Alternatively, such modifications may be employed as an anti-forensic technique in an attempt to hide the actual data from an investigator when an investigation lead to the examination of a database. In both cases forensic examiners {{need to be aware of}} the impact of such metadata on queries and plan their examination of the database accordingly. Different versions of a <b>layer</b> of <b>metadata</b> may exist: a version as found on the computer being investigated, the version that was initially designed, versions from backups, and so on. It is possible that these versions are identical, but subtle ad hoc changes are often made over time and someone with access and malicious intent can introduce changes to modify the behaviour of the DBMS to achieve some nefarious goal. This paper initially discusses categories of possibilities that exist to (surreptitiously) change the application schema; practical examples are used to illustrate these possibilities. The paper is based on the premise that a specific combination of DBMS <b>layers</b> of <b>metadata</b> and data should be assembled to test specific hypotheses.

In 4 Any Framework, we assume learning has to occur anywhere, anyway, anytime for anybody. The actors in this framework are specified as Instructor, Learner, Device and Programmer. Each actor initiates an action with respective entities Information, Media, Location. Time is considered as another layer with the repetition of these components at another time.
