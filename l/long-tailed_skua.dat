50|$|Distinguishing this skua {{from the}} {{northern}} hemisphere Arctic, pomarine and <b>long-tailed</b> <b>skuas</b> is relatively straightforward. The large size, massive barrel chest, and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. The flight is direct and powerful. Identification of this skua is more complicated when {{it is necessary to}} distinguish it from the closely related great skua of the North Atlantic, and the other large southern hemisphere skuas. Identification problems make claims of any southern hemisphere skua in the eastern North Atlantic problematic, and few records of south polar skua have been accepted in Western Europe.

In 1975 and 1979, estimated mean egg production per territorial pair was 1. 2 and 1. 9, respectively, and young did hatch, but none of them fledged. In both these years two-thirds of overall egg and chick mortality was caused by Arctic Foxes. Survival time of clutches and young in the different breeding years was negatively correlated with the number of foxes per unit of snow-free area. High breeding success of <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skuas</b> in Northeast Greenland occurs only in years with moderate to high food availability, a relatively low number of foxes and early to rather early disappearance of snow cover. Chicks gained weight rapidly from the first day to 12 or 13 days after hatching, when fast growth of culmen and tarsus stopped, {{and growth of}} wing slowed down. During the first two weeks in 1975 first-hatched chicks were heavier than second-hatched chicks of the same age and single chicks were similar to first-hatched chicks. The two longest surviving chicks reached an age of 24 and 25 days, at which time they had not yet fledged. Chicks and parents showed a circadian rhythm with greatest activity during the day and a period of sleep during the night in which the sun does not set at this latitude.

40|$|Dwarf eggs, e. g. {{eggs that}} are very much smaller than normal eggs, are {{occasionally}} found among normal eggs in nests of birds. Although they are not often mentioned in the handbooks, the frequency of dwarf eggs seems to be about one per thousand, or less. In 2001 I found one dwarf egg in a nest with two eggs of the <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skua</b> Stercorarius longicaudus at Ammarnas in Swedish Lapland.

50|$|Skuas {{are related}} to gulls, waders, auks, and skimmers. In the three smaller species, all nesting {{exclusively}} in the Holarctic, breeding adults have the two central tail feathers obviously elongated, and at least some adults have white on the underparts and pale yellow on the neck. These characteristics are not shared by the larger species, all native to the Southern Hemisphere except for the great skua. Therefore, the skuas are often split into two genera, with only the smaller species retained in Stercorarius, and the large species placed in Catharacta. However, based on genetics, behavior, and feather lice, the overall relationship among the species is best expressed by placing all in a single genus. The pomarine and great skuas' mitochondrial DNA (inherited from the mother) is in fact {{more closely related to}} each other than it is to either Arctic or <b>long-tailed</b> <b>skuas,</b> or to the Southern Hemisphere species. Thus, hybridization must have played a considerable role {{in the evolution of the}} diversity of Northern Hemisphere skuas.|$|R
40|$|Energy reserves, gonad {{development}} and breeding of <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skuas</b> were investigated in East Greenland at Kap Stewart in 1973 and 1974, at Gåseelv and Ugleelv in 1975, and at Kaerelv in 1975. In spring adults arrived along the ice edge {{and on the}} tundra with maximal energy reserves, with testes of sub-maximal size and enlarged follicles close to the size at which rapid follicle growth may start. In paired birds the loss of energy reserves in the pre-breeding period decided how far rapid follicular growth proceded and whether none, one or two eggs were laid. In 1973 and 1975 oneegg and two-egg pais had similar energy reserve losses until hatching of the young, regardless of clutch size. Nonbreeding birds in 1974 lost their energy reserves {{at a faster rate}} than did breeding birds in 1973 and 1975, weights of laid eggs included. Timing of egg laying was correlated with the disappearance of snow-cover and the experience of the pair and not with body energy reserves. One – egg and two – egg clutches in 1973 and 1975 had the same average completion date (13 June). First clutches were completed between 4 June (Gåseelv 1975) and 5 July (Kap Stewart 1973) and replacement clutches until 14 July (Kaerelv 1979). Testes and largest follicles started to regress at or soon after (failed) breeding. In non-breeders regression started later than in early breeders. All breeding and non-breeding territorial birds developed brood patches, which started to appear in the first days of pair formation. In females, only breeding birds had full-size patches, which were attained at clutch initiation. Males attained full-size patches some days before or after clutch initiation and some of them also without eggs being produced. In early breeders patches started to regress between two and three weeks after clutch initiation, in late breeders within a week. In 1975 about 61 % of the incubation was done by the female...|$|R
40|$|This bird {{report for}} the Camargue, Crau and Alpilles (Rhône delta, S. France), covers the years 1980 and 1981. It has been {{compiled}} partly from observations communicated by visiting n aturalists but particularly from resident ornithologists, attached to the « Fondation Tour du Valat », the « Centre d'Écologie de Camargue » (C. N. R. S.), the « Réserve Nationale de Camargue » (S. N. P. N.) and the « Centre de Recherches Ornithologiques de Provence » (C. R. O. P.). As with the previous reports only the results of censuses and unusual observations are given. As a baseline, readers are advised to consult the recently published guide to the birds of the Camargue by Blondel and Isenmann (1981) in which are mentioned all 337 species recorded {{in the area to}} date. The climatological report shows a cold spell in December 1980, with subzero temperatures recorded on 18 days. Total rainfall in autumn and winter was below, but in spring and summer higher, than normal. 1981 was even more unusual, with 25 nights of frost in January, low rainfall, long hours of sunlight and much northerly wind. In contrast, the winter ended (March) mild and wet. April was mild and dry, May cold and wet. The variable summer and autumn weather was characterised by a dry spell (excepting September) with no rain in October/November. December was mild and wet. A first complete census of wintering cormorants revealed 4000 in 1980 and 6000 in 1981 against a formerly estimated maximum of about 2000. This increase has meant that the delta {{has become one of the}} most important wintering are as for the species in western Europe. The Grey Heron population continues to increase with 438 nests in 1980 and 515 in 1981 (table I). In contrast, Purple Herons have decreased in number in the delta over the last decade, probably as a result of a reduction in the available breeding habitat. Large colonies still exist just outside the delta, and the region continues to be the most important breeding area for Purple Herons in France. The population of Cattle Egrets, after being stable from 1977 to 1979 (table II), increased by 48 % in 1980 before decreasing in 1981. This drop was undoubtedly attributable to the cold winter. A nest of Little Bittern was found in 1981 and there is a summer record of a Reef Heron in 1980. A pair of White Storks again bred, raising 3 young in both years. The adult pair are sedentary whilst the young migrate in autumn. Flamingos again bred in large numbers, with 7500 prs. in 1980 and 9500 prs. in 1981, although this latter figure was reduced to 8170 prs. by heavy rains. These raised 3730 and 4000 chicks respectively. The colour-ringing programme continued and a further 1358 chicks were marked during the two years, bringing the total of individu ally recognisable birds to 3316. Of these, 1724 (52 %) have since been identified throughout the West Mediterranean, whilst the total number of sightings exceeds 11000. Both Greylag Goose and Gannet have been attracted to the Flamingo colony, the latter bird staying for three months, displaying and occupying a nest cone and accompanying the flamingos up to 14 kms inland. Bewick's Swans continue to be winter visitors with 52 in 1979 - 1980 and 82 in 1980 - 1981, with a record high of 23 juveniles. The breeding population of Shelduck, a species extending its range in the south of France, was censused in 1980, with 350 chicks (42 families) in the Salins-de-Giraud and 700 (86 families) in the Salins-d'Aigues-Mortes. A further 111 were colour-ringed as part of a study on the movements of the West Mediterranean population which has now been shown to moult in the same area as the North West European population, in North West Germany, a distance of 1200 kms north of the Camargue. Winter counts have revealed peaks of 1354 birds in 1980 and 1035 in 1981, in each case representing over 80 % of the total number recorded in the south of France. For other species of ducks the peak 1980 - 1981 winter count was of 143000 in November. Instead of increasing in December, as is usually the case, the cold spell of early December resulted in a decrease of 25 % mostly caused by a high hunting mortality within the delta. Amongst the major changes in numbers compared to former winters has been a decrease of Pintail and Tufted Ducks and an increase of Shoveler and Gadwall. Diving ducks (Tufted and Pochard) are gradually decreasing in the Camargue because there are more attractive areas further north, whilst some of the surface-feeders tend to increase, Mallard and Teal together regularly forming 50 - 60 % of the total Anatidae. Amongst the seaducks, a concentration of 1000 Scoters, mostly or solely Velvets, was quite exceptional. The area is one of the most remarkable in Europe for raptors at all seasons. Booted Eagles were again regularly recorded in 1980 and a Sea Eagle appeared in both years. Wintering Marsh Harriers are at a remarkably high density with 280 counted at 3 roosts, probably only about half of the total in the area. There were two observations of Eleonora's Falcon in 1981. The average number of wintering coots bas recently decreased from about 25000 (1964 - 1968) to 20000 in 1980 - 1981. Sample censuses of the breeding population indicate a relatively law density of 3. 7 nests per 10 ha. ln the Crau, the wintering Little Bustards have been estimated at 1000 - 1100, which corresponds with the breeding population of about 500 prs. The third record of a Pectoral Sandpiper was a bird shot in September 1979. There is a second winter record of a Great Skua in 1981 and a remarkable observation of 22 <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skuas</b> together in the Gulf of Beauduc in May 1980. A pair of Mediterranean Gulls successfully bred in both 1980 and 1981 whilst the Slender-billed Gull was not found breeding either year. The former of these two species occurs in large numbers outside the breeding season with maximum counts of 250 in March 1980 and 700 in September 1981. Two pairs of Black Terns nested in 1980, the first breeding record since 1931. Whiskered Terns bred in 1981 (120 prs.). This species was formerly abundant in the area but bad not been recorded breeding since 1974. The Long-eared Owl, which forms winter roosts of up to 20 birds, was found breeding in 1980 for only the fifth time. There are several spring records of Red-rumped Swallows whilst those of the common Swallow in December may indicate a possible attempt at wintering. Richard's Pipit was recorded for the first time in October 1981 with a second record one month later, whilst the May 1980 record of a Red-throated Pipit was only the sixth in the past 30 years. The Stonechat seems now to be well re-established as a breeding species and there is a possible return of the Penduline Tit with one nest found in each of the two years...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skua</b> () is a {{specialist}} predator of lemmings {{during the summer}} and hence {{an important component of the}} tundra ecosystems, but most of its life cycle takes place offshore and remains largely unknown outside of the breeding season. Using 9. 5 -g solar-powered satellite transmitters, we were able to document for the first time the post-breeding movements of the <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skua,</b> from its high-Arctic breeding-grounds in North and Eastern Greenland to the tropical waters of West Africa. The birds traveled the approximately 10, 000  km of this migration in only 3 - 5  weeks, covering 800 - 900  km/day during active migration, which also occurred during nighttime. Leaving their breeding areas in August (except for one failed breeder), the Long-tailed Skuas first moved south along the coast of East Greenland towards a staging area off the Canadian Great Banks where they stayed for 1 - 3  weeks. From there, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean eastwards in just 1  week, entering African waters near the Madeira Archipelago in September. Although only four birds were monitored for 1. 5 - 3  months, the data reveal that the migration routes between birds breeding in different locations and in different years were relatively similar...|$|E
40|$|In {{our model}} (main article), {{the numbers of}} lemmings predated by the arctic fox, the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>skua</b> and the snowy owl were {{calculated}} based on the functional and numerical responses of the predators presented in Fig. 1 (main article). All these species feed mostly on lemmings, which account for> 90 % of their diet when lemming densities are> 1 ind. /ha. At lower lemming densities, the main alternate prey are birds (ptarmigan, waders and passerines) for the snowy owl, small birds, fishes, invertebrates and berries for the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>skua,</b> and arctic hare, muskox carrion, birds, eggs, invertebrates and berries for the arctic fox (O.

40|$|Fieldwork in {{different}} parts of Severnaya Zemlya in 1985, 1991, 1992 and 1993 and aerial surveys in 1994 revealed a limited bird fauna with a total of 17 breeding species. The most numerous breeding birds are cliff-nesting seabirds, comprising little auk (Alle alle), 10 000 - 80 000 pairs; kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), 5000 - 10 000; black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), 1000 - 5000; ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), 1000 - 2000; and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), 500 - 1000. They breed all over the archipelago, usually in rather small mixed- or single-species colonies. Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) 100 - 500, and herring gull (Larus argentatus) 1 - 10, breed as solitary pairs or with a few pairs together. Of tundra birds, only brent goose (Branta bernicla), purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima) and snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) are found breeding on most of the major islands.

40|$|International audienceQuantifying within- and between-individual {{variation}} in animal migration strategies {{is a first}} step towards our understanding of the ability of migrants to adjust to changes in the environment.

We obtained 97 annual tracks of 38 individuals and quantified similarity between routes. Overall, tracks of the same individual were generally within about 200 to 300 km of their previous year’s route, and more similar than tracks of different individuals. Some flexibility was observed during migration, but individuals were faithful to their staging areas in the North Atlantic and in the Benguela Current off Namibia and South Africa. Over the course of the winter, an increasing number of individuals started to deviate—up to 5200 km—from the previous year’s route. Intriguingly, individuals could be highly consistent between 2 consecutive years and flexible between other years. Site-shifts in late winter seem to reflect responses to local conditions, but what promotes this larger flexibility remains unclear and requires further study. Our results show that individual long-tailed skuas are generally consistent in their itineraries, but can show considerable flexibility in some years. The flexibility in itineraries suggests that long-tailed skuas are able to adjust to environmental change, but the mechanisms leading to the observed within- and between-individual {{variation in}} movement patterns are still poorly understood...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} phylogenetic analyses {{have revealed}} that some apparently oligoxenous feather mite species are in fact monoxenous cryptic species with little morphological differentiation. In this study we analyzed two species, Zachvatkinia isolata (Avenzoariidae) and Alloptes (Sternalloptes) stercorarii (Alloptidae) which prefer {{different parts of the}} plumage of two sister species of birds: arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) and <b>long-tailed</b> <b>skua</b> (S. longicaudus) breeding on tundra in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Given that there are no reports about hybridization events between the host species, we expected that both skuas would have a species-specific acarofauna. The genetic distances among DNA-barcode sequences (COI and 28 S rDNA), phylogenetic tree topologies, and haplotype networks of the COI sequences of mites suggested extensive gene flow in Z. isolata between and within populations inhabiting both skua species, whereas the Alloptes populations were host specific and sufficiently genetically separated as to warrant species-level status. The discrepancy in the genetic structure of Alloptes and Zachvatkinia populations suggests frequent but transient contacts between the two skua species in which the probability of mite exchange is much higher for Zachvatkinia, which is present in high numbers and inhabits exposed parts of primary flight feathers, than for the less abundant Alloptes that lives primarily in more protected and inaccessible parts of the plumage. We discuss the possible nature of these contacts between host species and the area(s) where they might take place. The star-like structures in the haplotype network as well as high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity observed in Z. isolata are concordant with the known dispersal strategy of feather mites: vertical colonization of new host individuals followed by rapid growth of founder populations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skua,</b> a small (, 300 g) Arctic-breeding {{predator}} and seabird, is a functionally {{very important}} component of the Arctic vertebrate communities in summer, but little is known about its migration and winter distribution. We used lightlevel geolocators to track the annual movements of eight adult birds breeding in north-east Greenland (n = 3) and Svalbard (n = 5). All birds wintered in the Southern Hemisphere (mean arrival-departure dates on wintering grounds: 24 October- 21 March) : five along the south-west coast of Africa (0 – 40 uS, 0 – 15 uE), in the productive Benguela upwelling, and three further south (30 – 40 uS, 0 – 50 uE), in an area extending into the south-west Indian Ocean. Different migratory routes and rates of travel were documented during post-breeding (345 km d 21 in late August-early September) and spring migrations (235 km d 21 in late April) when most birds used a more westerly flyway. Among the different staging areas, a large region off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland appears to be the most important. It was used in autumn by {{all but one of the}} tracked birds (from a few days to three weeks) and in spring by five out of eight birds (from one to more than six weeks). Two other staging sites, off the Iberian coast and near the Azores, were used by two birds in spring for five to six weeks. Over one year, individuals travelled between 43, 900 and 54, 200 km (36, 600 – 45, 700 when excluding staging periods) and went as far as 10, 500 – 13, 700 km (mean 12, 800 km) from their breeding sites. This study has revealed important marine areas in both the south and north Atlantic Ocean. Sustainable management of these ocean basins will benefit Long-tailed Skuas as well as other trans-equatorial migrants from the Arctic. © 2013 Gilg et al.

40|$|Differences between ages, sexes and {{populations in}} the timing of {{migration}} at Falsterbo, Sweden and {{in the choice of}} wintering site among raptors in Scania were investigated. Competition and dominance is the best primary explanation to the results. In most cases the more competitive adults winter north of juveniles and the larger females north of males. Moult strategy {{is probably one of the}} most important reasons why females in general migrate south earlier than males, and juveniles ahead of adults, in some short-distance migrants. The proportion of adults and juveniles in Swedish raptors leaving via Falsterbo is calculated. The concentration rate is generally highest in species with a more southerly distribution and in raptors primarily using thermal migration. With a few exceptions juveniles are more concentrated at Falsterbo than adults. An analysis of the long-term systematic migration counts from Falsterbo, shows that in all raptors where the Swedish population trends are reasonably well known from other studies, the fluctuation in numbers is very well reflected in the autumn figures from Falsterbo. The proportion of juvenile birds among the migrants gives a good measure of the annual reproduction in several species. By separating Common Buzzards with a white plumage (mainly with a relatively southerly breeding range) at Falsterbo it was possible to demonstrate some differences in migration pattern compared to darker and more northerly birds. Studies of three species of skuas on the Russian tundra demonstrated interesting differences in the proportion of dark phase. While no dark phase birds seem to occur in <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Skua</b> the proportion was close to 8 % dark birds in Pomarine Skua all the way from Norway to Wrangel Island. This strongly indicates a gene flow all along the transect in this nomadic species. In Arctic Skua on the other hand there was an abrupt change from 64 % dark phase on the Kola Peninsula to an almost complete dominance of light birds all along the Russian tundra. Satellite transmitters constitute an invaluable tool enabling detailed studies of the migration strategies of individual birds. Thirteen Ospreys were tracked on autumn migration from Sweden to the wintering grounds in tropical Africa. The average speed for the whole journey was 174 km/day. This is similar to migration speeds in other raptors studied by satellite telemetry, but considerably faster than results from ringing recoveries. There was large individual variation with few major differences between sexes and ages. The birds made between 0 and 4 stopovers along the way. Migration took place only during the light hours and the Ospreys spent about nine hours in active flight on travelling days...|$|E
