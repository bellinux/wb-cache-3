5|$|Amy neared {{hurricane}} intensity several times, {{beginning on}} June30 as maximum winds increased to 70mph (110km/h); however, {{the storm was}} unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical.

5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave.
