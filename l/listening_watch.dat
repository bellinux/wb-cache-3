A <b>listening</b> <b>watch</b> aboard GMDSS-equipped ships on 2182 kHz ended on February 1, 1999. In May 2002, IMO decided to postpone cessation of a VHF <b>listening</b> <b>watch</b> aboard ships.

All this work was carried out at no cost to the public purse.|$|E

Following an escort mission to the Palaus from 5 to 11 January 1945, Vigilance returned to Ulithi on the 12th, only to find a full-scale antisubmarine alert in progress. She commenced patrolling station number 7 in company with [...] before receiving orders to patrol off the Zowariyau and Piiriperiperi channels.

For the latter part of February, the minesweeper served as submarine <b>listening</b> <b>watch</b> and harbor entrance patrol vessel at Kossol before she returned to Ulithi. From 6 to 8 March, Vigilance lay alongside [...] undergoing availability in preparation for the upcoming operation against the Ryūkyūs.

She cut loose one moored mine on the 26th, three on the 27th, and one on the 28th. While performing these sweep operations, she served as MinRon 4 [...] "destruction vessel", slated to destroy loose mines once they reached the surface. The ship sank several drifting floats and one moored mine with gunfire.|$|E
