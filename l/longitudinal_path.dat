50|$|An {{intuitive}} {{argument can}} also be used to show that the flux density outside the solenoid is actually zero. Magnetic field lines only exist as loops, they cannot diverge from or converge to a point like electric field lines can (see Gauss's law for magnetism). The magnetic field lines follow the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>path</b> of the solenoid inside, so they must go in the opposite direction outside of the solenoid so that the lines can form a loop. However, the volume outside the solenoid is much greater than the volume inside, so the density of magnetic field lines outside is greatly reduced. Now recall that the field outside is constant. In order for the total number of field lines to be conserved, the field outside must go to zero as the solenoid gets longer.|$|E
50|$|Deletion of pioneer axons which {{create the}} {{scaffold}} {{have an effect}} on the growth cones of the neurons of the nucleus of the posterior commissure, in that they cannot follow the normal path of extending ventrally, then posteriorly. Despite the compromised pioneer neuron scaffold, the follower growth cones extend ventrally normally. However, around half of the followers do not follow the posterior <b>longitudinal</b> <b>path</b> correctly, while the other half do. This suggests that other cues other than those from pioneer axons play a role in guiding follower axon growth, and that pioneer axons may play different roles in different parts of neuronal development. In a different study, replacement or removal of the early-born retinal ganglion cells, which function as pioneer neurons, had a significantly deleterious effect on the ability of later axons to exit the eye. Subsequent axon-axon interactions were also shown to be necessary, as misrouting of retinal axons led to chiasm defasciculaiton, telencephalic and ventral hindbrain projections, or aberrant crossing in the posterior commissure.|$|E

40|$|Most post-crossing commissural axons {{turn into}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>paths</b> to make {{synaptic}} connections with their targets. Mechanisms that control their rostrocaudal turning polarity are still poorly understood. We used the hindbrain {{as a model}} system to investigate the rostral turning of a laterally located commissural tract, identified as the caudal group of contralateral cerebellar-projecting second-order vestibular neurons (cC-VC). We found that the caudal hindbrain possessed a graded non-permissive/repulsive activity for growing cC-VC axons. This non-permissiveness/repulsion was in part mediated by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored ephrin A. We further demonstrated that ephrin A 2 was distributed in a caudal-high/rostral-low gradient in the caudolateral hindbrain and cC-VC axons expressed EphA receptors. Finally, perturbing ephrin A/EphA signalling both in vitro and in vivo led to rostrocaudal pathfinding errors of post-crossing cC-VC axons. These results suggest that ephrin A/EphA interactions {{play a key role}} in regulating the polarity of post-crossing cC-VC axons as they turn into the longitudinal axis...|$|R

40|$|Paleomagnetic data on {{geomagnetic}} reversals {{are divided}} into two general categories: times of occurrence, and records of directional and/or intensity changes for transitions at individual locations. Despite consider-able efforts expended in acquiring paleomagnetic reversal records, a detailed picture of the reversal process is still lacking, along with any means of clearly identifying when the magnetic field has entered a transitional state destined {{to lead to a}} reversal. Accurate dating remains critical to making inferences about timing and structure of reversals and excursions. Controversy remains about the significance of such features as the preferred <b>longitudinal</b> <b>paths</b> that virtual geomagnetic poles at some sites seem to follow during excursions and reversals. Reversal rates are estimated under the assumption that reversal occurrence times can be described as a Poisson process. Correlations are sought between reversal rates and other properties of the paleomagnetic secular variation, and more general models for reversals and secular variations are being developed to provide predictions of the power spectrum of geomagnetic intensity variations for comparison with those derived from long paleomagnetic records.

This four-wave, multi-informant study investigated linkages of siblings' externalizing problems and sibling-adolescent negative interactions on adolescents' externalizing problems, while examining and controlling for similar linkages with friends and parents. Methods Questionnaire data on externalizing problems and negative interactions were annually collected from 497 Dutch adolescents (M = 13. 03 years, SD = 0. 52, at baseline), as well as their siblings, mothers, fathers, and friends. Results Cross-lagged panel analyses revealed modest unique <b>longitudinal</b> <b>paths</b> from sibling externalizing problems to adolescent externalizing problems, for male and female adolescents, and for same-sex and mixed-sex sibling dyads, but only from older to younger siblings. Moreover, these paths were above and beyond significant paths from mother-adolescent negative interaction and friend externalizing problems to adolescent externalizing problems, 1 year later. No cross-lagged paths existed between sibling-adolescent negative interaction and adolescent externalizing problems. Conclusions Taken together, it appears that especially older sibling externalizing problems may be a unique social risk factor for adolescent externalizing problems, equal in strength to significant parents' and friends' risk factors. © 2013 The Authors.

In spite of this, their role {{has largely been}} neglected in research on residential care. The aim {{of the current study}} was twofold. First, longitudinal changes in group care worker interventions and child behaviors were investigated separately. Second, bidirectional influences between group care worker interventions and child behaviors were investigated. Group care workers completed the Group care worker Intervention Checklist and Child Behavior Checklist for 128 children (66 % boys, mean age 8. 63 years) {{at the beginning of the}} treatment and at two measurement intervals that followed (6 and 12 months, respectively). Most results contradicted the predictions. There was no change in controlling and warm and supportive interventions by group care workers. Autonomy granting interventions increased during treatment. Second, there were no changes in externalizing and internalizing behaviors of children over time. Third, cross-lagged analyses revealed that higher levels of controlling interventions increased externalizing problems of children. In the opposite direction, higher levels of children's externalizing problems were associated with an increase in controlling interventions of group care workers. In addition, higher levels of children's internalizing problems were associated with lower subsequent levels of autonomy granting interventions. These significant <b>longitudinal</b> <b>paths</b> were found only for the first phase of treatment. This study emphasizes the potential of the role of group care workers in residential youth care.

40|$|The first {{velocity}} {{measurements for}} Thwaites Glacier {{were made by}} R. J. Allen in 1977. He compared features of Thwaites Glacier and Iceberg Tongue on aerial photography from 1947 and 1967 with 1972 Landsat images, and measured average annual displacements of 3. 7 and 2. 3 km/a. Using his photogrammetric experience and taking into consideration the lack of definable features and the poor control in the area, he estimated an average velocity of 2. 0 to 2. 9 km/a to be more accurate. In 1985, Lindstrom and Tyler also made velocity estimates for Thwaites Glacier. Using Landsat imagery from 1972 and 1983, their estimates of the velocities of 33 points ranged from 2. 99 to 4. 02 km/a, {{with an average of}} 3. 6 km/a. The accuracy of their estimates is uncertain, however, because in the absence of fixed control points, they assumed that the velocities of icebergs in the fast ice were uniform. Using additional Landsat imagery in 1984 and 1990, accurate coregistration with the 1972 image was achieved based on fixed rock points. For the period 1972 to 1984, 25 points on the glacier surface ranged in average velocity from 2. 47 to 2. 76 km/a, with an overall average velocity of 2. 62 +/- 0. 02 km/a. For the period 1984 to 1990, 101 points ranged in velocity from 2. 54 to 3. 15 km/a, with an overall average of 2. 84 km/a.

For both overt and relational victimization the autoregressive model where only previous levels of each construct predicted future levels of the construct was the most parsimonious explanation.

Functions for lateral path tracking, ILS guidance, flare and runway alignment are based on classical PID structures. The free parameters in the controller functions are tuned using multi-objective optimization. Performance criteria are directly derived from the imposed design requirements and computed from linear or nonlinear analysis (e. g. eigenvalues, simulations). Robustness is addressed via a multi-model approach, via optimization criteria (e. g. gain/phase margins), and, as a new contribution, via statistical criteria computed from on-line Monte-Carlo analysis. The design process and selected architecture have been applied to a wide-body as well as a small passenger aircraft to demonstrate controller robustness and efficiency of the process.
