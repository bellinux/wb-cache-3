5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. <b>Later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> heard a baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|Robson's {{success with}} Ipswich had {{attracted}} the attention of many bigger clubs, and he had been linked with the Manchester United job when Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to Ron Atkinson instead.

His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|E
5|$|When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955, he {{authorized}} the decision upholding {{the conviction of}} leaders of the Communist Party USA (including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn) under the Smith Act. The ruling {{was based on the}} previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. <b>Later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of Communist Party activists as unconstitutional in the case of Yates v. United States. Another such case was Watkins v. United States.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} Reed's return from Baku, {{he began to}} {{experience}} dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> became delirious, doctors diagnosed typhus and {{sent him to the}} hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, {{at the head of the}} funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal William Lloyd (Bill) Hely, CB, CBE, AFC (24 August 1909– 20May 1970) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1930 before transferring to the RAAF as a cadet pilot. Hely came to public attention in 1936–37, first when he crashed on a survey flight in the Northern Territory, and <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> undertook two successful missions to locate missing aircraft in the same vicinity. His rescue efforts earned him the Air Force Cross. After occupying staff positions {{during the early years}} of World WarII, Hely was appointed Officer Commanding No.72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea in May 1944. Later that year he formed No.84 (Army Cooperation) Wing, commanding it during the Bougainville Campaign until the end of the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Darabont {{purchased}} the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development {{did not begin}} until five years <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to the Castle Rock Entertainment film studio, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many notable stars of {{the time for the}} lead roles including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.|$|E

5|$|Haig's {{solution}} to this diplomatic crisis was a compromise. Alderson {{was transferred to the}} nominal post of Inspector-General of Canadian Forces and the highly effective Sir Julian Byng replaced him in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, supported by Sir Arthur Currie, who had succeeded Alderson in command of the 1st Canadian Division. In exchange, Haig finally got rid of the Ross rifle, all Canadian troops being reissued Lee–Enfields in preparation for the upcoming Battle of the Somme. Alderson was not made aware of the purely nominal nature of his position until <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> requested a staff car and was informed that he was no longer entitled to one. In September 1916, Alderson became Inspector of Infantry in the British Army, a position he retained until 1920, when he retired from active service at the age of 61.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{was still}} {{in command of the}} Bellerophon three months <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was heavily engaged in the van of Howe's fleet at the Glorious First of June, when an equally sized French fleet was {{defeated}} 200 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean. At the start of 1795, Hope joined HMS Tremendous, but within two months was requested onboard HMS Venerable by Admiral Duncan. However, while visiting aboard a Russian ship in 1796, Hope suffered a serious accidental head injury that left him an invalid for two years, consequently missing Duncan's victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|In 1907–08, Celtic {{once again}} {{finished}} top, with Rangers in third, and knocked their rivals {{out of the}} Scottish Cup. The two teams also met in {{the final of the}} Glasgow Cup, with Celtic winning in the second replay. Speirs was limited to 13games, none of which Rangers lost, and he left after playing 62matches, from which he scored 29goals. During his final days with Rangers, he also won his only cap for Scotland, in a 2–1 win over Wales on 7 March 1908. Speirs won a representative cap 11days <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> played and scored for Glasgow during an inter-city fixture with Sheffield. The game finished 2–2.|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{came from}} a humble {{seafaring}} background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His Antarctic experiences began 10 years <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> joined Scott's Discovery Expedition as an Able Seaman. In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce {{to take charge of}} dogs and sledges on the Nimrod Expedition. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the Antarctic. In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the Antarctic, and of his exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease these girls, deep down he is nice to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and the girl reunite.|$|E

In 2008, Ryan's final year with the team, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL. The Ravens lost by a score of 23-14 in the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, during which the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL, concluded an hour <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> accepted the head coaching position with the New York Jets.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{was born}} on 6 June 1868, the third of six {{children}} and elder son of John Edward, a brewer and magistrate, and Hannah (née Cuming) Scott of Stoke Damerel, near Devonport.
