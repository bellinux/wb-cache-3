40|$|Summary In {{recent years}} {{electronics}} {{has had an}} impact on almost every aspect of lamps and lighting from escape <b>lighting</b> <b>to</b> son et lumi&egrave;re, from reduction of gear losses to reduction of flicker, from tunnel <b>lighting</b> <b>to</b> theatre <b>lighting,</b> from automobile <b>lighting</b> <b>to</b> automation of lamp making machinery. Electronics is helping safety with hazard warning lights, automatically compensated tunnel lighting and measuring equipment <b>to</b> correlate street <b>lighting</b> with road accidents. The use of electronic ignitors to start high intensity discharge lamps assists energy conservation and reduces the material content of the control gear while invertor operated fluorescent tubes for transport <b>lighting</b> has <b>to</b> meet stringent requirements on transients. ...|$|R
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker <b>lights)</b> <b>to</b> increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|R

5|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the speed of}} light is to measure the time needed for <b>light</b> <b>to</b> travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, {{the storm}} spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, {{moisture from the}} storm produced <b>light</b> <b>to</b> heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7inches (175mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. Subsequent to becoming extratropical, the remnants of Jeanne turned eastward, exited into the Atlantic Ocean, and merged with a cold front.|$|E

5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses scattered <b>light</b> <b>to</b> {{measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|As the {{precursor}} to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides. Four {{people died in}} various incidents related to the system: three in El Salvador and one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180residents.
