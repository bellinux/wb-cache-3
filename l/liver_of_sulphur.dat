Sulphur is an important macroelement in plant nutrition and it is part of important amino acids, vitamins and proteins. Sulphur content in crops predetermines the quantity and quality <b>of</b> harvested products. <b>Sulphur</b> in our latitudes entered in soil particularly due to atmospheric depositions. With desulphurization of power plants, there has been a significant decline in sulphur entering soil in recent decades, from an approximate figure of 120 kg <b>of</b> pure <b>sulphur</b> per hectare in 1990 to mere 6 8 kg <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> per hectare in 2013. Due to small intake <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil, plants that draw off large amounts <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and {{due to the fact that}} sulphur is swiftly washed off from the topsoil to deeper soil layers where it is inaccessible to the crops, there is often lack <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in the nourishment of crops being grown, which regards both sulphur demanding crops, such as oil crops, and crops such as cereals where lack <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> has not manifested itself as much so far. Soil contains sulphur in an inorganic and organic form. Inorganic sulphur in agricultural land is represented to a lesser extent than organic sulphur, but it is the main source <b>of</b> plant available <b>sulphur</b> and it is a highlydynamic soil component. In soil, it is usually contained in the form of sulphates. Intake of sulphates and their concentration in the soil solution impacts pH, amount of Fe and Al oxides and behaviour of soil colloids. We can influence the content <b>of</b> inorganic <b>sulphur</b> by supplying mineral fertilizers, but we cannot increase the overall long-term supply <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil in this way. Long-term and main supply <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil is represented by organic sulphur bound in sulphur amino acids, sulfolipids, sulphonic acids and sulphated polysaccharides.

This paper demonstrates, using the Pre-Carpathian region as an example, that karstification {{is one of}} the most important processes guiding the formation <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits. This is determined by a coincidence of some major prerequisites of these two processes. In the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions the Miocene aquifer system is well drained by erosion valleys; the giant network caves known here in gypsum formed under past artesian conditions. In the region <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits, associated with the same karstified gypsum strata, true artesian conditions still prevail.
