5|$|The colonial {{venture into}} modernity brought {{concepts}} of democracy, equality and individual rights. The {{rise of the}} concept of nationalism and introspection of discriminatory practices brought about social reform movements related to caste and gender relations. This first phase of feminism in India was initiated by men to uproot the social evils of sati (widow immolation), to allow widow remarriage, to forbid child marriage, and to reduce illiteracy, as well as to regulate the age of consent and to ensure property rights through <b>legal</b> <b>intervention.</b> In addition to this, some upper caste Hindu women rejected constraints they faced under Brahminical traditions. However, efforts for improving the status of women in Indian society were somewhat thwarted by the late nineteenth century, as nationalist movements emerged in India. These movements resisted 'colonial interventions in gender relations' particularly in the areas of family relations. In the mid to late nineteenth century, there was a national form of resistance to any colonial efforts made to 'modernise' the Hindu family. This included the Age of Consent controversy that erupted after the government tried to raise the age of marriage for women.|$|E

Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of breast cancer when he was fourteen years old, and his home life became strained during later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife.|$|E
2500|$|The PIT maneuver, or Pursuit Intervention Technique, is a pursuit tactic {{by which}} a {{pursuing}} car can force a fleeing car to abruptly turn sideways, causing the driver to lose control and stop. Other names include pit block, pit stop and blocking. It was developed and named by the Fairfax County Police Department of Virginia, United States.

[...] The technique {{is also known as}} tactical car intervention, tactical ramming, <b>legal</b> <b>intervention,</b> and fishtailing.

2500|$|It {{is argued}} by some hunt {{supporters}} that no law should curtail {{the right of}} a person to do as they wish, so long as it does not harm others.

In contrast, liberal philosopher, John Stuart Mill wrote, [...] "The reasons for <b>legal</b> <b>intervention</b> in favour of children apply not less strongly to the case of those unfortunate slaves and victims of the most brutal parts of mankind—the lower animals."

40|$|Women and {{children}} who are subjected to family violence are vulnerable to homelessness. The traditional focus of social policy responses has been on supporting them to leave situations of family violence, through funding a network of emergency and transitional accommodation. More recently, there is increased policy interest in identifying strategies to assist victims of family violence to remain safely in their homes, while the perpetrator of the violence is removed. DVIRC’s Discussion Paper presents suggestions as to how policy can be directed to removing violent men from the family home, evaluates the two main <b>legal</b> <b>interventions</b> that exist in Victoria to enable this to happen, and discusses obstacles typically faced by those who pursue these <b>legal</b> <b>interventions.</b> The paper also explores some of the strategies and initiatives that have emerged elsewhere {{to address the problems}} identified, and recommends ways of making positive change...|$|R

40|$|The immense body of {{contemporary}} work aimed at ‘promoting {{the rule of}} law’ is often accused of ‘neo-imperialism’. Yet, despite many points of contiguity {{between past and present}} <b>legal</b> <b>interventions,</b> the charge is overbroad and rarely illuminating. This article attempts to move beyond polemic to track concrete historical and structural forerunners of today's rule of law work. Focusing mainly (though not exclusively) on late imperial British endeavours, it traces colonial <b>legal</b> <b>interventions</b> over time, the techniques adopted (and rejected), the shifting normative bases of legitimacy, and moments of strategic recalibration in the face of resistance. Three broad attitudes towards law across the period are (provisionally) characterised as ‘regulative’, ‘constitutive’ and ‘institutive’ moments. In each phase, the Powers treat colonial territories as laboratories of statehood, within which experiments are conducted to locate the optimal configuration of law. In conclusion some counterparts to these moments in today's ‘rule of law’ activities are identified...|$|R

40|$|Feminist {{scholars}} have demonstrated how <b>legal</b> <b>interventions</b> {{in relation to}} domestic violence frequently impose further violence on women {{as a product of}} a narrow criminal law perspective. Linda Mills argues that <b>legal</b> <b>interventions</b> commonly reproduce the emotional abuse initially perpetrated by violent men. She argues that such interventions ignore the perspectives of the women the interventions are designed to protect and support. This paper draws on a study of court responses to breaches of domestic violence protection orders and explores the violence of state intervention in this context. The law may provide protection to women in the form of domestic violence protection orders and recognise the criminal nature of breaches of such orders. However the process involved in demonstrating a criminal breach often involves a ruthless contest about the facts and numerous court appearances before resolution. Further, breaches often result in no conviction being recorded or in trivialising fines. This paper explores how the understandings and concerns of women, that are generally ignored by the traditional criminal legal paradigm, may be privileged in order to develop non-violent state interventions in this context...|$|R

In particular, {{it focuses on}} meaningfully increasing supply and facilitating intensification and options in growing cities. It analyses the measures currently proposed by Central Government, including de-regulation and reforms to the Resource Management Act 1991 and assesses whether these measures can achieve density and options. It proposes measures such as {{making full use of}} the RMA’s effects-based model, releasing National Policy Statements and carefully drafting cohesive and strategic City Plans which focus on outcomes and quality. These measures should be supported by a range of incentives, disincentives, regulations and supplementary measures to ensure the implementation of transformative town plans.
