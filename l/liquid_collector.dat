40|$|Wet electrospinning is {{a useful}} method for 3 -dimensional {{structure}} control of nanofibrous materials. This innovative technology uses a <b>liquid</b> <b>collector</b> instead of the metal one commonly used for standard electrospinning. The article compares the internal structural features of polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous materials prepared by both technologies. We analyze the influence of different water/ethanol compositions used as a <b>liquid</b> <b>collector</b> on the morphology of the resultant polycaprolactone nanofibrous materials. Scanning electron micro-photographs have revealed a bimodal structure in the wet electrospun materials composed of micro and nanofibers uniformly distributed across the sample bulk. We {{have shown that the}} full-faced, twofold fiber distribution is due to the solvent composition and is induced and enhanced by increasing the ethanol weight ratio. Moreover, the comparison of fibrous layers morphology obtained by wet and dry spinning have revealed that beads that frequently appeared in dry spun materials are created by Plateau-Rayleigh instability of the fraction of thicker fibers.

In this work the interdependency between thermal and hydraulic behavior and the resulting primary energy demand will be explained. Moreover, suitable mass flow dependent models for thermal efficiency, pressure drop and leakage will be presented.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the liquid flow {{distribution}} is investigated at the outlet of a 30 -cm-diameter trickle bed {{by means of a}} <b>liquid</b> <b>collector</b> divided in nine compartments and inside the bed by local heat transfer probes. Coalescent and coalescence-inhibiting fluids are employed. In steady-state operation, the liquid flow maldistribution, quantified using the collector, attains a minimal value for a superficial liquid velocity of about 0. 006 m s- 1. At lower superficial liquid velocities, the important maldistribution is due to the stochastic nature of the trickling liquid flow, whereas at higher superficial liquid velocities, the increase of the maldistribution is due to the formation of a radial flow gradient, characteristic for the pulsing flow regime. Measurements of the local particle-liquid heat transfer coefficient indicate an important spread of the local particle irrigation, probably due to geometrical reasons. The influence of periodic operation of the liquid feed rate is tested. Under the investigated operating conditions, periodic operation is not found to improve significantly the liquid distribution at the two spatial scales investigated: the maldistribution quantified by the collector measurements and the spread of the local particle-liquid heat transfer coefficient are almost invariable...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a solar <b>liquid</b> <b>collector</b> {{can be improved}} by augmenting heat transfer from the tube to the working fluid. Various types of heat transfer techniques {{has been used in}} heat exchangers which are mainly classified in active and passive types of techniques. Solar liquid collectors can also be enhanced by these active and passive devices. The passive devices do not require any external source of power and they do not harm structure of the tube or weaken the strength of tube material. For the same reasons passive devices are most widely used heat transfer augmentation techniques. Initially twisted tape inserts and conical inserts were popular devices used in enhanced solar liquid collectors mainly because of availability of established correlations of design parameters. Wire coil inserts are relatively less used and less experimented passive technique. Presence of well established correlation of design parameters does not mean that twisted tapes are the best heat transfer augmentation device. These passive devices enhance the heat transfer, but due to increased friction, pumping power requirement of the heat exchanger is also increased. The present study is therefore focused on coiled wire inserts as heat transfer enhancement device in solar liquid collectors. The effect of dimensionless parameters such as pitch of coil to tube diameter and coil wire diameter to tube diameter on thermal {{efficiency of}} the solar collector was studied under changing flow rates in the study...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{allowable}} costs for a residential PV/T <b>liquid</b> <b>collector</b> system {{with those of}} both PV-only and side-by-side PV and thermal collector systems. Four types of conventional energy systems provide backup: all oil, all gas, all electric resistance, and electric resistance hot water with space heating by parallel heat pump. Electric space cooling is modeled, and the electric utility serves as backup for all electrical needs. The analysis is separated into two parts. The first is a base case study using conservative market and financial parameters for comparing PV/T economics in three northern locations: Boston, Madison, and Omaha. All parameter estimates are for a privately purch. -sed residence, newly constructed in 1986. Three measures are used for establishing allowable costs, including system breakeven capital cost, al. owable levelized annual costs, and an allowable combined collector cost when compared directly with a side-by-side collector system. In the second portion of this study we examine the sensitivity of PV/T economics to pertinent physical, market, and financial variables. Here also we estimate the difference in economic outlook for PV/T in retrofit applications. The results indicate that, for those northern locations modeled, the allowable cost for a combined collector system is roughly $ 10 -$ 30 /m 2 {{less than that of}} separate (side-by-side) collector systems, at total array areas between 40 - 80 m. Below this range, allowable costs diverge, benefiting optimally sized separate collector systems. All systems look best when operating against all-electric homes.

40|$|Efficient {{flotation}} with insoluble-in-water <b>liquid</b> <b>collectors</b> {{is governed}} by selective attachment and spreading phenomena at mineral surfaces. This paper investigates the spreading of mixtures of hydroxamic acids and alcohols, recently identified and developed as collectors for the selective flotation of phosphate minerals. The spreading of collector drops on surfaces of apatite and the gangue minerals (dolomite and quartz) immersed in water or surfactant solutions was measured using a high-speed video system and the dynamic contact angle was determined from the transient profiles of the collector drops. Surface and interfacial tensions were measured applying the Du Nouy ring method. The dynamic wetting behavior of collector drops was described using the molecular kinetic theory. This analysis indicates that hydroxamic acids increase {{the interaction between the}} alcohol solution and the apatite surface, producing a strong collector attachment. Further information regarding spreading characteristics was obtained from studies at a graphite surface used as a model surface to reveal the nature of the hydrophobic/hydrophobic interaction. The spreading resistance was increased by the hydroxamic acid adsorption resulting in a decrease in the rate of spreading. Both theoretical and experimental results show that at the air-water and alcohol-water interfaces hydroxamic acids exhibit unique interfacial characteristics which account for the selective flotation of apatite from quartz.
