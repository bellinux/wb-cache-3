5|$|Chris Metzen {{teamed with}} author Flint Dille and artist <b>Livio</b> Ramondelli {{to create the}} 12-part, {{bi-weekly}} digital comic series Transformers: Autocracy. Autocracy was published by IDW Publishing in 2012. The series focused on the days just before the Great War. It is set after Megatron Origin, and presents the Decepticons as an established force, sowing dissent across Cybertron primarily through terrorist actions. The series focuses on Orion Pax, an Autobot commander charged with rooting out these cells. Transformers: Autocracy was released as a collected Trade Paperback in July 2012 with a bonus forward authored by Metzen. Autocracy was followed by Transformers: Monstrosity in 2013 and Transformers: Primacy in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente <b>Livio</b> Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of its}} destruction.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Braschi {{from the}} Italian Football Federation, was {{appointed}} to officiate the final, making it his first time to decide a closing match in a European contest. He was regonised as a professional Serie A referee in 1992. The Italian took charge of his first European fixture in a 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup group stage meeting between Lierse and Groningen. The same year, Braschi made FIFA's international referees list; he debuted in February 1997 in a Israel–Germany friendly. Before the final, {{he had been the}} match official in four Champions League and two UEFA Cup matches (including one qualifier), as well as four international friendlies. Braschi was accompanied by an all-Italian team, which was made up of assistant referees Gennaro Mazzei and Pietro Contente – the reserve referee was unveiled as <b>Livio</b> Bazzoli.|$|E
5|$|No. 80 Squadron was re-equipped with newer model Hawker Hurricane Mk Is on 20 February 1941. That day, Pattle, flying Hurricane Mk I V7724, {{was leading}} {{a group of}} six Hurricanes escorting 16 Blenheim light bombers — eight from No. 84 Squadron RAF, six from No. 211 Squadron and three from No. 30 Squadron RAF—to Berat. Fiat G.50bis from the 361a and 395a Squadriglia, 154° Autonomo Gruppo were {{scrambled}} from Berat airfield, but they were attacked by the higher altitude Hurricanes. Pattle led his section straight towards four Fiat G.50s and selected the leading aircraft as his own target. It {{was the first time}} he had fired the eight guns of the Hurricane, and the G.50 exploded. The Fiat G.50 was from 154° Gruppo and it was the first Hurricane victory that Pattle would claim. Tenente <b>Livio</b> Bassi was killed in this battle. Another CR.42 fell to Pattle on 27 February 1941 — his 17th victory. His Hurricane sustained a bullet hole in the fuel tank.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1729, by the Italian Pier Antonio Micheli in his Nova plantarum genera iuxta Tournefortii methodum disposita, {{who gave it}} its current scientific name. The species was once referred to by American authors as Clathrus cancellatus L., as they used a system of nomenclature based on the former American Code of Botanical Nomenclature, in which {{the starting point for}} naming species was Linnaeus's 1753 Species Plantarum. The International Code for Botanical Nomenclature now uses the same starting date, but names of Gasteromycetes used by Christian Hendrik Persoon in his Synopsis Methodica Fungorum (1801) are sanctioned and automatically replace earlier names. Since Persoon used the specific epithet ruber, the correct name for the species is Clathrus ruber. Several historical names of the fungus are now synonyms: Clathrus flavescens, named by Persoon in 1801; Clathrus cancellatus by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and published by Elias Fries in 1823; Clathrus nicaeensis, published by Jean-Baptiste Barla in 1879; and Clathrus ruber var. flavescens, published by <b>Livio</b> Quadraccia and Dario Lunghini in 1990.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there has}} been some ongoing dispute on the {{experiment}} itself, as the fact that Fechner deliberately discarded results of the study ill-fitting to his needs became known, with many mathematicians including Mario <b>Livio</b> refuting the result of the experiment.|$|E

25|$|In 1659, the Italian Tito <b>Livio</b> Burattini built {{a machine}} with nine {{independent}} wheels, {{each one of}} these wheels was paired with a smaller carry wheel. At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.|$|E
25|$|In 1681, Pozzo {{was called}} to Rome by Giovanni Paolo Oliva, Superior General of the Jesuits. Among others, Pozzo worked for <b>Livio</b> Odescalchi, the {{powerful}} nephew of the pope, Innocent XI. Initially he {{was used as a}} stage designer for biblical pageants, but his illusionistic paintings in perspective for these stages gave him soon a reputation as a virtuoso in wall and ceiling decorations.|$|E
25|$|Maze {{started the}} 2014 season less successfully, with one victory and three more podiums before the Winter Olympics in February. The decline in results was {{partially}} {{attributed to the}} change of the coach from the previous season, when Walter Ronconi replaced <b>Livio</b> Magoni. In January 2014, Ronconi was replaced by Mauro Pini, who, according to Maze's team, brought a positive change to the team.|$|E
25|$|The {{compatibility}} {{problem is}} to take two or more polyominoes and find a figure that can be tiled with each. Polyomino compatibility has been widely studied since the 1990s. Jorge Luis Mireles and Giovanni Resta have published websites of systematic results,ominoes"] and <b>Livio</b> Zucca shows results for some complicated cases like three different pentominoes. The general problem can be hard. The first compatibility figure for the L and X pentominoes was published in 2005 and had 80 tiles of each kind. Many pairs of polyominoes have been proved incompatible by systematic exhaustion. No algorithm is known for deciding whether two arbitrary polyominoes are compatible.|$|E
25|$|The Gonzaga Cameo {{passed through}} a series of famous {{collections}} before coming to rest in the Hermitage. First known in the collection of Isabella d'Este, it passed to the Gonzaga Dukes of Mantua, Emperor Rudolf II, Queen Christina of Sweden, Cardinal Decio Azzolini, <b>Livio</b> Odescalchi, Duke of Bracciano, and Pope Pius VI before Napoleon carried it off to Paris, where his Empress Joséphine gave it to Alexander I of Russia after Napoleon's downfall, as a token of goodwill. It remains disputed whether the cameo is Alexandrian work of the 3rd century BC, or a Julio-Claudian imitation of the style from the 1st century AD.|$|E
25|$|De Divina Proportione, a three-volume work by Luca Pacioli, was {{published}} in 1509. Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, was known mostly as a mathematician, {{but he was also}} trained and keenly interested in art. De Divina Proportione explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, <b>Livio</b> points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the Vitruvian system of rational proportions. Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. De Divina Proportione contains illustrations of regular solids by Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.|$|E
500|$|In many Einstein biographies, it {{is claimed}} that Einstein {{referred}} to the cosmological constant in later years as his [...] "biggest blunder". The astrophysicist Mario <b>Livio</b> has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting {{that it may be}} exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|The {{maximum energy}} of a {{particle}} recorded by Agassiz experiment, 1019electron volts, is close to energies beyond which charged particles can not be confined to the galactic disc by typical interstellar magnetic fields of10−5gauss. [...] A detector array of very large dimensions is needed to detect showers of these energies. John Linsley agreed to take on responsibility for building such an array. He came to MIT in 1954 from the University of Minnesota, where he completed a PhD under Edward P. Ney. [...] Soon, he was joined by <b>Livio</b> Scarsi, whom Rossi had recruited from Occhialini's group at the University of Milan.|$|E
500|$|Pope Innocent XI (1676–1689) despised the {{practice}} and only accepted his election as Pope after the College of Cardinals consented to his plans for reform, which included a ban on nepotism. However, Innocent XI backed down after thrice failing to achieve {{the support of the}} majority of his cardinals for a bull banning nepotism, which had been tediously composed between 1677 and 1686. Innocent XI refused entreaties from within the papal court to bring his only nephew, <b>Livio</b> Odescalchi, the prince of Sirmio, to Rome, although he did elevate Carlo Stefano Anastasio Ciceri, a distant relative, cardinal on September 2, 1686. Innocent XI's successor, Pope Alexander VIII (1689–1691), was the last Pope to create a Cardinal Nephew. Alexander VIII also undid another reform of Innocent XI by restoring the revenues of the former Chancery to the Vice-Chancellor, who was, at the time, his cardinal-nephew, Pietro Ottoboni. Edith Standen, a consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, calls Ottoboni the [...] "last and certainly not least magnificent example" [...] of the [...] "splendor of an extinct species, the Cardinal-Nephew".|$|E

2500|$|On {{hearing of}} the project in October 1991, the Argentine {{locomotive}} engineer <b>Livio</b> Dante Porta contacted the trust, hailing the project as {{the start of a}} [...] "renaissance of steam technology".

In it, he proposed to the trust several design improvements that could be made to Tornado that, while preserving the outer form, would make Tornado a second-generation steam locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{club was}} {{promptly}} re-established in August 2002 as Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner {{and the club}} was admitted into Serie C2, the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was Angelo Di <b>Livio,</b> whose commitment to the club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di <b>Livio</b> and 30-goal striker Christian Riganò, the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally {{have led to a}} promotion to Serie C1. Due to the bizarre Caso Catania (Catania Case), however, the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B, something that was only made possible by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC)'s decision to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for [...] "sports merits." [...] In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina. The club finished the 2003–04 season in sixth place and won the playoff against Perugia to return to top-flight football.|$|E

This vastly improved {{the economy of}} this modern steam engine and more than doubled train length. Accordingly, a second Garratt for this railway was built to similar specifications, but with superheating added, in the workshops of Girdlestone Rail in Port Shepstone, South Africa. It was shipped to Argentina in 2006 and entered service in October of that year.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 December 1935 Minniti {{was flying}} a {{reconnaissance}} mission with an observer, Sergeant <b>Livio</b> Zannoni. He {{was forced to}} land behind enemy lines, probably due to engine trouble. Minnitti and Zannoni survived apparently uninjured, but were soon challenged by Ethiopians. What happened next is disputed. Both men were killed, but according to Rainer Baudendistel, [...] "it was never established whether they died defending themselves or were killed after surrender". The only officially recorded testimony of the event, given by an Egyptian paramedic, asserted with details that Minniti was tortured and murdered by Ethiopian troops.|$|E
2500|$|In 1671 Jean Picard {{proposed}} a pendulum defined 'universal foot' in his influential Mesure de la Terre. [...] Gabriel Mouton around 1670 suggested defining the toise either by a seconds pendulum or {{a minute of}} terrestrial degree. A plan for a complete system of units based on the pendulum was advanced in 1675 by Italian polymath Tito <b>Livio</b> Burratini. In France in 1747, geographer Charles Marie de la Condamine proposed defining length by a seconds pendulum at the equator; since at this location a pendulum's swing wouldn't be distorted by the Earth's rotation. James Steuart (1780) and George Skene Keith were also supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Steven Weinberg {{believes}} the Anthropic Principle may be appropriated by cosmologists committed to nontheism, and refers to that Principle as a [...] "turning point" [...] in modern science because applying {{it to the}} string landscape [...] " [...] may explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator". Others—most notably David Gross but also Lubos Motl, Peter Woit, and Lee Smolin—argue {{that this is not}} predictive. Max Tegmark, Mario <b>Livio,</b> and Martin Rees argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.|$|E
