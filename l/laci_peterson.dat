50|$|<b>Laci</b> Denise <b>Peterson</b> (née Rocha; May 4, 1975 December 24, 2002) was an American {{woman who}} {{was the subject of}} a highly publicized murder case after she went missing while eight months {{pregnant}} with her first child. She was reportedly last seen alive on December 24, 2002. Her husband, Scott Peterson, was later convicted of murder in the first degree for her death, and in the second degree for the death of their prenatal son, Conner. Scott is on death row at San Quentin State Prison.|$|R
25|$|The {{disappearance}} of Figueroa sparked controversy about media coverage because cable news channels, such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel, neglected {{to cover her}} story in favor of Natalee Holloway, a Caucasian teen missing {{on the island of}} Aruba. Some observers protested that Figueroa's case was similar to the <b>Laci</b> <b>Peterson</b> case (which also covered the same timespan) and thus deserved greater attention, implying that race was a factor in the lack of coverage.|$|E
500|$|In April 2003, {{the body}} of <b>Laci</b> <b>Peterson</b> washed up on a shore near San Francisco Bay; she had been {{pregnant}} when she disappeared four months earlier, and the fetus she had been carrying was discovered on a separate beach. When questioned by the media, medical authorities initially speculated that a [...] "coffin birth" [...] might have occurred. However, at autopsy the cervix {{was found to be}} in a prepartum condition. Medical examiners later concluded that while Peterson's body was in the bay, the skin over the abdominal cavity had ruptured due to natural decompositional processes. Seawater entered the abdominal cavity and washed out most of the internal organs, along with the fetus.|$|E
500|$|Levy's {{death has}} had a lasting impact, {{due in part to}} the efforts of her family and friends. Levy's {{disappearance}} came after a number of other high-profile cases that led to the creation of resources for missing young adults. For example, Levy's parents quickly turned for help to the Carole Sund/Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation, a nonprofit group that was established in Modesto after three female hikers disappeared from a 1999 trip to Yosemite National Park and were later found slain. That foundation, which offered the Levys staff support and contributed towards a cash reward for information about Chandra's disappearance, was merged into the Laci & Conner Search and Rescue Fund in 2009; Susan Levy had previously participated in the efforts to find <b>Laci</b> <b>Peterson,</b> another missing woman from Modesto. In 1997, when Kristen Modafferi mysteriously disappeared from the San Francisco Bay Area just three weeks after her 18th birthday, her parents turned to their congresswoman for help they were ineligible to receive from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. As a result, Congress enacted [...] "Kristen's Law" [...] in October 2000, which established the National Center for Missing Adults (NCMA) within the U.S. Department of Justice to coordinate such missing person cases. By the time Levy disappeared, institutions were in place to provide her family with support and to assist in a nationwide search to locate her. Although the Levy family moved quickly to mobilize all such available resources, including offering a cash reward for information, hiring their own investigators, and seeking media attention, those efforts to locate Chandra Levy or find her killer were overshadowed by the speculation surrounding her possible relationship with Condit. Susan Levy later joined with Donna Raley, the mother of another young woman who disappeared in 1999 from Modesto, to form [...] "Wings of Protection", a support group for people with missing loved ones. The Mary Ann Liebert company, publishers of the Journal of Women's Health and Gender-Based Medicine, presented their annual Criterion Award in May 2002 to Susan Levy for her work with [...] "Wings of Protection".|$|E
2500|$|The {{disappearance}} of Figueroa has spawned controversy about {{media coverage of}} missing people and how cases get national attention, with the terms [...] "Missing White Women Syndrome." [...] PBS journalist Gwen Ifill referred to the phenomenon as [...] "The Missing White Woman Syndrome" [...] at the Unity Convention of Journalists in 2004 [...] This phrase was invoked by Professor of American Studies Sheri L. Parks) [...] on March 13, 2006 during an interview with American news reporter, Anderson Cooper to describe a phenomenon characterized by critics as a short and cynical equation: Pretty, white damsels in distress draw viewers; missing women who are black, Latino, Asian, old, fat, or ugly do not. Critics accused major news outlets of ignoring Figueroa's disappearance to focus on cases involving young, usually attractive, white women like <b>Laci</b> <b>Peterson</b> who was also pregnant when she was reported missing.|$|E
