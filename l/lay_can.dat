This belief is based on the observation that the bees tend to be less prone to move up the hive into the supers when a queen excluder is used, preferring to fill cells in the brood box with nectar and honey first. This behaviour constrains the size of the brood nest which the queen can lay eggs in, which has two effects on the colony: the buildup rate of workers is constrained and a dearth of space for the queen to <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> lead to swarm preparations.|$|E
30|$|The term ‘tramp {{shipping}} optimisation’ {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo time window (<b>lay</b> <b>can).</b> Name this problem area ‘optimisation of ship voyage’. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‘optimisation in liner shipping’, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. Charter party, signed by the ship owner and the charterer, usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both parties. Non-demise voyage charter parties are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo time window (<b>lay</b> <b>can),</b> allowable cargo handling time (lay days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If reversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms of voyage charter party are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo <b>lay</b> <b>can,</b> and other voyage charter party terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|E

40|$|Feather pecking {{in layers}} is a multi {{factorial}} problem, {{which can be}} caused by environmental, genetic or nutritional factors. From the literature {{it has been shown that}} nutritional factors may positively or negatively affect feather pecking behaviour in laying hens. Nutritional factors seem to reduce feather pecking behaviour in laying hens if these factors increase the time spent on feeding behaviour, by affecting foraging and feed intake. Laying hens may spend more time on these feeding behaviours when they are fed 1) mash diets in stead of crumbles or pellets, 2) low energy diets, 3) high (in-) soluble fibre diets or 4) roughages. However, such feeding strategies may not reduce egg performance of the hens, which can be the case when hens are not able to fully compensate for the dilution. Especially hens at early <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> have problems with consuming sufficient feed for maintenance and egg production.

30|$|In {{this case}} study, speed {{sensitivity}} analysis {{concludes that the}} higher speed is tried on all legs the more gross profit per day or gross profit is achieved. Higher speed enabled each ship to meet <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> dates of more profitable cargoes. One can expect better results if higher speed is tried only on legs leading to these cargoes. Sensitivity analysis may also be tried for cargo freight and quantity, and cargo handling rate and charges. Take for now handling rate as an example. There is a chance that handling rate in Maracaibo be decreased to 17, 000 mt/day due to pumps repeated malfunction. There is also another chance {{that by the time}} Sidi Kirear reaches Maracaibo in early December to take ‘Crude Oil 5 ’ and ‘Crude Oil 7 ’, handling rate could possibly reach 57, 000 mt per day. This may be caused by the installation of high-speed pumps. Applying handling sensitivity to the model at low-speed results the same quantities as what were reported earlier, for the two handling rates available for Sidi Kirear while loading ‘Crude Oil 5 ’ and ‘Crude Oil 7 ’. The only difference between the two rates is that total gross profit per day decreases to $ 51, 521 for 17, 000 mt/day and increases to $ 52, 339 for 57, 000 mt/day handling rate.|$|E
30|$|Fagerholt (2001) has {{developed}} an optimisation model for tramp shipping, where cargo time window (<b>lay</b> <b>can)</b> may be violated {{to a certain extent}} with a penalty cost in return. That is why cargo time window was given the name soft time window, and penalty cost was given the name inconvenience cost. The model designs a predetermined set of schedules for each ship to follow. In each schedule, there is a predetermined route with cargo pick-up and delivery nodes along with soft time window for each node and a predetermined ship speed on each sailing leg. The model objective is to find the schedule for each ship which minimises total operating and penalty cost. The review of this model is reported in the follows items. The first is that the number of schedules of each ship is too small to represent all candidate schedules. The second is that even if the number of schedules is large enough, the way the schedule is designed does not generate a right mix between low and high-cost schedules. The right mix has to be the one that leads to a globally optimal solution. The third is that the model does not use gross profit or gross profit per day as a criterion for selecting optimal schedules, which limits the use of the model to only the industrial mode of transport. The fourth is that transport demand is assumed fixed.|$|E

The aim of this PhD study was to investigate animal welfare in organic egg production in Denmark, with emphasis on mortality and helminth infections. The specific hypothesis in the PhD study were i) helminth infections (Ascaridia galli and Heterakis sp.) increase the mortality rate at peak of lay (observational event study, Paper I), ii) helminth infections (Ascaridia galli and Heterakis sp.) diagnosed at end of <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> be predicted by at least one clinical welfare indicator diagnosed at peak of lay and end of lay (longitudinal study, Paper II).

The applicant is seeking the further authorisation of Bonvital for use in {{chickens reared for laying}} and minor avian species. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. The safety of Bonvital in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, safety for this animal category can be presumed. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species, this conclusion can be extrapolated to minor avian species to point of lay. The strain is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. Bonvital is not irritant to skin and eyes. In the absence of data, it should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of Bonvital under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. The efficacy in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, the conclusion on the major species can be extended to this category.

40|$|ABSTRACT Key words: broiler breeder, feeding strategies, body composition, reproduction, {{behavior}} Nowadays, welfare {{issues in}} broiler breeders associated with nutrition and reproductive characteristics, {{are becoming increasingly}} challenging. Due to genetic selection on broilers, body composition of breeders has changed dramatically during the last 50 years to less fat and more breast muscle. It is postulated that {{a certain amount of}} body fat in broiler breeders at the onset of lay is necessary for maximum performance and offspring quality. Body composition of breeders can be influenced by different feed allowances during rearing and lay, as well as by changes in nutrient composition of the diet. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of body composition on reproduction of broiler breeders. In this thesis, we investigated the effects of different feeding strategies during the rearing period on body composition at the end of rearing. Moreover, the effects of differences in body composition at the end of rearing, and feeding strategies during lay were evaluated on breeder performance, incubation traits, offspring performance, behavior and feather cover. From this study, it can be concluded that feeding a low protein diet during rearing decreased breast muscle and increased abdominal fat pad, whereas providing an increased feeding schedule, which resulted in a high growth pattern, only increased abdominal fat pad, at the end of rearing. The higher abdominal fat pad content resulted in an increased hatchability during the first phase of lay and a larger number of eggs during the second phase of lay. For maintaining growth pattern, broiler breeders had to provide a higher amount of feed with an increased energy to protein ratio compared to broiler breeders that were fed a diet with a standard energy to protein ratio. This resulted in an increased eating time and less stereotypic object pecking, which may indicate a reduced hunger and frustration. On the other hand, a low daily protein intake during the rearing and first phase of <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> lead to a poor feather cover. Feeding a high-energy diet during the second phase of lay resulted in increased hatchability, decreased embryonic mortality and more first grade chicks.  ...|$|E

30|$|It {{was found}} that the OR model of Osman et al. (1993) and Christiansen et al. (2007) holds {{characteristics}} close to the tramp shipping characteristics mentioned {{at the beginning of this}} section. The model of either research paper is based on a network of multiple cargo flows. Each network node either represents a load or a discharge event for each cargo. Ships compete in carrying cargoes by following selected arcs in the network, beginning with a start node and ending with an end node. If a network arc is used by a ship, this arc is restricted for use by other ships. An arc is used by a ship if <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> of each arc node can be met and load available in each arc node is within remaining ship capacity. The model assigns network arcs to ships in an attempt to maximise total voyage gross profit for all ships. Both models are nonlinear. Hemmati et al. (2014) and Christiansen and Fagerholt (2014) have presented better tramp shipping characteristics. The former have used a linear objective but used heuristic algorithms to solve their problem. The latter have presented some linear and non-linear models; some handle flexible cargo sizes of what is called ‘more or less owner’s option’, some handle splitting of cargo loads, and some others handle varying ship speed. Most of these models use heuristic algorithms to solve the problem of concern. Flexible cargo sizes, splitting of loads, and different ship speed, although they have been formulated within the models; they could have been handled via sensitivity and what-if analysis after solution. This might help other important shipping elements to be formulated as well. Sensitivity and what-if analysis are necessary validation tools in tramp shipping to handle possible changes in cargo quantity and freight rate, cargo handling rate and charges, and ship speed and fuel consumption. Instead of ship full loads assumed in Brown et al. (1987) and Laake and Zhang (2013), Vilhelmsen et al. (2015) have developed a linear model to handle the case where multiple cargoes can be carried simultaneously on board each ship. The review of the previous models is reported in the follows items. The first is that the model objective maximises voyage gross profit, while in tramp shipping the objective has to maximise gross profit per day. The second is that transport demand is assumed deterministic. In shipping, some cargoes may have random demand. The third is that the model with non-linear objective or/and constraints call for software solutions usually less reliable and inefficient. The fourth is that the authors brought no evidence on the possibility of solving large problems when more cargoes and ships are added.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of different dietary protein levels during rearing and different dietary energy levels during lay on behaviour and feather cover in broiler breeder females. A 2 × 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used. A total of 2880 Ross 308 14 -day-old broiler breeder pullets were fed between weeks 2 and 22, a high (CPh) or low (CPl) crude protein (CP) diet. Between weeks 22 and 45, the breeders were fed either a high, standard, or low energy diet (3000, MEh 1; 2800, MEs 1; 2600, MEl 1, kcal/kg AME n (apparent metabolisable energy, corrected for nitrogen), respectively). Between weeks 45 and 60, the breeders were fed a standard or high energy diet (2800, MEs 2; 3000, MEh 2, kcal/kg AME n, respectively). During rearing, CPl pullets received 12. 1 % more feed, resulting in a 137 % increased eating time and 47 % decreased eating rate. This increased feeding, sitting, and comfort behaviour while standing, walking, foraging, stereotypic object pecking, and bird pecking were reduced. Feather cover was poorer when pullets were fed a low protein diet during rearing, but this effect was not present during lay. A 7. 6 % lower feed intake for the MEh 1 birds resulted in a 21 % decreased eating time and 19 % increased eating rate compared with the MEs 1 birds. Birds on the MEh 1 diet spent less time feeding and more time sitting, comfort, and stereotypic object pecking behaviour compared with the MEs 1 birds. Birds fed the MEh 1 diet showed a poorer feather cover during the entire lay compared with the MEs 1 birds. A 7. 7 % higher feed intake for the MEl 1 birds resulted in a 31 % increased eating time and 18 % decreased eating rate compared with the MEs 1 birds. MEl 1 birds spent more time feeding and less time foraging, comfort, and stereotypic object pecking compared with the MEs 1 birds. No effect on feather cover was found for the MEl 1 compared with the MEs 1 birds. The MEh 2 birds received 8. 8 % less feed resulted in a 16 % decreased eating time and 9 % increased eating rate. The lower feed intake resulted in less time spent feeding and standing, and more time spent foraging and comfort behaviours. Feather cover was not affected by dietary energy level during the second phase of lay. In conclusion, feeding broiler breeders a higher amount of feed due to a higher energy-to-protein ratio resulted in an increased eating time and less stereotypic object pecking behaviour what is an indication of reduced hunger and frustration. This was much more expressed during rearing than lay. However, a low daily protein intake during rearing and first phase of <b>lay</b> <b>can</b> lead to a poorer feather cover. </p...|$|E
