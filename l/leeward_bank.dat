50|$|The Orsova {{departed}} on its {{maiden voyage}} from Tilbury 17 March 1954, with Sydney as its main destination. The following month, on its return voyage from Sydney to Tilbury, it became stuck against {{the bank in}} the Suez Canal. This was attributed to {{the combination of a}} strong crosswind and a pilot unfamiliar with the vessel. Sixty or so local males were recruited on the windward bank of the canal to pull the ship off the <b>leeward</b> <b>bank,</b> using one of the ship's mooring lines, so that it could once again make way. This operation took several hours. Meanwhile, a group of passengers who had disembarked at Port Suez to take a bus tour, and who {{were on their way to}} Port Said to rejoin the ship, were left stranded when it was decided, in order to stay on schedule, not to dock at Port Said.They were subsequently flown to Naples, Orsova's next port of call.|$|E
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Gauteng, Mpumalanga, N. E. Free State, Vaal dam, Hartebeespoort dam and Roodeplaat dam, {{now also}} Western and Eastern Cape Provinces. Botanical description: General: • These fresh water, blue-green algae that grow {{naturally}} in many surface waters, are phototrophic cyanobacteria which differ from {{other groups of}} algae in that they possess no nuclear membrane. • Under certain conditions (such as when the water is warm with abundant nutrients), Microcystis aeruginosa can grow more rapidly than normal. The result can be large colonies that form floating masses on the water. These occurrences are called "algal blooms". • On calm, hot, fine days the algae rise {{to the surface of}} the water and looks like green pea soup that is blown by the wind against the <b>leeward</b> <b>banks</b> of dams, etc. • Here the accumulated mass of algae may die to release a blue to purple chromoprotein, phycocyanin, and an offensive smell hangs in the air. • Since the cells are very small, they can be ingested along with the water. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Hepatotoxic principle is not phycocyanin, but heptapeptides, e. g. microcystin LR, and phylloerythrin is the photodynamic agent. • The microcystin toxins are produced and contained inside the Microcystis cells,and are released in the water when the cells die and disintegrate. • Since the cells are very small, they can be ingested along with the water and disintegrate and are released in rumen/stomach. • Toxin levels in a water body tend to be higher near shorelines and at the surface of the water where animal and human contact is most likely. SYNDROMES: Hepatogenous photosensitivity primarily due to liver parenchymal damage. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Liver. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Ruminants are most commonly affected, and signs of photosensitivity are also seen. • Horses, dogs, turkeys, ducks can also be affected - severe liver damage, but no photosensitivity. Signs: • Acute deaths - Massive liver failure. - Pooling of blood in the liver. • Subacute toxicicity - Liver damage and secondary photosensitivity - Anorexia, - Rumen stasis, - ConstipationNECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: Acute: • Liver swollen, greyish-yellow (hepatic necrosis and haemorrhage) Subacute: • Kidneys swollen• Icterus, signs of photosensitivity• Caecum and colon impacted. DIAGNOSIS: • History, clinical signs, necropsy findings • Mouse bioassay• HPLC analysis. Colour photos. Final web-ready size: JPEG.

40|$|To {{make clear}} {{the effects of}} {{topographic}} features of flatland on nocturnal cooling process, micro-meteorological observations were {{carried out in the}} fields near Koga town {{in the northern part of}} Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The observation area was in a place crossed by the large bank of the Kyushu Express-way and divided into two parts :the upward side and downward side of air flow from the mountainside. Horizontal and vertical distribution of minimum air temperature, wind speed and net radiation at several points in the field were measured during the winter of 1978 - 1979. Increases in negative net radiation aceelerated cooling of the air layer, and decreases in wind speed made air temperature lower. When the wind speed was weak, the lowest value of minimum air temperature appeared on the upward part of the bank of the Express-way facing to the mountainside, because of the accumulation of cold air from the mountain. While the wind speed became rather strong, the lowest value appeared on the reverse side-downward of the bank. This phenomenon was caused by the lowering of wind speed in the <b>leeward</b> of the <b>bank,</b> where convection of sensible heat from the upper warm air layer to the ground surface was much interfered. The surface temperature of plants becomes cool when the air layer becomes cool in consequence of advection of cold air, that is, the plants is affected by cold air...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{work on the}} Great Bahama <b>Bank's</b> western, <b>leeward</b> margin has centred chiefly on seismic-scale {{expressions}} of carbonate sequences and systems tracts. However, periplatform, slope sediments also exhibit very well developed cyclicity on scales of decimetres to several metres. It is these small-scale, high-frequency cycles within the larger-scale facies successions of the Quaternary which form the main topic of this paper. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the small-scale cycles correlate to the orbitally forced, high-frequency sea-level changes. Therefore these cycles should indicate how sea level has affected the slope development and thus platform-margin evolution during this period. Through detailed, high-resolution sequence stratigraphy of the Great Bahama <b>Bank's</b> <b>leeward</b> margin, obtained via delta 18 O isotope and mineralogical (XRD) analyses, confined by U/Th dating and nannofossil bioevents, a greater understanding of the bedding geometries within the Pleistocene-Holocene seismic sequences and clues as to the nature of the slope development has been achieved. The high-resolution seismic profiles indicate that since the Plio-Pleistocene change in geometry, in which the Great Bahama Bank developed into a rimmed platform, continued steepening and subsequent progradation of the leeward margin has typified slope development during the Quaternary, which is described as an accretionary slope. However, on the basis of our observations we conclude that only the early to lower middle Pleistocene section (isotope stages 45 - 20) and the Holocene (isotope stage 1) of the leeward margin is accretionary. This indicates that a degree of erosion and/or by-passing has occurred on the leeward margin since the lower middle Pleistocene (isotope stage 19). During the first part of this period (isotope stages 19 - 12) erosion and/or by-passing occurred in the middle to lower slope regions and toe-of-slope. By the end of the upper middle to late Pleistocene phase (isotope stages 11 - 2) erosion also occurred on the upper slope. This erosion by currents at the toe-of-slope and oversteepening of the upper and middle slopes have led to back-cutting upslope and resulted in the progressive retreat of the toe-of-slope towards the platform to the east. However, the rise in sea level since the Last Glacial Maximum to its present-day level has allowed high productivity on the platform top during the Holocene and the deposition of a thick sediment wedge on the slope and sedimentation across the entire leeward flanks. This has led to the redevelopment of an accretionary slope and continued westward progradation of the Great Bahama <b>Bank's</b> western, <b>leeward</b> margin...|$|R
