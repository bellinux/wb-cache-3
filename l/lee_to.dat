5|$|The Union army reached Antietam Creek, to {{the east}} of Sharpsburg, on the evening of September 15. A planned attack on September 16 was put off because of early morning fog, {{allowing}} <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> prepare his defenses with an army less than half the size of McClellan's.|$|E
5|$|General Pickett had {{received}} orders from Robert E. <b>Lee</b> <b>to,</b> with the Cavalry divisions of Major Generals William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and Thomas L. Rosser, hold the vital railroad crossing at Five Forks at all costs. On April 1, at the Battle of Five Forks, their troops {{were attacked by}} a combined force under Major General Philip Henry Sheridan, which consisted of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, and the Cavalry Corps of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt. Pickett, W.H.L. Lee, and Rosser were located behind the lines of their troops {{at the time of}} the attack, enjoying a shad bake while failing to inform their subordinate officers of their location. Meanwhile, Warren's troops overwhelmed their left flank, and the Cavalry troops pinned the Confederates down elsewhere. By the time the Confederate commanders realized the catastrophe, it was too late to prevent the defeat. The result of the battle, as well as that of the Third Battle of Petersburg the following day, forced <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> abandon his entrenchments at Petersburg, leading to the capture of Richmond and surrender of his army on April 9.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis {{considered}} replacing John Bell Hood {{in command of the}} Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> find out if Beauregard would be interested. Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of Hood and Richard Taylor under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.|$|E

5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E
5|$|Gewirtz {{spent five}} years {{developing}} the film's premise before working on what became his first original screenplay. After he completed the script in 2002, Imagine Entertainment purchased it {{to be made by}} Universal Studios, with Imagine co-founder Ron Howard attached to direct. After Howard stepped down, his Imagine partner Brian Grazer began looking for a new director to helm the project, and ultimately hired <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> do so. Principal photography began in June 2005 and concluded in August of that year; filming took place on location in New York City. Inside Man premiered in New York on March 20, 2006 before being released in North America on March 24, 2006. Upon release, the film received a generally positive critical response and was a commercial success, grossing over $184 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> {{do the same in}} Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E

However <b>Lee</b> did go <b>to</b> court, where he was slandered by the archbishop of Cashel, Miler Magrath, with the [...] "most indecent and contumelious words" [...] and accused of treason; <b>Lee</b> wrote <b>to</b> Cecil seeking an opportunity to meet the charges.|$|R

5|$|James A. Seddon {{resigned}} {{his position}} as the Confederate Secretary of War on January 19, 1865. On February 6, Davis appointed Breckinridge to the vacant position, partially to quiet growing opposition to his administration. Initially opposed by {{several members of the}} Confederate Congress because he had waited to join the Confederacy, he eventually gained their support by administrating his office more efficiently than his predecessors. With their support, he was able to expand the post's influence to include making officer assignments and promotion recommendations and advising field generals regarding strategy. His first act as secretary was to promote Robert E. <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> general-in-chief of all Confederate forces. After Lee reported a critical shortage of food, clothing, and supplies among his troops, Breckinridge recommended the removal of Lucius B. Northrop, the Confederate commissary general. Northrop's successor, Isaac M. St. John, improved the flow of supplies to troops in the field.|$|E
5|$|Lee was {{met with}} resistance, because the audio {{industry}} at the time didn't believe cables made an audible difference in the sound and wire {{was something that was}} normally provided for free. Lee did demonstrations at retailers comparing Monster cables to zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was wasted on cheap wiring. Sales picked up as retailers saw the wiring as an opportunity for higher profit margins. This led <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> provide incentives to retail salespeople to sell the cabling, rather than spend money on advertising. This led to criticisms that his business model creates aggressive salespeople.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{plan for}} July 2 called for Longstreet {{to attack the}} Union's left flank, which would be {{followed}} up by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet {{was not ready to}} attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> wait for Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and some distance from the attack positions they would need to reach. All of Longstreet's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Jefferson Parish's {{longtime}} sheriff, Harry <b>Lee,</b> asked Seagal <b>to</b> train {{some of his}} deputies in the martial arts. The success of these classes led <b>to</b> <b>Lee</b> asking Seagal <b>to</b> join the department as a reserve deputy.|$|R

5|$|McClellan {{was removed}} {{after failing to}} pursue General Robert E. Lee's retreat from Antietam, and Burnside was {{assigned}} to command the Army of the Potomac on November 7, 1862. He reluctantly obeyed this order, the third such in his brief career, {{in part because the}} courier told him that, if he refused it, the command would go instead to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked. President Abraham Lincoln pressured Burnside to take aggressive action and approved his plan on November 14 to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. This plan led to a humiliating and costly Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13. His advance upon Fredericksburg was rapid, but the attack was delayed by his planning in marshaling pontoon bridges for crossing the Rappahannock River, as well as his own reluctance to deploy portions of his army across fording points. This allowed Gen. <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> concentrate along Marye's Heights just west of town and easily repulse the Union attacks.|$|E
5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and {{get caught in the}} same accident that creates the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the role}} of Scaramanga was offered to Jack Palance, but he turned the {{opportunity}} down.

Due to filming on location in Bangkok, his role in the film affected Lee's work the following year, as director Ken Russell was unable to sign <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> play Specialist in the 1975 film Tommy, a part eventually given to Jack Nicholson.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} notable for {{borrowing}} extensively from East Asian art and mythology for its universe, and employed cultural consultants Edwin Zane and calligrapher Siu-Leung <b>Lee</b> <b>to</b> help determine its art direction and settings. Its character designs {{are influenced by}} Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, and Yoga. The series' music and sound were composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who experimented {{with a wide range}} of different instruments, including the guzheng, pipa, and duduk, to create music and sounds that matched the Asiatic-influenced setting of the show. The art style of the various fictitious locations visited throughout the series are based on real locations in Asia. Notably, sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se in the show.|$|E
