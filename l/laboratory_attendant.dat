The animal exhibits all signs of intense suffering; in his struggles, he again and again lifts his body from the board, and makes powerful attempts to get free.|$|E
6000|$|Hill {{experienced}} a sudden loss of complacency at this question, {{but even as}} it was asked, relief came {{in the person of}} Brooks, the <b>laboratory</b> <b>attendant,</b> who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number of freshly killed guinea-pigs by their hind legs. [...] "This is the last batch of material this session," [...] said the youngster who had not previously spoken. Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a couple of guinea-pigs at each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out. Hill was already standing by his table, and his box of scalpels was sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him, and, leaning over his table, said softly, [...] "Did you see that I returned your book, Mr. Hill?" ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the extent of availability of safety instruments in science laboratories in secondary schools in Ebonyi State of Nigeria. The researcher used 45 secondary schools and 180 science teachers and <b>laboratory</b> <b>attendants</b> for the study. Descriptive survey design was adopted. 11 -item four-point scale structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The data collected were analysed using {{mean and standard deviation}} for the research question while t-test was used to test the hypothesis at 0. 05 alpha level of significance. Result of the data analysis revealed that the extent of availability of safety instruments is very low in secondary schools in Ebonyi state of Nigeria. The implication of this is that sustainable development of science laboratory skills in the state will be hampered. The researcher recommends that the government of Ebonyi State should ensure that safety instruments are provided to a very high extent in secondary schools in the state...|$|R
40|$|Probable loss of chlorophyll-derived {{pigments}} during {{passage through}} the gut of zooplankton, {{and some of the}} consequences Abstract-By use of biogenic silica as an inert marker, it is shown that chlorophyll a and its derivatives can be destroyed or absorbed during {{passage through the}} gut of a herbivorous copepod. This observation is contradictory to the hypothesis that chlorophyll a is converted to pheophorbide a with 100 % molar efficiency. The currently used equations for measuring chlorophyll and pheopigment by fluorescence cannot be used to give concentration of phcopigment. Determining quantitatively the role of zooplankton as intermediates in material and energy transfer in aquatic food chains remains a formidable challenge for biological oceanographers. Several kinds of in vivo or in situ techniques have been developed to avoid the lengthy incubations usually required to measure grazing rates in the <b>laboratory,</b> with their <b>attendant</b> problems of interpretation and application. Probably the most widely used of these is the gut chlorophyll method (Mackas and Bohrer 1976). The usefulness of this technique to examine short term variability in zooplankton feeding has been frequently demonstrated (Boy...|$|R
40|$|The 59 publications, {{identified}} through {{a search of}} Educational Resources Informatior Center (ERIC) publications and non-ERIC publications, were reviewed and analyzed to identify the major findings, promising developments, strategies, and methodological strengths and weaknesses which exist in curriculums designed for training dental assistants, dental <b>laboratory</b> technicians, hospital <b>attendants,</b> nurses aides, medical and dental technicians, and practical or professional nurses. Current training programs cone closer to meeting immediate needs in some health occupational areas than in others. Of the occupational categories reviewed, only dental assistants and hospital attendants can receive training at the secondary level, while the remaining receive training at the post secondary level. Though a number of curriculums ar available, a major shortcoming is the general lack of a core or cluster curriculum. Curriculums for new and emerging occupations should be developed and evaluated through an educational planning system consisting of occupational analysis, program planning, program development and testing, and documentation and dissemination of the results. In addition, to provide and train necessary workers, improved counseling and recruitment programs and techniques will be required. (SP) - 1 "...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Screening and {{confirmation}} {{testing for}} drugs of abuse in urine (DAU) represent areas for potential reduction of <b>laboratory</b> workload and <b>attendant</b> cost savings. Following a careful {{review of the}} clinical needs of the underlying veteran patient population served by 7 medical facilities in the Boston area, DAU test ordering frequencies, positive rates for several screening panels and the associated confirmation tests, DAU panel standardization, and confirmation testing only by request were introduced. These changes were all reviewed {{and approved by the}} clinician users of DAU testing at each institution before the changes were implemented. Before standardization of DAU screening panels, 59, 835 DAU screening requests were done at a cost of $ 216, 005; following standardization, there was 47 % decrease in DAU screening utilization (27, 876) and costs ($ 100, 633). Before implementation of a DAU confirmation by request only policy, 5, 331 confirmation tests were done at a cost of $ 111, 502; after institution of the confirmation policy, there was 95 % decrease in confirmation tests (5, 080) and costs ($ 105, 826). DAU panel standardization and DAU confirmation by request only have resulted in substantial reductions of laboratory workload and costs in a veterans population and may {{serve as a model for}} other patient populations wit...|$|R
40|$|The Papanicolaou test [...] or Pap {{smear test}} [...] {{is one of}} the most {{effective}} cancer screening tests available, and its ability to detect premalignant conditions has contributed to the decline in cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in the United States since its development in 1941. The success of this screening test has created confidence among women, health-care providers, and public health officials. However, this screening tool is not perfect: false-negative findings are a special concern because they can delay necessary follow-up of and treatment for women who have cervical cancer precursor lesions or invasive cervical cancer. Recent media attention has focused on cytology laboratories that have been closed as a result of deficiencies (including a high proportion of false-negative reports), and in some states legal action has been taken against individual laboratories. With the advent of revised federal regulations implementing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988, scrutiny of the quality of cytology laboratory practice has increased. Between 1992 and 1994, a total of 10 cytology laboratories were closed by regulatory action of the Health Care Financing Administration because they were considered a threat to the public's health. Although such closures represent < 1 % of CLIA-certified cytology <b>laboratories,</b> the <b>attendant</b> publicity may trigger anxiety among women. Public health officials must respond to those concerns with appropriate clinical and community actions to ensure the health and safety of women whose Pap smears were evaluated by the closed laboratories. There are no published recommendations to help develop a public health response to the regulatory closure of a cervical cytology laboratory. In April 1994, the Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors, through a cooperative agreement with CDC, convened a working group to provide background on the current practice of clinical cervical cytology in the United States, summarize the CLIA regulations that established specific quality assurance standards for this specialty, and recommend actions that a public health agency may initiate to deliver a measured response to laboratory closings and other regulatory sanctions. This report includes this background and summary of the workshop. The working group made three recommendations: (a) public health officials should plan for a cervical cytology laboratory closure, then, when a laboratory is closed by regulatory action, they should (b) assess the severity of the situation and determine an appropriate response and (c) provide accurate, timely information to the public.
