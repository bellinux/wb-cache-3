50|$|According to the {{original}} task definition provided by {{the organizers of the}} OAEI 2008, the <b>library</b> <b>track</b> involved the alignment of two Dutch thesauri. These Dutch thesauri are used to index books from two collections held by the National Library of the Netherlands (KB). KB maintains two big collections: the Deposit Collection, containing all the Dutch printed publications (one million items), and the Scientific Collection, with about 1.4 million books mainly about the history, language and culture of the Netherlands. Each collection is described according to its own indexing system and conceptual vocabulary. On the one hand, the Scientific Collection was described using the GTT, a huge vocabulary containing 35,000 general concepts ranging from Wolkenkrabbers (Sky-scrapers) to Verzorging (Care). On the other hand, the books contained in the Deposit Collection are mainly indexed against the Brinkman thesaurus, containing a large set of headings (more than 5,000) that were expected to serve as global subjects of books. For each concept, the thesauri provided the usual lexical and semantic information: preferred labels, synonyms and notes, broader and related concepts, etc. The language of both thesauri was Dutch, but a quite substantial part of Brinkman concepts (around 60%) come with English labels. The <b>library</b> <b>track</b> was difficult partly because of its relative large size and because of its multilingual representation. Nevertheless in the <b>library</b> <b>track</b> DSSim has performed the best out of the 3 participating systems. However these ontologies contain related and broader terms therefore the mapping can be carried out without consulting multi-lingual background knowledge.|$|E

Each performer's music track was specially created from at least one (often several) <b>library</b> <b>track,</b> with stingers, hits and various accentuating effects from Gary Ouellet's Designer Textures for Magicians. Hence, WGM 3-5 were taped live with the pre-prepared music tracks.|$|E

40|$|Thesauri are {{hierarchical}} knowledge organization systems {{commonly used}} in libraries to categorize and index publications. While {{sometimes referred to as}} so-called lightweight ontologies [4], they actually fundamentally differ from ontologies in several aspects. Nevertheless, as thesauri are actively used, constantly maintained and improved, they offer an interesting background knowledge for semantic applications. This year, we reinstantiated the OAEI <b>library</b> <b>track</b> 1, i. e., we provide the ontology matching community with the challenge to create alignments between thesauri. First, we aim for interesting insights into the differences between ontologies and thesauri. Second, we try to further integrate existing thesauri by means of new alignments which leads to better search experiences within library systems. From 2007 to 2009, there has already been a <b>library</b> <b>track</b> in the OAEI [1]. They focused on matching thesauri describing the same topic but at a different level of granularity. For our track, we selected two very comparable thesauri with topical overlaps. To make sure that the created alignments are indeed used, we work closely together with the maintaining institutions. We apply the following two thesauri: STW: The Thesaurus for Economics (STW) provides vocabulary on any economic subject: more than 6, 000 standardized subject headings (in English and German...|$|E
40|$|Since the 90 s, we {{have seen}} an {{explosion}} of information and with it there {{is an increase in}} the need for data and information aggregation systems that store and manage information. However, most of the information sources apply different Knowledge Organizations Systems (KOS) to describe the content of stored data. This heterogeneous mix of KOS in different systems complicate access and seamless sharing of information and knowledge. Concordances also known as cross-concordances or terminology mappings map different (KOS) to each other for improvement of information retrieval in such heterogeneous mix of systems. (Mayr 2010, Keil 2012). Also for coherent indexing with different terminologies, mappings are considered to be a valuable and essential working tool. However, despite efforts at standardization (e. g. SKOS, ISO 25964 - 2, Keil 2012, Soergel 2011); there is a significant scarcity of concordances that has led an inability to establish uniform exchange formats as well as methods and tools for maintaining mappings and making them easily accessible. This is particularly true in the field of library classification schemes. In essence, {{there is a lack of}} infrastructure for provision/exchange of concordances, their management and quality assessment as well as tools that would enable semi-automatic generation of mappings. The project "coli-conc" therefore aims to address this gap by creating the necessary infrastructure. This includes the specification of a data format for exchange of concordances (JSKOS), specification and implementation of web APIs to query concordance databases (JSKOS-API), and a modular web application to enable uniform access to knowledge organization systems, concordances and concordance assessments (Cocoda). The focus of the project “coli-conc” lies in semi-automatic creation of mappings between different KOS in general and the two important library classification schemes in particular - Dewey classification system (DDC) and Regensburg classification system (RVK). In the year 2000, the national libraries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland adopted DDC in an endeavor to develop a nation-wide classification scheme. But historically, in the German speaking regions, the academic libraries have been using their own home-grown systems, the most prominent and popular being the RVK. However, with the launch of DDC, building concordances between DDC and RVK has become an imperative, although it is still rare. The delay in building comprehensive concordances between these two systems has been because of major challenges posed by the sheer largeness of these two systems (38. 000 classes in DDC and ca. 860. 000 classes in RVK), the strong disparity in their respective structure, the variation in the perception and representation of the concepts. The challenge is compounded geometrically for any manual attempt in this direction. Although there have been efforts on automatic mappings (OAEI <b>Library</b> <b>Track</b> 2012 [...] 2014 and e. g. Pfeffer 2013) in the recent years; such concordances carry the risks of inaccurate mappings, and the approaches are rather more suitable for mapping suggestions than for automatic generation of concordances (Lauser 2008; Reiner 2010). The project "coli-conc" will facilitate the creation, evaluation, and reuse of mappings with a public collection of concordances and a web application of mapping management. The proposed presentation will give an introduction to the tools and standards created and planned in the project "coli-conc". This includes preliminary work on DDC concordances (Balakrishnan 2013), an overview of the software concept, technical architecture (Voß 2015) and a demonstration of the Cocoda web application. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{maintaining}} Digital Libraries, having {{bibliographic data}} up-to-date is critical, yet often minor irregularities may cause information isolation. Unlike documents for which {{various kinds of}} unique ID systems exist (e. g., DOI, ISBN), other bibliographic entities such as author and publication venue do not have unique IDs. Therefore, in current Digital <b>Libraries,</b> <b>tracking</b> such bibliographic entities is not trivial. For instance, suppose a scholar changes her last name from A to B. Then, a user, searching for her publications under the new name B, cannot get old publications that appeared under A although they are by the same person. For such a scenario, since both A and B are the same person, it would be desirable for Digital <b>Libraries</b> to <b>track</b> their identities accordingly. In this paper, we investigate this problem known as name authority control, and present our system-oriented solution. We first identify three core building blocks that underlie the phenomenon, and show taxonomy where different combinations of the building blocks can occur. Then, we consider how systems can support the problem in two common functions of Digital Libraries- Update and Search. Finally, our test-bed called OpenDBLP is presented where the suggested solution is fully implemented as a proof of the concept. 1...|$|R
