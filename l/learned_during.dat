5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E
5|$|A {{culture of}} {{violence}} {{rooted in the}} deep conflicts that split the countryside during the revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout the whole {{second half of the}} 20th century. The term 'social revolution' has been applied to a range of mostly violent activities of the left that included both altruistic attempts to organise real revolution and simple expressions of revenge, resentment and assertions of power. Violence was one of the many lessons <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> the Japanese occupation, and figures identified as 'feudal', including kings, regents, or simply the wealthy, were often attacked and sometimes beheaded. Rape became a weapon against 'feudal' women. In the coastal sultanates of Sumatra and Kalimantan, for example, sultans and others whose authority had been shored-up by the Dutch, were attacked as soon as Japanese authority left. The secular local lords of Aceh, who had been the foundation of Dutch rule, were executed, although most of Indonesia's sultanates fell back into Dutch hands.|$|E

5|$|The West Wycombe {{estate was}} {{acquired}} by Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his brother Samuel in 1698. Dashwood demolished the existing manor house and built a modern mansion on higher ground nearby. This mansion forms {{the core of the}} present house. Images of the house on early estate plans show a red-brick house with stone dressings and a hipped roof in the contemporary Queen Anne style. In 1724, Dashwood bequeathed this square conventional house to his 16-year-old son, the 2nd Baronet, also Francis, who later inherited the title Baron le Despencer through his mother and is perhaps best known for establishing the Hellfire Club close to the mansion, in the West Wycombe Caves. Between 1726 and 1741, Dashwood embarked on a series of Grand Tours: the ideas and manners he <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> this period influenced him throughout his life and were pivotal in the rebuilding of his father's simple house, transforming it into the classical edifice that exists today.|$|E
5|$|The lessons <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E
5|$|A Joint RAN-USN Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the incident, and was in session over June and July 1969. The Board found Evans partially at fault for the collision, but also faulted Melbourne for not taking evasive action sooner, even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed. It was <b>learned</b> <b>during</b> the inquiry that Evans commanding officer was asleep in his quarters {{at the time of}} the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time. Subsequent to the inquiry, the three USN officers and Stevenson were court-martialled by their respective navies on charges of negligence, with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson 'Honourably Acquitted'. Despite the findings, Stevenson's next posting was as a minor flag officer's chief of staff, seen by him as a demotion in all but name. In a repeat of the aftermath of the Voyager collision, Melbournes captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the Minister for Defence, apologising for his treatment by the RAN and the government of the day.|$|E

40|$|Debriefing, the {{reflective}} activity following an experiential learning exercise, {{has been identified}} as {{the most important part of}} simulation learning and is also important for learning in other activities utilized in nursing education. There is general agreement that debriefing provides learning and improves performance. However, there is little specific evidence about the phenomenon of <b>learning</b> acquired <b>during</b> debriefing, including how it occurs, how it is defined and identified, and how it is evaluated by debriefing facilitators. In addition, there are no instruments or tools specifically measuring <b>learning</b> acquired <b>during</b> debriefing. Without practical and theoretically grounded tools, simulation activities will continue to lack the element of objective assessment necessary to move evidence-based teaching practices forward. A measure of <b>learning</b> acquired <b>during</b> debriefing, independent of a specific debriefing method and across debriefing types, will aid in the design of future simulation debriefing research that is both rigorous and feasible. To inform future tool development, I conducted a qualitative descriptive study to provide initial evidence regarding the <b>learning</b> acquired <b>during</b> debriefing. Following Institutional Review Board approval, I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews of nurse educators who facilitate debriefing in pre-licensure nursing programs. The interviews were transcribed and data analysis was completed to provide answers to the research questions using simple descriptive statistics, inductive reasoning processes and content analysis to interpret and structure meaning from the interviews. Study results included the nurse educators‚Äô verbatim definitions of learning as well as simple descriptions of how they measured the <b>learning</b> acquired <b>during</b> debriefing. Qualitative themes emerging from the interviews describe how nurse educators recognize when students are <b>learning</b> <b>during</b> debriefing; these themes also describe activities that the nurse educators used to promote student <b>learning</b> <b>during</b> debriefing. Nurse educators identified that nursing students are <b>learning</b> <b>during</b> debriefing when they express what they have learned directly, connect past and present learning, plan for future practice experiences, share with peers, experience the ‚ÄúAh-ha‚Äù moment, critically review their actions, display excitement and engagement during debriefing, apply their simulation learning in subsequent clinical and simulation experiences, and display learning in formal and informal assessments. Nurse educators described many activities they used to promote learning when they facilitated debriefings. These activities included utilizing simulation preparation activities, aligning their debriefing practices with a specific debriefing method or learning theory, utilizing intentional debriefing, establishing safety, maintaining a supportive demeanor, encouraging student-led debriefing, engaging the student learner, using debriefing aids, promoting recognition of learning, facilitating to the level of the learner, attending to the debriefing environment, and providing post-debriefing activities. I will use the results of this study to inform future development of an instrument intended to measure <b>learning</b> acquired <b>during</b> debriefing. This study also provides many insights into how nurse educators can facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>during</b> debriefing for pre-licensure nursing student...|$|R
