40|$|A models lunar {{mining method}} is {{proposed}} that illustrates the {{problems to be}} expected in lunar mining and how they might be solved. While the method is quite feasible, it is, more importantly, a useful baseline system against which to test other, possible better, methods. Our study group proposed the slusher to stimulate discussion of how a lunar mining operation might be successfully accomplished. Critics of the slusher system were invited to propose better methods. The group noted that while nonterrestrial mining has been {{a vital part of}} past space manufacturing proposals, no one has proposed a lunar mining system in any real detail. The group considered it essential that the design of actual, workable, and specific lunar mining methods begin immediately. Based on an earlier proposal, the method is a three-drum slusher, also known as a cable-operated <b>drag</b> <b>scraper.</b> Its terrestrial application is quite limited, as it is relatively inefficient and inflexible. The method usually finds use in underwater mining from the shore and in moving small amounts of ore underground. When lunar mining scales up, the lunarized slusher will be replaced by more efficient, high-volume methods. Other aspects of lunar mining are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of blunt trailing edge airfoils (also called flatback airfoils) for the inboard region of large {{wind turbine blades}} has been proposed. Blunt trailing edge airfoils would not only provide a number of structural benefits, such as increased structural volume and ease of fabrication and handling, but they have also been found to improve the lift characteristics of thick airfoils. Therefore, the incorporation of blunt trailing edge airfoils would allow blade designers to more freely address the structural demands without having to sacrifice aerodynamic performance. These airfoils do have the disadvantage of generating high <b>levels</b> of <b>drag</b> {{as a result of}} the low-pressure steady or periodic flow in the near-wake of the blunt trailing edge. Although for rotors, the drag penalty appears secondary to the lift enhancement produced by the blunt trailing edge, high <b>drag</b> <b>levels</b> are of concern in terms of the negative effect on the torque and power generated by the rotor. Hence, devices are sought that mitigate the drag of these airfoils.

50|$|During the 1960s, other {{mechanical}} injection {{systems such as}} Hilborn were occasionally used on modified American V8 engines in various racing applications such as drag racing, oval racing, and road racing.

However, they were a favorite in the aforementioned competition trials in which essentially wide-open throttle operation was prevalent.
