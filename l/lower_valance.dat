50|$|In April 1969, the car gained gauge-pack cluster, HD suspension, wider tires; {{adjustable}} seat back (45% of production); bumpers restyled, <b>lower</b> <b>valance</b> panels added; swing-out quarter window option (10% of production).|$|E
5000|$|The 1964 Dodge 426 Hemi Lightweight {{produced}} over [...] This [...] "top drag racer" [...] had an aluminium hood, lightweight front bumpers, fenders, {{doors and}} <b>lower</b> <b>valance,</b> magnesium front wheels, lightweight Dodge van seat, Lexan side windows, one windshield wiper, and no sun visors or sound deadening. Like other lightweights of the era, {{it came with}} a factory disclaimer: Designed for supervised acceleration trials. Not recommended for general everyday driving because of the compromises in the all-round characteristics which must be made {{for this type of}} vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The X308 kept much of {{the same}} {{exterior}} styling as its predecessor, carrying its rounded four-headlamp bonnet, low roofline, sloping tail, and wrap-around rear light clusters. From the front, the two generations can be differentiated by the shape of the indicator lenses (rectangular on the X300, oval on the X308), and also by the shape of the fog lamps and <b>lower</b> <b>valance</b> air intake (both of which are more rounded on the X308). The front and rear bumpers were both changed along with the taillights which had red/clear lenses rather than red/grey lenses. The grill surround and badging was slightly changed. The headlight fixtures also included forward parking lights housed with the brights, new to X308.|$|E
50|$|As for the LNER A4 class, {{the class}} {{retained}} its overall streamlining throughout service but the <b>lower</b> <b>valances</b> were later cut higher, to improve {{access to the}} running gear for maintenance.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, as {{electrification}} of the East Coast Main Line {{was under}} way, British Rail realised {{that the new}} Mark 4 carriages for the Class 89 and 91 locomotives {{were not going to}} be finished in time for the introduction of electric services on the East Coast Main Line so, in late 1987, a total of eight Eastern Region power cars (Numbers 43013/014/065/067/068/080/084/123) conversions (on 43014/123) were carried out at the Derby Engineering Development Unit, whilst the other six (43013/065/067/068/080/084) were converted by the diesel repair shop at Stratford to have the <b>lower</b> <b>valancing</b> removed and buffers fitted.|$|R
50|$|Following Ford Australia's {{introduction}} of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220 and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic but nevertheless significant and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu√© and, on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-tone paint to their side skirts and <b>lower</b> <b>valances.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1999 {{model year}} {{received}} a facelift {{similar to that}} of the 1999 model year Ford F-150. Included in the update was a new front grille which now dropped lower in the center, grille work, as well as a new front bumper that incorporated the fog lamps into the <b>lower</b> <b>valance</b> and larger center air intake. Both the 4.6 liter and 5.4 liter V8 engines received updates including more power and torque. The Two High mode for automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive equipped models was dropped leaving only Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock) modes. The dashboard also received an updated radio and air conditioning controls and revised Gauge Cluster and a Digital Odometer for the first time.|$|E
40|$|Cementitious waste forms can be {{designed}} to chemically stabilize selected contaminants, such as Tc{sup + 7 } and Cr{sup + 6 }, by chemically reduction to <b>lower</b> <b>valance</b> states, Tc{sup + 4 } and Cr{sup + 3 }, respectively, and precipitation of these species in alkaline media as low solubility solid phases. Data for oxidation {{of this type of}} cementitious waste form cured under field conditions as a function of time is required for predicting the performance of the waste form and disposal facility. The rate of oxidation (oxidation front advancement) is an important parameter for predicting performance because the solubilities of some radionuclide contaminants, e. g., technetium, are a function of the oxidation state. A non-radioactive experiment was designed for quantifying the oxidation front advancement using chromium, as an approximate redox-sensitive surrogate (Cr{sup + 6 } / Cr{sup + 3 }) for technetium (Tc{sup + 7 } / Tc{sup + 4 }). Nonradioactive cementitious waste forms were prepared in the laboratory and cured under both laboratory and ?field conditions. ? Laboratory conditions were ambient temperature and sealed sample containers. Field conditions were approximated by curing samples in open containers which were placed inside a plastic container stored outdoors at SRS. The container had a lid and was instrumented with temperature and humidity probes. Subsamples as thin as 0. 2 mm were taken as a function of distance from the exposed surface of the as-cast sample. The subsamples were leached and the leachates were analyzed for chromium, nitrate, nitrite and sodium. Nitrate, nitrite, and sodium concentrations were used to provide baseline data because these species are not chemically retained in the waste form matrix to any significant extent and are not redox sensitive. ?Effective? oxidation fronts for Cr were measured for samples containing 1000, 500 and 20 mg/kg Cr added as soluble sodium chromate, Na{sub 2 }CrO{sub 4 }. For a sample cured for 129 days under field conditions, leachable Cr (assumed to be the oxidized form, i. e., Cr{sup + 6 } was detected in the top 15 to 20 mm of the sample spiked with 1000 mg/kg Cr. Below about 20 mm, the Cr concentrations in leachates were below the detection limit (< 0. 010 mg/L) which indicates that the oxidation as the result of exposure to air was limited to the top 20 mm of the sample after exposure for 129 days and that the bulk of the waste form was not affected, i. e., the Cr was stabilized and insoluble. For samples cured in the laboratory, leachable Cr was detected in the top 8 mm of the Cr 1000 sample cured in the laboratory for 37 days. Between 8 and 14 mm, the concentration Cr in the leachate dropped by a factor of about 20 to just above the detection limit. These depth of penetration results indicate that the rate of advancement of the oxidation front for samples spiked with 1000 mg/kg Cr cured under ?field conditions? for 129 days is less than that for the sample cured in the laboratory for 37 days, i. e., 0. 156 and 0. 216 mm/day, respectively. Additional data are presented for samples spiked with 500 and 20 mg/kg Cr. In summary, cementitious waste forms are porous solids with a network of interconnected pores ranging in diameter from 10 E- 10 m to greater than a few mm. The oxidation process is assumed to occur as the result of oxygen transport through the interconnected porosity which may be filled with air, aqueous salt solution, or both. Upon oxidation, the Cr becomes soluble and can be transported in solution through aqueous pore fluid or leachate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An ion-exchanged {{reaction}} of MnCl 2 with Al-incorporated solid core/mesoporous shell silica (AlSCMS) followed by calcinations generated manganese species, where average oxidation state of manganese ion is 3 +, in the mesoporous materials. Dehydration {{results in the}} formation of Mn 2 + ion species, which can be characterized by electron spin resonance (ESR). The chemical environments of the manganese centers in Mn-AlSCMS were investigated by diffuse reflectance, UV-VIS and ESR spectroscopic methods. Upon drying at 323 K, part of manganese is oxidized to higher oxidation state (Mn 3 + and Mn 4 +) and further increase in (average) oxidation state takes place upon calcinations at 823 K. It was found that the manganese species {{on the wall of the}} Mn-AlSCMS were transformed to tetrahedral Mn 3 + or Mn 4 + and further changed to square pyramid by additional coordination to water molecules upon hydration. The oxidized Mn 3 + or Mn 4 + species on the surfaces were reversibly reduced to Mn 2 + or Mn 3 + species or <b>lower</b> <b>valances</b> by thermal process. Mn(II) species I with...|$|R
50|$|In 1999 for the 2000 {{model year}} came a minor {{front-end}} restyle, with new, larger, clear headlights, a revised grille, and <b>lower</b> front <b>valance</b> with standard projection fog lamps. On the interior, the seats received a new, horizontal stitch pattern. Also, the 3.7-litre V8 FWD model was dropped, leaving the 2.8 V6 {{model and the}} long-wheelbase and short-wheelbase 4.2-litre quattro. These restyled cars also featured revised external door handles and an integrated radio antenna. For 2000, the North American A8 line-up was expanded to include the A8 L.|$|R
5000|$|The 1980 to 1983 {{models were}} called the [...] "Datsun 720". They had single wall beds with outside rolled lips and rope ties, two faux hood vents (some had real vents), and tail {{lights on the}} <b>lower</b> rear <b>valance</b> (similar to the 620). These {{vehicles}} were badged with a small Datsun logo on the driver's side of the grill, a raised plastic Datsun badge on the front fenders, a large Datsun embossed on the rear tailgate, as well as Datsun stickers on the bottom left of the tailgate, and model designation on the right. The owner's manual and service manuals retained the Datsun name.|$|R
5000|$|The Z28s {{included}} lightweight fiberglass SMC hoods with functional hood {{air induction}} flaps on RPO LU5 cars. The Z28 {{had a different}} nose, a three-piece rear spoiler and front, side, and rear <b>lower</b> body <b>valances</b> in silver or gold. Just above the valance was a three-color lower body stripe that encircled the car. Headlamp pockets on the Z28 were black. Standard were new 15x7-inch cast-aluminum five-spoke wheels accented with silver or gold. Z28 badges appeared on the right rear bumper and on the side valances. On early models, if the [...] "Conteur" [...] sport seats were selected as an option, the passenger seat was purposefully a mismatched high-back bucket seat design, due to production shortages of the passenger seat.|$|R
50|$|Available {{features}} on 2000 models included a hidden radio antenna (integrated {{into the rear}} quarter panel window glass), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rear view mirrors, lane departure indicators on side view mirrors (before on the glass) and ultrasonic rear park assist /backup sensors. The <b>lower</b> front bumper <b>valance</b> and illuminated running boards were changed over to Arizona beige to complement the standard Arizona beige exterior body trim on Eddie Bauer models.|$|R

50|$|While the {{standard}} S-10 {{moved to a}} redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, {{with the exception of}} composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's sealed-beam headlamps. The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a passenger side airbag. Aside from this header panel, a unique <b>lower</b> bumper <b>valance,</b> and a stylized 'Electric' decal {{on the bottom of the}} doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, belly pans beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed.|$|R
