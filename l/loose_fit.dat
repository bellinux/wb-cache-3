25|$|The hip {{could have}} major contractions or {{seizures}} from dysplasias. The caput is not deeply and tightly {{held by the}} acetabulum. Instead of being a snug fit, it is a <b>loose</b> <b>fit,</b> or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.|$|E
25|$|The {{displacer}} is a special-purpose piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to {{move the}} working gas {{back and forth between}} the hot and cold heat exchangers. Depending on the type of engine design, the displacer may or may not be sealed to the cylinder, i.e. it may be a <b>loose</b> <b>fit</b> within the cylinder, allowing the working gas to pass around it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a <b>loose</b> <b>fit</b> and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E

2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the <b>loose</b> <b>fit</b> between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E
60|$|For a {{time these}} two perfected modern aristocrats stood {{regarding}} the difficult {{problem of the}} Anglo-Saxon citizen, that ambiguous citizen who, obeying some mysterious law in his blood, would neither drill nor be a democrat. Bert {{was by no means}} a beautiful object, but in some inexplicable way he looked resistant. He wore his cheap suit of serge, now showing many signs of wear, and its <b>loose</b> <b>fit</b> made him seem sturdier than he was; above his disengaging face was a white German cap that was altogether too big for him, and his trousers were crumpled up his legs and their ends tucked into the rubber highlows of a deceased German aeronaut. He looked an inferior, though by no means an easy inferior, and instinctively they hated him.|$|E
50|$|A hairnet, or {{sometimes}} simply a net or caul, is a small, often elasticised, fine net worn over long hair {{to hold it}} in place. It is worn to keep hair contained. A snood is similar but a <b>looser</b> <b>fit</b> and with a much coarser mesh and noticeably thicker yarn.|$|R

50|$|When Dinah {{belonged to}} the JLI during the 1980s she wore a new costume, a blue-and-black {{full-body}} jumpsuit with a bird motif and a slightly <b>looser</b> <b>fit</b> instead of her traditional, skin-tight black outfit with fishnet stockings. The change was poorly received and short-lived, and later artists restored her original look.|$|R

"I {{had thought}} of {{painting}} and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me, in order to render myself visible, but the disadvantage of this lay {{in the fact that}} I should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish again. Finally I chose a mask of the better type, slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings, dark glasses, greyish whiskers, and a wig. I could find no underclothing, but that I could buy subsequently, and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs. I could find no socks, but the hunchback's boots were rather a <b>loose</b> <b>fit</b> and sufficed. In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings' worth of silver, and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold. I could go forth into the world again, equipped.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the earlier}} efforts to obtain better {{high-velocity}} performance involves placing a very shallow cup of copper alloy over {{the base of the}} bullet.

Some gas checks are designed to crimp onto the base of the bullet, while others have a <b>looser</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|R

50|$|A shirtdress is a {{style of}} dress that borrows details from a man's shirt. These can include a collar, a button front, or cuffed sleeves. Often, these dresses are made up in crisp fabrics {{including}} cotton or silk, much like a men's dress shirt would be. As they are typically cut without a seam at the waist, these dresses often have a <b>looser</b> <b>fit,</b> usually relying on a belt to define the waist. Button fronts and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most body types.|$|R

25|$|The unfitted <b>looser</b> <b>fit</b> of the 1640s {{continued}} into the 1650s. In the 1650s, sleeves ranged from above to below the elbow. The sleeves could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching {{the bottom of the}} rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of the sleeves.|$|R

50|$|Muskets were smoothbore, large caliber weapons using ball-shaped {{ammunition}} {{fired at}} relatively low velocity.

50|$|A wetsuit {{must have}} a snug fit to work {{efficiently}} when immersed; too <b>loose</b> a <b>fit,</b> particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter continuously.

2500|$|The common upper garment was a gown, {{called in}} Spanish ropa, in French robe, and in English either gown or frock.

50|$|Over the chemise, women wore a <b>loose</b> or <b>fitted</b> gown {{called a}} cotte or kirtle, usually ankle or floor-length, and with trains for formal occasions.
