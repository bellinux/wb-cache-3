5|$|Group 18 Structure 3 is a {{rectangular}} platform {{located on the}} south side of the plaza. The core consists of <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> of rubble that suggest some kind of older substructure. The platform has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Large</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of glass}} screens and metal {{shoulder}} eaves extend horizontally; {{the station is}} lit and transparent. The specially designed lighting, the clear tempered glass, the insulating glass, and the truss system emphasize {{the functions of the}} space and bring a bright look to the building. The 6-meter tall lobby on the ground floor is connected by the escalators coming up from the entrance hall and the platforms built underground.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into <b>large</b> <b>pieces.</b> These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E

50|$|The Flax and Wool Cabinet or the Flax and Wool Wardrobe is a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> {{of painted}} {{furniture}} {{designed by the}} English architect and designer William Burges. It {{may have been the}} first <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> of painted furniture that Burges designed.|$|R
5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial {{is on the other}} side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E
5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E
5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
50|$|There are burr {{wood and}} {{buttress}} root formations in Andaman Padauk. The <b>largest</b> <b>piece</b> of buttress known from Andaman was a dining table of 13 x 7 ft. The <b>largest</b> <b>piece</b> of burr wood was again a dining table for eight.|$|R
50|$|Equipment {{costs can}} become a large {{deterrent}} of owners also. Several smaller pieces of equipment must be purchased for each floor instead of one <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> for the whole building. The <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment is much cheaper {{than all of the}} small pieces combined in almost every case.|$|R

5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. <b>Large</b> <b>pieces</b> of tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prototype}} dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. Striking such <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier reducing lathe {{to lower the}} relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore {{at least some of}} the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.|$|E
