40|$|ABSTRACT EMBEDDED NETWORK BASED MONITORING SYSTEM DESIGN by ?? Yongqing Cui 2009 Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Computer Engineering Option California State University, Chico Fall 2007 With the {{widespread}} use of network technology, more and more monitoring and control systems in industry are connected with networks to implement remote monitoring and control of industrial systems. These systems are normally designed and implemented with high-end desktop computers or workstations because the connection with networks needs large computer resources such as fast execution speed and large memory capacity. Now, microcontrollers are widely used in industrial monitoring and control systems, especially for small-scale systems. How to connect these systems with networks is becoming a real challenge for design engineers because microcontrollers have limited hardware resources. For example, microcontrollers have only 1 k to several k bytes on-chip random access memory (RAM). xi This project focuses on the design and implementation of a monitoring system with an embedded network control device connected to networks. The system includes two parts: embedded network control subsystem and temperature monitoring subsystem. The first part focuses on the design and implementation of the embedded network subsystem. The off-the-self network control device CS 8900 A will be used to design and implement a practical interface with a microcontroller based system and implement TCP/IP stack by using the limited microcontroller???s hardware resources. The second part of the project is the monitoring subsystem that monitors the ambient temperature change. This part will focus on the interface design and implementation of temperature sensor???s data acquisition, input and output devices such as keypad, liquid crystal display (<b>LCD),</b> <b>printer,</b> etc. CSU, Chic...|$|E
