40|$|Background: Radiation {{exposure}} from {{computed tomography}} (CT) {{is associated with}} deleterious effects. In-plane bismuth shields (IBS) have been suggested as an effective method to reduce radiation exposure to radiosensitive organs during CT. Objectives: To explore the availability and usage of modern shielding tools (IBS) and conventional radiation shields for patients undergoing CT exams in five hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran. Methods: Six radiological technology students were sent to five different hospitals of Ahvaz as observers. Data of the availability and usage of shielding tools for patients undergoing CT exams were collected. Results: In the five hospitals evaluated, there were no IBS found. In each X-ray room at least one lead apron was available. A gonad shield and thyroid collar were available in 70 and 62 of X-ray rooms, respectively. Also there was no available <b>lens</b> <b>shield.</b> Shielding the eyes and thyroid gland were often neglected. Gonads and breasts were shielded occasionally. Conclusions: Patients have received avoidable doses of radiation {{and this is a}} reason for concern and call for action. Adherence to safety guidelines is recommended. The provision and routine use of IBS to radiosensitive organs as well as lead-shields to the organs outside the field being scanned should be mandatory...|$|E

50|$|Colin and Dennis Creevey are Muggle-born Gryffindor students; {{their father}} is a milkman. Colin is one year younger than Harry and is in a regular state of excitement; he is delighted at the {{discovery}} {{that he is a}} wizard, and takes photographs of memorable people, objects and events to send home to his family. He is also star-struck by Harry and pursues him regularly to get pictures, but Harry quickly gets tired of Colin's constant attention. During one of Gryffindor's Quidditch practices, Colin sits in the stands and repeatedly snaps pictures of Harry, and inappropriately photographs Ron vomiting slugs after his curse directed at Malfoy backfires. Ironically, Colin's camera later proves to be a lifesaver when he attempts to take a picture of the basilisk, and the camera <b>lens</b> <b>shields</b> him from the creature's direct and fatal eye contact, and Colin is only Petrified.|$|R
50|$|Photokeratitis can be {{prevented}} by using sunglasses or eye protection that transmits 5-10% of visible light and absorbs almost all UV rays. Additionally, these glasses should have large <b>lenses</b> and side <b>shields</b> to avoid incidental light exposure. Sunglasses should always be worn, even when the sky is overcast, as UV rays can pass through clouds.|$|R
40|$|Since {{practical}} multiplexed {{structured light}} systems currently available use plural light patterns or different illumination conditions {{to ensure a}} high reliability, their fast performance is impaired. This paper describes a fast, highly reliable range imaging system with a multiplexed structured light system that uses a direct space encoding approach while using only a single light pattern. Unlike a conventional encoding approach, the proposed approach is unique in that it encodes object space {{through the use of}} a special optical system which consists of field stops, plural <b>lenses,</b> and <b>shield</b> masks, rather than a light pattern. The theoretical considerations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for a highly reliable, fast, accurate range imaging system </p...|$|R
50|$|Some sports-optimized {{sunglasses}} have {{interchangeable lens}} options. Lenses {{can be easily}} removed and swapped for a different lens, usually of a different color. The purpose is to allow the wearer to easily change lenses when light conditions or activities change. The reasons are {{that the cost of}} a set of lenses is less than the cost of a separate pair of glasses, and carrying extra lenses is less bulky than carrying multiple pairs of glasses. It also allows easy replacement of a set of lenses if they are damaged. The most common type of sunglasses with interchangeable lenses has a single <b>lens</b> or <b>shield</b> that covers both eyes. Styles that use two lenses also exist, but are less common.|$|R
50|$|Since a metal-halide lamp {{contains}} gases at {{a significant}} high pressure (up to 50 psi), {{failure of the}} arc tube is inevitably a violent event. Fragments of arc tube are launched, at high velocity, in all directions, striking the outer bulb of the lamp with enough force to cause it to break. If the fixture has no secondary containment (such as a <b>lens,</b> bowl or <b>shield)</b> then the extremely hot pieces of debris will fall down onto people and property below the light, likely resulting in serious injury, damage, and possibly causing a major building fire if flammable material is present.|$|R
500|$|Russell Meredith of Northrop Aircraft {{perfected the}} process in 1941. Meredith named the process Heliarc because it used a {{tungsten}} electrode arc and helium as a shielding gas, but it {{is often referred to}} as tungsten inert gas welding (TIG). [...] The American Welding Society's official term is gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Linde Air Products developed a wide range of air-cooled and water-cooled torches, gas <b>lenses</b> to improve <b>shielding,</b> and other accessories that increased the use of the process. Initially, the electrode overheated quickly and, despite tungsten's high melting temperature, particles of tungsten were transferred to the weld. To address this problem, the polarity of the electrode was changed from positive to negative, but the change made it unsuitable for welding many non-ferrous materials. Finally, the development of alternating current units made it possible to stabilize the arc and produce high quality aluminum and magnesium welds.|$|R
40|$|This chapter aims {{to provide}} the readers a {{comprehensive}} review of the current trends and approaches used in the development of ocular drug delivery systems. After the introduction to the topic, the chapter begins with {{a brief description of the}} common anatomical and physiological factors that are barriers to ocular drug transport and presents a persistent challenge to the development of formulations targeted to ophthalmic tissues. Further, traditional as well as relatively newer approaches used in the development of ocular formulations are discussed. Approaches such as viscosity modifiers, penetration enhancers, liposomal delivery, niosomes, microemulsions, prodrugs, and nanotechnology-derived approaches are extensively reviewed. These approaches are described with respect to the materials, formulation development, formulation performance, relative advantages and drawbacks, and recent advances in the technology. Additionally, the design approaches for the modified ocular drug delivery such as ocular implants, inserts, <b>lenses,</b> and ocular <b>shields</b> are described with respect to the formulation development. Finally, ocular drug delivery systems that are relatively newer or employed less frequently such as intravitreal injections, ocular iontophoresis, etc. are discussed. All approaches described are supported with relevant examples and up-to-date literature reports...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} adult male mice, body weight of 25 - 26 g. Animals were bred in constant light 12 : 12 and fed with standard diet. The animals were segregated into one control and three experimental groups. Each group consisted of 5 specimens, n= 5. In {{the first part of}} the experiment animals of the experimental groups drunk 5 %, 10 % and 15 % ethanol solutions for 10 days and individual daily doses of ethanol were 48, 84 and 118 mg respectively. After 10 days of the experiment animals were decapitated and the lenses were taken immediately. Next the lenses were put into Petri dish filled with physiological saline and placed under UV lamps. The UV system emitted both UV-A and U-B radiation. The lamps were placed 24 cm above the Petri dishes and the <b>lenses</b> were <b>shielded</b> by WG 295 SCHOTT filters which cut of the waves shorter than 295 nm. The biologically effective irradiances of the UV system measured from a distance of 24 cm was 0. 000000112 W/cm 2 and 0. 0000042 W/cm 2 for UV-A and UV-B respectively. The lenses were irradiated for 3 hours. These gave biological effective doses of 0. 12 kJ/m 2 and 0. 45 kJ/m 2 for UV-A and UV-B respectively. After the exposure the lenses were homogenized in phosphate buffer containing EDTA (pH= 7. 4). The reduced glutathione content was estimated with Elman’s method using color reactions of thiol groups with DTNB. The method was adapted to microplate reader. Statistical analysis was performed using MANOVA test followed by Tukey’s test. We have found statistically significant interactions between UV and ethanol influence on GSH content in mice lenses (F= 4. 059; p= 0. 01). Control animals exposed to UV radiation had significantly lower GSH content of reduced glutathione in eye lenses (p= 0. 01). This effect did not occur in lenses of animals drinking ethanol and exposed to UV radiation. This suggest protective effect of methanol against UV induced drop or reduced glutathione in mice lenses. Probably alcohol drinking before the exposure to UV could increase activity of antioxidative system, which diminished UV influence on glutathione content in lenses of tested mice...|$|R
60|$|One {{realized}} the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over {{him from the}} moment that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity. He {{was out on the}} lawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom, {{for all the world like}} a dashing foxhound drawing a cover. In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight. Then he rushed down the stair, out through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry. The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain measurements upon its bowl. He carefully scrutinized with his <b>lens</b> the talc <b>shield</b> which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook. Finally, just as the doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the potential efficacy for autologous and allogeneic expanded corneal epithelial cell transplants derived from harvested limbal corneal epithelial stem cells cultured in vitro {{for the management}} of ocular surface disease. METHODS: Human Subjects. Of the 19 human subjects included, 18 (20 procedures) underwent in vitro cultured corneal epithelial cell transplants using various carriers for the epithelial cells to determine the most efficacious approach. Sixteen patients (18 procedures on 17 eyes) received autologous transplants, and 2 patients (1 procedure each) received allogeneic sibling grafts. The presumed corneal epithelial stem cells from 1 patient did not grow in vitro. The carriers for the expanded corneal epithelial cells included corneal stroma, type 1 collagen (Vitrogen), soft contact <b>lenses,</b> collagen <b>shields,</b> and amniotic membrane for the autologous grafts and only amniotic membrane for the allogeneic sibling grafts. Histologic confirmation was reviewed on selected donor grafts. Amniotic membrane as carrier. Further studies were made to determine whether amniotic membrane might be the best carrier for the expanding corneal epithelial cells. Seventeen different combinations of tryspinization, sonication, scraping, and washing were studied to find the simplest, most effective method for removing the amniotic epithelium while still preserving the histologic appearance of the basement membrane of the amnion. Presumed corneal epithelial stem cells were harvested and expanded in vitro and applied to the amniotic membrane to create a composite graft. Thus, the composite graft consisted of the amniotic membrane from which the original epithelium had been removed without significant histologic damage to the basement membrane, and the expanded corneal epithelial stem cells, which had been applied to and had successfully adhered to the denuded amniotic membrane. Animal model. Twelve rabbits had the ocular surface of 1 eye damaged in a standard manner with direct removal of the presumed limbal stem cells, corneal epithelium, and related epithelium, followed by the application of n-heptanol for 60 seconds. After 6 weeks, all damaged eyes were epithelialized and vascularized. Two such treated eyes were harvested without further treatment, to be used for histologic study as damaged controls. The remaining 10 rabbits received composite grafts (consisting of amniotic membrane with expanded allogeneic rabbit corneal epithelial cell transplants) applied to the ocular surface in a standard manner followed by the application of a contact lens. At 16 days following transplantation, 5 of the rabbits were sacrificed and the corneal rims were removed for histologic study. At 28 days, the remaining rabbits were sacrificed and the previously damaged eyes were harvested for histologic and immunohistochemical study. RESULTS: Human subjects. Of the 19 total patients admitted to the study, the presumed corneal epithelial stem cells of 1 patient did not grow in vitro. Of the remaining 18 patients (20 procedures, 19 eyes), 3 patients had unsuccessful results (3 autologous procedures), 1 patient had a partially successful procedure (allogeneic procedure), and 1 patient had a procedure with an undetermined result at present (allogeneic procedure). One unsuccessful patient had entropion/trichiasis and mechanically removed the graft and eventually went into phthisis. The other 2 unsuccessful patients suffered presumed loss of autologous donor epithelium and recurrence of the ocular surface disease (pterygium). The partially successful patient receiving an allogeneic transplant had infectious keratitis delay of his re-epithelialization; he has only minimal visual improvement but has re-epithelialized. The patient receiving the second allogeneic graft lost his donor epithelium at day 4. Additional donor epithelium was reapplied, but the result is undetermined at present. Amniotic membrane as carrier. The in vitro preparation of the amniotic membrane with corneal epithelial stem cell graft overlay was successful. Histology documented removal of the amniotic epithelium and reapplication of corneal epithelial cells. Animal model. The 2 rabbits that had no reparative surgery following standard ocular surface injury had histology and immunopathology consistent with incomplete corneal epithelial stem cell failure with vascularization and scarring of the ocular surface. Light microscopy and immunohistologic staining with AE 5 confirmed the conjunctival phenotype of the ocular surface repair but also documented the incomplete model. The allogeneic stern cell transplants had varying results. One rabbit had a suppurative infection and lost the graft. Reparative surgery failed in 2 of the rabbits, failed partially in 3 of the rabbits, was partially successful in 3 others, and was successful in 1 rabbit at 28 days. Histologic and immunopathologic study documented successful growth of corneal epithelium onto the recipient surface. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Presumed corneal epithelial stem cells can be harvested safely from the limbus and expanded successfully in vitro. 2. Expanded corneal epithelial cell cultures can be grown onto various carriers, but currently denuded amniotic membrane seems to be the best carrier for ocular surface repair. 3. Expanded corneal epithelial cell transplants appear to resurface damaged ocular surfaces successfully, but cellular tracking and further confirmation are required. 4. Expanded allogeneic corneal epithelial cell transplants are technically possible and may represent alternative treatment modalities for selected ocular surface problems. 5. These techniques potentially offer a new method of restoring a normal ocular surface while minimizing the threat of damage or depletion to the contralateral or sibling limbal corneal epithelial stem cells. 6. The rabbit model was probably incomplete and should be interpreted with caution. The complete eradication of all corneal epithelial stem cells from any eye is difficult, making confirmation of such work challenging. 7. The results of the rabbit model suggest that allogeneic grafts may restore a nearly normal ocular epithelial surface to certain ocular surface injuries...|$|R
