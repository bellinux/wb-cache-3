5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} <b>Lewis</b> acid and combines with <b>Lewis</b> bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as <b>Lewis</b> acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral <b>Lewis</b> acid known.|$|E

Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E

Forman is taken into custody. Later, <b>Lewis</b> still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. <b>Lewis,</b> determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
