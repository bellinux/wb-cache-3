5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century {{who could afford}} the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E

25|$|Pisces Austrinus {{originated}} with the Babylonian constellation simply {{known as the}} Fish (MUL.KU).

25|$|Ara {{is one of}} {{the southernmost}} constellations {{depicted}} by Ptolemy. It had been recorded by Aratus in 270 BCE as lying close to the horizon, and the Almagest portrays stars as far south as Gamma Arae.

25|$|England {{had lost}} four wickets for six runs, and were 31 for 4 with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen survived what <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> edge {{on the first}} ball he faced, {{and went on to}} make 20 before he was given out in a similar {{situation}} from Shane Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell took England's lead past 150, and with Bell having batted past the hour mark, he needed 29 more for his half-century when he gave a tiny edge to Gilchrist.|$|E
25|$|Before filming started, some of {{the actors}} had to undergo various {{training}} exercises for their roles. Dillahunt, Lindhome, and Aaron Paul—the latter portrays Francis—had {{to take part in}} gun training, while Sara Paxton had to get up each morning for swimming lessons so that she <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> experienced swimmer. Iliadis also spent several weeks with the actors in rehearsal. It was Iliadis's hope that space to rehearse their roles, and then time during filming to develop their characters individually, would help them to trust Iliadis as the director more.|$|E
25|$|Between 1951 and 1969, {{a limited}} number of O gauge train sets were {{manufactured}} in the Soviet Union. Utilizing the same track and voltage as their U.S. counterparts, the colorful locomotives and cars resembled pre-World War II designs from U.S. manufacturers Lionel and American Flyer and the couplers were nearly identical to those of pre-war American Flyer. Some differences in U.S. and Soviet railroading were evident from comparing the Soviet sets with U.S. sets, particularly {{in the design of the}} boxcar, which <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> American Flyer boxcar with windows added, reflecting the Soviets' use of box cars to haul livestock, as well as merchandise.|$|E

25|$|Following the Nazi {{invasion}} of Poland in World War II, the New Cemetery {{was closed to}} outsiders and the Germans sold the most valuable stonework to local masons. Other headstones, as well as slabs, were turned into construction material and used for paving the supply road to the camp, including the courtyard of commandant Amon Göth, {{who is known for}} having insisted that the Jews pay for their own executions. Meanwhile, the old bones at the cemetery were often left uncovered and scattered around in what <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> open-pit mine. Caretaker Pina Ladner, who used to live on premises, was sent to Płaszów beforehand, and shot.|$|E
25|$|As the Scots {{advanced}} {{towards the}} Norwegians, the saga indicates that Ogmund withdrew his {{troops from the}} mound to avoid being cut off from his comrades on the beach below. If the Scots had indeed marched northwards, their advance would have threatened to {{drive a wedge between}} the Norwegians on the mound and those on beach. Once the Scottish vanguard came into contact with Ogmund's men, the saga indicates that his orderly withdrawal disintegrated into a chaotic scramble. On the beach below, Haakon followed the advice of his men and retired to the safety of his ships. To the men on the beach, the rapid descent of Ogmund's men towards them <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> all-out retreat; they turned and fled. The Norwegian army was thus routed, and in the mad dash back to their ships they suffered substantial casualties. Some of the Norwegians may have used the beached vessels as makeshift fortifications, since the saga notes that a group of them made a valiant stand by their ships, out-numbered ten to one, in a fierce engagement in which a particularly valiant Scottish knight was slain. This entry confirms {{that at least some of}} the Scottish knights present were able to engage their foes on horseback.|$|E

500|$|Reeve Robert Williams {{suggested}} {{ferns and}} flowers indigenous to British Columbia {{would be brought}} in, and planted around the statue. Williams insisted the flora would not obscure anatomy. Township Council voted to place the statue in a [...] "suitable place" [...] in the yet-to-be-opened municipal offices.

500|$|Nevertheless, Greeley's {{effectiveness}} as {{a reformer}} was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he [...] "must have <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> apparition, {{a man of}} eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat {{that made him look}} like a farmer who came into town for supplies". [...] Van Deusen wrote, [...] "Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics.

[...] By October 2007 {{all that was left}} was [...] "an empty lot dotted with weeds and crushed bricks".
