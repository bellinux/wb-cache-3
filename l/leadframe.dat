5000|$|A person upon first {{seeing a}} ball bonder will usually compare its {{operation}} {{to that of}} a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the capillary, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire {{at the tip of the}} capillary. The tip of the wire forms into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125°C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip - which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called ball bond that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the [...] "purple plague" [...] - a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound - sometimes associated with pure gold bonding wire. This property makes aluminum ideal for ultrasonic bonding.) Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the <b>leadframe).</b> The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the <b>leadframe</b> and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver - but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the wedge bond, tail bond, or simply as the second bond.|$|E

However, most of the studies on the problems of the springback of sheet metals are based on wide strips. In the present study, a special cantilever-type forming jig has been designed to investigate the springback of narrow strips of steel and copper alloy at various die radii, die angles and die gaps. This forming jig is equipped with an advanced on-line automated imaging system to measure the springback angle of the strips. The springback was found to increase with increase of the die radius, the die angle and the die gap. Significant anisotropy in the sheet materials led to different springback behaviours for different sheet orientations.

40|$|A typical {{electroplating}} {{production line}} for the deposition of silver pattern on copper <b>leadframes</b> in the semiconductor industry involves twenty to twenty five steps of cleaning, pickling, plating, stripping etc. This complex production process occupies large floor space and has also {{a number of problems}} such as difficulty in the production of rubber masks and alignment, generation of toxic fumes, high cost of water consumption and sometimes uncertainty on the cleanliness of the surfaces to be plated. A novel laser patterning process is proposed in this paper which can replace many steps in the existing electroplating line. The proposed process involves the application of high speed laser etching techniques on <b>leadframes</b> which were protected with polymer coating. The desired pattern for silver electroplating is produced by laser ablation of the polymer coating. Excimer laser was found to be most effective for this process as it can expose a pattern of clean copper substrate which can be silver plated successfully.

40|$|Wire bonding failures, {{including}} non-stick on die pad (bond-off) and smash ball of {{the first}} bond, are often encountered in manufacturing of miniaturized packages with increased feature density and higher UPH requirement. Many researches have been conducted with an attempt to solve these issues. However, these studies mainly focused on the correlations between bonding pad qualities and robust ball bonding solutions. Few of them investigated these failures from a mechanical point of view, such as deflection of <b>leadframe</b> under vertical bonding force.

40|$|Small outline {{transistor}} (SOT) packages, {{because of}} their low cost and low profile, are widely used in consumer electronics. Ni/Fe alloy (A 42) is {{the most widely used}} <b>leadframe</b> material of SOT packages because of its good formability and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) match with silicon die. The very small size of SOT packages allow a higher package density on a board, but the small size and close proximity of SOT packages make thermal management difficult. The low thermal conductivity of A 42, which is less than one tenth of that of copper, makes the thermal conduction even more difficult. Thus, the method of copper plating on A 42 <b>leadframe</b> is used to enhance the thermal conductivity of SOT packages while keeping their low cost and good CTE match between <b>leadframe</b> and silicon die. In this paper, the junction temperature T-j, the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance theta(j-a) and the junction-to-solder joint thermal resistance theta(j-sp) are used to evaluate the heat dissipating ability of the package. The finite element method is applied to study the influence of copper plating thickness on the thermal performance of a SOT package. A thermal resistance circuit model and the corresponding thermal resistance expression on function of the copper plating thickness are then proposed to quantify the influence of copper plating thickness. The proposed expression, which follows a hyperbolic form, can well predict thermal resistance of the model. Finally, die cracking issue of the SOT packages with copper <b>leadframe</b> is examined and the residual stress on silicon die after die bonding process is studied. By comparing the cracking pattern and the stress state, shear fracture is proposed to be the crack initiation mechanism. Results also show that copper plating on A 42 <b>leadframe</b> has little influence on the distribution of the thermal residual stress in the die. The stress level for the SOT package with copper plated A 42 <b>leadframe</b> is much lower than that with copper <b>leadframe,</b> which makes the die cracking risk much lower...|$|E

Copper (Cu) {{wire bonding}} on the {{pre-plated}} leadframes with Ni/Pd/AuAg plating {{has been applied}} extensively in the semiconductor industry for the interconnection of integrated-circuit (IC) packaging due to the lower material cost of Cu and its excellent electrical properties. Furthermore, the Cu wire bonding on the preplated <b>leadframe</b> has advantages, such as the tin whisker prevention and the robust package for automotive application. Nevertheless, a stitch bondability of Cu wire-preplated <b>leadframe</b> is facing several challenges, such as the Cu oxidation, the high hardness of Cu wire and the very thin AuAg plating on the leadframes. This paper discusses the effect of AuAg plating thickness in roughened pre-plated <b>leadframe</b> on the stitch bonding of Cu wires with the <b>leadframe.</b> The stitch bonding integrity was assessed using Dage 4000 shear/pull tool at a key wire bond responses of stitch pull at time zero (T 0).

FESEM images of the stitch bonding between the Cu wires and the pre-plated leadframes of different AuAg plating thickness did not show any defect in microstructures, thus it suggests that the bonding property is determined by diffusion mechanism at the Cu wire/AuAg stitch bonding interface.

40|$|Au/Pd/Ni {{pre-plated}} <b>leadframes</b> (PPF) {{are high}} performance frames for accommodating high-end electronic packages. Cost and reliability are major concerns in their wide application. The present work, from a materials science point view, deepens {{the understanding of}} PPFs, optimizes the conventional PPFs, develops a novel PPF architecture and models the residual stress relaxation in heteroepitaxial thin films. The wire pull test, the solderability test, and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to characterize the PPFs {{in order to understand}} the relationship between performance and microstructure. We optimized the electroplating profiles and determined the minimum thickness of the Pd layer with the PPF performance satisfying the industry standards. Further increasing the Pd layer thickness beyond the critical thickness will not enhance the performance more, but increase the product cost. With the optimized electroplating profile, the electroplated Au layer is epitaxially deposited on the Pd layer, and so does the Pd layer on the Ni layer. Misfit dislocations and nanotwins are present at the interface between the Pd and Ni layers, which are generated to release the about 10. 4 % misfit strain between the Pd and Ni lattices. This work demonstrates that the electro-deposition technique can electroplate epitaxy-like Pd films on the highly (200) textured Ni films, which are grown on the Cu substrates. A novel technique for impeding Cu out-diffusion in Cu alloy based pre-plated <b>leadframes</b> was developed by electroplating a 3 - 4 nm thick Sn layer on a Cu alloy base prior to electroplating a Ni layer. A 10 - 14 nm thick epitaxy-like and dense (Cu,Ni) 3 Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) layer is automatically formed en route of diffuse reaction, which leads to a drastic reduction in Cu out-diffusion and hence improves significantly the protection of the <b>leadframes</b> against oxidation and corrosion attack. The oxidation behaviours were quantified by Electron Diffraction X-ray (EDX) incorporated in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in the present work, which is a good complementary to the traditional weight gain test by a balance. A diffusion/oxidation model was developed to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient of Cu in the formed IMC nanolayers. The estimated Cu diffusion coefficient in the IMC interlayer is about 1. 6 x 10 - 22 m 2 / s at 250 °C, which is around 7 ~ 11 orders lower than the interdiffusion coefficients for η-Cu 6 Sn 5 and ε-Cu 3 Sn phases at corresponding temperatures. Based on the dislocation theory of twinning, analytical solutions by using the hybrid superposition and Fourier transformation approach were derived for the calculation of various energies involved in the misfit twinning process. For a given epilayer thickness and lattice mismatch strain, the twin formation energy should reach its minimum to determine the twin width and a zero minimum formation energy determines the critical thickness for misfit twinning. The effect of elastic mismatch between the epilayer and the substrate on the critical thickness was studied comprehensively, revealing that an elastically soft epilayer has a large critical thickness. Moreover, a misfit-twin-and-perfect-dislocation predominance chart is constructed to predict the predominant regions of misfit twinning and perfect dislocation in the mismatch strain and the specific twin boundary energy domain. Multiple misfit twins in epilayer/substrate systems were studied by summing up the stress and displacement fields of individual twins. In principle, the energy minimization approach can be applied to multiple misfit twins, although only periodic arrays of parallel and alternating twins were investigated here in detail. The equilibrium twin width and equilibrium twin spacing of a periodic array of twins represent the misfit twin morphology. The theoretical results indicate that the difference in elastic constants between an epilayer and its substrate has great effects on the morphology of equilibrium twins. The theoretical predictions agree with experimental observations...|$|R
