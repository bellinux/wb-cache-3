25|$|Primase adds RNA primers {{onto the}} lagging strand, which allows {{synthesis}} of Okazaki fragments from 5' to 3'. However, primase creates RNA primers {{at a much}} lower rate than that at which DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA on the <b>leading</b> <b>strand.</b> DNA polymerase on the lagging strand also has to be continually recycled to construct Okazaki fragments following RNA primers. This makes the speed of lagging strand synthesis much lower than that of the <b>leading</b> <b>strand.</b> To solve this, primase acts as a temporary stop signal, briefly halting the progression of the replication fork during DNA replication. This molecular process prevents the <b>leading</b> <b>strand</b> from overtaking the lagging strand.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} {{the best known of}} these {{mechanisms}} and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, primase adds RNA primers to the template strands. The <b>leading</b> <b>strand</b> receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand receives several. The <b>leading</b> <b>strand</b> is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high processivity, while the lagging strand is extended discontinuously from each primer forming Okazaki fragments. RNase removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the <b>leading</b> <b>strand</b> and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. Ligase works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} causes of {{bacterial}} chro-mosome asymmetry is replication-associated mutational pressure. Different rates of nucleotide substitution accu-mulation on <b>leading</b> and lagging <b>strands</b> implicate quali-tative and quantitative differences in the accumulation of mutations in protein coding sequences lying on different DNA strands. We show that the divergence rate of or-thologs situated on <b>leading</b> <b>strands</b> {{is lower than the}} di-vergence rate of those situated on lagging strands. The ratio of the mutation accumulation rate for sequences lying on lagging strands to that of sequences lying on <b>leading</b> <b>strands</b> is rather stable and time-independent. The divergence rate of sequences which changed their positions, with respect to the direction of replication fork movement, is not stable—sequences which have recently changed their positions are the most prone to mutation accumulation. This effect may influence estimations of evolutionary distances between species and the topology of phylogenetic trees...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe studied {{nucleotide}} usage biases in 4 -fold degenerated {{sites of}} all the genes from <b>leading</b> and lagging <b>strands</b> of 30 bacterial genomes. The level of guanine in 4 -fold degenerated sites (G 4 f) is significantly lower in genes from lagging strands than in genes from <b>leading</b> <b>strands,</b> probably because of the faster rates of guanine oxidation in single-stranded DNA leading to G to T transversions. The rates of cytosine deamination causing C to T transitions are also higher in lagging strands. We showed {{that the level of}} codons able to form stop-codons by the way of G to T transversions and C to T transitions is always higher than the level of codons able to form stop-codons by the way of C to A transversions and G to A transitions. This circumstance can be an explanation of the lower percent of ORFs in lagging strands of bacterial replichores than in <b>leading</b> <b>strands...</b>|$|R
25|$|PCNA fully encircles the DNA {{template}} strand {{and must be}} loaded onto DNA at the replication fork. At the <b>leading</b> <b>strand,</b> loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the <b>leading</b> <b>strand</b> is continuous until replication is terminated.

This constant initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis requires repeated PCNA loading for efficient DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of {{eukaryotic}} DNA replication is {{the first}} stage of DNA synthesis where the DNA double helix is unwound and an initial priming event by DNA polymerase α occurs on the <b>leading</b> <b>strand.</b> The priming event on the lagging strand establishes a replication fork.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{simian virus}} 40 minireplicons containing uniquely placed cis,syn-thymine dimers (T T) {{for the analysis}} of leading- and lagging-strand bypass replication. Assaying for replication in a human cell-free extract through the analysis of full-size labeled product molecules and restriction fragments spanning the T T site resulted in the following findings: (i) The primary site of synthesis blockage with T T in either the <b>leading</b> or lagging <b>strand</b> was one nucleotide before the lesion. (ii) Replicative bypass of T T was detected in both <b>leading</b> and lagging <b>strands.</b> The efficiency of synthesis past T T was 22 % for leading-strand T T and 13 % for lagging-strand T T. (iii) The lagging-strand T T resulted in blocked retrograde synthesis with the replication fork proceeding past the lesion, resulting in daughter molecules containing small gaps (form II' DNA). (iv) With T T in the leading-strand template, both the <b>leading</b> and lagging <b>strands</b> were blocked, representing a stalled replication fork. Uncoupling of the concerted synthesis of the two strands of the replication fork was observed, resulting in preferential elongation of the undamaged lagging strand. These data support a model of selective reinitiation downstream from the lesion on lagging strands due to Okazaki synthesis, with no reinitiation close to the damage site on <b>leading</b> <b>strands</b> [Meneghini, R. & Hanawalt, P.

25|$|Although {{synthesis}} of the lagging strand involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing Okazaki fragments is about twice that required to synthesize the <b>leading</b> <b>strand.</b> Even in small species such as yeast, Okazaki fragment maturation happens approximately a million times during a single round of DNA replication. Processing of Okazaki fragments is therefore very common and crucial for DNA replication and cell proliferation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{scrutiny}} {{that has been}} directed for years at the yeast genome, relatively {{little is known about}} the impact of replication on the substitution dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30 % between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. In addition, we found a mutational asymmetry associated with the polarity of replication resulting in higher rates of substitutions toward C and A than toward G and T in <b>leading</b> <b>strands</b> (reciprocally more substitutions toward G and T in lagging strands). Such mutational asymmetries applied over long evolutionary periods should generate compositional skews between the two DNA strands. Thus, we show that the <b>leading</b> replicating <b>strands</b> present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands). We also show that the nucleotide frequencies at mutational equilibrium predict a compositional skew at equilibrium very close to the observed skew between <b>leading</b> and lagging <b>strands,</b> suggesting that compositional equilibrium has been nearly attained in the present day genome of S. cerevisiae. Surprisingly, the direction of this skew is inverted compared with the one in the human genome...|$|R

25|$|DNA is {{synthesised}} from 5' to 3', so when copying the 3' to 5' strand, replication is continuous. Phosphodiester links form {{between the}} 3' to 5' and nucleotides {{can be added}} {{with the aid of}} the enzyme DNA polymerase for the continuous <b>leading</b> <b>strand.</b> However, in order to synthesise the lagging strand (the 5' to 3' strand) synthesis must occur in small sections (100-200 nucleotides at a time in eukaryotes). These new stretches of DNA are called Okazaki fragments and each one requires its own RNA primer.|$|E
25|$|Further {{optimization}} can {{be achieved}} by designing oligos that target the lagging strand in DNA replication because targeting the lagging strand results in a higher frequency of recombinants. In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction. This discontinuous synthesis results in the lagging strand being more exposed which allows for easier beta-mediated annealing of the oligo to the target DNA than when compared to annealing to the <b>leading</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face {{another issue}} that is not seen in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the <b>leading</b> <b>strand</b> can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E

Before the genome era, many evolutionary processes were evaluated from limited data sets and evolutionary models were constructed {{on the basis of}} small amounts of evidence. In this paper, I show that genes on the Borrelia burgdorferi genome have two separate, distinct, and significantly different codon usages, depending on whether the gene is transcribed on the <b>leading</b> or lagging <b>strand</b> of replication. Asymmetrical replication is the major source of codon usage variation. Replicational selection is responsible for the higher number of genes on the <b>leading</b> <b>strands,</b> and transcriptional selection appears to be responsible for the enrichment of highly expressed genes on these strands. Replicational–transcriptional selection, therefore, has an influence on the codon usage of a gene. This is a new paradigm of codon selection in prokaryotes...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{replication}} of mini-chromosomes {{in the absence}} of DNA ligase activity resulted in replication products with single-strand breaks at specific sites.

The primer recognition complex, RF-C. PCNA. ATP, stimulated pol delta activity in cooperation with RF-A, but also functioned to prevent abnormal initiation of DNA synthesis by polymerase alpha.
