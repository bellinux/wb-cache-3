5|$|Clark Kent (Tom Welling) {{sits in his}} loft {{holding a}} piece of coal, waiting for Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) to arrive. He then takes her to the Kawatche Caves, where they are transported to the Fortress of Solitude. Lana is in shock as she <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the Fortress. Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{playing at}} the Luxury Lounge when Christopher <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the swag is [...] "Welcome to New York City" [...] by Camron, from the True Crime: New York Citys intro, briefly shown in the TV.|$|E

50|$|Zoot's {{claim to}} fame was playing the final off-key note to the end theme of the show; he then looks into his {{saxophone}} with a bewildered expression, checks his music, gives a satisfied nod, <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the other musicians and gives the same nod. The note played is the lowest note on the baritone saxophone and most of Zoot's other playing has {{the sound of a}} tenor saxophone while his instrument appears to be an alto saxophone.|$|E
5000|$|Alienation: In the {{transitions}} from {{first person to}} third person, Atwood demonstrates Marian's growing alienation from her body. At the company Christmas party, Marian <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the other women, thinking [...] "You were green and then you ripened: became mature. Dresses for the mature figure. In other words, fat." [...] Marian refuses to become likewise, which would transform her into a woman and as such be constrained by a sexist culture. Marian is, therefore, alienated from nature as she places herself outside the process of maturation.|$|E

The two men sit and drink and Tully <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> all the people immediately around him, all of whom now seem at an impassable distance. Munger says he needs to leave, but Tully asks him to stay and talk a while. Munger agrees, {{and the two men}} sit drinking their coffee together in silence.|$|E
50|$|In the plaza, Claire <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the crowd, {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} couples including {{parents and their}} children; depressed, she laments to Peter about the bad things she feels she has done and the people she feels she hurt because of her powers, and that meeting Peter {{was the only thing}} that gave her some sense of belonging; Peter comforts Claire and tells her that he shared a similar feeling upon meeting her. Claire then sees three familiar faces heading toward them: Mr. Bennet, Ted, and Matt Parkman. She runs to her adoptive father and hugs him. As Peter acknowledges Matt and Ted, his hands begin to glow.|$|E

5000|$|He {{asks the}} people [...] "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: {{to do good}} or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" [...] (...) They do not answer and he angrily <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the crowd and is [...] "distressed at their {{stubborn}} hearts" [...] (...) [...] Methodist founder John Wesley suggested that his adversaries were already seeking occasion to kill him. He tells the man to put out his hand which he does and then, seemingly instantaneously, it is healed. Many other stories of healing at the time involved the healer doing work {{in some way to}} effect a cure as compared to this quick almost effortless action here. Mark could be highlighting how great he viewed Jesus' powers as being. Jesus also equates not doing good with doing evil and says it is more important, even or perhaps especially, to not let evil and suffering occur through inaction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Gaze following, {{the ability}} to {{redirect}} one’s visual at- tention {{to look at what}} another person is seeing, is foundational for imitation, word learning, and theory-of-mind. Previous theories have suggested that the development of gaze following in human infants {{is the product of a}} basic gaze following mechanism, plus the gradual incorporation of several distinct new mechanisms that im- prove the skill, such as spatial inference, and {{the ability to}} use eye direction information as well as head direction. In this paper, we offer an alternative explanation based on a single learning mecha- nism. From a starting state with no knowledge of the implications of another organism’s gaze direction, our model learns to follow gaze by being placed in a simulated environment where an adult caregiver <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> objects. Our infant model matches the development of gaze following in human infants as measured in key experiments that we replicate and analyze in detail...|$|E
