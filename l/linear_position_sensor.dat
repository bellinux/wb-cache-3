40|$|A new <b>linear</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (Micrus) {{has been}} developed, {{based on the}} transmis-sion of {{ultrasonic}} signals in a waveguide. Waves are generated at the cursor position by the magnetostrictive e®ect, and their times of °ight {{to the ends of}} the waveguide are used to estimate the position of the mobile element. The choice of the generat-ing/transmitting metal for this kind of sensor is discussed. We have found that the magnetic hysteresis inherent to the magnetostrictive phenomenon translates into measurement hysteresis, a®ecting the performance of the sensor. An explanation of the link between both e®ects is given, and a compensation technique based in focusing the ultrasonic generation is o®ered. This compensation technique is tested using an electromagnetic ¯nite element method program and then empirically in the Micrus sensor, with satisfactory results.

40|$|An optical {{alignment}} mirror mechanism (AMM) {{has been}} developed with angular positioning accuracy of +/- 0. 2 arcsec. This requires the mirror s linear positioning actuators to have positioning resolutions of +/- 112 nm to enable the mirror to meet the angular tip/tilt accuracy requirement. Demonstrated capabilities are 0. 1 arc-sec angular mirror positioning accuracy, which translates into linear positioning resolutions at the actuator of 50 nm. The mechanism consists of a structure with sets of cross-directional flexures that enable the mirror s tip and tilt motion, a mirror with its kinematic mount, and two linear actuators. An actuator comprises a brushless DC motor, a linear ball screw, and a piezoelectric brake that holds the mirror s position while the unit is unpowered.

The LHC collimators are equipped with high-precision <b>linear</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors,</b> the <b>linear</b> variable differential transformers (LVDTs).

The aim of the system is to make the suspension work around its optimal operating point, so that the safety and comfort of the vehicle can be improved. In fact, variations of the load carried by the vehicle determine a change of the suspension spring compression that moves the operating point away from the optimal value. Spring compression can also be changed by varying the suspension preload.

40|$|A second-generation, Stirling-cycle {{cryocooler}} (cryogenic refrigerator) {{for space}} applications, with a cooling capacity of 5 watts at 65 K, was recently completed. The refrigerator, called the Prototype Model, was designed {{with a goal}} of 5 year life with no degradation in cooling performance. The free displacer and free piston of the refrigerator are driven directly by moving-magnet linear motors with the moving elements supported by active magnetic bearings. The use of clearance seals {{and the absence of}} outgassing material in the working volume of the refrigerator enable long-life operation with no deterioration in performance. Fiber-optic sensors detect the radial position of the shafts and provide a control signal for the magnetic bearings. The frequency, phase, stroke, and offset of the compressor and expander are controlled by signals from precision <b>linear</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> (LVDTs). The vibration generated by the compressor and expander is cancelled by an active counter balance which also uses a moving-magnet linear motor and magnetic bearings. The driving signal for the counter balance is derived from the compressor and expander <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> which have wide bandwidth for suppression of harmonic vibrations. The efficiency of the three active members, which operate in a resonant mode, is enhanced by a magnetic spring in the expander and by gas springs in the compressor and counterbalance.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{measurement}} technique based on local strain measurements to perform real-time {{reconstruction of the}} overall structural deformation and the distributed stress field produced by {{the impact of a}} body on a water free surface. In particular, we seek establishing a measurement chain capable of acquiring and elaborating the signals at high frequency, {{so that it can be}} utilized to study rapidly varying strain fields, such as those occurring in impulsive events. Fiber Bragg gratings are utilized to sense the local structural deformation. Experiments are conducted on flexible plastic wedges with variable deadrise angles impacting on a quiescent fluid surface. The experimental tests are performed in free fall and we explore variations of the entry velocity by varying the drop height. The structural deformation is reconstructed from point-wise strain measurements utilizing a modal reconstruction methodology. The impact dynamics are analysed through accelerometers and <b>linear</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors.</b> Results show that the impact behaviour of the flexible body is characterized by a main overall deformation where the structure is distorted in the direction of the loading, whereby marked vibrations, whose amplitude increase with the entry velocity, dominate the dynamic response. The influence of the mode shapes considered in the present analysis on the accuracy of the results is also observed. The proposed methodology allows for a fairly high acquisition frequency, which translates into a real-time structural reconstruction technique. Results show that the proposed methodology can be a valuable tool for the live monitoring of structures undergoing impact events...|$|R

40|$|For good crop emergence, {{the seed}} {{should be placed}} at a depth where good {{conditions}} concerning oxygen, temperature and water are provided. To place the seed in the soil, some type of see d coulter is used. Väderstad-Verkens Rapid is a seed drill that places the seed at a certain depth {{in relation to a}} wheel running on the ground. This can lead to a to shallow seed placement. On fields with clayey soils and spring sown cereals a to shallow seed placement can lead to poor emergence, especially if there is no rainfall after seeding. To improve the ability of the Rapid drill to place the seed in moist soil, Väderstad-Verken has developed a spring-loaded coulter. This coulter, like the ordinary Rapid coulter, is placed beside a disc but it can move up and down approximately 15 mm. The idea is to make a coulter which is adjusted to follow the soil mechanical resistance and place the seed in an environment favorable for germination. The aim of this thesis was to compare the performance of the new spring-loaded coulter with the ordinary Rapid coulter. A field experiment was carried out to investigate seed placement and germination. Oats were sown in the spring with three different coulters, one ordinary Rapid coulter and two spring-loaded coulters with different spring-forces, at three different sowing depths. In another experiment the go al was to study how the spring-loaded coulters were moving during sowing. Two <b>linear</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> were used to measure the movement, one on a coulter with high spring-force and one on a coulter with low spring-force. Three different working speeds and four different sowing depths were used during the test. Compared with the ordinary Rapid coulter the spring-loaded coulters placed a higher proportion of the seeds at a correct depth. Also the plant emergence was better for the spring-loaded coulter. There was little difference in seed placement and plant emergence between the high and low spring-force coulter. The coulter with high spring-force worked deeper and with less standard deviation than the coulter with low spring-force. Both coulters worked more shallow in relation to the disc when the sowing depth or working speed was increased. The standard deviation of the coulter movements was only slightly affected by the sowing depth. The coulter movements were compared with the relief of the seedbed bottom, as measured by a laser. There was no significant relation between the coulter movements and the shape of the seedbed bottom. The advantage of the spring-loaded coulter was that it manages to work deeper than the ordinary Rapid coulter. To make the spring-loaded coulter more able to follow the uneven bottom under the harrowed layer some changes in the design might be necessary. The coulter must be able to move more, especially downwards. The coulter should have longer pivot arm with a low pivot axis and less friction in the suspension joint. Furthermore the spring force should be adjustable. To conclude which is the best design more experiments on different prototypes are necessary...|$|R
