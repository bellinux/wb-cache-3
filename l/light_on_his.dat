5|$|In the meantime, in Washington, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examine {{video footage}} from a {{security}} camera positioned at the Mexican border. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh disbands {{the task force}} searching for Doggett, believing the video is proof that he entered Mexico on his own free will and was not abducted. Meanwhile, Doggett phones a U.S. Marine Corps public affairs office, hoping his Marine tattoo will shed some <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> true identity.

25|$|Fanshawe was {{respected}} {{throughout the}} 48th Division.

Yet his Battle Narrative is inadequate, inaccurate and trite, but it sheds no <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sacking. He left, uncomplainingly, gentlemanly to the end and did not see further active service. Many officers in the 48th Division complained for years about his dishonourable treatment.|$|E
25|$|The Charanavyuha {{authored}} by Shaunaka mentions four upaveda (applied Vedas). Included {{among them are}} archery (dhanurveda) and military sciences (shastrashastra), the mastery {{of which was the}} duty (dharma) of the warrior class. Kings usually belonged to the kshatria (warrior) class and thus served as heads of the army. They typically practiced archery, wrestling, boxing, and swordsmanship as part of their education. Examples include such rulers as Siddhartha Gautama and Rudradaman. The Chinese monk Xuanzang writes that the emperor Harsha was <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet despite his advancing age and managed to dodge and seize an assailant during an assassination attempt.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{feedback}} {{has also}} been studied in relation to visual extinction. Patients were asked to touch a known target in a darkened room. A light attached to the patient’s hand was sometimes briefly illuminated, {{to provide information about}} where the hand was in relation to the target. In some of these trials, a distracting light was also lit, which induced an extinction event in the patient. Although the patient reported in such cases that he had not seen the indicator <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hand, their performance was correspondingly better, similar to the results when visual feedback had been available. Although the patient was not cognizant of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, {{in a manner similar to}} blindsight.|$|E
25|$|According to musicologist Gerald Abraham, the operas on {{the whole}} embody an {{enormous}} mass of music far too beautiful and interesting to be ignored. Moreover, he maintains, Tchaikovsky's search for operatic subjects, along with his views on their nature and treatment and his own work on librettos, throw considerable <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> creative personality. Nevertheless, according to musicologist Francis Maes, most of Tchaikovsky's operas failed for three reasons. First, the composer could not get good librettos, despite continued requests to some of Russia's leading playwrights and his brother Modest. Second, he was no Verdi, Puccini or Leoncavalo. While he could write music that was often beautiful and sometimes very moving, it was generally not as arresting dramatically as anything those three provided. Third, and perhaps most sadly, Tchaikovsky's enthusiasm for opera writing did not match his theatrical sense. Apparently either unaware of this deficiency or unable to curb his excitement long enough to take a cold, {{hard look at the}} true stage-worthiness of a libretto, he seemed destined to repeat his failures.|$|E
25|$|As {{evident from}} {{photographs}} taken {{at various stages}} in his life, Sharaf was obese, but <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet in spite of it, only losing substantial weight {{towards the end of}} his life as an indirect result of advanced diabetes. He was a chain smoker till well into his mid-fifties, and was regarded by many as a sanguine, gregarious, and happy-go-lucky person. He valued his family and often took them along on his various travels. He was a moderate person, with few enemies compared to some members of his family clan. Sharaf had no conflict furthering Egypt's interests including those with Israel by maintaining cordial and polite relations with his Israeli Counterpart in Stockholm, ambassador Mordecay Kidron, who also happened to be his next door neighbor. He also chose, out of the available pictures at his disposal, to have printed in a local Cairo monthly magazine a photograph taken of him welcoming, as doyen of the consular corps, Pope Paul VI to Hong Kong at Kai Tak International Airport in December 1970, reflecting his sense of religious tolerance as a Muslim.|$|E

25|$|Although De Haan's fame waned {{after his}} death, his works have been {{published}} and reprinted in a fairly constant stream. Even under the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, David Koker managed to publish his Brieven uit Jeruzalem ('Letters from Jerusalem') in a little book. In 1949, a committee was founded with the object to publish a collected edition of the poems, which duly followed in 1952. A 'Society Jacob Israël de Haan' furthered other publications: philosophical aphorisms and letters, and a memoir by his sister Mies de Haan. In the 1960s two attempts at a biography were published, and after 1970 an actual De Haan-revival brought with it a flood of publicity. Many of his publications about law and significs have been reprinted, as were his novels, and his earlier prose has been rescued from obscure magazines. Dozens of bibliophile editions honoured his poems and prose sketches. Many magazine articles and other publications about his life were published, and generated heated debates. A large volume of his correspondence (only of the period 1902-1908), published in 1994, shed a bright <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> life, but a full-scale biography {{has yet to be}} written.|$|E
25|$|Above the Sovereign, {{the second}} tier {{contains}} the icons {{of the twelve}} great feasts. There are two large icons above the Royal Door, that divide the three central tiers of the iconostasis into two equal parts. Six icons, related {{to the life of}} Mary, appear {{on the left side of}} the Feasts tier. These icons depict scenes related to Mary. On the far left there is the Nativity of the Theotokos, which has Saint Anne sitting in the center, holding the newborn Mary on her lap. An angel holds a wreath of glory above them, and the Holy Spirit shines in the shape of the Eye of Providence on the top of the composition. The Greek Catholic Church celebrates Mary's birth on September 8. The second icon from the left depicts the Presentation of Mary, celebrated on November 21. This is the feast with which the cathedral was associated. In the painting the child Mary steps forward to Zechariah, the priest of the temple in Jerusalem. The next image illustrates the scene of the Annunciation, when Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary to announce to her that she is conceived with Jesus. Gabriel holds a white lily in his left hand, and points to the sky with his right. The beam of light, coming down from God via the dove of the Holy Spirit onto Mary, symbolizes that the Holy Virgin became pregnant by God himself through the Holy Spirit. The Annunciation is celebrated nine months before the birth of Jesus, on March 25. The next icon depicts the Visitation, when Mary visits her cousin, Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist. Traditionally the icon of the Visitation portrays the two pregnant women, Mary and Elizabeth hugging each other. In Hajdúdorog this scene is quite different: Elizabeth does not even appear in the painting. Mary, on the right, brings two white doves in a basket as gifts to her cousin. The family members introduce the newborn John to her. March 31 is the feast day of the Visitation. The fifth icon on the tier is the flight to Egypt. This is the only scene on the Feasts tier which cannot be associated with any religious feast. Joseph leaves Bethlehem with Mary and Jesus after learning that King Herod wants to massacre all the newborns in Judea. The last icon on the Marian part of the Feasts tier is the Dormition, the death of Mary. The Holy Virgin, in a white shroud, lies in the center of the image. Jesus casts <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mother from Heaven as a symbol of her eternal life and her assumption. The Greek Catholic Church commemorates Mary's death on August 15.|$|E

Years later, Edmond Malone, an important Shakespearean scholar and friend of Johnson's, said that Johnson's [...] "vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> authour than all his predecessors had done", and that the Preface was [...] "the finest composition in our language".

After the race, Espinoza explained how the colt moved: [...] "All the way he was on a high cruising speed. He has such a long stride.
