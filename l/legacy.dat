5|$|The <b>Legacy</b> was a villainous {{alliance}} {{in the professional}} wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), that competed on its Raw brand from 2008 to 2010. Originally, The <b>Legacy</b> was a group led by Randy Orton that contained the tag team of Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase. Two other wrestlers, Manu and Sim Snuka, were affiliated with the faction prior to its official formation. The concept behind the group was that each member was a multi-generational wrestler. The name The <b>Legacy</b> was a reference to their extensive family histories in wrestling.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Families stay {{connected}} over time through the intergenerational transmission of <b>legacies.</b> <b>Legacies</b> help {{family members to}} articulate family identity, learn more about family history, and provide succeeding generations with information about family culture and ethnicity. This qualitative study examines how older mothers transmit family meanings, history, and culture to family members through <b>legacies</b> and how ethnic histories influenced this process. Thirty older Armenian American mothers residing in California were interviewed. A life course perspective provides the overarching framework for analysis. Participants described the <b>legacies</b> they received and those they planned {{to pass on to}} family members. Emphasis was given to those <b>legacies</b> that symbolized connection to family, underscored family cohesion, and accentuated Armenian cultural roots. Individual age, larger historical events, and the gendered construction of family life influenced both the receipt of <b>legacies</b> and those that were passed on to family members. During the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Armenian families were forced to leave their native homeland. Because of these events, Armenian families passed few physical <b>legacies</b> on to family members. <b>Legacies</b> took on other forms such as stories, rituals, family gatherings, religious participation, cooking, and service to others. Women viewed their <b>legacies</b> within the context of motherhood and worked to ensure that certain <b>legacies</b> would be valued and remembered by future generations. Shaped by age, generational position, and ethnic identity, women expressed variation in types of <b>legacies</b> and the ways they planned to share them with family members. Women reported tension when certain <b>legacies</b> lacked meaning for their children (in-law) and grandchildren due to the influences of assimilation, intermarriage, changes in family and paid work patterns, and the characteristics and interests of adult children. A focus on <b>legacies</b> provides a useful lens for understanding how families transmit family identity, culture, and ethnicity to succeeding generations...|$|R

5|$|After Adamle {{stepped down}} as General Manager, Stephanie soon became {{in charge of the}} brand and (reignited her feud) and had altercations with Chris Jericho in the {{following}} weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated). After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head. After a few weeks of feuding, Orton and his alliance, The <b>Legacy,</b> punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon. Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, who is her real-life husband. The rivalry between Orton, The <b>Legacy</b> and The Mcmahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and the <b>Legacy</b> rivalry continued at WrestleMania XXV, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton. The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash. After Backlash McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television.|$|E

40|$|Mega-events {{have become}} more and more a part of modern life, however most impact studies focus on the {{economic}} and tourism benefits and not on underlying intangible <b>legacies,</b> such as social and political implications, of event hosting. This dissertation uses a case study of the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa to analyse the question of how perceptions and interpretations of mega-event <b>legacies</b> change over time, from the bid process, through preparation, the event itself, and postevent reckonings of event <b>legacies.</b> As a wide spectrum of stakeholders were involved in the 2010 World Cup, the conclusions drawn in this dissertation reflect these differences of interestand how their perceptions of the World Cup <b>legacies</b> have changed during the various event phases. A certain trend towards <b>legacies</b> that need to be managed has also become visible. This dissertation shows that the World Cup leaves both positive and negative <b>legacies</b> behind, and, moreover, has had ambiguous and complex implications for actors involved...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings from}} an AHRC funded project. We aimed to co-develop and co-explore how a values-focused approach could help conceptualise and evaluate less ‘tangible' <b>legacies</b> of collaborative research projects funded through the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Connected Communities programme. In doing so, we aimed to help legitimise ways of knowing that are often marginalised by conventional evaluations, and in doing so, reflect the broader <b>legacies</b> of project partners and participants. We found that a values-based approach to understanding the <b>legacies</b> of community-engaged research can:  • Unearth ‘new' <b>legacies</b> and {{a deeper understanding of}} ‘known' <b>legacies</b>  • Enhance existing <b>legacies</b>  • Create confidence to articulate broader and deeper aspects of <b>legacies</b>  • Enhance collaborative working within partnerships The project led to additional benefits for community partners: energising key members of staff and articulating the values of their own organisations. This has also led to being better equipped to negotiate their role in future partnership work. The project has also inspired partners to develop new projects with values approaches at the heart of design and delivery, and led to new research ideas and practices...|$|R

30|$|Accounting for {{shrinking}} grade variances {{and course}} selection also explains the convergence in grades {{for a group}} where we would expect catch up to not occur: <b>legacies.</b> <b>Legacies</b> at Duke start out behind their white non-legacy counterparts (though not {{as far back as}} blacks) with 65 % of the gape removed {{by the end of the}} senior year. Similar major-switching patterns occur for <b>legacies</b> as well, with large shifts away from the natural sciences, engineering, and economics towards humanities and social sciences. The different grading standards across courses <b>legacies</b> and blacks take, coupled with the tighter variances on the grade distributions of upper year courses, accounts for their catch up to their white non-legacy counterparts.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the various and complex <b>legacies</b> of the Iraq War of 2003. In follows {{the trajectory of}} these <b>legacies</b> back to {{the earliest days of}} the US intervention and {{examines the}} extent to which key decisions and errors of judgement on the part ofthe Coalition and the Iraqi political elite have had unexpected and devastating consequences for Iraq today. The chapter documents how the war dramatically altered the lives of ordinary Iraqis and led to many of the most deep-seated and intractable problems facing Iraq, the region and the world today. In discussing these <b>legacies,</b> this chapter also points to the root causes of the rapid turn of events that transpired after the dramatic advance of ISIS in mid- 2014. The argument here being that the Iraq War of 2003 has left behind a sequence of deeply felt but rarely examined <b>legacies</b> and that together these <b>legacies</b> have served as the catalyst of Iraq’s current chaos. Therefore, this chapter is not only timely, but it also addresses a significant lacuna in academic and policy debates by addressing a series of urgent questions concerning the <b>legacies</b> of Iraq...|$|R
40|$|Starting from Values - Evaluating Intangible <b>Legacies</b> was {{a project}} {{funded by the}} Arts and Humanities Research Council. It is one of seven {{projects}} investigating the <b>legacies</b> of the Connected Communities theme. Contributers included: Gemma Burgord, Marie Harder and Louise Dredge.  The work presented in this booklet {{has been carried out}} in the context of research funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), through the Connected Communities theme which focuses on funding and supporting community-engaged research. We set out to explore the following question: ‘what difference have Connected Communities projects made: what are their legacies?’ Community-engaged research tends to be evaluated in research terms. This does not reflect the broader <b>legacies</b> for all partners and participants. ‘Starting from values’ re-sets the balance and provides a mechanism for understanding and valuing different perspectives. It also gives space and a language to articulate less ‘tangible’ aspects of project <b>legacies.</b> A values-based approach to understanding the <b>legacies</b> of community-engaged research can unearth ‘new’ <b>legacies</b> and a deeper understanding of ‘known’ legacies; enhance existing legacies; create confidence to articulate broader and deeper aspects of legacies; and enhance collaborative working within partnerships...|$|R
40|$|New Labour’s {{performance}} in office–as an orchestrator {{of economic and}} social change–is situated against, and evaluated by reference to, two sets of legacies: <b>legacies</b> inherited from the years of Conservative political dominance after 1979; and <b>legacies</b> brought to power by New Labour. The paper argues that the first set of <b>legacies</b> was deep and enduring, and threw a long shadow forward. It argues that the second set of <b>legacies</b> were highly coherent and intellectually informed, but cumulatively involved a diminution in the capacity of the state. The result has been a two-term government that is sufficiently superficially successful to win a third term; but which has yet seriously to transform the <b>legacies</b> it inherited: to our misfortune, and ultimately–in electoral terms–also probably to its own. This paper is based on my study of New Labour’s domestic policy–Prolonged Labour: The Slow Birth of New Labour Britain; I have also co-authored a study of New Labour’s policy towards Iraq–Blair’s War–which was published by Polity Press in 2004...|$|R
