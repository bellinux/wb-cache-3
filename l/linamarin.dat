50|$|<b>Linamarin</b> is a cyanogenic {{glucoside}} {{found in}} the leaves and roots of plants such as cassava, lima beans, and flax. It is a glucoside of acetone cyanohydrin. Upon exposure to enzymes and gut flora in the human intestine, <b>linamarin</b> and its methylated relative lotaustralin can decompose to the toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide; hence food uses of plants that contain significant quantities of <b>linamarin</b> require extensive preparation and detoxification. Ingested and absorbed <b>linamarin</b> is rapidly excreted in the urine and the glucoside itself {{does not appear to}} be acutely toxic. Consumption of cassava products with low levels of <b>linamarin</b> is widespread in the low-land tropics. Ingestion of food prepared from insufficiently processed cassava roots with high <b>linamarin</b> levels has been associated with dietary toxicity, particularly with the upper motor neuron disease known as konzo to the African populations in which it was first described by Trolli and later through the research network initiated by Hans Rosling. However, the toxicity is believed to be induced by ingestion of acetone cyanohydrin, the breakdown product of <b>linamarin.</b> Dietary exposure to <b>linamarin</b> has also been reported as a risk factor in developing glucose intolerance and diabetes, although studies in experimental animals have been inconsistent in reproducing this effect and may indicate that the primary effect is in aggravating existing conditions rather than inducing diabetes on its own.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, whereas its two {{products are}} UDP and <b>linamarin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{generation}} of cyanide from <b>linamarin</b> is usually enzymatic and occurs when <b>linamarin</b> {{is exposed to}} linamarase, an enzyme normally expressed in the cell walls of cassava plants. Because the resulting cyanide derivatives are volatile, processing methods that induce such exposure are common traditional means of cassava preparation; foodstuffs are usually made from cassava after extended blanching, boiling, or fermentation. Food products made from cassava plants include garri (toasted cassava tubers), porridge-like fufu, the dough agbelima, and cassava flour.|$|E
50|$|Lotaustralin is a cyanogenic {{glucoside}} {{found in}} small amounts in Fabaceae Austral Trefoil (Lotus australis), cassava (Manihot esculenta), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), roseroot (Rhodiola rosea) and white clover (Trifolium repens), among other plants. Lotaustralin is the glucoside of methyl ethyl ketone cyanohydrin and is structurally related to <b>linamarin,</b> the acetone cyanohydrin glucoside also found in these plants. Both lotaustralin and <b>linamarin</b> may be hydrolyzed by the enzyme linamarase to form glucose and a precursor to the toxic compound hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
50|$|Cassava tubers contain <b>linamarin,</b> a {{glucoside}} of acetohydrin, and {{the enzyme}} linamarinase for hydrolysing the glucoside. Crushing the tubers releases these compounds and produces acetone cyanohydrin.|$|E
5000|$|Examples include {{amygdalin}} and prunasin {{which are}} made by the bitter almond tree; other species that produce cyanogenic glycosides are sorghum (from which dhurrin, the first cyanogenic glycoside to be identified, was first isolated), barley, flax, white clover, and cassava, which produces <b>linamarin</b> and lotaustralin.|$|E
5000|$|In cassava it {{is found}} in the cell walls. When the plant is chewed or ground, it exposes the enzyme to {{compounds}} like <b>linamarin</b> and lotaustralin which release cyanide compounds that can be lethal to the eater. In humans, chronic toxicity is more likely than death.|$|E

50|$|The cassava {{plant has}} either {{red or green}} {{branches}} with blue spindles on them. The root of the green-branched variant requires treatment to remove <b>linamarin,</b> a cyanogenic glycoside occurring naturally in the plant, which otherwise may be converted into cyanide. Konzo (also called mantakassa) is a paralytic disease associated with several weeks of almost exclusive consumption of insufficiently processed bitter cassava.|$|E
5000|$|Konzo can be {{prevented}} by use of the “wetting method,” [...] {{which is used to}} remove residual cyanogens from cassava flour, as an additional processing method. Cassava flour is placed in a bowl and the level marked {{on the inside of the}} bowl. Water is added with mixing until the height of the wet flour comes up to the mark. The wet flour is placed in a thin layer on a mat for 2 hours in the sun or 5 hours in the shade to allow the escape of hydrogen cyanide produced by the breakdown of <b>linamarin</b> by the enzyme linamarase. The damp flour is then cooked in boiling water in the traditional way to produce a thick porridge called “fufu” or “ugali”, which is flavoured by some means such as a sauce. The wetting method is accepted by rural women because it requires little extra work or equipment and produces fufu which is not bitter, because the bitter tasting <b>linamarin</b> has gone.|$|E
50|$|Cassava, {{like other}} foods, also has antinutritional and toxic factors. Of {{particular}} concern are the cyanogenic glucosides of cassava (<b>linamarin</b> and lotaustralin). On hydrolysis, these release hydrocyanic acid (HCN). The presence of cyanide in cassava {{is of concern}} for human and for animal consumption. The concentration of these antinutritional and unsafe glycosides varies considerably between varieties and also with climatic and cultural conditions. Selection of cassava species to be grown, therefore, is quite important. Once harvested, bitter cassava must be treated and prepared properly prior to human or animal consumption, while sweet cassava can be used after simple boiling.|$|E

50|$|Cassava roots, peels {{and leaves}} {{should not be}} {{consumed}} raw because they contain two cyanogenic glucosides, <b>linamarin</b> and lotaustralin. These are decomposed by linamarase, a naturally occurring enzyme in cassava, liberating hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Cassava varieties are often categorized as either sweet or bitter, signifying the absence or presence of toxic levels of cyanogenic glucosides, respectively. The so-called sweet (actually not bitter) cultivars can produce as little as 20 milligrams of cyanide (CN) per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much (1 g/kg). Cassavas grown during drought are especially high in these toxins. A dose of 25 mg of pure cassava cyanogenic glucoside, which contains 2.5 mg of cyanide, is sufficient to kill a rat. Excess cyanide residue from improper preparation is known to cause acute cyanide intoxication, and goiters, and {{has been linked to}} ataxia (a neurological disorder affecting the ability to walk, also known as konzo). It has also been linked to tropical calcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis.|$|E
5000|$|White clover {{has been}} {{described}} as the most important forage legume of the temperate zones. [...] Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (up to 545 kg N per hectare per year, although usually much less, e.g. about 110 to 170 kg N per hectare per year) in root nodules of white clover obviates synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use for maintaining productivity on much temperate zone pasture land. White clover is commonly grown in mixtures with forage grasses, e.g. perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), [...] Such mixtures can not only optimize livestock production, but can also reduce the bloat risk to livestock that can be associated with excessive white clover in pastures. Such species mixtures also tend to avoid issues that could otherwise be associated with cyanogenic glycoside (<b>linamarin</b> and lotaustralin) intake on pure or nearly pure stands of some white clover varieties. However, problems do not inevitably arise with grazing on monocultures of white clover, and superior ruminant production is sometimes achieved on white clover monocultures managed to optimize sward height. [...] Formononetin and biochanin A play a role in arbuscular mycorrhiza formation on white clover roots, and foliar disease can stimulate production of estrogenic coumestans in white clover. [...] However while {{there have been a few}} reports of phytoestrogenic effects of white clover on grazing ruminants, these have been far less common than such reports regarding some varieties of subterranean and red clover. Among forage plants, some white clover varieties tend to be favored by rather close grazing, because of their stoloniferous habit, which can contribute to competitive advantage. T. repens is also considered as a folk medicine in India against intesinal helminthic worms and an experimental in vivo study validated that the aerial shoots of T. repens bear significant anticestodal properties.|$|E
40|$|Several fungi and bacteria, {{isolated}} from Ugandan domestic fermented cassava, released HCN from <b>linamarin</b> in defined growth media. In 72 h, a Bacillus sp. decreased the <b>linamarin</b> to 1 % of initial concentrations, Mucor racemosus to 7 %, Rhizopus oryzae and R. stolonifer to 30 %, but Neurospora sitophila and Geotrichum candidum hardly degraded the <b>linamarin.</b> Adding pectolytic and cellulolytic enzymes, but not linamarase, to root pieces under aseptic conditions, led to root softening and significantly lower <b>linamarin</b> contents.

40|$|We have {{purified}} cassava (Manihot esculenta) linamarase to apparent homogeneity using {{a simplified}} extraction procedure using low pH phosphate buffer. Three isozymes of cassava linamarase {{were identified in}} leaves based on differences in isoelectric point. The enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing a number of β-glycosides in addition to <b>linamarin.</b> The enzyme is unusually stable and has a temperature optimum of 55 °C. Immunogold labeling studies indicate that linamarase is localized in the cell walls of cassava leaf tissue. Since <b>linamarin</b> must cross the cell wall following synthesis in the leaf for transport to the root, {{it is likely that}} <b>linamarin</b> must cross the cell wall in a nonhydrolyzable form, possibly as the diglucoside, linustatin. In addition, we have quantified the levels of <b>linamarin</b> and linamarase activity in leaves of cassava varieties which differ in the <b>linamarin</b> content of their roots. We observed no substantial differences in the steady state <b>linamarin</b> content or linamarase activity of leaves from high or low (root) cyanogenic varieties. These results indicate that the steady state levels of <b>linamarin</b> and linamarase in leaves of high and low cyanogenic varieties are not correlated with the varietal differences in the steady state levels of <b>linamarin</b> in roots...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>linamarin</b> in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) {{has been}} investigated. Information on the biosynthetic pathway, synthetic sites, translocation and turnover of the cyanoglucoside has been obtained by precursor administrations to {{various parts of}} cassava plants grown under partially controlled conditions in the glasshouse. Three volatile 14 C-labelled precursors of <b>linamarin</b> isobutyronitrile, isobutyraldoxime and 2 -hydroxyisobutyronitrile were prepared, purified and administered to cassava leaves by a new technique in which the leaves were allowed to take up precursor vapour in an enclosed glass chamber. The incorporation of these precursors, and of L-valine administered by solution uptake, was consistent with a pattern of <b>linamarin</b> biosynthesis in cassava involving the reaction sequence through valine, isobutyraldoxime, isobutyronitrile and 2 -hydroxyisobutyronitrile established for other plants. The solution administration of L-[U- 14 C] valine to various organs of the plant indicated that the leaves and the shoot apex synthesised <b>linamarin</b> more efficiently than the woody stem and the roots and tubers. More detailed investigations of leaf biosynthesis showed much higher incorporation of 14 C-valine into <b>linamarin</b> by the petioles and midribs (45 - 62 % 14 C incorporation by petioles and 20 % by midribs) than the leaf blades (2 %). There was no direct relationship between endogenous <b>linamarin</b> content (which was higher in the blades than the petioles) and the apparent ability to synthesise <b>linamarin</b> from exogenous valine. However, the low ability of the blade tissue to incorporate valine into <b>linamarin</b> {{could be due to}} more active competing pathways removing the exogenously administered valine. In further investigations with tuber peels and the edible cores, similar competing pathways have been implicated for an apparently low biosynthetic efficiency of <b>linamarin.</b> The translocation of <b>linamarin</b> was demonstrated by specifically labelling 14 C-linamarin in attached leaves with 2 -hydroxy[1 - 14 C] isobutyronitrile vapour and following the change in labelled <b>linamarin</b> content in the leaf and the distribution of <b>linamarin</b> {{to other parts of the}} plant. In both non-tuberous and tuberous plants there was a rapid loss of 14 C-linamarin due to translocation from the fully expanded leaves up to 69 hours after synthesis. However a residual component of the 14 C-linamarin (25 - 37 % of that initially synthesised) remained in the leaves. A compartmentation of synthesised <b>linamarin</b> in cassava leaf tissues into a readily mobile and partially immobile fraction would account for these observations. In senescing leaves a continuous loss of both 14 C-labelled and endogenous <b>linamarin</b> occurred leaving almost no residual component although this was attributed to both translocation and turnover. Translocated <b>linamarin</b> was distributed to all parts of the plant but the general pattern of translocate flow differed between non-tuberous and tuberous plants. An apical direction of <b>linamarin</b> distribution existed in the non-tuberous plants while tuber-directed <b>linamarin</b> translocation prevailed in the tuberous plants. Leaf senescence apparently enhances <b>linamarin</b> translocation to the tubers. There was little turnover of freshly synthesised 14 C-linamarin in detached leaves and tuber tissues over a period of 1 to 3 days. However the low recoveries of 14 C-linamarin in the whole plant translocation experiments suggest that active turnover may be occurring during translocation or in certain sink tissues...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Cassava is a known {{source of}} <b>linamarin,</b> but {{difficulties}} associated with its isolation have prevented {{it from being}} exploited as a source. A batch adsorption process using activated carbon at the appropriate contact time proved successful in its isolation with ultrafiltration playing {{a pivotal role in}} the purification process. Result revealed that optimum purification was obtained with increasing amount of crude cassava extract (CCE) purified. 60 g of CCE took 32 mins, 80 g, 34 mins while 100 g took 36 mins of contact time, where 1. 7 g, 2. 0 g and 2. 5 g of purified product were obtained, respectively. The purification process in batch mode was also carried out at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 65 oC. Results showed that purification increases with increase in temperature. In a bid to ascertain the moles of <b>linamarin</b> adsorbed per pore volume of activated carbon used, the composite isotherm was found to represent the measured adsorption data quite well. The adsorption of <b>linamarin</b> was used to study the goodness of fit criteria (R 2) for the entire process. Results showed that R 2 value was best with decreasing amount of CCE purified (R 2 = 1 for 60 g) at the temperature of 45 oC. Compound elucidation of purified product by Picrate paper test, IR and 1 HNMR confirmed the structure of <b>linamarin.</b> Cytotoxic effects of <b>linamarin</b> on MCF- 7, HT- 29, and HL- 60 cells were determined using the 3 - (4, 5 – dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) – 2, 5 – diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cytotoxic effects were significantly increased in the presence of linamarase, which catalysed the hydrolysis of <b>linamarin</b> to hydrogen cyanide. A 10 –fold decrease in the IC 50 values obtained for <b>linamarin</b> or crude extract in the presence of linamarase was determined for HL- 60 cells. This study thus describes a method for the isolation and purification of <b>linamarin</b> from cassava, as well as the potential of this compound as an anticancer agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>linamarin</b> [2 (β-d-glucopyranosyloxy) isobutyronitrile] {{was investigated}} in male albino Wistar rats and using rat liver microsomal preparations. In the in vitro experiments incubations of varying concentrations of <b>linamarin</b> at pH 6. 0 – 6. 5 with liver microsomal preparations resulted in rapid degradation of the substrate without concomitant production of any detectable amount of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or of thiocyanate, its detoxication derivative.

In the in vivo experiments excretion of glucosidic cyanide (<b>linamarin)</b> in rat urine was found, within the range of applied oral doses 10 – 350 mg/kg body weight, to be dose dependent. Urinary excretion of HCN and thiocyanate did not show this correlation.

The effect of crude water extract of cassava leaf and that of commercial <b>linamarin</b> was investigated on two human tumor cell lines Caov- 3 (ovarian), and HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma) in vitro, using the MTT- assay for cell growth inhibition/cytotoxicity. The effect of the enzyme linamarase (EC 3. 2. 1. 21), a β-glucosidase also tapped from the cassava plant and treated appropriately was tested {{on one of the}} cell lines. Crude water extract or commercial <b>linamarin</b> was added in a final concentration of 300 µg/ml with or without the partially purified enzyme (10 % added of total cell volume and culture medium) to the seeded cells. The water extract was more efficacious, eliciting an IC 50 value of 38 µg/ ml and 57 µg/ml, respectively, for the ovarian and cervical cell lines, while the commercial <b>linamarin</b> shows a growth inhibition of 150 and 210 µg/ml, respectively, for the two cell lines. Inclusion of the enzyme on a <b>linamarin</b> treated cervical cell line improved the growth inhibition to 40 µg/ml. The antineoplastic effect exhibited by the two samples containing the cyanogenic glucoside is explained in terms of the activity of endogenous/exogenous linamarase, presence of dietary factors in the crude extract, and a possibly induced bystander effect. Tumors are unlikely to develop any resistance against hydrocyanic acid, due to its inhibitory role in oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, an inbuilt mechanism in vivo ensures detoxification of excess cyanide that may seep to the surrounding normal tissues. Thus properly administered by increasing the prodrug concentration at the tumor site and decreasing its systemic level, treatment of cancer using the relatively non-toxic <b>linamarin,</b> with or without the enzyme, linamarase could be a favoured future treatment for a variety of cancers...|$|E
