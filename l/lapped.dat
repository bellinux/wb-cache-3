5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was <b>lapped</b> by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.|$|E

5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all <b>lapped</b> traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns to pit lane, allowing the drivers to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart.|$|E
5000|$|... 100 <b>Laps</b> — 50 <b>Laps,</b> 20 <b>Laps,</b> 20 <b>Laps,</b> 10 Green Flag <b>Laps</b> (2009-2011) ...|$|R
25|$|At the restart on <b>lap</b> 24, Kurt Busch led {{the field}} to the green flag. Brian Vickers passed Kurt Busch for the lead on <b>lap</b> 26. Vickers led for three <b>laps,</b> until <b>lap</b> 29, when Hamlin passed Vickers for the lead. One <b>lap</b> later, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. passed Hamlin. Michael Waltrip passed Earnhardt and claimed the lead a <b>lap</b> later on <b>lap</b> 31. Two <b>laps</b> later, on <b>lap</b> 33, A. J. Allmendinger passed Waltrip, but on the next <b>lap</b> Waltrip {{reclaimed}} the lead. On <b>lap</b> 38, Jimmie Johnson passed Waltrip for the lead, but on <b>lap</b> 39, with a push from Vickers, Earnhardt passed Johnson. On <b>lap</b> 42, Jeff Burton passed Earnhardt, but Earnhardt repassed him on the next <b>lap.</b> On the next <b>lap,</b> Kyle Busch passed Earnhardt Jr. for the lead, but Busch led only one <b>lap</b> until Earnhardt passed him. On <b>lap</b> 46, Kurt Busch passed Earnhardt for the lead. Two <b>laps</b> later, Brad Keselowski passed Busch for the lead. On <b>lap</b> 50, David Ragan passed Keselowski for the lead, but he led only one <b>lap</b> until Jeff Burton passed him.|$|R
25|$|Ragan led eight <b>laps</b> until Sam Hornish, Jr. passed him. On <b>lap</b> 60, Kyle Busch passed Hornish Jr. for the lead. Two <b>laps</b> later Brian Vickers passed Busch to lead. On <b>lap</b> 64, Jimmie Johnson passed Vickers to {{lead his}} first <b>lap</b> of the day. A <b>lap</b> later, Burton passed Johnson for the lead. <b>Laps</b> 65 and 66 saw the field cycle through green flag pit stops. On <b>lap</b> 66, Denny Hamlin moved into the lead. One <b>lap</b> later, Johnson retook the lead. On <b>lap</b> 68, Jeff Gordon passed Johnson for the lead, but a <b>lap</b> later Johnson {{reclaimed}} the lead. On <b>lap</b> 70, Michael Waltrip repassed Johnson. One <b>lap</b> later, Logano passed Waltrip to lead. Regan Smith, on <b>lap</b> 71, passed Logano for the lead. On <b>lap</b> 72, Kyle Busch passed Smith to lead. On <b>lap</b> 75, Elliott Sadler passed Busch for the lead.|$|R
5|$|From there, {{the order}} {{remained}} relatively constant with Hamilton {{going on to}} take his 34th Grand Prix win. He was followed by Rosberg, Vettel, Massa and Nasr. Completing the point-scorers were Ricciardo, Nico Hülkenberg, Ericsson, Sainz and Pérez. In all, only eleven cars finished the race with Button's McLaren being the only car to finish outside the points and everyone from sixth position down <b>lapped.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} round in Europe, Hill again {{finished}} second behind Senna and ahead of a <b>lapped</b> Prost. In his first full season, Hill benefited {{from the experience of}} his veteran French team-mate. He continued to impress as the season went on, and in San Marino Hill took the lead at the start, though he was passed by Prost and Senna and ultimately retired with brake failure. More bad luck struck him in Spain where he kept pace with Prost for most of the race only for his engine to fail.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher contested 308 {{races in}} his career which {{included}} 91 Grand Prix wins; {{the majority of his}} race victories were for the Ferrari team with 72. His most successful circuit was Magny-Cours where he won eight times {{in his career}}. Schumacher's largest margin of victory was at the 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix, a race in which he <b>lapped</b> the field, and the smallest margin of victory was at the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix when he beat teammate Rubens Barrichello by 0.174 seconds.|$|E

50|$|Ryan Newman led {{the first}} nine <b>laps</b> of the race, with Rusty Wallace {{claiming}} the lead on <b>lap</b> 10, leading for 33 <b>laps.</b> Terry Labonte then led the next eight <b>laps,</b> with Kasey Kahne leading for 17 <b>laps</b> before Labonte took the lead back. Tony Stewart took the lead on <b>lap</b> 90, losing it on <b>lap</b> 108 to Kurt Busch, who led for only the <b>lap</b> before Sterling Marlin took over, leading until Busch reclaimed it on <b>lap</b> 131. Busch would lead for 54 <b>laps,</b> with Matt Kenseth briefly leading for a <b>lap</b> before Busch led the longest streak with 64 <b>laps.</b> Kevin Harvick, Wallace, and Kenseth would split the lead for the next 45 <b>laps,</b> Harvick leading 43 of them, followed by leading another 61 after taking the lead back from Kenseth on <b>lap</b> 295. After Busch led <b>lap</b> 356, Jamie McMurray took the lead, leading for 20 <b>laps</b> until Jeff Gordon led for six <b>laps</b> from <b>lap</b> 377 to 382 before McMurray reclaimed it. Jimmie Johnson then led his first <b>laps</b> of the race on <b>lap</b> 405, relinquishing it on <b>lap</b> 410. McMurray (1) and Marlin (29) led the next 30 <b>laps</b> until Johnson took the lead on <b>lap</b> 440, leading {{for the remainder of}} the race. McMurray, Newman, Marlin, and Busch finished in the top five, while the top ten consisted of Jeremy Mayfield, Jeff Green, Harvick, Jeff Gordon, and Rusty Wallace.|$|R
5|$|The 1978 season {{started with}} Roberts winning the Daytona 200 in a {{dominating}} fashion. After several near misses {{forced him to}} retire while leading the event, Roberts <b>lapped</b> the entire field en route to his first Daytona victory. He then won a rain-shortened Imola 200 race and was the second highest individual scorer behind Pat Hennen at the 1978 Transatlantic Match races. The 1978 world championship chase did not start well for Roberts at the season-opening round in Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer <b>lapped</b> in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to make the transition from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was <b>lapped</b> on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E
50|$|Earnhardt led four <b>laps</b> before Reutimann {{took over}} the lead {{position}} and led two <b>laps.</b> Afterward, Harvick reclaimed the lead position but was passed a <b>lap</b> later when Montoya moved to the lead on <b>lap</b> 106. Two <b>laps</b> later, Kenseth moved to first and led one <b>lap,</b> before Harvick passed him. Afterward, there were three lead changes {{in the next three}} <b>laps,</b> beginning with Harvick's teammate Bowyer, followed by Montoya and Earnhardt. Two <b>laps</b> earlier, pit stops began. On the 114th <b>lap,</b> Bowyer became the leader. On the following <b>lap,</b> he made a pit stop, giving the lead to Reutimann, who led one <b>lap</b> before giving the lead to Aric Almirola. After leading two <b>laps,</b> he was passed by Elliott Sadler, who led only one <b>lap,</b> before conceding the first position to Marcos Ambrose on <b>lap</b> 120. One <b>lap</b> later, Menard passed Ambrose for the lead position.|$|R
50|$|On <b>lap</b> 52, Keselowski {{claimed the}} lead from Kenseth. One <b>lap</b> later, Johnson pushed Earnhardt, Jr. into 1st place, duelling with Kenseth for the lead. On <b>lap</b> 56, Earnhardt, Jr. and Johnson {{had a big}} lead, but were passed one <b>lap</b> later by the pair Greg Biffle and Trevor Bayne. Kenseth and Ragan moved to the outside lane on <b>lap</b> 58. On <b>lap</b> 59, Bayne {{switched}} positions with Biffle to lead a <b>lap,</b> before being passed by Earnhardt, Jr. and Johnson on <b>lap</b> 60. Bowyer claimed the lead from Earnhardt on <b>lap</b> 62, but Earnhardt repassed him one <b>lap</b> later. One <b>lap</b> later, Bayne reclaimed the lead for three <b>laps</b> before Earnhardt, Jr. repassed him as well.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 {{cautions}} {{occurred during}} the race. The first was on <b>lap</b> 4, when Joe Nemechek and Todd Bodine crashed in turn 2. On <b>lap</b> 14, Brendan Gaughan, Marlin, and Mayfield were involved in an accident in turn 4, with Jimmy Spencer becoming the beneficiary and gain back a <b>lap.</b> On <b>lap</b> 21, Rudd spun out in turn 2, allowing Shelmerdine to gain back a spot. On <b>lap</b> 66, Robby Gordon crashed in turn 4, allowing Mario Gosselin to be the beneficiary. On <b>lap</b> 77, Rudd and Robby Gordon crashed in turn 4, Shelmerdine gaining another <b>lap</b> back. On <b>lap</b> 107, Dale Jarrett, Casey Mears, Bobby Hamilton, Jr., and Kirk Shelmerdine crashed in turn 3, allowing Robby Gordon to regain a <b>lap.</b> On <b>lap</b> 184, Kyle Petty spun in turn 2, permitting Nemechek to gain back a <b>lap.</b> On <b>lap</b> 292, Carl Edwards spun in turn 2, with Jeff Gordon being the beneficiary. The first caution for debris was flown on <b>lap</b> 322, with Robby Gordon becoming the beneficiary. Bobby Labonte, Jeff Green, and Ken Schrader crashed in turn 4 on <b>lap</b> 355, Rudd winning a <b>lap</b> back. Ward Burton spun in turn 2 on <b>lap</b> 372, {{though there was no}} beneficiary. On <b>lap</b> 410, Jarrett spun out in turn 3, with Petty gaining a <b>lap</b> back. The second debris caution flew on <b>lap</b> 418, Travis Kvapil being the beneficiary. On <b>lap</b> 451, Elliott Sadler spun out in turn 4, Burton gaining back a <b>lap.</b> Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Petty crashed in turn 2 on <b>lap</b> 468, with Sadler getting a <b>lap</b> back. However, on <b>lap</b> 477, Sadler would be involved in a crash in turn 2 with Nemechek, allowing Scott Riggs to gain back a <b>lap.</b> The final caution occurred on <b>lap</b> 490, with Edwards and Robby Gordon crashing in turn 3, with Kvapil being the beneficiary again.|$|R
5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being <b>lapped</b> by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E
5|$|Hornish began {{driving for}} Marlboro Team Penske during the 2004 IndyCar Series season in its No. 6 Dallara IR03-Toyota Indy V8, winning {{the season opener}} at Homestead-Miami in his first race with the team. After {{qualifying}} in 11th place at the Indianapolis 500, he battled for the lead with Buddy Rice and Dan Wheldon and led for nine laps (the first laps Hornish led in his Indianapolis 500 career). On lap 105, entering the main straightaway out of the fourth turn, Hornish tried to pass Darren Manning and Greg Ray's <b>lapped</b> car. They collided, crashing into the pit lane; Hornish finished 26th, dropping to ninth place in the point standings. The rest of his season was sub-par, with two podium finishes. Hornish was seventh in the championship standings with 387 points, his worst finish since he placed 21st in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix formula {{was changed}} again in 1938, abandoning the {{previous}} system of weight restrictions and instead limiting piston displacement. Mercedes-Benz' new car, the W154, proved its abilities at the French Grand Prix, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang {{to make it}} a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the 1938 season: the Swiss Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo; finished second in three: the French, German and Pau Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and Italian Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola's season was his win in the pouring rain at the Swiss Grand Prix. His teammate Seaman led for the first 11laps before Caracciola passed him; he remained in the lead {{for the rest of the}} race, despite losing the visor on his helmet, severely reducing visibility, especially given the spray thrown up by tyres of the many <b>lapped</b> cars.|$|E

5|$|Biffle led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the restart, and was passed on <b>lap</b> 77 by Jeff Gordon. Three <b>laps</b> later, Sadler made a pit stop with a flat right rear tire. On <b>lap</b> 90 Kyle Busch took the lead, losing it to Gordon on the next <b>lap.</b> Earnhardt passed Gordon on <b>lap</b> 93, holding the lead for nine <b>laps.</b> Vickers took the lead on <b>lap</b> 102; Earnhardt's left front tire went flat the next <b>lap,</b> costing him a <b>lap.</b> Green-flag pit stops began on <b>lap</b> 107, with Vickers {{stopping}} on <b>lap</b> 108 and giving the lead to McMurray. After the pit stops, Vickers regained the lead.|$|R
50|$|While under caution - on <b>lap</b> 119 - Gordon {{achieved}} his 24,000th career <b>lap</b> led, and led {{the field}} to the restart on <b>lap</b> 127. Gordon made his final stop and handed the lead to Harvick on <b>lap</b> 133, before Greg Biffle took the lead two <b>laps</b> later. On <b>lap</b> 138, the seventh caution came out when Allmendinger, <b>laps</b> down with damage from the <b>lap</b> 117 crash, hit the wall in turn 1. The race restarted with 17 <b>laps</b> to go.|$|R
5|$|The {{race was}} a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of <b>lapped</b> traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E
5|$|Two laps {{from the}} finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Schumacher {{was leading the}} race when he was issued a stop-and-go penalty for {{overtaking}} a <b>lapped</b> car (Alexander Wurz) during the early moments of a Safety Car period. This penalty involves going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds, and the rules state that a driver must serve his penalty within three laps of the penalty being issued. On the third lap after receiving the penalty, Schumacher turned into the pit lane to serve his penalty, but as {{this was the last}} lap of the race, and as Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, Schumacher technically finished the race before serving the penalty. The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded the penalty completely due to the irregularities in how the penalty had been issued.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. The first session provided limited opportunities to the drivers due to heavy rain and standing water on the course. As a result, only 11 of the 25 entrants participated in the session, of which Takuma Sato set the fastest time. Conditions improved during the second practice, and all 25 drivers set times. Will Power was quickest; marginally over a tenth of a second faster than Wilson. Ryan Briscoe, Simon Pagenaud and Tony Kanaan completed the top five, all recording times within half a second of Power. In the third practice, Scott Dixon recorded the fastest time, trailed by Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay. Briscoe and Wilson also <b>lapped</b> the track in under 72 seconds to finish among the five quickest drivers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lap</b> Leaders: Ayrton Senna 46 <b>laps</b> (1-28, 32-49); Gerhard Berger 3 <b>laps</b> (29-31); Nigel Mansell 12 <b>laps</b> (50-61) ...|$|R

5000|$|On <b>lap</b> 139, {{the third}} caution {{flag of the}} race was waved for debris. Earnhardt, Jr. got back on the lead <b>lap</b> and Kyle Busch {{returned}} to the lead <b>lap</b> with a free pass. At the restart on <b>lap</b> 143, Casey Mears was leading again. <b>Laps</b> later, Biffle passed him. On <b>lap</b> 151, McMurray received the lead. A <b>lap</b> later, Biffle repassed him. On <b>lap</b> 155, Kevin Harvick gave McMurray a shove to reclaim the lead for two <b>laps.</b> On <b>lap</b> 168, Harvick became the leader. He led for three <b>laps</b> before Mears assumed the lead. On <b>lap</b> 173, the lead returned to McMurray. On <b>lap</b> 182, Kenseth claimed the lead, and the fourth caution came out as McMurray spun out in the tri-oval off of Harvick's bumper. Under the caution, 11 drivers did not pit, so Clint Bowyer led the field at the restart on <b>lap</b> 187.|$|R
5|$|While Räikkönen {{closed on}} Verstappen at the front, Fernando Alonso's home race ended on lap 47, pulling {{over to the}} side of the track at turn three. Räikkönen managed to get into the one-second window to {{activate}} the drag reduction system (DRS), as Vettel was eight seconds behind him with Ricciardo closing on him in fourth place. By lap 57, Ricciardo was close enough to use DRS as well, but unable to pass. Three laps later, Ricciardo made an attempt at overtaking into turn one, but braking too late left him running wide, allowing Vettel back through. As the front runners <b>lapped</b> backmarkers, Kvyat, after scoring the first fastest lap for himself and Toro Rosso, overtook Gutiérrez for tenth place. Two laps from finish, Ricciardo suffered a puncture and was forced to pit, but retained fourth place ahead of Bottas. On the last lap, Renault drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer collided, but both made it to the finish. As Verstappen crossed the finish line, he became the youngest ever and first Dutch race winner in Formula One.|$|E
5|$|Haryanto held a three-second {{advantage}} over Visoiu who had worn his tyres, {{and he was}} unable to maintain the pace. Matsushita overtook Visoiu as a result. Vandoorne was overtaken Visoiu on the pit lane straight with the assistance of DRS {{at the start of the}} 16th lap. Vandoorne began to push hard and <b>lapped</b> one second faster than his teammate Matsushita. He moved in front of Matsushita for second place after starting lap 18, providing him with an opportunity to attempt to catch Haryanto during the remainder of the event. Haryanto responded and pulled away from Vandoorne. His teammate Matsushita struggled with pace and was passed by Rossi for third place. Berthon recovered from his poor start and moved ahead of Rossi, with the assistance of DRS, at the start of the final lap. Haryanto crossed the start/finish line after 23 laps to win his first GP2 Series race in his 70th attempt. Vandoorne finished second, ahead of third-placed Berthon. Rossi secured fourth, with Leal fifth. Matsushita, Visoiu, and Negrão rounded out the points-scoring positions. King, Pic, Stanaway, Markelov, de Jong, and Sirotkin filled the next five positions, while Lynn, Nato, Evans, Amberg, Stöckinger, Marciello, Sørensen, and Gasly were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher <b>lapped</b> {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued {{to move up the}} field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a pit stop for the second time on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his pit stop three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final pit stop of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his pit stop on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a pit stop and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled stop on lap 44. Fisichella's pit stop was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his clutch system and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
5|$|Da Matta {{reclaimed}} {{the first}} position on <b>lap</b> 103 before losing it to Papis {{on the next}} <b>lap.</b> After coming from a <b>lap</b> behind {{the rest of the}} field, Carpentier moved into the lead on <b>lap</b> 105, although Papis retook it on the following <b>lap.</b> Da Matta and Mears both held the position over the next two <b>laps</b> before Papis reclaimed it on <b>lap</b> 109. Andretti passed Papis to move into the first position on <b>lap</b> 110, before the Italian reclaimed it on the next <b>lap.</b> Da Matta, Andretti, Papis and Fernández all held the position over the following four <b>laps.</b> Green-flag pit stops began on <b>lap</b> 116. Papis and da Matta made their pit stops on <b>laps</b> 119 and 120. After the pit stops, Fernández moved back into the lead. Fittiapldi took over the first position on the 133rd <b>lap,</b> before Fernández passed him to retake the lead four <b>laps</b> later. Papis and Moreno shared the first position between <b>laps</b> 139 and 140, before da Matta retook the position seven <b>laps</b> later. Papis passed him to reclaim the lead on <b>lap</b> 148. Fernández moved back into first place on <b>lap</b> 150, and held a 0.7 second advantage over da Matta, who in turn was three-tenths of a second in front of Papis.|$|R
50|$|By <b>lap</b> 55, Allmendinger had a one-second {{lead over}} Truex. One <b>lap</b> later, Brian Vickers passed Truex for second. Allmendinger built his {{lead up to}} 1.4 seconds by <b>lap</b> 63. Twenty-two <b>laps</b> later, Truex passed Vickers to reclaim the second position. Vickers passed Truex on <b>lap</b> 92 to move back into that spot. Three <b>laps</b> later, Allmendinger, who was stuck behind Bobby Labonte, was passed by Vickers for the lead. On <b>lap</b> 104, Gordon moved up to third. Five <b>laps</b> later, Vickers {{maintained}} a half-second lead over Allmendinger. The third caution came on <b>lap</b> 116 when Ken Schrader hit the wall in turns 3 and 4. Under caution, all of the leaders opted to pit.Vickers maintained the lead at the restart, ahead of Allmendinger and Gordon. By <b>lap</b> 130, Vickers now had a 1.6-second lead over Allmendinger. On <b>lap</b> 134, Keselowski had passed Allmendinger and Gordon for second. By <b>lap</b> 147, Keselowski had reduced Vickers' lead to 1.5-seconds. Eight <b>laps</b> later, Kahne returned to the race after the <b>lap</b> 24 crash. By <b>lap</b> 168, Vickers' lead was one second from Keselowski. After starting nineteenth, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. had moved up fourteen positions to fifth by <b>lap</b> 179. Two <b>laps</b> later, Allmendinger started suffering from an vibration in his car. On <b>lap</b> 217, Keselowski passed Vickers for the lead. Eleven <b>laps</b> later, Gordon passed Vickers for second. On <b>lap</b> 235, Allmendinger made a pit stop to allow his team to check his car.|$|R
50|$|From {{the green}} flag, Jimmie Johnson {{got off to}} a good start, leading the first eight <b>laps.</b> On <b>lap</b> 8, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. passed Johnson and assumed the lead for all but two of the next 42 laps; Jeremy Mayfield led <b>lap</b> 33 and Michael Waltrip led <b>lap</b> 40. On <b>lap</b> 50, Sterling Marlin claimed the lead, and led two <b>laps</b> before Matt Kenseth passed him for the lead. Kenseth led until <b>lap</b> 56, when Earnhardt, Jr. regained the lead. Earnhardt, Jr. led until <b>lap</b> 65, when Mayfield assumed the lead, again for only a <b>lap</b> before losing the lead to Earnhardt. He {{continued}} to lead until <b>lap</b> 82 when Waltrip claimed it again. Waltrip led until <b>lap</b> 95, when Ryan Newman passed him and led <b>lap</b> 96.
