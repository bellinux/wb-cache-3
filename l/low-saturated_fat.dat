40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} whether the prescription of a detailed lifestyle programme in overweight/obese pregnant women influences the occurrence of gestational diabetes (GDM), and if this kind of prescription increases the adherence to a healthier lifestyle in comparison to standard care. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial, with open allocation, enrolling women at 9 - 12 [*]weeks of pregnancy with a BMI[*]≥[*] 25 [*]kg/m(2). The women assigned to the Intervention group (I[*]=[*] 96) received a hypocaloric, low-glycaemic, <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat</b> diet and physical activity recommendations. Those assigned to the Standard Care group (SC[*]=[*] 95) received lifestyle advices regarding healthy nutrition and exercise. Follow-up was planned at the 16 (th), 20 (th), 28 (th) and 36 (th) weeks. A total of 131 women completed the study (I[*]=[*] 69, SC[*]=[*] 62). The diet adherence was higher in the I (57. 9 %) than in the SC (38. 7 %) group. GDM occurred less frequently in the I (18. 8 %) than in the SC (37. 1 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 019) group. The adherent women from either groups showed a lower GDM rate (12. 5 % vs. 41. 8 %, P [*] 4000 [*]g were significantly lower in I group.

40|$|Monoglycerides {{are among}} the most {{promising}} polar lipid compounds that could form self-assembly structures able to bring new or improved functionality to food product. In particular, saturated monoglycerides can organize by themselves, in lamellar phases to form gelled systems, which have been proposed as structuring phase in low-fat or <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat</b> products  1 . In these products, the structure is mainly attributable to the presence of a crystalline triacylglycerol hardstock containing high level of saturated fatty acids. The latter are nowadays recognised to have negative health implications. Their consumption is in fact associated to an increase of the risk of cardio-vascular diseases due to the increase of low density lipoprotein cholesterol. The aim of the present research was to study applicability of saturated monoglyceride-oil-water gels for the production of target foods such as lemon cream, bread and biscuits. To this purpose, monoglyceride-oil-water gels were prepared mixing water, sunflower oil and commercial saturated monoglycerides. This system has been used in food formulations as substitute of palm oil, which is traditionally applied in the manufacturing of these products...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} serum {{cholesterol}} and lipoproteins covering periods of 28 {{years in a}} male physician and 17 years in a female research worker showed relative 'constancy for the cholesterol levels and greater variability for the lipoproteins. Cholesterol was reduced sharply and temporarily just after each influenzal infection. In the male, the level of cholesterol was slightly above 300 mg/ 100 ml for more than 13 years. An extremely low cholesterol and high carbohydrate diet proved unacceptable. A more liberal, relatively <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> low-cholesterol, and high polyunsaturated fatty acid diet with about 30 % of the calories from fat, maintained the cholesterol level between 230 and 270 mg and has been followed with relish {{for a number of}} years. A myo-cardial infarction occurred 27 years after the study began. Clofibrate since then has reduced the cholesterol level further. The female subject is in good health and maintains cholesterol levels slightly below 300 mg on a usual American diet. She is 10 years younger than the male.

40|$|In this article, {{we compare}} two {{strategies}} for atherosclerosis treatment: drugs and healthy lifestyle. Statins {{are the principal}} drugs used {{for the treatment of}} atherosclerosis. Several secondary prevention studies have demonstrated that statins can significantly reduce cardiovascular events including coronary death, the need for surgical revascularization, stroke, total mortality, as well as fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction. These results were observed in both men and women, the elderly, smokers and non-smokers, diabetics and hypertensives. Primary prevention studies yielded similar results, although total mortality was not affected. Statins also induce atheroma regression and do not cause cancer. However, many unresolved issues remain, such as partial risk reduction, costs, several potential side effects, and long-term use by young patients. Statins act mainly as lipid-lowering drugs but pleiotropic actions are also present. Healthy lifestyle, on the other hand, is effective and inexpensive and has no harmful effects. Five items are associated with lower cardiac risk: non-smoking, BMI &# 8804; 25, regular exercise (30 min/day), healthy diet (fruits, vegetables, <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> and 5 - 30 g alcohol/day). Nevertheless, there are difficulties in implementing these measures both at the individual and population levels. Changes in behavior require multidisciplinary care, including medical, nutritional, and psychological counseling. Participation of the entire society is required for such implementation, i. e., universities, schools, media, government, and medical societies. Although these efforts represent a major challenge, such a task must be faced in order to halt the atherosclerosis epidemic that threatens the world...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} inter-individual {{variability in}} cholesterol absorption has been reported. It could result from polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins {{involved in the}} absorption process and in interaction with dietary intakes. To assess whether the extent of cholesterol absorption or synthesis is modified in adult women according to the − 493 G/T polymorphism in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene (MTP) and/or the habitual diet. Cholestanol and sitosterol, as well as desmosterol and lathosterol, surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption or synthesis, respectively, were analyzed in the fasting plasma of 69 middle-aged women under a Western-type diet (WD) and after 3 months on a <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> low-cholesterol/Mediterranean-type diet (LFLCD). Genotypes for MTP − 493 G/T polymorphism were determined. Under an usual WD, subjects homozygous for the MTP − 493 T allele exhibited higher (P <  0. 05) fasting serum concentrations of cholestanol (199. 0  ±  30. 0 vs. 133  ±  7. 4  ×  102  mmol/mol cholesterol) and lathosterol (188. 7  ±  21. 8 vs. 147. 6  ±  9. 1  ×  102 mmol/mol cholesterol), as well as total cholesterol (7. 32  ±  0. 22 vs. 6. 63  ±  0. 12  mmol/l) compared to G carrier subjects. After 3 months on a LFLCD, level of absorption markers decreased in TT subjects with no change in synthesis ones, leading to values comparable to those measured in G carriers. The lowering of plasma total and LDL cholesterol due to dietary change was 2. 4 - and 2. 3 -fold greater in TT women than in G carriers. The polymorphism − 493 G/T in MTP modulates the level of cholesterol absorption but not synthesis in women under a WD, an effect abolished under a prudent LFLCD...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hyper{{cholesterol}}aemia, characterised by raised {{blood cholesterol}} levels, {{is not a}} disease itself but a metabolic derangement that often contributes to many diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. In most cases, elevated cholesterol levels are associated with high-fat diet, especially saturated fat, coupled with an inactive lifestyle. Less commonly, raised cholesterol {{may be related to}} an inherited disorder, familial hypercholesterolaemia. This systematic review is only concerned with acquired hypercholesterolaemia. Objectives: To assess the effects of low-fat diets for acquired hypercholesterolaemia and to investigate the incidence of adverse effects from low-fat dietary interventions. We planned to compare the relative effectiveness of low-fat diets with calorie-restricted diets for acquiredhypercholesterolaemia. We also wanted to look into the relative effectiveness of low-fat diets and pharmacological interventions for acquired hypercholesterolaemia. Search strategy: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and databases of ongoing trials. Date of last search was February 2010. Selection criteria: Otherwise healthy adults (equal to or greater than 18 years) with acquired (not familial) hypercholesterolaemia. We defined hypercholesterolaemia as either total cholesterol greater than 5. 2 mmol/L, LDL-cholesterol greater than 3. 0 mmol/L, HDL-cholesterol less than 1. 0 mmol/L or a combination thereof, although investigators’ definitions were also accepted. We wanted to include any low-fat dietary intervention, like low-fat and <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat</b> diets, intended to lower serum total and LDL-cholesterol or to raise HDL-cholesterol. A low-fat diet was considered as a fat calorie intake less than 20 % of the total calories. The minimum duration of the intervention had to be six months. We excluded studies in unhealthy people. Data collection and analysis: Two authors were planned to independently assess risk of bias and extract data. Main results: No study met our inclusion criteria. Authors’ conclusions: Well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials investigating patient-relevant outcomes of low-fat diets for otherwise healthy people with hypercholesterolamia are required...|$|E
40|$|Background: Introducing {{nutritional}} {{and lifestyle}} principles {{to children in}} late infancy may permanently improve their adher-ence to a <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> low-cholesterol diet, thus reducing of coronary risk factors, but worries about possible effects on growth and development have hampered such an approach. Objective: The Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project for Babies (STRIP) aimed to decrease exposure to known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors in children 7 – 36 mo of age. Design: Repeated, individualized counseling aimed at promoting a fat intake of 30 % of energy and a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio of saturated to monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fat intake was provided (n = 540 intervention children; 284 boys). Nutrition was discussed superficially with {{the families of the}} control children (n = 522; 266 boys) and food intake was recorded at 3 – 6 -mo intervals by use of 3 – 4 -d food diaries. Serum lipids were measured at 6 – 12 -mo inter-vals and growth was monitored regularly. Results: Fat intake of the intervention (control) children pro-vided 29. 5 % (29. 4 %) of energy at the age of 8 mo, 26. 6 % (28. 5 %) of energy at 13 mo, 30. 5 % (33. 5 %) of energy at 24 mo, and 31. 5 % (33. 5 %) of energy at 36 mo. The intervention chil-dren consistently consumed less saturated fat than did the con-trol children (P < 0. 0001). Recommended intakes of other nutri-ents (except vitamin D and occasionally iron) were reached irrespective of the amount and type of dietary fat. Serum cho-lesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol concentra-tions were 3 – 6 % lower in the intervention children than in the control children. The intervention had no effect on height, weight, or head circumference gain. Fat intake did not predict children’s growth patterns. Conclusion: Repeated, individualized counseling in early child-hood aimed at reducing consumption of saturated fat and choles-terol was effective and feasible and did not restrict growth in cir-cumstances in which children were regularly monitored.

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is associated with}} a number of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease. Dietary fat has been linked with insulin resistance, with alterations in the quality as opposed to the quantity of dietary fat now thought be more important in instigating improvements in insulin resistance. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of alterations in the dietary fat intakes of middle-aged men (n = 32) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose disposal and postprandial lipid metabolism and to explore the mechanistic links between these insulin responsive pathways. Three separate dietary interventions were conducted; the first involved an increase in the intake of n- 3 polyunsaturated fat, the second a decrease in saturated fat and an increase in carbohydrate and the third a decrease in saturated fat and an increase in monounsaturated fat intake. Compliance was monitored by the measurement of red blood cell phospholipid fatty acid composition, postprandial lipid metabolism was measured over 9 hours following a high-fat breakfast (80 g fat), and insulin resistance was measured using the short insulin tolerance test. The results of the study showed that while insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with red blood cell saturated fatty acid concentration at baseline, the insulin sensitivity of glucose disposal was unaffected by any of the dietary interventions conducted. In measurements of postprandial lipaemia, improvements were observed following the <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat</b> / high-monounsaturated fat diet and the n- 3 polyunsaturated enriched diet, however the low-saturated fat/ high-carbohydrate diet was associated with a worsening of postprandial lipaemia through an increase in the concentrations of triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins. Changes in fasting biochemical measurements were most evident in the low-saturated / high-monounsaturated diet, with an 11 % reduction in total cholesterol and a 15. 4 % reduction in fasting triglycerides. There were no observed changes in the activity levels or the gene expression of lipoprotein lipase. There was an unexpected positive association between the degree of insulin sensitivity and the extent of postprandial lipaemia, indicating that the link between these pathways is complex and warrants further investigation. Overall this work supports the view that dietary guidelines should be directed towards a change in the composition of fat, to a lower saturated fat intake, a higher monounsaturated fat intake and a lower n- 6 : n- 3 ratio through an increase in the intake of long chain n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{food-grade}} oleogels (differing {{in concentration}} of bees wax in rice bran oil) were combined with palm oil at three replacement levels (17, 33, and 50 %wt) {{to form a}} continuous fat phase reduced in saturated fatty acids. We explored the crystallization and gelling behavior of the wax-based palm-blend mixtures, {{and those of the}} fillings containing sugar and hazelnut particles dispersed in these wax-based palm-blend fat phases. The wax-based palm-blends were different in chemical nature (unique triacyglycerols in hazelnut oil, rice bran oil, and palm oil; fatty esters, n-alkanes, free fatty acids, and free fatty alcohols in bees wax), resulting in the formation of different crystalline morphologies when oleogels and palm oil were crystallized together. The crystallization of BW-oleogel has proven its contribution to the gelation of the hybrid mixtures during the instant cooling step. The maximum amount of palm oil being replaced by wax-based oleogels was 17 %, resulting in a system having similar gel strength with the reference (100 % of palm oil). The gel strength obtained from rheological measurements was explained based on the information obtained from oil binding capacity, microstructure (polarized light microscopy), and thermal studies. The dilution effect was observed and the melting enthalpy decreased with the increasing oleogel fraction. The solid fat content of the final filling products at body temperature was lower than 2. 0 %wt, suggesting a non-waxy mouthfeel. This research provides imperative information involved in the use of oleogels for the engineering of low saturated-fat confectionery products. Practical applications: Food grade beeswax-oleogel was used in search of a novel alternative for palm oil to limit the consumption of saturated fat content in confectionery products, especially hazelnut filling. A fundamental understanding in the rheological behavior and thermal properties of wax-based palm-blend mixtures, and of the wax-based fillings is very important to evaluate the influence of BW-oleogel on the crystallization of the continuous fat phase. The obtained data are imperative for the achievement of <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat</b> products with a well-defined structure. These findings will be interest to the readers who are working in the area of food lipid science and technology, especially the use of food-grade fat-based alternatives in chocolate and confectionary industry. In this research, food-grade oleogels (differing in concentration of bees wax in rice bran oil) were combined with palm oil at three replacement levels (17, 33, and 50 %wt) to form a continuous fat phase reduced in saturated fatty acids.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of a very-low-carbohydrate, high-unsaturated fat, <b>low-saturated</b> <b>fat</b> (LC) diet with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HC) diet on glycemic control and cardiovascular disease risk factors in T 2 D after 52 wk. DESIGN: In this randomized controlled trial that was conducted in an outpatient research clinic, 115 obese adults with T 2 D [mean ± SD age: 58 ± 7 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)) : 34. 6 ± 4. 3; glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) : 7. 3 ± 1. 1 %; duration of diabetes: 8 ± 6 y] were randomly assigned to consume either a hypocaloric LC diet [14 % of energy as carbohydrate (carbohydrate < 50 g/d), 28 % of energy as protein, and 58 % of energy as fat (< 10 % saturated fat) ] or an energy-matched HC diet [53 % of energy as carbohydrate, 17 % of energy as protein, and 30 % of energy as fat (< 10 % saturated fat) ] combined with supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (60 min; 3 d/wk). Outcomes were glycemic control assessed with use of measurements of HbA 1 c, fasting blood glucose, glycemic variability assessed with use of 48 -h continuous glucose monitoring, diabetes medication, weight, blood pressure, and lipids assessed at baseline, 24, and 52 wk. RESULTS: Both groups achieved similar completion rates (LC diet: 71 %; HC diet: 65 %) and mean (95 % CI) reductions in weight [LC diet: - 9. 8 kg (- 11. 7, - 7. 9 kg); HC diet: - 10. 1 kg (- 12. 0, - 8. 2 kg) ], blood pressure [LC diet: - 7. 1 (- 10. 6, - 3. 7) /- 6. 2 (- 8. 2, - 4. 1) mm Hg; HC diet: - 5. 8 (- 9. 4, - 2. 2) /- 6. 4 (- 8. 4, - 4. 3) mm Hg], HbA 1 c [LC diet: - 1. 0 % (- 1. 2 %, - 0. 7 %); HC diet: - 1. 0 % (- 1. 3 %, - 0. 8 %) ], fasting glucose [LC diet: - 0. 7 mmol/L (- 1. 3, - 0. 1 mmol/L); HC diet: - 1. 5 mmol/L (- 2. 1, - 0. 8 mmol/L) ], and LDL cholesterol [LC diet: - 0. 1 mmol/L (- 0. 3, 0. 1 mmol/L); HC diet: - 0. 2 mmol/L (- 0. 4, 0. 03 mmol/L) ] (P-diet effect ≥ 0. 10). Compared with the HC-diet group, the LC-diet group achieved greater mean (95 % CI) reductions in the diabetes medication score [LC diet: - 0. 5 arbitrary units (- 0. 7, - 0. 4 arbitrary units); HC diet: - 0. 2 arbitrary units (- 0. 4, - 0. 06 arbitrary units); P = 0. 02], glycemic variability assessed by measuring the continuous overall net glycemic action- 1 [LC diet: - 0. 5 mmol/L (- 0. 6, - 0. 3 mmol/L); HC diet: - 0. 05 mmol/L (- 0. 2, - 0. 1 mmol/L); P = 0. 003], and triglycerides [LC diet: - 0. 4 mmol/L (- 0. 5, - 0. 2 mmol/L); HC diet: - 0. 01 mmol/L (- 0. 2, 0. 2 mmol/L); P = 0. 001] and greater mean (95 % CI) increases in HDL cholesterol [LC diet: 0. 1 mmol/L (0. 1, 0. 2 mmol/L); HC diet: 0. 06 mmol/L (- 0. 01, 0. 1 mmol/L); P = 0. 002]. CONCLUSIONS: Both diets achieved substantial weight loss and reduced HbA 1 c and fasting glucose. The LC diet, which was high in unsaturated fat and low in saturated fat, achieved greater improvements in the lipid profile, blood glucose stability, and reductions in diabetes medication requirements, suggesting an effective strategy for the optimization of T 2 D management.
