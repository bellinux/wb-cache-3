25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil, <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E

50|$|Baldellia ranunculoides is an {{aquatic plant}} which {{produced}} erect flowering stems that rise up to 10 cm {{above the water}} surface. Each flower stalk bears one or two umbels of up to five flowers each, and often only a single flower. Each flower is 10 - 15 mm in diameter, and has three petals. When not in flower, B. ranunculoides can be mistaken for <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> Ranunculus flammula, which grows in similar locations.|$|E
50|$|Ranunculus flammula, the <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> greater {{creeping}} spearwort or banewort, is {{a species}} of perennial herbaceous plants in the genus Ranunculus (buttercup), growing in damp places throughout the Boreal Kingdom. It flowers June/July. Ranunculus flammula is poisonous.It is very closely related to R. reptans, which is distinguished by prostrate and more slender stems, narrower leaves and smaller flowers and is sometimes included within R. flammula sensu lato as a variety (R. flammula var. reptans (L.) E. Meyer).|$|E
50|$|The {{north shore}} is mainly vegetated with scrub and woodland, {{including}} willow, blackthorn, elder, birch, hawthorn, and hazel. Common spotted orchids {{grow in the}} base-rich flushed areas. At the extreme south eastern corner of the site there {{is an area of}} marshy grassland with abundant meadow-sweet, wild angelica, common knapweed, and sneezewort and where there is periodic flooding of the shore you can also find species like common spike rush, reed canary grass, <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> and amphibious bistort.|$|E
50|$|The most {{interesting}} feature ecologically is {{a chain of}} old ponds. Starting from the east, they are Burnham's Pond, Warren Pond, Long Pond, Ellern Mede Pond and Pink Cottage Pond. They vary in character, but all have interesting wetland flora, and most are valuable for dragonflies, other invertebrates and amphibians. Plants to be found {{around the edges of}} the ponds include <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> trifid bur-marigold and fool's watercress (Apium nodiflorum). In deeper water, white water-lily and curled and broad-leaved pondweeds can be found. Long Pond is used for angling.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater marshes {{exist in}} many places around the shore but {{extensive}} reed-beds stretching out into the lake are rare. The margins of the marshes are mostly sedge dominated by such species as bottle sedge, bladder-sedge, tufted-sedge, common-sedge and occasionally water-sedge, water horsetail, marsh cinquefoil and bur-reeds also occur commonly. Also on the fringes occurs a more varied community characteristic of base-poor areas, with such species as marsh ragwort, <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> devils-bit scaboius, marsh bedstraw and hoary willowherb, creeping bent, sweet vernal-grass, Yorkshire fog and purple moor-grass. Cuckooflower occurs commonly and bog violet and greater spearwort {{are to be found}} in places.|$|E
50|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil, <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E
50|$|The hamlet {{is located}} on the B6270 between Thwaite and Keld below Great Shunner Fell and close to a small beck named Skeb Skeugh. The area around this beck, known as Angram Bottoms, has been {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is made of seven fields covering 24.2 acres supporting a diverse habitat of flora. A combination of mire and wet grassland, due to many sinkholes and springs. Plants in the wet grasslands that can be found here include sharp-flowered rush, <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort,</b> slender tufted-sedge, bottle sedge, common marsh-bedstraw, northern marsh-orchid, marsh-marigold and meadowsweet. Other areas of marsh support marsh lousewort, carnation sedge, flea sedge, star sedge, marsh valerian and marsh violet.|$|E
50|$|The {{woodland}} policies at Monkcastle {{are classified}} {{as one of the}} relatively few North Ayrshire 'Ancient Woodland' sites. Aspen (Populus tremulans) has been recorded here; liverworts, ferns, and mosses are common due to the conditions of continuous high humidity. The Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) have designated Monkcastle as part of Listed Wildlife or Local Site for Nature Conservation (LSNC) number 27, together with Monkcastle House, Dalgarven and Smithstone. Aspen (Populus tremula) is the most notable species present, however the presence of Broad-leafed Helleborine (Epipactis helleborine) indicates a woodland containg many mature deciduous trees of some habitat value, together with wet flushes containing yellow flag iris, soft rush, <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort</b> and golden saxifrage.|$|E
50|$|Habitats {{described}} as species rich wet grasslands are rare in Northern Ireland and are typically located {{in areas where}} traditional farming practices are still maintained. The meadows are categorised by botanists/ecologists as Fen-meadow, {{a specific type of}} purple moor-grass, rush pasture that is fed by a steady hydrological influence. The typical species found in Drumbegger are Devil’s-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), sharp-flowered rush (Juncus acutiflorus), meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum), <b>lesser</b> <b>spearwort</b> (Ranunculus flammula) together with mosses such as glittering wood-moss (Hylocomium splendens) and neat feather-moss (Pseudoscleropodium purum).Drumbegger is also noteworthy as a habitat for two protected species, blue-eyed-grass (Sisyrinchium bermudiana) and the marsh fritillary butterfly (Euphydryas aurinia). Marsh fritillary caterpillars thrive on two plant species found in Drumbegger which are blue-eyed-grass and Devil’s-bit scabious.|$|E
5000|$|Higher Moors and Porth Hellick Pool SSSI {{is one of}} {{the three}} main {{freshwater}} wetland areas on Scilly. The wetland is fed by ground water and a small steam to form a mosaic of willow and alder scrub, mire and pools. The peat deposits were once a fuel source and are rich in pollen. Along with other paleo-environmental evidence the deposits provide information about the vegetational history of the islands since the Mesolithic. The area is important as a feeding ground for migrating and wintering birds and for summer visitors and waterfowl. Reed Warbler and Sedge Warbler nest in the common reed which grows along the margins of the pools and Coot, Gadwall, Mallard and Moorhen, Teal and Water Rail also breed. The moors were once grazed and the fields have a rich wet grassland flora with Greater Tussock-sedge, Hemlock Water-dropwort, Purple Loosestrife, Royal Fern, Water Mint and Yellow Iris. The acidic boggy areas support Bog Pimpernel, Bog Stitchwort and Marsh St John’s-wort with <b>Lesser</b> <b>Spearwort</b> in the wetter areas.|$|E
