5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E

In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia Natural History that beryl and emerald ("smaragdus") were similar. The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in {{the third or fourth}} century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper part}} of the Syrian Euphrates valley has been intensively {{occupied}} at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the Late Natufian period (10,800â€“9500 BC). Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European travellers had already noted the presence of numerous archaeological sites in the area that would be flooded by the new reservoir. In order to preserve or at least document as many of these remains as possible, an extensive archaeological rescue programme was initiated during which more than 25 sites were excavated.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E

5|$|Built on {{a shallow}} slope below the Zerhoun mountain, Volubilis {{stands on a}} ridge above the valley of Khoumane (Xuman). It overlooks a rolling fertile plain north of the modern city of Meknes. The area around Volubilis has been {{inhabited}} at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the Late Atlantic Neolithic, some 5,000 years ago; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in Iberia. By the third century BC, the Phoenicians had a presence there, {{as evidenced by the}} remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language. The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Berber word Walilt, meaning oleander, which grows along the sides of the valley.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{have been}} used for bathing at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} that quickly developed between Cairano and the experts of the Sanmicheli studio {{is evident in}} the artworks and their chronological sequence. They had been the major artistic personalities of the city at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the beginning of the construction of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and ended up supplanted by the rise of the new master sculptor. The first documentary evidence of the company of the Sanmicheli brothers, Bartolomeo and Giovanni, originally from Porlezza on Lake Como, appears in the 1480s in Verona; {{by the end of the}} century, they had obtained important commissions in various northern Italian cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Croatia have been {{populated}} at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> {{the time of}} Ancient Greece. For example, Hvar was already populated between 3500 BC and 2500 BC and Dionysius I of Syracuse founded a colony on Hvar and Vis in the 4th century BC. The combined island population reached its peak in 1921, at 173,503 inhabitants, and went into steady decline in the following decades, dropping to pre-1850s level by 1981. The depopulation trend was reversed only in the 1990s, with the 2001 census registering a population of 122,418, up from 110,953 in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{medical records}} show that {{epilepsy}} has been affecting people at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the disease {{was thought to be}} a spiritual condition. The world's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a Moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1790 BC) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c. 1700 BC) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.|$|E

5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This {{is supported by the}} fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E
5|$|When Theobald died in 1160, most {{observers}} believed that Foliot {{was the leading}} candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury had been held by a monk, at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the replacement of Stigand by Lanfranc in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were {{a subset of the}} Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{restoration}} to Byzantine rule, relations between Thessalonica and Constantinople remained troubled, with Thessalonica's local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges, which apparently amounted to virtual autonomy. This {{was part of}} a wider phenomenon for several cities during the last century of Byzantine history, as the state's central authority weakened. In Thessalonica's case, a tendency of independence from the imperial capital had been evident at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> the Zealot movement of the mid-14th century, and had been reinforced by Manuel II's autonomous regime in 1382â€“1387. Thus, Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. During this time, Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa Ã‡elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa Ã‡elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383â€“1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the {{privilege of}} peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at <b>least</b> <b>since</b> 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E
