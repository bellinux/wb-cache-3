40|$|AbstractHeavy wall {{reactors}} {{and large}} diameter pressure vessels usually face unique challenges in their erection onto their foundations at the jobsite. Today, 800 ton to 1, 500 ton reactors and or large diameter vessels with diameters ranging up to 15 meters {{are common in}} the refining industry. These pressure vessels are usually fabricated in shops dispersed globally and require unique heavy duty equipment for their safe handling, transportation and erection. The challenge {{is to find a}} safe, efficient and cost effective solution based upon the limitations of the equipment, job site and the lift equipment available for erection. Equipment for the handling heavy reactors and large diameter pressure equipment is usually scarce, expensive. Planning well in advance of the lift date is required. Careful consideration must be given to the choice and design of attachment to the pressure vessels used for the lift to ensure that the vessel and lifting components are not overstressed during the lifting process. This paper identifies the types of evaluations that must be performed to determine the stresses in the vessel and <b>lifting</b> <b>attachments</b> during the lifting. The paper also discusses different types of lifting lugs that may be attached to each end of the vessel either by bolting or welding and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} each. The paper also provides an example of a finite element analysis (FEA) of a top nozzle, a FEA of a pair of lifting trunions and a FEA of welded on lifting lugs for buried pipe. The intent of the paper is to outline the effects on the vessel due to different types of lifting configurations in combination with the lifting parameters. This paper is not intended to provide guidance on how to design lifting lugs...|$|E

40|$|The 1991 - 1992 senior Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Design class {{continued}} work on {{the post}} landing configurations for the Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV) and the Emergency Egress Couch (EEC). The ACRV will be permanently docked to Space Station Freedom fulfilling NASA's commitment of Assured Crew Return Capability {{in the event of}} an accident or illness aboard Space Station Freedom. The EEC provides medical support and a transportation surface for an incapacitated crew member. The objective of the projects was to give the ACRV Project Office data to feed into their feasibility studies. Four design teams were given the task of developing models with dynamically and geometrically scaled characteristics. Groups one and two combined efforts to design a one-fifth scale model for the Apollo Command Module derivative, an on-board flotation system, and a <b>lift</b> <b>attachment</b> point system. This model was designed to test the feasibility of a rigid flotation and stabilization system and to determine the dynamics associated with lifting the vehicle during retrieval. However, due to priorities, it was not built. Group three designed a one-fifth scale model of the Johnson Space Center (JSC) benchmark configuration, the Station Crew Return Alternative Module (SCRAM) with a <b>lift</b> <b>attachment</b> point system. This model helped to determine the flotation and lifting characteristics of the SCRAM configuration. Group four designed a full scale EEC with changeable geometric and geometric and dynamic characteristics. This model provided data on the geometric characteristics of the EEC and on the placement of the CG and moment of inertia. It also gave the helicopter rescue personnel direct input to the feasibility study. Section 1 describes in detail the design of a one-fifth scale model of the Apollo Command Module Derivative (ACMD) ACRV. The objective of the ACMD Configuration Model Team was to use geometric and dynamic constraints to design a one-fifth scale working model of the Apollo Command Module Derivative (ACMD) configuration with a <b>Lift</b> <b>Attachment</b> Point (LAP) System. This model was required to incorporate a rigidly mounted flotation system and the egress system designed the previous academic year. The LAP system was to be used to determine the dynamic effects of locating the lifting points at different locations on the vehicle. The team was then to build and test the model; however, due to priorities, this did not occur. To better simulate the ACMD after a water landing, the nose cone section was removed and the deck area exposed. The areas researched during the design process were construction, center of gravity and moment of inertia, and <b>lift</b> <b>attachment</b> points...|$|R
50|$|An Auxiliary <b>Lifting</b> <b>Attachment</b> (ALA) - a davit with a {{winch rope}} roller - fitted {{to the inside}} of the {{earthmoving}} bucket was used for lifting loads of up to 4tonnes. Loads such as Medium Girder Bridge pallets could be lifted vertically to a height of 1.8m. This then allowed a cargo vehicle to back under the suspended load, the CET could not travel or turn with a suspended load on the ALA due to lateral weakness of the ALA and the proximity of the load to the earthmoving bucket. Use of the ALA was discontinued in the 1990s due to difficulties in annual testing of the safe working load, and a reduced requirement for its use.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} results of a probabilistic analysis of the potential for load drop during the load test of the K West Basin South Loadout Pit Gantry. The calculations are in support of the cask loading system (CLS) subproject load test of the gantry. The purpose of this calculation note is to document the probabilistic calculation of the per lift potential for drop of a test load by the Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) Loading System (MLS) during load testing at the K West Basin south loadout pit. The MLS subproject needs to load test the MLS in the K West Basin south loadout pit. To perform this test, a basket mockup weighing approximately 4, 500 lb (125 % of a fully loaded MCO basket accounting for water displacement) needs to be used for one or more load tests. The test load will comprise a standard basket <b>lifting</b> <b>attachment</b> with several ring-shaped steel segments to provide the required weight. The test load will exceed the K Basin Safety Analysis Report (WHC-SD-WM-SAR- 062) (SAR) allowances for load drop in the K West Basin south loadout pit. This probabilistic calculation will be used as part of the basis for seeking U. S. Department of Energy approval to use an MLS test weight that exceeds SAR allowances...|$|R

5000|$|A 36-wheeled {{transport}} trailer, the Orbiter Transfer System, originally {{built for}} the U.S. Air Force's launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California (since then converted for Delta IV rockets) would transport the orbiter from the landing facility to the launch pad, which allowed both [...] "stacking" [...] and launch without utilizing a separate VAB-style building and crawler-transporter roadway. Prior to {{the closing of the}} Vandenberg facility, orbiters were transported from the OPF to the VAB on their undercarriages, only to be raised when the orbiter was being <b>lifted</b> for <b>attachment</b> to the SRB/ET stack. The trailer allowed the transportation of the orbiter from the OPF to either the SCA [...] "Mate-Demate" [...] stand or the VAB without placing any additional stress on the undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|Unit load {{formation}} {{equipment is}} used to restrict materials so that they maintain their integrity when handled a single load during transport and for storage. If materials are self-restraining (e.g., a single part or interlocking parts), then they can be formed into a unit load with no equipment. Examples of unit load formation equipment include pallets, skids, slipsheets, tote pans, bins/baskets, cartons, bags, and crates. A pallet is a platform made of wood (the most common), paper, plastic, rubber, or metal with enough clearance beneath its top surface (or face) to enable the insertion of forks for subsequent lifting purposes. A slipsheet is a thick piece of paper, corrugated fiber, or plastic upon which a load is placed and has tabs that can be grabbed by special push/pull <b>lift</b> truck <b>attachments.</b> They are used {{in place of a}} pallet to reduce weight and volume, but loading/unloading is slower.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to develop an Attachment which will enable the lateral {{movement}} of the manufacturing Dies by mounting it on the forks of any Hydraulic Stacker or Fork <b>Lift.</b> The <b>Attachment</b> manufactured is unique because it can be attached or mounted on any hydraulic stalker in the One Tonne range. The attachment is a combination of two separate bed of rollers, a lead screw, a gear mechanism and a moving frame which enables the hydraulic stacker to easily load or unload Dies upto the range of one tonne, in and out of Machine Presses and Storage Racks which reduces material handling time and cost, manual effort and increases safety. The developed attachment in this work can also be easily detached and kept aside when not in use, so that the stacker can be used for regular purposes in the logistics department.

50|$|The Moazagottl {{was a high}} {{gull wing}} glider. The inner third of the span carried a {{dihedral}} of about 8° and was rectangular in plan. Single, broad-chord faired lift struts on each side braced these sections from about 20% of the span to the lower fuselage. Outboard the wing had no dihedral and was strongly swept on the leading edge, resulting in marked taper. Long ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of each outer panels; these were slightly tapered and projected behind {{the trailing edge of}} the inner sections. The wing was built around a single, swept main spar which was straight in plan, simplifying its change in direction between the inner and outer panels. Diagonal sub-spars ran inwards and rearwards from it between the <b>lift</b> strut <b>attachment</b> points and the fuselage. Plywood skinning forward of these spars around the leading edge formed a D-box; aft, the wing, including the aileron, was fabric covered.|$|R
50|$|All the Schlesierland {{variants}} had a ply covered fuselage; {{most were}} hexagonal in cross-section, though {{that of the}} 1931 ESG 31B had a rounded, streamlined form. Early Schlesierlands had open cockpits and landed on a skid that reached from the nose to the <b>lift</b> strut <b>attachment</b> point but the 1931 Stanavo introduced a monowheel aft of the skid. At some point it was fitted with a multi-transparency cockpit canopy. The wing pedestal slowly deceases in height rearwards above the fuselage, ending about halfway to the tail. The narrow, swept tailplane is mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage; on the later 1931 variants, the ESG 31A and B, the tailplane was braced {{to the top of the}} fin. On all models except possibly the Commodore, this was ply covered and only about a third the height of the balanced rudder. Both rudder and elevators are fabric covered with rounded trailing edges; the rudder extends down to the keel and operated between the elevators. There is a small, partly faired sprung tailskid immediately ahead of the rudder hinge line.|$|R

This is obtained by designing the support (2) of the lifting device {{in the form of a}} small hollow body comprising a cylindrical lifting wall (6) and a flat bottom wall (7) opposite said lifting wall, the lifting wall (6) being bent so that said lifting device is large enough to surround the drive elements located in the support (2) and the bottom wall (7) and the lifting wall (6) meet, forming flat wedge-shaped edges...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the optimum position and geometry of stall strips (SS) to control sudden fall of lift in wind turbine blades. The type of airfoil {{used in this study}} is NACA 0015 with 150 mm of chord length. Total of five positions, two geometries and three sizes of SS configurations are simulated by using Ansys Fluent software. For position configuration, SS of size 2 mm is placed on the apex (POS- 1), and on the upper and lower surfaces at distance of 0. 65 mm (POS- 4 and POS- 2 respectively), and 2. 45 mm (POS- 5 and POS- 3), respectively, from the leading edge. The shapes tested are dome and equilateral triangle. The results show that the addition of SS as a method of controlling sudden loss of lift decreases the maximum <b>lift</b> coefficient. <b>Attachment</b> of SS at the lower surface of the airfoil did not bring any significant effect to the lift and stall characteristics; while for the upper surface it reduces the sudden fall of lift but at the cost of big reduction in maximum lift coefficient. The optimum position and geometry of SS are POS- 1 and triangle shape. Increasing in size of SS shows positive effect in control stalling effect...|$|R
40|$|A two-component {{force balance}} has been {{constructed}} and {{installed in the}} Charles Darwin University (CDU) wind tunnel to increase the capability of experimental investigation into fluid flow around submerged bodies. The balance consists {{of a series of}} struts that transfer forces to two load cells orientated perpendicularly in order to separately measure horizontal (drag) and vertical (<b>lift)</b> forces. Various <b>attachments</b> have been manufactured for various model types. The mechanism has been tested over a range of air velocities from 0 - 40 m/s with the various attachments and suitable models. Comparison of the experimental results with the results of theoretical modelling using a CFD software package revealed an excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental interpretation of fluid forces. A detailed practical exercise manual was developed to assist future students and researchers in conducting experiments involving investigation of fluid flow over submerged bodies. One of the major practical benefits resulted from this project is that the created setup allows for the direct measurement of fluid forces which was not available previously...|$|R
40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet assembly handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and inner shield plug <b>lifting</b> fixture <b>attachment.</b> Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|R
