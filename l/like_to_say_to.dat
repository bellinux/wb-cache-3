She spoke {{publicly}} {{concerning his}} death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating [...] "I'd just <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> you, Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live {{in all of our}} hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much." [...] In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming Why Did I Get Married Too?. Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, [...] "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second." [...] During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet [...] "Scream". MTV stated [...] "there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] The performance was lauded by critics, with Entertainment Weekly affirming the rendition [...] "as energetic as it was heartfelt".|$|E

2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E

She rather depends upon me, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You men," [...] she sighed, [...] "are all alike! You judge only by what happens. You {{never look}} inside. That is why your justice is so {{different}} from a woman's. All that you have told me is very pitiful, {{but there is another}} view of the case which you should consider. Let us sit down upon this boulder for a few moments.
