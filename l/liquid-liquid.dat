5|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC. Meanwhile, trialkyl esters such as tributyl phosphate (made similarly from n-butanol) are used as <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction solvents in nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, an {{experiment}} showed that when natural 209Bi is bombarded with neutrons, 210Bi is created, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction techniques. Polonium {{may now be}} made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors. Only about 100grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.|$|E
5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction.|$|E
25|$|While during {{conventional}} <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction the solvent and the extractant {{have to be}} dispersed, in a SIR {{setup the}} dispersion is already achieved by the impregnated particles. This also prevents an additional phase separation step, which would be necessary after the emulsification occurring in <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction. In order to elucidate the effect of emulsification, Figure 2 (to the left) compares the two systems of an extractant in <b>liquid-liquid</b> equilibrium with water, left, and SIR particles in equilibrium with water, right. The figure shows that no emulsification occurs in the SIR system, whereas the <b>liquid-liquid</b> system shows turbidity implying emulsification. Also, the impregnation step decreases the solvent loss into the aqueous phase compared to <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction. This decrease of extractant loss is contributed to physical sorption of the extractant on the particle surface, {{which means that the}} extractant inside the pores does not entirely behave as a bulk liquid. Depending on the pore size of the used particles, capillary forces may also play a role in retaining the extractant. Otherwise, van-der-Waals forces, pi-pi-interactions or hydrophobic interactions might stabilize the extractant inside the particle pores. However, the possible decrease of extractant loss depends largely on the pore size and the water solubility of the extractant. Nonetheless, SIRs have a significant advantage over e.g. custom made ion-exchange resins with chemically bonded ligands. SIRs can be reused for different separation tasks by just rinsing one complexing agent out and re-impregnating them with another more suitable extractant. This way, potentially expensive design and production steps of e.g. affinity resins can be avoided. Finally, by filling the whole volume of the particle pores with an extractant (complexing agent), a higher capacity for solutes can be achieved than with ordinary adsorption or ion exchange resins, where only the surface area is available.|$|E
25|$|Chemists often exploit {{differences}} in solubilities to separate and purify compounds from reaction mixtures, using {{the technique of}} <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction. This applies in vast areas of chemistry from drug synthesis to spent nuclear fuel reprocessing.|$|E
25|$|An {{effective}} {{sample preparation}} protocol, usually involving either <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction (LLE) or solid phase extraction (SPE) and frequently derivatisation can remove ion suppressing species {{from the sample}} matrix prior to analysis. These common approaches may also remove other interferences, such as isobaric species.|$|E
25|$|Solvent {{impregnated}} resins (SIRs) are {{commercially available}} (macro)porous resins impregnated with a solvent/an extractant. In this approach, a liquid extractant is {{contained within the}} pores of (adsorption) particles. Usually, the extractant is an organic liquid. Its purpose is to extract one or more dissolved components from a surrounding aqueous environment. The basic principle combines adsorption, chromatography and <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction.|$|E
25|$|PUREX, {{the current}} {{standard}} method, is an acronym standing for Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by EXtraction. The PUREX {{process is a}} <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction method used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, to extract uranium and plutonium, independent of each other, from the fission products. This is the most developed and widely used process in the industry at present.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of this approach}} is the need to dispose of the ammonium sulfate byproduct. This problem has led some manufacturers to develop energy-efficient methods of separating formic acid from the excess water used in direct hydrolysis. In one of these processes (used by BASF) the formic acid is removed from the water by <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction with an organic base.|$|E
25|$|This is a <b>liquid-liquid</b> {{extraction}} process which uses {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} as the extractant. The extraction is by a solvation mechanism. This process has the disadvantage of requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. This process has been replaced by the PUREX process.|$|E
25|$|Spiral Flow/Cross Flow: One fluid is in spiral {{flow and}} the other in a cross flow. Spiral flow {{passages}} are welded at each side for this type of spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding pressure loss. It can be used for <b>liquid-liquid</b> applications if one liquid has a considerably greater flow rate than the other.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that SAM formation occurs in two steps: an initial fast step of adsorption and a second slower step of monolayer organization. Adsorption occurs at the <b>liquid–liquid,</b> liquid–vapor, and liquid-solid interfaces. The transport of molecules to the surface occurs due {{to a combination of}} diffusion and convective transport. According to the Langmuir or Avrami kinetic model the rate of deposition onto the surface is proportional to the free space of the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} rare-earth elements are the minerals bastnäsite, monazite, and loparite and the lateritic ion-adsorption clays. Despite their high relative abundance, rare-earth minerals {{are more difficult}} to mine and extract than equivalent sources of transition metals (due in part to their similar chemical properties), making the rare-earth elements relatively expensive. Their industrial use was very limited until efficient separation techniques were developed, such as ion exchange, fractional crystallization and <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction during the late 1950s and early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{previous}} technique, the TIPS phase separation procedure {{requires the use of}} a solvent with a low melting point that is easy to sublime. For example, dioxane could be used to dissolve polylactic acid, then phase separation is induced through the addition of a small quantity of water: a polymer-rich and a polymer-poor phase are formed. Following cooling below the solvent melting point and some days of vacuum-drying to sublime the solvent, a porous scaffold is obtained. <b>Liquid-liquid</b> phase separation presents the same drawbacks of emulsification/freeze-drying.|$|E
25|$|Immiscible liquids, such {{as water}} and toluene, easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are {{referred}} to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a <b>liquid–liquid</b> separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.|$|E
25|$|Poor quality {{diesel fuel}} {{has been used}} as an {{extraction}} agent for <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction of palladium from nitric acid mixtures. Such use has been proposed as a means of separating the fission product palladium from PUREX raffinate which comes from used nuclear fuel. In this system of solvent extraction, the hydrocarbons of the diesel act as the diluent while the dialkyl sulfides act as the extractant. This extraction operates by a solvation mechanism. So far, neither a pilot plant nor full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium, rhodium or ruthenium from nuclear wastes created by the use of nuclear fuel.|$|E
25|$|The chosen {{composition}} of the mobile phase (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components ("analytes") and stationary phase (e.g. hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process {{taking place in the}} column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e. in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).|$|E
25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E
25|$|Phase {{separation}} {{allows for}} three-dimensional sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds {{to be created}} {{without the use of}} specialized equipment. The five steps involved in phase separation are polymer dissolution, phase separation and gelation, solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and freeze drying in water. The final product is a continuous fiber network. Phase separation can be modified to fit many different applications, and pore structure can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from <b>liquid–liquid</b> to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. Phase separation is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.|$|E
25|$|The term colloid is used {{primarily}} {{to describe a}} broad range of solid-liquid (and/or <b>liquid-liquid)</b> mixtures, all of which contain distinct solid (and/or liquid) particles which are dispersed to various degrees in a liquid medium. The term is specific {{to the size of the}} individual particles, which are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit Brownian motion. If the particles are large enough, then their dynamic behavior in any given period of time in suspension would be governed by forces of gravity and sedimentation. But if they are small enough to be colloids, then their irregular motion in suspension can be attributed to the collective bombardment of a myriad of thermally agitated molecules in the liquid suspending medium, as described originally by Albert Einstein in his dissertation. Einstein concluded that this erratic behavior could adequately be described using the theory of Brownian motion, with sedimentation being a possible long-term result. This critical size range (or particle diameter) typically ranges from tens of angstroms (10−10m) to a few micrometres (10−6m).|$|E
500|$|Commercial {{zirconium}} metal typically contains 1–3% of hafnium, {{which is usually}} not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar. [...] Their neutron-absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors. [...] Several separation schemes are in use. [...] The <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction of the thiocyanate-oxide derivatives exploits {{the fact that the}} hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl isobutyl ketone than in water. [...] This method is used mainly in United States.|$|E
500|$|After {{the mixture}} is dissolved, iridium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by precipitating ammonium hexachloroiridate (...) or by extracting [...] with organic amines. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure Tennant and Wollaston used for their separation. The second method can be planned as continuous <b>liquid–liquid</b> extraction and is therefore more suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
500|$|These {{equations}} are simplified: it {{is suspected}} that bisulfate (HSO4−) and chloride compete as ligands for the Nb(V) and Ta(V) ions, when sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are used, respectively. [...] The tantalum and niobium fluoride complexes are then {{removed from the}} aqueous solution by <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction into organic solvents, such as cyclohexanone, octanol, and methyl isobutyl ketone. This simple procedure allows the removal of most metal-containing impurities (e.g. iron, manganese, titanium, zirconium), which remain in the aqueous phase {{in the form of}} their fluorides and other complexes.|$|E
500|$|The bismuth (or {{sometimes}} bismuth trioxide) {{target is}} dissolved in, for example, concentrated nitric or perchloric acid. Astatine is extracted using an organic solvent such as butyl or isopropyl ether, or thiosemicarbazide. A separation yield of 93% using nitric acid has been reported, falling to 72% {{by the time}} purification procedures were completed (distillation of nitric acid, purging residual nitrogen oxides, and redissolving bismuth nitrate to enable <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction).At from an Irradiated 209Bi Target for Radiopharmaceutical Applications |journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=262 |issue=3|pages=593–599|doi=10.1007/s10967-005-0481-7|subscription=yes}} Wet methods involve [...] "multiple radioactivity handling steps" [...] and are not well suited for isolating larger quantities of astatine.

500|$|The {{chemical}} properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical, {{which makes the}} two difficult to separate. The methods first used — fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the fractionated distillation of the chloride — have not proven suitable for an industrial-scale production. After zirconium was chosen as material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s, a separation method had to be developed. <b>Liquid-liquid</b> extraction processes {{with a wide variety}} of solvents were developed and are still used for the production of hafnium. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of zirconium refinement. The end product of the separation is hafnium(IV) chloride. The purified hafnium(IV) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction [...] with magnesium or sodium, as in the Kroll process.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} {{berkelium}} readily assumes oxidation state +4 in solids, and is relatively stable {{in this state}} in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents {{can be applied to}} the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromates (...) , bismuthates (...) , chromates ( [...] and CrO), silver(I) thiolate (...) , lead(IV) oxide (...) , ozone (...) , or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), amines, tributyl phosphate or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains).|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the distribution of radioactive metals for analytical purposes, Solvent Impregnated Resins (SIRs) can be used. SIRs are porous particles, which contain an extractant inside their pores. This approach avoids the <b>liquid-liquid</b> separation step required in conventional <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction. For the preparation of SIRs for radioanalytical separations, organic Amberlite XAD-4 or XAD-7 can be used.

2500|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{real-world}} scientific context by C. Casagrande et al. in 1988 to describe spherical glass particles {{with one of the}} hemispheres hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic. In that work, the amphiphilic beads were synthesized by protecting one hemisphere with varnish and chemically treating the other hemisphere with a silane reagent. This method resulted in a particle with equal hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas. In 1991, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes mentioned the term [...] "Janus" [...] particle in his Nobel lecture. Janus particles are named after the two faced Roman god Janus because these particles may be said to have [...] "two faces" [...] since they possess two distinct types of properties. de Gennes pushed for the advancement of Janus particles by pointing out these [...] "Janus grains" [...] have the unique property of densely self-assembling at <b>liquid–liquid</b> interfaces, while allowing material transport to occur through the gaps between the solid amphiphilic particles.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Stichlmair {{developed}} electroextraction at the University of Essen in Germany in 1987 as {{an improvement}} on <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction in an electric field. [...] Electric fields {{are applied to}} enhance the demixing of a sample in a two-phase system. [...] However, as current flows through the system, the resulting convective mixing disrupts separation. [...] Electroextraction corrects for this. [...] Two or three liquid phases that are electrically conductive and immiscible with one another are kept between electrodes, and upon addition of an electric field, charged particles travel from one phase to another separating anions and cations. [...] A two-phase system brings anions into one phase and cations into the other. [...] A three phase system extracts anions and cations into the two outer phases while leaving uncharged particles in the middle phase. [...] Convective mixing is restricted to each phase and does not travel between phases. [...] A diagram is given in figure 1. [...] Organic phases that are used typically have small amounts of water added {{in order to be}} conductive. [...] Other possible phases include mixtures of water and highly polymerized substances, or water with non-ionic surfactants. [...] Electroextraction has also influenced the development of similar electrophoretic separation techniques involving a membrane between the two-phase systems.|$|E
2500|$|Partition {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of chromatography that chemists developed. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and <b>liquid–liquid</b> separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an [...] "inert" [...] solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.|$|E
