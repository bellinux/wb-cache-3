5|$|Some 843 {{conscientious}} objectors {{spent more}} than two years in prison; ten died while there, seventeen were initially given the death penalty (but received life imprisonment) and 142 were imprisoned on <b>life</b> <b>sentences.</b> Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution were disenfranchised for five years after the war.|$|E
5|$|The judge {{concluded}} that Awan had wielded the knife, was the ringleader {{of the group}} and had intended to kill. The three received <b>life</b> <b>sentences,</b> with Awan to serve a minimum of 18 years and the others at least 16. Mahrad was cleared of murder and manslaughter.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>Life</b> <b>sentence</b> in Ireland {{may last}} {{for the natural}} life of the convict. It is not {{necessarily}} [...] "life imprisonment" [...] in practice, as {{not all of the}} <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> is generally served in prison custody. The granting of temporary or early release of <b>life</b> <b>sentenced</b> prisoners is a feature of the Irish prison system handled by the Minister for Justice and Equality.|$|R
50|$|Salter {{received}} a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> {{as part of}} a plea agreement. In 1994 Kristi Koslow was convicted of murder. She also {{received a}} <b>life</b> <b>sentence.</b> Dillingham refused a plea agreement, was convicted, and received the death penalty.|$|R
5|$|After {{the close}} of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial in 1947–48, part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials held under United States {{military}} authority. The men were charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen death sentences and two <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional Einsatzgruppe leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.|$|E
5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> no further {{punishment}} could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|Around 12 {{percent of}} Auschwitz's 6,500 staff {{who survived the}} war were {{eventually}} brought to trial. Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial. On 25 November 1947, the Auschwitz Trial began in Kraków, when Poland's Supreme National Tribunal brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff. The trial's defendants included commandant Arthur Liebehenschel, women's camp leader Maria Mandel, and camp leader Hans Aumeier. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, 7 <b>life</b> <b>sentences,</b> and 9 prison sentences ranging from three to fifteen years. Hans Münch, an SS doctor who had several former prisoners testify on his behalf, {{was the only person}} to be acquitted.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013 Kidada Savage {{was convicted}} of various crimes, {{including}} retaliating against witnesses and aiding racketeering. In February 2014 Surrick imposed a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> plus ten years; the <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> was mandatory. Kidada Savage tried to delay the sentencing but Surrick denied the request.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{most notable}} for {{successfully}} challenging the Home Secretary's powers to set minimum terms for <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> prisoners. On 25 November 2002, the Law Lords ruled {{in favour of}} Anderson's claim that it was incompatible with human rights for politicians to set minimum terms for <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> prisoners, {{and the next day}} the European Court of Human Rights agreed with this decision, meaning that politicians in European countries can no longer decide the minimum length of imprisonment for anyone serving a <b>life</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{was arrested}} on December 4, 1990, and {{received}} a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> and an additional 15-year sentence for murder and Mafia association. In 1998, he received a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for ordering the killing in 1989 of the Christian Democrat politician Lodovico Ligato, {{former head of the}} Italian State Railways. Ligato demanded a 10 percent bribe on public work contracts, jeopardizing agreements already reached among a so-called [...] "business committee" [...] of local politicians and 'Ndrangheta groups. In March 2001, he received another <b>life</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight <b>life</b> <b>sentences.</b> Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 2006, Lawrence and Rush, {{the first}} of the nine to face sentencing, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The next day, Czugaj and Stephens were sentenced to life imprisonment, and the group ringleaders, Chan and Sukumaran, were sentenced to death by firing squad, the first ever death {{sentences}} imposed by the Denpasar District Court. The other three, Norman, Chen and Nguyen, were all sentenced to life imprisonment on 15 February 2006. On 26 April 2006, Lawrence, Nguyen, Chen, and Norman appealed and had their sentences reduced to 20 years, while the <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> for Czugaj and Stephens were upheld. Prosecutors launched appeals against the changes in their sentences.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real <b>life,</b> <b>sentences</b> can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of Cristina Kirchner continued {{the trials of}} military personnel involved in the Dirty War, started by her husband. There {{have been more than}} 500 people sentenced, and 1,000 convicted, in a process that was unprecedented in Latin America. De facto president Jorge Rafael Videla, who was convicted and given a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> in 1985 and pardoned years later, received a new <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> in 2010. General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, who waged war against the leftist guerrillas in the northern Argentine provinces, received a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|A third person, former UDR soldier John James Somerville (aged 37, a lorry-helper and {{the brother}} of Wesley), was arrested {{following}} an RUC raid in Dungannon on 26 September 1980. He was charged with the Miami Showband murders, the attempted murder of Stephen Travers, and the murder of Patrick Falls in 1974. He was given {{a total of four}} <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> (three for the murders of the Miami Showband members and one for the Falls murder) on 9 November 1981; he had pleaded not guilty. The three convicted UVF men, although admitting to having been at the scene, denied having shot anyone. None of the men ever named their accomplices, and the other UVF gunmen were never caught. The three men were sent to serve their sentence in the Maze Prison, on the outskirts of Lisburn. Fortnight Magazine reported that on 1 June 1982, John James Somerville began a hunger strike at the Maze to obtain special category status. Crozier, McDowell, and Somerville were released after 1998 {{under the terms of the}} Belfast Agreement.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January 2005, when Basciano {{was indicted}} for the Pizzolo murder, Massino was {{identified}} by news sources as the then-anonymous fellow mobster who secretly recorded his confession, to the public disgust of Massino's family. Further confirmation of Massino's defection came in February as he was identified as the source for the graveyard, then in May when the Justice Department dropped {{the threat of the}} death penalty regarding the Sciascia case. In a hearing on June 23, 2005, Massino finalized his deal and plead guilty to ordering the Sciascia murder. For this and his 2004 conviction he was sentenced to two consecutive <b>life</b> <b>sentences,</b> with a possible reduction depending on his service as a witness. That same day Josephine Massino negotiated a settlement to satisfy the forfeiture claim, keeping the homes of herself and Massino's mother as well as some rental properties while turning over, among other assets, a cache of $7 million and hundreds of gold bars, and the Casablanca restaurant.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, {{after hours of}} interrogation. He initially proclaimed his innocence. According to an expert in Peruvian law, the confession fit a defense strategy {{of trying to get}} the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery. Peruvian president Alan García Pérez used the case to seek the reinstatement of the death penalty for murder.|$|E
