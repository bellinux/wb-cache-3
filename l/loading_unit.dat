40|$|The BMW Group uses <b>load</b> <b>units</b> for the {{transportation}} of assembly parts from the suppliers to {{the plants and}} for the internal material flow. This thesis analyses the advantageousness of introducing a <b>load</b> <b>unit</b> with a new size. There are three reasons why the current choice of containers is not sufficient. Firstly, {{there is a certain}} range of assembly parts that does not fit very well into the existing standard <b>load</b> <b>units.</b> Secondly, the average measurements of the parts have grown in the last years and thirdly, several of the existing containers leave unused space in {{the transportation}} vehicles. For this the relevant costs and other, more qualitative aspects like the placing at the assembly line are considered. A container size is identified that offers a significant savings potential. For this potential the handling and transportation costs are identified as the relevant leverages. These costs are found to depend mainly on the utilisation degree of the <b>load</b> <b>units.</b> To calculate the different utilisation degrees, a packing-algorithm in form of a four-block heuristic is applied and its results are extrapolated on the basis of existing BMW packing information. Thus, several assembly parts are identified that fit better into the suggested <b>load</b> <b>unit</b> than in the existing ones. These results are assessed using BMW’s expense ratios for handling and transportation. 80 parts are determined for which the migration to the new size would result in savings of more than 5, 000 EUR for each per year in Dingolfing. Together, these parts offer a savings potential of about 0. 9 million Euro...|$|R

50|$|To {{accommodate}} EUR-pallets, {{there are}} derivative intermodal containers {{that are about}} 2 in wider — these {{are commonly known as}} “pallet-wide” containers. These containers feature an internal width of 2440 mm for easy loading of two 1200 mm long pallets side by side - many sea shipping providers in Europe allow these, as overhangs on standard containers are sufficient to fit them in the usual interlock spaces. Especially the 45 ft pallet-wide high-cube shortsea container has gained wide acceptance, as these containers can replace the A-Behälter swap bodies with a length of 13670 mm that are common for truck transport in Europe.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of a power system is to supply its customers with electrical energy as economically as possible and with acceptable reliability and quality. Generating capacity adequacy evaluation is {{the oldest and most}} extensively studied aspect of power system reliability assessment. A wide range of methods have been developed to perform this evaluation. Two computer programs were developed based on the analytical and simulation techniques and used as tools in this research work. A number of basic considerations in generating capacity adequacy evaluation are investigated. Generating unit residence time distributions and peaking <b>load</b> <b>units</b> are incorporated in the analysis. Two commonly encountered misconceptions regarding the basic system reliability indices are examined by applying the two programs to two reliability test systems. Reliability index probability distributions can be used to supplement the information provided by the expected index values. The concept of creating distributions and the additional information that can be obtained is illustrated in this thesis. Generating unit residence time distributions are generally categorized as being either exponential or non-exponential in form. The exponential distribution is utilized, however, in virtually all practical system studies. The impacts on the system reliability of non-exponential unit state residence time distributions are examined in this research. Peaking <b>load</b> <b>units</b> and base <b>load</b> <b>units</b> have different operating characteristics.
