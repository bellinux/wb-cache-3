50|$|German Shepherds have a two-layer coat {{which is}} close and dense {{with a thick}} undercoat. The coat is {{accepted}} in two variants; medium and long. The <b>long-hair</b> gene is recessive, making the <b>long-hair</b> variety rarer. Treatment of the <b>long-hair</b> variation differs across standards; they are accepted but not competed with standard coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while they can compete with standard coated dogs but are considered a fault in the American Kennel Club. The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b—while short-haired type is listed as the variety a.|$|E
50|$|The urban {{legend of}} the Pittsburgh Refrigerator Cats {{periodically}} resurfaced in the twentieth century. The Greenfield Daily Report (January 21, 1929) printed a contributor’s reminiscence regarding the local carpenter having an odd-looking kittens. It was a white <b>long-hair,</b> but {{did not look like}} a Persian. The correspondent described it as looking more like a polar bear’s cub. The carpenter claimed it was a Cold Storage Cat. The account was attributed to Mara Evens in the Saturday Evening Post, adding that after several generations roaming the neighbourhood, the descendants of the Cold Storage cats reverted to shorthairs. This would have been the case if <b>long-hair</b> cats bred with short-haired cats, because the gene for <b>long-hair</b> is recessive.|$|E

5000|$|The terms {{used for}} the {{movement}} often reflect the viewpoint of the writer. In modern Chinese the war {{is often referred to}} as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, reflecting both a Nationalist and a Communist point of view that the Taiping represented a popular ideological movement of either Han nationalism or proto-communist values. In the 19th century the Qing did not label the conflict either a civil war or a movement--since that would lend the Taiping credibility--but they instead referred to the tumultuous civil war as a period of chaos (乱), rebellion (逆) or military ascendancy (军兴). The Qing referred to the Taiping as Yue Bandits (粤匪 or 粤贼) in official sources, a reference was made to their origins in the southeastern province of Guangdong. At other times it was referred to as the Hong-Yang Rebellion (洪杨之乱), pointing to the two most prominent leaders, Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing, and it was also dismissively referred to as the Red Sheep Rebellion (红羊之乱), because [...] "Hong-Yang" [...] sounds like [...] "Red Sheep" [...] in Chinese. More colloquially, the Chinese called the Taiping some variant of <b>Long-Hairs</b> (长毛鬼、长髪鬼、髪逆、髪贼), because they did not shave their foreheads and braid their hair into a queue as Qing subjects were obligated to do, allowing their hair to grow long.|$|R

Though some breeders consider the Oriental breed synonymous to the Balinese breed, {{they are not the}} same breed due to being classified as another breed and standard. The primary reason for this classification has been due to the goal of keeping Siamese and Balinese lines pure or distinguished.|$|E

Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform and wanted to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, the uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.

The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with <b>long-hair</b> breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were once again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966 The first Birman cats were seal point. The blue point colour was introduced in 1959 using blue Persian lines. New colours were later added by English breeders including chocolate, red, and tabby/lynx points. Birmans have also been used in the development of new breeds, notably including the Ragdoll.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{long-haired}} Bengals (more properly semi-long-haired) {{have occurred}} {{since the beginning}} of the Bengal breeding program, as longer-haired domestic cats were among those used in crosses with the wild Asian leopard cat to produce the breed. Some current F4 and later purebred Bengals carry the recessive long-haired genes and when they are mated with each other, they can produce long-haired Bengals. (See Cat coat genetics#Genes involved in fur length and texture.) Such offspring were usually spayed or neutered until ongoing intentional development of the <b>long-hair</b> variety, as they did not then qualify as Bengal breeding stock due to their non-conforming long or semi-long coats. On August 21, 2013, long-haired Bengals were granted [...] "preliminary" [...] breed status in the New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) registry under the breed name Cashmere, at the behest of a breeder named Damian Vaughan. They are currently not recognized by any other cat registries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{semantic}} {{system is}} {{developed from the}} beginning through early interactions with adults. At first, this usually involves labeling (e.g. This is a dog). Then labeling becomes more detailed (e.g., It is a Labrador dog. Its coat is black.) The child learns {{that there is a}} set of [...] "dog attributes" [...] and that within the category [...] "dog", there are subsets of [...] "dog" [...] (e.g. <b>long-hair,</b> short-hair). The development of this system and the development of the important concepts that relate to the system are largely accomplished as children begin to explore language independently. As children speak about what they’ve done and play out their experiences, they are making personal associations between their experiences and language. This is critical to success in later literacy practices such as reading comprehension and writing. The meaning people bring to the reading is available to them through every cuing system, but it’s particularly influential as we move from our sense of the syntactic patterns to the semantic structures.|$|E

[...] Another explanation says that the animal {{is found in the}} western Rong region Sichuan, so it is thus named. There is a kind of <b>long-hair</b> dog that is also called Nao. ... The book Tan Yuan 談苑 by Yang Yi (楊億): The golden monkey is found in the deep mountains in Sichuan and Shaanxi. It looks like an ape. It has a long tail of golden color. So it is colloquially called Jinsirong 金絲狨 (meaning [...] "golden thread monkey"). It is quick at climbing trees. It loves its tail dearly. When shot by a poisonous arrow, it will bite off its own tail when poisoned. During the Song dynasty (960-1279), only officials of the administration and military of the third rank and above were allowed to use seats and bedding made of golden monkey hide. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401)This entry has two subheadings: the yuan 猨 or changbeihou 長臂猴 [...] "gibbon, Hylobates agilis" [...] and the du 獨 (below).The ape is good at climbing trees. It is found in the deep mountains in the Chuan and Guang regions. It looks like a monkey, but has very long arms. It is an animal that can practice Daoist qi (Vital Energy), so it lives a long life. Some say it has one arm stretching {{from one side to the}} other. This is not correct. Its arm bone can be made into a flute that sounds very clear and resonant. Apes come in different colors: blue-green, white, black, yellow and crimson. It is a kind and quiet animal, and likes to eat fruits. It lives in forests and can jump over a distance of several dozen chi. But when it falls and drops onto the ground, it may suffer from excessive diarrhea and then die. Treatment is the drinking of juice of Fuzi/radix aconiti lateralis/daughter root of common monkshood. Apes live in groups. The male cries a lot. It makes three cries consecutively. The cry sounds miserable and is penetrating. The book Guihai Zhi 桂海志 by Fan Chengda: There are three varieties of apes: Yellow ones with golden thread; black ones with jade faces; and black ones with black faces. Some say the pure black one is the male, and the golden thread one is the female. A male one shouts and a female does not. The book Rixun Ji 日詢記 by Wang Ji: People in the Guang region say that when an ape is born, it is black and male, When it gets old, it turns yellow and its genitals become ulcerous, and then it turns into a female.

40|$|Background: Seven donkey breeds are {{recognized}} by the French studbook. Individuals from the Pyrenean, Provence, Berry Black, Normand, Cotentin and Bourbonnais breeds are characterized by a short coat, while those from the Poitou breed (Baudet du Poitou) are characterized by a <b>long-hair</b> phenotype. We hypothesized that loss-of-function mutations in the FGF 5 (fibroblast growth factor 5) gene, which {{are associated with a}} <b>long-hair</b> phenotype in several mammalian species, may account for the special coat feature of Poitou donkeys. To the best of our knowledge, mutations in FGF 5 have never been described in Equidae. Methods: We sequenced the FGF 5 gene from 35 long-haired Poitou donkeys, as well as from a panel of 67 short-haired donkeys from the six other French breeds and 131 short-haired ponies and horses. Results: We identified a recessive c. 433 _ 434 delAT frameshift deletion in FGF 5, present in Poitou and three other donkey breeds and a recessive nonsense c. 245 G > A substitution, present in Poitou and four other donkey breeds. The frameshift deletion was associated with the <b>long-hair</b> phenotype in Poitou donkeys when present in two copies (n = 31) or combined with the nonsense mutation (n = 4). The frameshift deletion led to a stop codon at position 159 whereas the nonsense mutation led to a stop codon at position 82 in the FGF 5 protein. In silico, the two truncated FGF 5 proteins were predicted to lack the critical beta strands involved in the interaction between FGF 5 and its receptor, a mandatory step to inhibit hair growth. Conclusions: Our results highlight the allelic heterogeneity of the <b>long-hair</b> phenotype in donkeys and enlarge the panel of recessive FGF 5 loss-of-function alleles described in mammals. Thanks to the DNA test developed in this study, breeders of non-Poitou breeds {{will have the opportunity to}} identify <b>long-hair</b> carriers in their breeding stocks...|$|E
