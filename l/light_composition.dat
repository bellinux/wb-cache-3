Strong modifications of the phase-space distribution of produced particles as compared to leading-twist models are predicted which reflect in the properties of cosmic ray induced air showers in the atmosphere.

The same conclusion is obtained using a variety of assumptions about the cosmic ray spectrum. To the extent that precise spectral measurements will be possible by forthcoming experiments such as the Auger observatories, the method will further constrain data on composition of the ultra high energy cosmic rays.

30|$|We {{observe that}} the {{component}} of effluent crude oil at different period changes rapidly. This {{is because of}} the different oil/gas contact time at varying position in long cores. In this study, we divide the hydrocarbon of crude oil into four parts, followed by C 1 –C 6, C 7 –C 16, C 17 –C 35 and C 35 +. It can be seen that the hydrocarbon distribution of C 1 –C 16 component content is decreased in all experiments. The medium composition (C 7 –C 16) of 50  mD long core exhibits greater cracking extend. And heavy component is increased. It is deduced that oxygenation reaction products of ketone, aldehyde, acid and other substance in medium component would combine together through the chelation. As we know the effect of chelation can result in carbon chain growth. And we find that the range ability of <b>light</b> <b>composition</b> content is increased with the increasing of core permeability. While, heavy component content displays inverse. This can be an evident for higher extent of oxidation in higher permeability long cores. The variation maximum value of each component is also listed in Table  2.|$|E

The ankle of the spectrum is measured at 4 × 10 ^ 18 eV and a suppression above 3 × 10 ^ 19 eV consistent with the GZK effect is observed. At energies above 5. 5 × 10 ^ 19 eV a correlation with the distribution of nearby extragalactic objects is found, including an excess around the direction of Centaurus A, the nearest radio loud active galaxy. Measurements of the depth of shower maximum and its fluctuations suggest a gradual change in the average mass of the primary cosmic rays (under standard extrapolations of hadronic interaction models), being the results consistent with a <b>light</b> <b>composition</b> consisting mostly of protons at few× 10 ^ 18 eV and approaching the expectations from iron nuclei at 4 × 10 ^ 19 eV.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report a}} first {{measurement}} for ultrahighenergy cosmic {{rays of the}} correlation between the depth ofshower maximum and the signal in the water Cherenkov stations of air-showers registered simultaneouslyby the fluorescence and the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Such a correlationmeasurement is a unique feature of a hybrid air-shower observatory with sensitivity to both the electro-magnetic and muonic components. It allows an accurate determination of the spread of primary massesin the cosmic-ray flux. Up till now, constraints on the spread of primary masses have been dominatedby systematic uncertainties. The present correlation measurement is not affected by systematics in themeasurement of the depth of shower maximum or the signal in the water Cherenkov stations. Theanalysis relies on general characteristics of air showers and is thus robust also with respect to uncer-tainties in hadronic event generators. The observed correlation in the energy range around the ‘ankle’ atlg(E/eV) = 18. 5 – 19. 0 differs significantly from expectations for pure primary cosmic-ray compositions. A <b>light</b> <b>composition</b> made up of proton and helium only is equally inconsistent with observations. Thedata are explained well by a mixed composition including nuclei with mass A > 4.

40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 188 - 204 Data {{collected}} by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration,Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than 6 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than 75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99 % through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation {{is compatible with the}} hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuz’min effect). The angular scale of the correlation observed is a few degrees, which suggests a predominantly <b>light</b> <b>composition</b> unless the magnetic fields are very weak outside the thin disk of our galaxy. Our present data do not identify AGN as the sources of cosmic rays unambiguously, and other candidate sources which are distributed as nearby AGN are not ruled out.
