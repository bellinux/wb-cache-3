Here, we consider the case when the two remaining eigenvalues of F are complex conjugate, with corresponding right eigenvectors c±id (say). It is seen that the "directional ellipse" corresponding to the bivector c+id is preserved in the deformation, the ellipse associated with the bivector c+id being transformed into a similar and similarly situated ellipse. Any two material <b>line</b> <b>elements</b> at X along a pair of conjugate radii of the directional ellipse are deformed into material <b>line</b> <b>elements</b> along another pair of conjugate radii of this ellipse.
