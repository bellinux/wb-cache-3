40|$|Botrytis spp. cause several {{diseases}} in Allium crops {{and depending on}} meteorological conditions economic losses can exceed 50 %. Forecasting models improve plant protection and sometimes reduce consumption of fungicides, because applications are made precisely during the favourable periods for disease development. Our aim was to evaluate the iMETOS®sm B. cinerea forecasting model as an effective onion <b>leaf</b> <b>fleck</b> management system and estimate the variability of onion bulb pathogens during storage. Assessment of forecasting model data showed that favourable conditions for <b>leaf</b> <b>fleck</b> development arise in July, but greatly depend on that year’s meteorological conditions. During an experimental year the first sprayings with fungicides were applied as forecasted from the model, which resulted in application 19, 6 and 23 days earlier than conventional treatment application times. In 2012 - 2014 iMETOS®sm treatment yield increased by 3. 51 t ha- 1, 3. 87 t ha- 1 and 3. 40 t ha- 1 relative to the control. During storage most frequent injuries were fungal (44 %) and bacterial (41 %), followed by insects (7 %) and physiological (9 %). The highest prevalence of injuries was detected after 2 months of storage...|$|R

It is concluded that the lake breeze correlates effectively with flecking when the lake breeze is accompanied by a southerly gradient wind.

40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the potential for post-extraction algal residue (PEAR) to be incorporated as a protein source in the grazing sector of the beef cattle industry. In Experiment 1, blends <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> and conventional protein supplements (dried distillers? grains, DDG; cottonseed meal, CSM) were offered to steers consuming Bermudagrass to evaluate palatability <b>of</b> <b>PEAR.</b> Supplement completion, time required for consumption, and amount of supplement consumed were recorded. In Experiment 2, isonitrogenous amounts <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> and CSM (100 mg N/kg BW) were supplemented to steers consuming low-quality forage to compare effects on nutrient utilization. Experiment 3 evaluated the optimal inclusion rate <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> to steers consuming low-quality forage. Treatments included no supplemental protein, 3 levels <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> (50, 100, and 150 mg N/kg BW) and 1 level of CSM (100 mg N/kg BW). In Experiment 4, the effects of upstream operations on the nutritive value <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> were quantified. Observations indicate PEAR may be blended with existing protein sources in the beef industry without negatively affecting palatability, {{but there may be}} palatability concerns when PEAR is offered alone. Provision of 100 mg N/kg BW <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> or CSM stimulated forage intake (P ? 0. 05) and increased N retention (P = 0. 02) relative to unsupplemented animals. Imbalances in mineral intakes (Ca:P ratio of 8 : 1) were observed when PEAR was supplemented, but not CSM. Total digestible OM intake (TDOMI) responded quadratically (P = 0. 01) to increasing provision <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> with maximization occurring when PEAR was provided at 100 mg N/kg BW. There was not a difference in TDOMI (P = 0. 13) at isonitrogenous levels <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> and CSM, indicating forage utilization was stimulated to a similar extent. Excess mineral levels and imbalances in PEAR were largely a result of cultivation, harvesting, and extraction procedures which could be controlled. Thus, there is potential to alter production streams to optimize oil yield and co-product value. Overall, our results indicate PEAR can be incorporated as a protein source in the beef cattle industry, thus increasing economic viability of biofuel production from algal biomass...|$|R
