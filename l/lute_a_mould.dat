50|$|Zithers {{are played}} by {{strumming}} or plucking the strings, either with the fingers (sometimes using an accessory called a plectrum or pick), sounding the strings with a bow, or, with varieties {{of the instrument}} like the santur or cimbalom, by beating the strings with specially shaped hammers. Like <b>a</b> guitar or <b>lute,</b> <b>a</b> zither's body serves as a resonating chamber (sound box), but, unlike guitars and <b>lutes,</b> <b>a</b> zither lacks a distinctly separate neck assembly. The number of strings varies, from one to more than fifty.|$|R

25|$|The European lute and {{the modern}} Near-Eastern oud descend from a common {{ancestor}} via diverging evolutionary paths. The lute is used in {{a great variety of}} instrumental music from the Medieval to the late Baroque eras and was the most important instrument for secular music in the Renaissance. During the Baroque music era, the lute was used as one of the instruments which played the basso continuo accompaniment parts. It is also an accompanying instrument in vocal works. The lute player either improvises ("realizes") a chordal accompaniment based on the figured bass part, or plays a written-out accompaniment (both music notation and tabulature ("tab") are used for <b>lute).</b> <b>As</b> a small instrument, the <b>lute</b> produces <b>a</b> relatively quiet sound. The player of <b>a</b> <b>lute</b> is called <b>a</b> lutenist, lutanist or lutist, and <b>a</b> maker of <b>lutes</b> (or any similar string instrument, or violin family instruments) is referred to as a luthier.|$|R
