40|$|There are no {{effective}} approaches to treatment {{and prevention of}} many infectious diseases representing a significant danger to humans. So far, mass vaccine immunization {{is among the most}} efficient and widely used approaches to prevent outbreaks of viral and bacterial infections. Mass immunization helps {{to reduce the number of}} carriers of infections, thus significantly decreasing probability of infection dissemination. Recent promising developments include genetically engineered vaccines based on adenoviral vectors, many of which are already at various stages of clinical trials. Genetic immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines allows delivery of the genes encoding only required antigens to human cells, thus allowing avoidance of conventional vaccines, e. g., <b>live</b> <b>pathogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> and bacteria, and providing versatile technologies for vaccine development. These advances significantly reduce the time needed for vaccine production and, respectively, the development and creation of new vaccines, thus being an important factor in decreasing risk of epidemics and pandemics. Advantages of adenoviral vectors include high ability of penetration into human cells, a potential for induction of both humoral and cellular immune response, rather long and active production of antigens following administration of adenoviral vectors into the human, safe usage, ease of obtaining preparative quantities of vaccines. In this review, we provide information about the ongoing worldwide clinical trials of adenoviral vector-based vaccines against various infectious diseases, like as to consider selection parameters of volunteers participating in the testing, vaccination schedule, doses and methods of drug administration, results of completed experiments, and preliminary data on currently ongoing research...|$|R
40|$|Through cognate {{interaction}} between antigen-specific B-cell and CD 4 + αβ T cells, the CD 4 + αβ T cells secrete cytokines that initiate immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching from IgM to IgG. In this study, {{we show that}} formalin-inactivated influenza PR 8 virus induces virus-specific IgM and IgG responses {{in the absence of}} CD 4 + T cells and that all four subclasses of IgG are produced. The immunized CD 4 -deficient mice were also found to be completely protected against lethal infection with <b>live,</b> <b>pathogenic</b> influenza <b>virus.</b> The ability of CD 4 + T-cell-deficient mice to generate these IgG responses was not found to be impaired when these mice were depleted of CD 8 + T cells with an anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibody. In contrast, αβ T-cell-deficient mice (TCRβ−/−) were not found to produce significant amounts of IgG upon immunization with formalin-inactivated PR 8 virus. These results suggest that CD 4 − CD 8 − double-negative αβ T cells are playing a role in regulating Ig class switching in the absence of CD 4 + T cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImmunoglobulin (Ig) class {{switching}} {{can occur in}} the absence of αβ+ or γδ+ T cells when mice are infected with certain live viruses, although CD 4 T helper cells are believed to be essential for induction of a high-affinity antibody response and for efficient isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA production. However, little information is available about the immune responses after mucosal immunization of CD 4 + T cell-deficient mice with inactivated virus. In this study, we show that intranasal immunization with formalin-inactivated influenza A/PR 8 / 34 virus induces IgG and IgA responses in serum and IgA responses in mucosal secretions in CD 4 + T cell-deficient mice. All four subclasses of IgG were produced. IgG 1 /IgG 2 a ratios were found to be from 1 to 1. 75, indicating that both Th 1 and Th 2 immune responses are induced by the inactivated influenza virus. The sera and mucosal secretions were found to have neutralizing activity against influenza virus in vitro. In addition, the mucosally immunized CD 4 + T cell-deficient mice were protected completely from challenge with a lethal dose of <b>live,</b> <b>pathogenic</b> influenza <b>virus.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that mucosal immunization with an inactivated virus induces immune responses in serum and mucosal secretions in CD 4 + T cell-deficient mice...|$|R

40|$|Highly <b>pathogenic</b> avian {{influenza}} <b>viruses</b> of subtype H 7 N 1 that emerged during an outbreak in 1999 and 2000 in Italy differ from their low-pathogenicity precursor viruses {{by changes in}} several genes, including three mutations in the NS 1 protein. Two of them involve amino acid exchanges located within or closely adjacent to the nuclear export signal of NS 1. The third mutation resulted in a new stop codon and thereby a C-terminal truncation of the NS 1 protein of the highly <b>pathogenic</b> <b>viruses.</b> To find out whether these mutations contribute to the phenotypic differences between the highly pathogenic and low <b>pathogenic</b> <b>viruses,</b> we generated recombinants of the highly pathogenic A/ostrich/Italy/ 984 / 00 strain that contained the nuclear export signal and/or the extended C terminus of NS 1 of a low <b>pathogenic</b> <b>virus</b> (A/chicken/Italy/ 1082 / 99). Using these recombinants we could demonstrate that replication rate and spread of infection in chicken fibroblast cultures, as well as infectivity for chicken embryos is reduced, whereas the mean death time for chicken embryos is increased, when the highly <b>pathogenic</b> <b>virus</b> acquires the NS 1 motifs of the low <b>pathogenic</b> <b>virus.</b> Analysis of beta interferon transcription in chicken fibroblasts infected with the recombinants revealed that the mutations observed in the nuclear export signal of the highly <b>pathogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> {{were responsible for the}} enhanced interferon antagonism of these viruses. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence studies in chicken fibroblasts showed that the nuclear export signal of the highly <b>pathogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> is responsible for cytoplasmic accumulation of NS 1, whereas the C-terminal truncation promotes transport into the nucleoli. Comparative analysis in human A 549 cells indicated that intracellular distribution of NS 1 is host specific. Taken together, these observations support the concept that compartmentalization of NS 1 within the cell contributes to the pathogenicity of {{avian influenza}} viruses...|$|R
