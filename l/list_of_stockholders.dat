60|$|The {{number and}} variety of such {{transactions}} in which the modes of doing business among men may be imitated with children, greatly to their enjoyment and interest, is endless. I could cite an instance when what was called a bank was in operation for many years among {{a certain number of}} children, with excellent effect. One was appointed president, another cashier, another paying-teller. There was a ledger under the charge of the cashier, with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>stockholders,</b> and the number of shares held by each, which was in proportion to the respective ages of the children. The bank building was a little toy secretary, something {{in the form of a}} safe, into which there mysteriously appeared, from time to time, small sums of money; the stockholders being as ignorant of the source from which the profits of the bank were derived as most stockholders probably are in the case of larger and more serious institutions. Once in six months, or at other periods, the money was counted, a dividend was declared, and the stockholders were paid in a regular and business-like manner.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the Etting family, the history of the Jewish {{community}} in Baltimore becomes more consecutive. It is uncertain when the Etting brothers, Reuben and Solomon, together with Levi Solomon, their uncle, came to Baltimore from York, Pa. On Jan. 4, 1796, Solomon Etting's name appears in the [...] "Advertiser" [...] as one of five persons authorized [...] "to receive proposals in writing for a house or suitable lot" [...] for a bank to be established in Baltimore Town. But there are indirect indications that the family settled in Baltimore before 1787. In the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>stockholders</b> of the same bank, published at the end of 1796, appear the following names: Solomon, Kitty, Reuben, Shinah, and Hetty Etting; Jacob F., Philadelphia, Benjamin, and Hetty Levy; and Levy and Myer Solomon. In the first directory of [...] "Baltimore Town and Fell's Point," [...] also published in 1796 - the year of the incorporation of Baltimore as a city - there are, in addition to the above, two Harts, three Jacobs, Philip Itzchkin, - Kahn, Benjamin Lyon, Solomon Raphael, and Isaac Solomon; and in the lists of letters remaining at the post-office occur the names of Hhym Levenstene and Benjamin Myers. Accordingly, the Jewish Encyclopedia estimates the Jewish population of Baltimore in 1796 at fifteen families.|$|E
