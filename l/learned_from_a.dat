5|$|Several Jews {{and other}} {{survivors}} of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis. Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance {{and there were no}} current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February.|$|E

Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order. McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement. Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.|$|E

5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the lessons <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> series of experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{member of}} the Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Park Board or the city of Nashville {{would be willing to}} pay for such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from country music star Conway Twitty, put {{together}} a group of investors including other country stars Cal Smith, Larry Gatlin, Jerry Reed, and Richard Sterban (bass singer of the Oak Ridge Boys), as well as other Nashvillians, in order to finance a stadium and a minor league team. Twenty shares valued at US$15,000 each were issued, with Schmittou purchasing 2shares, or 10percent of the team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou the site of Nashville's former softball fields on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (3km) south of downtown, for a period of 20years as long he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least $400,000 within 10years. In the second ten years, he would be required to pay the city seven percent of the team's total revenue.|$|E

5|$|Though Link {{must still}} collect several items {{in order to}} {{progress}} in the game (as in the previous and subsequent installments of the series), these special items grant abilities which either remain in permanent use {{for the rest of}} the game or can only be activated in the overworld. In place of actively used items, The Adventure of Link features eight spells for Link to use during action scenes. Each spell is <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> different wise man in one of the eight towns within Hyrule. Link often has to complete side-quests, such as retrieving lost items, before they will teach him their spells. Some spells and items are necessary for advancing beyond certain points in the game. Also, the Life spell becomes the main means of recovering health during action scenes, since healing Fairies are only found in rare fixed spots, and only appear randomly as overworld encounters.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E
5|$|In Shanghai {{during the}} 1930s, Sing {{and his friend}} Bone attempt to join the Deadly Axe Gang, which ruthlessly {{controls}} the city {{under the leadership of}} Brother Sum. Sing seeks to restore his confidence after being humiliated as a young boy while trying to protect a mute girl from bullies, due to the failure of the Buddhist Palm method he had <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pamphlet he bought from a beggar. Sing and Bone attempt to intimidate the residents of Pig Sty Alley but are chased off by its Landlady. Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of Sing and Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of the tenants, Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and Donut are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal that they too are martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and Donut die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, {{who are capable of}} returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> letter {{shown to}} him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that {{information}} to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany, received independent confirmation of Eichmann's whereabouts in 1957, but German agents were unable to find him until late 1959. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February. Zvi Aharoni, one of the Mossad agents responsible for Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960, said the photos were useful in confirming Eichmann's identity. On 23 May Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann was under arrest and in Israel. The next day Wiesenthal, while he was being interviewed by reporters, received a congratulatory telegram from Yad Vashem. He immediately became a minor celebrity, and began work on a book about his experiences. Ich jagte Eichmann: Tatsachenbericht (I Chased Eichmann: A True Story) was published six weeks before the trial opened in spring 1961. Wiesenthal helped the prosecution prepare their case and attended a portion of the trial. Eichmann was sentenced to death and was hanged on 1 June 1962.|$|E
