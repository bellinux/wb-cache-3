25|$|While costing £80 per {{horsepower}} {{compared to}} £60 for steam, the new locomotives ran 130,000 miles per year, compared to 35,000 and 60,000 miles {{per year for}} main line steam locomotives. The Chief Engineers Office found that one B class did the work of three steam locomotives. Their success led to further dieselisation, with the delivery of the T class <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> <b>units</b> from 1955, and the single ended S class mainline units from 1957.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{batch of}} 2H units, {{numbered}} 1119-1122, was built as 2-car units in 1958. These units were built for services on the Marshlink Line from [...] to Ashford, and associated <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> These <b>units</b> remained as two-car sets until 1979, and were reclassified as Class 204 upon {{the introduction of}} TOPS. In May 1979, following the disbandment of the four Class 206 units, they were strengthened to three cars and redesignated as Class 205s.|$|R
50|$|NSB Class 68 (NSB type 68) is a three-car {{electric}} {{multiple unit}} operated by Norges Statsbaner between 1956 and 2001. It was mainly used for local trains {{as well as}} <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> The <b>units</b> were built in two series, the A-series being delivered in 21 units between 1956-58 and the B-series in nine units between 1960-61. The motor cars were built by Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri and Skabo while the centre and end cars were built either by Skabo or by Strømmen.|$|R
5|$|NSB El 9 is {{a retired}} class of three {{electric}} locomotives built by Thune for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), with electrical equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) and Per Kure. The locomotives were delivered in 1947 after a three-year delay caused by wartime sabotage {{in response to the}} German occupation of Norway. They were used nearly exclusively on the Flåm Line and Hardanger <b>Line,</b> two steep <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> The <b>units</b> were used on the Flåm Line until 1983, when they were replaced by El 11. They were then used as shunters until being retired in 1988. Two of the locomotives have been preserved.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fleet of}} 17 two-coach [...] Sprinter units was {{inherited}} from Wessex Trains {{as part of}} the Greater Western franchise shuffle. The fleet had been refurbished by Wessex Trains in 2003, with 2+2 seating arranged in a mixture of 'airline' (face to back) and table seating. The fleet is widespread throughout the former Wessex area, and carried a maroon livery with advertising vinyls for South West Tourism. Each unit was sponsored by a district, town or attraction and carried a unique livery. Most received names of attractions, places and <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> Two <b>units</b> were repainted into the new First 'Local' livery, but all units are now due to receive the new green GWR livery. As part of a national fleet shuffle, eight units went to Arriva Trains Wales on 10 December 2006, and were replaced with 8 Class 158 units.|$|R

50|$|The shore {{station is}} linked to the first <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> as {{followed}} with 5 other <b>branching</b> <b>units</b> that are also linked to other <b>branching</b> <b>units.</b> This solid connection spur cable|forms a ring-shaped SONET network that has two cables in order to control the network traffic in two directions. A 2 by 2 Gbit/s data channel is implemented on the spur cable. Furthermore, each <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> is connected to a regional node station. And the connection between node stations and <b>branching</b> <b>units</b> provide 1 Gbit/s data rate using a fiber-optic cable. 6 Node stations split the back-haul into 6 separated regions and the network behavior in between each regions' devices is identical. Similar to the connections between node stations and <b>branching</b> <b>units,</b> node stations are linked to junction boxes with 1 Gbit/s data rate.|$|R

40|$|One {{key issue}} of {{seafloor}} observatory network {{is to ensure}} that the whole system operates normally when some equipment failure exists. <b>Branch</b> <b>Unit</b> can cut off the connection between the failure parts and the backbone network automatically and protect other equipment of the network from the impact of equipment failure. This paper proposes a design of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Unit.</b> The <b>Branch</b> <b>Unit</b> uses zener diode to provide power for the control circuits and constructs DWDM system {{with the help of the}} OADM. One <b>Branch</b> <b>Unit</b> model was built in this paper. Experiments verify the principle and functions of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Unit</b> and prove the feasibility of the design. The design provides a reference for the realization of the seafloor observatory network. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
