5|$|Licinius and Martinianus {{surrendered}} to Constantine at Nicomedia {{on the promise}} their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also killed.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> no longer be safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress {{as much as they}} could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be affected by it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed {{to work with the}} authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.|$|E
5|$|After British {{victory in}} World War II, Kenyatta {{received}} a call to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. Edna was pregnant with a second child, although she expected to never see her husband again; Kenyatta was aware that if they joined him in Kenya their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near {{to where he was}} born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyata met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss the future of the Koinange Independent Teachers' College in Githungui, with Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange's father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.|$|E
25|$|John von Neumann, Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil {{define the}} concept {{in terms of}} the {{technological}} creation of super intelligence.

25|$|The {{accident}} {{accelerated the}} introduction of British Railways' Automatic Warning System (AWS), although some in the industry thought more <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be saved by spending the money on installing more track circuits and colour light signals. By 1977 a third of British Rail track had been fitted with AWS.|$|E
25|$|The Fifth Hand, {{also from}} 1972, breaks from the serious nature of Loevy's themes {{to tell the}} story of a group of people {{addicted}} to the game of bridge. Nevertheless, his insights into the role that leisure activities play in people's <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be echoed over thirty years later in one of his most riveting documentaries, Sakhnin, My Life, about the Bnei Sakhnin football club from the Arab town of Sakhnin.|$|E
25|$|The medieval Baldrick was {{probably}} the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had {{worked very hard to}} get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be eternally entwined.|$|E

25|$|The loss of 30% of the country's {{generating}} capacity led to much greater reliance on {{liquified natural gas}} and coal. Unusual conservation measures were undertaken. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing. The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand. Converting to a nuclear-free gas and oil energy economy would cost {{tens of billions of}} dollars in annual fees. One estimate is that even including the disaster, more <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> have been lost if Japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{reported}} to the group's 61st Fighter Squadron on July 19, 1942, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The unit had just received the first production P-47B Thunderbolts, and, in effect, was flight testing the new fighter as it trained. While the 56th FG was responsible {{for many of the}} modifications that made later variants a successful fighter-bomber, the training resulted in more than forty crashes and 18 fatalities, many of which Johnson blamed on the inadequacy of the small airport at Bridgeport. However, he also asserted that many more <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> have been lost, had not the P-47 proved to have an exceptionally rugged airframe. The P-47 became the first USAAF aircraft to provide an understanding of compressibility and its effects.|$|E
25|$|Further on the way, they {{encountered}} a small settlement called Cavett's Station on September 25. After they had surrounded the place, Benge {{negotiated with the}} inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing {{them all over the}} pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; unfortunately, one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.|$|E
50|$|Bob Trumpy also {{hosted a}} national, postgame call-in show called NFL <b>Live.</b> NFL <b>Live</b> <b>would</b> officially become {{the name of}} the pregame show for the NFL on NBC {{television}} program.|$|R
50|$|Local Live {{expanded}} for season 5 with {{an audition}} tour across Simcoe County including Barrie, Orillia, Collingwood, Alliston, Borden and Midland. In addition, Local <b>Live</b> <b>would</b> broadcast on 4 additional stations.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the shows}} debut, {{director}} Ted Emery (Fast Forward, The Micallef Program, Kath & Kim) remarked {{in an interview}} that Let Loose <b>Live</b> <b>would</b> either soar majestically, or crash and burn.|$|R
25|$|Another {{reason behind}} the {{cancellation}} decision {{was that a}} new soap opera produced and owned by NBC (through its NBC Studios unit), Passions, had entered into production and was slated to begin airing on the network {{in the summer of}} 1999. To add Passions to its daytime schedule, NBC opted to cancel one of its existing serials instead of reclaiming one hour of programming time allocated for syndicated or local programming from its stations. Rumors abounded that Days of our <b>Lives</b> <b>would</b> be cancelled (despite being NBC's highest-rated daytime series), as renewal talks between NBC and Columbia Pictures Television were going poorly at the time (at the same time, there were rumors that ABC would cancel Port Charles to make room for Days on its schedule). There were also rumors that the low-rated, younger-skewing soap Sunset Beach (the lowest-rated of NBC's three daytime serials at the time) would be cancelled.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 320, Licinius reneged on the {{religious}} freedom promised by the Edict of Milan in 313 and began to oppress Christians anew. It became a challenge to Constantine in the west, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. Licinius, aided by Goth mercenaries, represented {{the past and the}} ancient Pagan faiths. Constantine and his Franks marched under the standard of the labarum, and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Supposedly outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious in the Battle of Adrianople. Licinius fled across the Bosphorus and appointed Martius Martinianus, the commander of his bodyguard, as Caesar, but Constantine next won the Battle of the Hellespont, and finally the Battle of Chrysopolis on 18 September 324. Licinius and Martinianus surrendered to Constantine at Nicomedia on the promise their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also eradicated. Thus Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman Empire, ending the Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy.|$|E
25|$|Mahmud Pasha {{drew up a}} {{document}} outlining the terms of surrender, and swore by his sword and by the Sultan's head that their <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be safe. Niccolò also demanded that he be given, in recompense, a domain of equivalent value. Learning of the surrender, Mehmed again crossed to the island, where he remained for four days. Accompanied by the notables of Mytilene, Niccolò surrendered the keys of the fortress to the Sultan, and begged for his forgiveness. Mehmed accepted, and instructed him to order the surrender of the other forts on the island—Methymna, Eressos, and Agioi Theodoroi (probably near Antissa)—as well. Niccolò complied, sending a letter with his seal to the forts, urging their garrisons to submit. The garrison of Agioi Theodoroi sent emissaries to Cappello offering to surrender the fort to Venice instead, but he refused. After allowing his troops to celebrate their victory in a drunken feast, in which the remaining houses of the Melanoudion quarter were burned down, Mehmed installed a garrison of 200 Janissaries and 300 irregular infantry (azaps) as a garrison in Mytilene, and entrusted its governance to the Persian sheikh Ali al-Bistami.|$|E

50|$|On 30 January 2015 the TV3 Group {{confirmed}} Late Lunch <b>Live</b> <b>would</b> {{be replaced}} with The Seven O'Clock Show, which premiered on 16 February 2015. Both presenters of Late Lunch Live joined the new show.|$|R
25|$|Within a {{considerable}} radius {{from the surface}} of the nuclear fireball, 0–3kilometers—largely depending on the explosion's height, yield and position of personnel—ducking and covering would offer negligible protection against the intense heat, blast and prompt ionizing radiation following a nuclear explosion. Beyond that range, however, many <b>lives</b> <b>would</b> be saved by following the simple advice, especially since at that range the main hazard is not from ionizing radiation but from blast injuries and sustaining thermal flash burns to unprotected skin. Furthermore, following the bright flash of light of the nuclear fireball, the explosion's blast wave would take from first light, 7 to 10 seconds to reach a person standing 3km {{from the surface of}} the nuclear fireball, with the exact time of arrival being dependent on the speed of sound in air in their area. The time delay between the moment of an explosions flash and the arrival of the slower moving blast wave is analogous to the commonly experienced time delay between the observation of a flash of lightning and the arrival of thunder during a lightning storm, thus at the distances that the advice would be most effective, there would be more than ample amounts of time to take the prompt countermeasure of 'duck and cover' against the blast's direct effects and flying debris. For very large explosions it can take 30 seconds or more, after the silent moment of flash, for a potentially dangerous blast wave over-pressure to arrive at, or hit, your position.|$|E
