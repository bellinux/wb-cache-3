25|$|As {{early as}} the 1600s, the blue crab was an {{important}} food item for Native Americans and European settlers in the Chesapeake Bay area. Soft and hard blue crabs were not as valuable as fish but gained regional popularity by the 1700s. Throughout their range crabs were also an effective bait type for hook and <b>line</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Rapid perishing limited the distribution and hindered {{the growth of the}} fishery.

25|$|The coachwhip {{trevally}}, Carangoides oblongus (also {{known as}} the oblong trevally and oblique-banded trevally) is a species of inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The coachwhip trevally is distributed through the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Fiji and Japan in the east. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a known maximum length of 46cm and can be distinguished from similar species by an array of detailed morphological features including dentition, fin ray counts and scale patterns. The coachwhip trevally inhabits coastal waters throughout its range, known to prefer estuarine waters in a number of localities. Nothing is known of its diet or reproductive biology, and is of little importance to fisheries, occasionally taken as bycatch in trawl and hook and <b>line</b> <b>fisheries.</b>|$|E

40|$|Surrounding Net Fishery (laila) and Bottom Long <b>Line</b> <b>Fishery</b> which {{operate in}} the coastal waters of Kalpitiya Peninsula, compete for the same fish resources, {{resulting}} in a fishery dispute between the respective fishermen. Both fisheries target demersal as well as mid pelagic fishes, such as travellys (parava), mullets (galmalu) and barracudas (ulava). As the dispute had an adverse impact on the social harmony in the fishing community of the area, a socio-economic survey was conducted to study the underlying factors and to suggest policy measures to resolve the issue. The laila fishermen were resident fishermen in the Kalpitiya Peninsula while bottom long line fishermen were migratory fishermen from Negombo and Chilaw areas in {{the west coast of}} Sri Lanka. The Kalpitiya peninsula is located in the North West coast, some 50 km away from the west coast. Although the educational level and literacy rate of the laila community was below that of the bottom long line community, the laila community was economically better off. The net economic returns from laila fishery were superior to that from bottom long <b>line</b> <b>fishery.</b> The boat owner's and crew's share per operation of laila fishery were Rs. 3, 736 and Rs. 947 respectively. The same figures for bottom long <b>line</b> <b>fishery</b> were Rs. 588 and Rs. 327 respectively. The resource rent from laila fishery was Rs. 5, 860, however, and much higher than that for bottom long <b>line</b> <b>fishery</b> (Rs. 275), showing that the laila fishery exploits the targeted fish resource at a much higher rate compared to bottom long <b>line</b> <b>fishery.</b> This situation badly affects the equitable distribution of resources between the two fishing communities and results in unequal economic gains. Based on the findings of this study, certain input/output controls are proposed to address this problem, among which is the need to increase license fee for laila fishery units to offset the higher exploitation rate of fish resources...|$|R

50|$|Dolphin pods often reside near large tuna shoals. This {{is known}} to fishermen, who look for {{dolphins}} to catch tuna. Dolphins are much easier to spot from a distance than tuna, since they regularly breathe.

The Reef <b>Line</b> <b>fishery</b> (RLF) of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia is a large-scale multi-sector, multi-species, highly regulated hook and <b>line</b> <b>fishery</b> {{with the potential for}} high levels of discarding. We used a range of data sources to estimate discard rates and discard quantities for the two main target groups of the RLF, the coral trout, Plectropomus spp, and the red throat emperor, Lethrinus miniatus, and investigated possible effects on discarding of recent changes in management of the fishery. Fleet-wide estimates of total annual quantities discarded from 1989 to 2003 were 292 – 622 t and 33 – 95 t for coral trout and red throat emperor, respectively. Hypothetical scenarios of high-grading after the introduction of a total allowable commercial catch for coral trout resulted in increases in discard quantities up to 3895 t, while no high-grading still meant 421 t were discarded. Increasing the minimum size limit of red throat emperor from 35 to 38 cm also increased discards to an estimated 103 t. We provide spatially and temporally explicit estimates of discarding for the two most important species in the GBR RLF of Australia to demonstrate the importance of accounting for regional variation in quantification of discarding. Effects of management changes on discarding are also highlighted. This study provides a template for exploring discarding levels for other species in the RLF and elsewhere. ...|$|R
