5|$|Up {{until the}} middle part of the 20th century, it was {{customary}} to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inaugural}} 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor {{controversy}} erupted when one opposition {{member of parliament}} (MP), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> and tie {{instead of the usual}} official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan's arrival. Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) MP, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit, promptly drew flak from other MPs and the Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani Othman who had earlier on met to agree to don in the official attire and songkok prior to the assembly, whereby Gwee was absent. The Sultan, apparently angry at Gwee, sharply criticised him two days later and publicly called upon Gwee to seek an audience with him.|$|E
5|$|There is {{capacity}} for 450 pupils in the Sixth Form, including up to 50 people {{from outside the}} Academy. Along with Carre's Grammar School, St George's {{is part of the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which was founded in 1983 and included Kesteven and Sleaford High School until it withdrew in 2010. It provides a common timetable across both sites and allows for pupils to choose from A-Level options offered at both schools. Pupils may apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial activities take place. Pupils are required meet minimum grade requirements for their subject choices and may have interviews to revise offers where appropriate. The Sixth Form has been based in the Arnold Centre since 2012. Sixth Formers are not required to wear school uniform, but must wear business-like attire, namely a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> for boys, including a tie, and a business suit for girls, with either full-length trousers, or a knee-length skirt or dress.|$|E
25|$|Currently however, Sixth Form {{students}} {{are permitted to}} wear <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> or dark jackets, collar and tie with the option of jumpers if necessary.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the {{original}} Imperial institution, the modern Order {{does not have}} special robes nor strict rules regulating its wearing. The collar, the sash and {{the star of the}} Imperial Order were only worn with uniform or full evening dress; the insignia are nowadays worn on <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> and at least one recipient was seen wearing the order dressed in <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> without a tie, something that would be unheard of during the Imperial era.|$|E
25|$|The current styles {{were founded}} in the {{industrial}} revolution during the late 18th century that sharply changed the elaborately embroidered and jewelled formal clothing into the simpler clothing of the British Regency period, which gradually evolved to the stark formality of the Victorian era. It was {{in the search for}} more comfort that the loosening of rules gave rise in the late 19th century to the modern <b>lounge</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The School {{is divided}} into three {{sections}} – the Lower School (Years 7–9), the Upper School (Years 10 and 11) and the Sixth Form (Lower Sixth and Upper Sixth) – each of which attracts its own dress code. Uniform consists of a maroon blazer with a house tie in the Lower School, a black blazer with a house tie in the Upper School and a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> and tie of the pupil's choice in the Sixth Form.|$|E
50|$|Single cuffs, the {{original}} linked cuff, {{are required for}} white tie and are the more traditional choice for black tie. Also, some traditionalists may wear this style with <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> as well.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: At the Treaty of Versailles signing, in 1919, {{the heads}} of state wore morning dress and <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> for {{informal}} meetings (as seen here), but frock coats for formal daytime meetings.|$|R
25|$|Three-piece suits {{consisting}} of a high-buttoned sack coat with matching waistcoat and trousers, called ditto <b>suits</b> or (UK) <b>lounge</b> <b>suits,</b> grew in popularity; the sack coat might be cutaway so that only the top button could be fastened.|$|R
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of frock coats was {{their lack of}} any outer pockets. Only late in the Victorian and Edwardian era were they ever made with a chest pocket to sport a pocket square, a feature more typical of the modern <b>lounge</b> <b>suit.</b> Oscar Wilde, a famous dandy of his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model, but this was rather rare on frock coats; while {{in keeping with the}} flamboyant nature of Wilde's dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. Side pockets were always absent from frock coats, but pockets were provided {{on the inside of the}} chest.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the skirt of the frock coat varied during the Victorian era and Edwardian era {{according}} to fashion. The most conservative length became established as being to the knees but fashion conscious men would follow the latest trends to wear them either longer or shorter. Similarly, {{the height of the}} waist– the point of maximal waist suppression– changed according to fashion. During its heyday, the frock coat was cut following the 19th century ideal of flattering the natural elegance of the naked figure, based on the ideals of Neoclassicism that admired the depiction of the idealised nude in Classical Greco-Roman sculpture. The elegance of the form of the frock coat derived from its hourglass shape with a closely cut waist which at times around the 1830s-40's was reinforced further with padding to round out the chest. A cut with an ideal hourglass silhouette was achievable because coats during this era were all made bespoke, individually cut to the exact measurements of the customer. The 19th century aesthetics of tailoring contrasted markedly to the modern style of cutting suits which involves a greater degree of drape (fullness), as established by the great early 20th century Savile Row tailor Frederick Scholte. Caution needs to be exercised by modern tailors trained to create the drape cut style of modern lounge suits to minimise drape– particularly around the waist– when cutting a historically accurate frock coat. Sometimes, modern <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> coats with an unusually long skirt are referred to by ready-to-wear makers as a 'frock coat' but these lack the waist seam, resulting in the fuller drape more typical of a modern overcoat or a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> jacket. The silhouette of the historically accurate frock coat has the waist seam precisely tailored to permit the classical and elongating hourglass figure with the strong waist suppression.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Homburg, Eden {{was associated with the}} mid-1930s fashion for wearing a white linen waistcoat with a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit,</b> while the poet and novelist Robert Graves likened Eden's moustache to those of film stars Ronald Colman, William Powell and Clark Gable: [...] "the new moustache was small, short and carefully cut, sometimes slightly curved over the lip at either end, sometimes making a thin straight line". When Eden visited New York City in 1938 he was [...] "deluged with fan mail from teenage college girls to elderly matrons", while women reporters and society editors [...] "gushed about his classic features, his long dark eyelashes, his limpid eyes, his clear skin, his wavy hair, his charm and magnetism". In another American city, a display of Homburgs in a shop window was adorned with the sign [...] "Welcome to Anthony Eden". In Amsterdam the hat became known as the [...] "Lord Eden".|$|E
50|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, men often wore {{elaborate}} and brightly-coloured waistcoats, until changing fashions in the nineteenth century narrowed this to a more restricted palette, and the development of <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> began the period of matching informal waistcoats.|$|R
50|$|Waistcoats {{worn with}} <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> (now principally single-breasted) {{normally}} match the suit in cloth, and have {{four to six}} buttons. Double breasted waistcoats are rare compared to single. As formalwear, {{it used to be}} common to wear a contrastingly coloured waistcoat, such as in buff or dove linen. This is still seen in morning dress, which requires a waistcoat.|$|R
50|$|The {{frock coat}} was widely worn {{in much the}} same {{situations}} as modern <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> and formalwear, with different variations. One example is that a frock coat for formalwear was always double-breasted with peaked lapels; as informal wear, the single-breasted frock coat often sported the step, or notched, lapel (the cause of its informality), and was more common in the early 19th century than the formal model.|$|R
2500|$|In Western {{clothing}} semi-formal is a {{grouping of}} dress codes indicating {{the sort of}} clothes worn to events {{with a level of}} protocol between informal (e.g., <b>lounge</b> <b>suit)</b> and formal. [...] Both morning and evening semi-formal attire share design features in common with the informal <b>lounge</b> <b>suit.</b> In the modern era, semi-formal attire for men includes wearing a dark business suit; a cocktail dress or little black dress is customary for women.|$|E
2500|$|Full-length {{trousers}} were worn, generally of a contrasting fabric. Costumes {{consisting of}} a coat, waistcoat and trousers of the same fabric (called a [...] "ditto suit") remained a novelty at this time. [...] In domestic settings, the sack coat or a lounge jacket could be worn with a waistcoat and trousers of the same fabric. [...] This form of ditto suit, {{referred to as a}} <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> in the United Kingdom was generally made of wool, with baggy tailoring. [...] However, the <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> was not considered appropriate for public settings until the 1870s.|$|E
2500|$|In clothing, a suit {{is a set}} of {{garments}} {{made from}} the same cloth, usually consisting of at least a jacket and trousers. Lounge suits (also known as business suits when sober in colour and style), which originated [...] in Britain as country wear, are the most common style of Western suit. Other types of suit still worn today are the dinner suit, part of black tie, which arose as a lounging alternative to dress coats {{in much the same way}} as the day <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> came to replace frock coats and morning coats; and, rarely worn today, the morning suit. [...] This article discusses the <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> (including business suits), elements of informal dress code.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the term}} [...] "undress" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} dress codes consisting of clothes of formality much less than those normally worn, including everything from dressing gowns, to, in their first few decades, <b>lounge</b> <b>suits.</b> [...] In contrast, the term [...] "overdress" [...] can describe the wearing of clothing which is more formal than that normally worn in that situation, and can in fact be more revealing, {{as in the case}} of evening gowns or cocktail dresses.|$|R
25|$|In the United States and the United Kingdom, {{around the}} start of the 20th century, <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> were never {{traditionally}} worn in plain black, this colour instead being reserved for formal wear (including dinner jackets or strollers), and for undertakers. However, the decline of formal wear since the 1950s and the rise of casual wear in 1960s allowed the black suit to return to fashion, as many designers began wanting {{to move away from the}} business suit toward more fashion suits.|$|R
50|$|Slip-ons are {{typically}} low, lace-less shoes. The style most commonly seen, {{known as a}} loafer or slippers in American culture, has a moccasin construction. One of the first designs was introduced in London by Wildsmith Shoes, called the Wildsmith Loafer. They began as casual shoes, but have increased in popularity {{to the point of}} being worn in America with city <b>lounge</b> <b>suits.</b> Another design was introduced as Aurlandskoen (the Aurland Shoe) in Norway (early 20th century). They are worn in many situations in a variety of colours and designs, often featuring tassels on the front, or metal decorations (the 'Gucci' loafer).|$|R
2500|$|A male junior {{barrister}} wears a {{white shirt}} and white wing-collar with bands, underneath a double-breasted or three-piece <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> of dark colour. He has a black [...] "stuff" [...] gown over his suit, and wears a short wig of horsehair. A female junior barrister wears similar garb.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> {{was once}} only worn as smart leisure wear {{in the country}} or at the seaside, {{but in the middle}} of the 19th century started to rise rapidly in popularity. [...] It took on the role of a more casual {{alternative}} to the morning coat for town wear, moving the latter up in the scale of formality. The more the morning coat became fashionable as correct daytime full dress, the more the <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> became acceptable as an informal alternative, and finally the more the frock coat became relegated to the status of ultra-formal day wear, worn only by older men. [...] At the most formal events during the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, heads of government wore the frock coat, but at more informal meetings they wore morning coats or even a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit.</b> In 1926, George V hastened the demise of the frock coat when he shocked the public by appearing at the opening of the Chelsea Flower Show wearing a morning coat. The frock coat barely survived the 1930s only as an ultra-formal form of court dress, until being finally officially abolished in 1936 as official court dress by Edward VIII (who later abdicated to become the Duke of Windsor). [...] It was replaced by the morning coat, thus consigning the frock coat to the status of historic dress.|$|E
2500|$|In England and Wales, {{black tie}} is seldom worn at Church weddings or civil ceremonies as morning dress or a <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> is {{normally}} favoured. However, {{in recent years}} black tie is sometimes worn at evening receptions. [...] At Jewish weddings, however, black tie is often stipulated. In Scotland, a dinner jacket is also not common but highland dress is often chosen.|$|E
50|$|The suit is a {{traditional}} form of men's formal clothes in the Western world. For some four hundred years, suits of matching coat, trousers, and waistcoat have {{been in and out}} of fashion. The modern <b>lounge</b> <b>suit's</b> derivation is visible in the outline of the brightly coloured, elaborately crafted royal court dress of the 17th century (suit, wig, knee breeches), which was shed because of the French Revolution. This evolution is seen more recently in British tailoring's use of steam and padding in moulding woolen cloth, the rise and fall in popularity of the necktie, and the gradual disuse of waistcoats and hats in the last fifty years.|$|R
60|$|Those {{who were}} going {{to take part in the}} social evening came in, the younger members of the staff mostly, boys who had not girls of their own, and girls who had not yet found anyone to walk with. Several of the young gentlemen wore <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> with white evening ties and red silk handkerchiefs; they were going to perform, and they had a busy, {{abstracted}} air; some were self-confident, but others were nervous, and they watched their public with an anxious eye. Presently a girl with a great deal of hair sat at the piano and ran her hands noisily across the keyboard. When the audience had settled itself she looked round and gave the name of her piece.|$|R
25|$|Once double breasted frock coats were established, lapels were sharply creased {{and their}} form was more static, varying only in {{details such as}} height, since they were buttoned nearly to the neck by the Edwardians, then {{lengthened}} to the classic three-button shape, the two-button jacket being a further American innovation. The other significant change over that period {{was the use of}} the revers {{in the construction of the}} lapel, as the Victorians used elaborate three-part patterns to cut a fold of cloth from the lining into the front of the lapel, a universal consideration of frock coats and dress coats of the period, but abandoned in favor of the current single-piece lapels at the same time as the switch to morning coats and <b>lounge</b> <b>suits.</b> Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts.|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally {{black tie}} should be worn {{to the opera}} {{although}} a dark <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> is also now acceptable. [...] In the 21st century, many opera houses in the English-speaking world do not stipulate black tie. [...] For example, neither the Royal Opera House nor the Sydney Opera House have a black tie dress code. Black tie is customary at English country house opera, such as during the summer Festival at Glyndebourne.|$|E
2500|$|At formal dinners on {{cruise ships}} {{the dress code}} will {{typically}} be black tie although a dark <b>lounge</b> <b>suit</b> may be worn as a substitute. In 2013 Cunard, noted for its adherence to formal dress codes, relaxed its dress standards. As of 2015 Cunard requires one of a dinner jacket, a dark suit, formal national dress or military uniform for gentlemen diners on formal evenings. [...] Similarly, the luxury cruise liner, Seabourn, stipulates either a tuxedo or a dark business suit on formal evenings.|$|E
2500|$|Formal Hall {{used to be}} {{a weekly}} {{tradition}} within Wills (and in earliest times was held every day), but [...] "formals" [...] are now only held every two or three weeks, with some 14-15 such events each year. Dress is formal (black tie / <b>lounge</b> <b>suit,</b> long / short), and residents wear an academic gown. Latin grace (Benedictus benedicat and Benedicto benedicatur) is said by the Warden {{at the beginning and end}} and there is usually a speech during dessert, given either by the Warden or by a notable guest. Speeches are often on contemporary social and political issues, and rejoinders are invited from members of the Hall if the topic is controversial.|$|E
5000|$|At a robed hearing, barristers wear a {{horsehair}} wig, an open black gown, {{dark suit}} and a shirt, with strips of white cotton called 'bands' or 'tabs' worn over a winged collar, instead of a tie. Female barristers wear either the same shirt, or a special collar which includes the bands and tucks inside a suit jacket. QCs wear slightly different silk gowns over short embroidered black jackets and striped trousers. Solicitors wear a black gown (of a distinct style), wing collar and band and a wig. The question of barristers' and judges' clothing in the civil courts {{was the subject of}} review, and there is some pressure to adopt a more [...] "modern" [...] style of dress, with European-style gowns worn over <b>lounge</b> <b>suits.</b> Guidance from the Bar Council has resulted in robes being worn for trials and appeals in the County Court more than formerly.|$|R
25|$|Top hats {{remained}} {{a requirement for}} upper class formal wear; soft felt Homburgs or stiff bowler hats were worn with <b>lounge</b> or sack <b>suits,</b> and flat straw boaters were worn for casual occasions.|$|R
5000|$|Employers {{may require}} their {{domestic}} workers {{to wear a}} uniform, livery or other [...] "domestic workers' clothes" [...] when in their employers' residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured dresses or black skirts with white belts and white blouses, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple suit, or a white dress shirt, often with tie, and knickers. In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve. For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in <b>lounge</b> <b>suits</b> or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion. In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie or bowtie, maybe even waistcoat, or a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.|$|R
