After validating the presented locomotive dynamic model by comparing its calculated results with test data, simulations are carried out to analyse the influences of the coupler-tail arc surface and locomotive secondary suspension parameters on the coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety. Results indicate that the friction coefficient and the arc radius of the coupler-tail arc surfaces have a remarkable influence, and that the locomotive secondary <b>lateral</b> <b>stop</b> and lateral stiffness also have a significant effect.

40|$|We present first {{observations}} of a dome-shaped large-scale EUV coronal wave, {{recorded by the}} EUVI instrument onboard STEREO-B on January 17, 2010. The main arguments that the observed structure is the wave dome (and not the CME) are: a) the spherical form and sharpness of the dome's outer edge and the erupting CME loops observed inside the dome; b) the low-coronal wave signatures above the limb perfectly connecting to the on-disk signatures of the wave; c) the lateral extent of the expanding dome which is much larger {{than that of the}} coronal dimming; d) the associated high-frequency type II burst indicating shock formation low in the corona. The velocity of the upward expansion of the wave dome (v ∼ 650 km s^- 1) is larger than that of the lateral expansion of the wave (v ∼ 280 km s^- 1), indicating that the upward dome expansion is driven all the time, and thus depends on the CME speed, whereas in the lateral direction it is freely propagating after the CME <b>lateral</b> expansion <b>stops.</b> We also examine the evolution of the perturbation characteristics: First the perturbation profile steepens and the amplitude increases.

30|$|In {{an effort}} to {{comprehend}} the mechanism {{of the formation of}} pores, the following statements about isotropic etching give a better understanding. The etching process continues as the catalysis of Au nanoparticles, which are merely from the reduction of HAuCl 4 by H 2 O 2. In the etching solution, Au particles adhere to the wafer surface via diffusion. Due to the electromotive force of Au particles being higher than that of silicon, this will form the local electromotive difference of potential. After the beginning of etching, nanopores are formed on the wafer surface, and as this process continues, the Au nanoparticles will subside {{to the bottom of the}} nanopores to ensure bottom etching. There is not enough energy to make a hole reach the surfaces of the sidewall because the sidewall of the nanopores are far away from the Au nanoparticles, so the <b>lateral</b> etching will <b>stop.</b> The above process results in the formation of nanopores.|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{convection}} in the Antarctic Ice Sheet {{was proposed}} in 1970. Demonstrating its existence {{proved to be}} elusive. In 2009, tributaries to ice streams were postulated as the surface expression of underlying thermal convection rolls aligned in directions of advective ice flow. Two definitive tests of this hypothesis are now possible, using highly accurate ice elevations and velocities provided by the European, Japanese, and Canadian Space Agencies that allow icestream tributaries and their velocities to be mapped. These tests are 1) measuring lowering of tributary surfaces to see if lowering is due only to advective ice thinning, or also requires lowering en masse in the broad descending part of convective flow, and 2) measuring transverse surface ice velocities to see if ice entering tributaries from the sides increases while crossing lateral shear zones, as would be required if this flow is augmented by convective flow ascending in the narrow side shear zones and diverted into tributaries by advective ice flow. If (1) and (2) are applied to tributaries converging on Byrd Glacier, the same measurements can be conducted when tributaries pack together to become “flow stripes” down Byrd Glacier and onto the Ross Ice Shelf to see if (2) is reduced when <b>lateral</b> advection <b>stops.</b> This could determine if thermal convection remains active or shuts down as ice thins.

30|$|The {{majority}} of criticisms of fuelbreaks center on design {{issues such as}} their proposed locations and patterns, stand-level prescriptions, and construction methods. Given that the main objective of fuelbreaks is to reduce wildfire spread, the ideal location for fuelbreaks would be alongside topographical or landscape features that offer tactical vantage points for containing wildfires. Placing fuelbreaks atop main ridges is a logical location from a tactical suppression standpoint, but placing fuelbreaks on secondary or lateral ridges presents certain risks of creating a “fuse effect” facilitating rapid upslope fire spread (Green 1977, Omi 1996). The concern is that even when a <b>lateral</b> fuelbreak successfully <b>stops</b> a flanking fire from spreading across a slope, the fire may proceed more rapidly upslope within the fuelbreak than the main headfire. If lateral fuelbreaks provide corridors for wildland fire to spread more rapidly upslope, then this can greatly increase the area needed to create a perimeter containment line. Omi (1977 a), in fact, compiled reports of lateral fuelbreaks that failed to contain chaparral fires in southern California partly due to this phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} EPG (electro-palatographic) data on (alveo-) palatal consonants {{from two}} Australian languages, Arrernte and Warlpiri. (Alveo-) palatal consonants are phonemic for <b>stop,</b> <b>lateral</b> and nasal manners of articulation in both languages, and are laminal articulations. However, in Arrernte, these lamino-(alveo-) palatals contrast with lamino-dental consonants {{for all three}} manners of articulation (i. e., it is a double-laminal language), whereas in Warlpiri this laminal contrast does not exist (i. e., it is a single-laminal language). Data are analyzed according to manner of articulation, vowel context and phrase position. Results suggest that in the double-laminal language Arrernte, the (alveo-) palatal articulation is further back than in the single-laminal language Warlpiri, presumably due {{to the presence of}} the lamino-dental in the Arrernte phoneme inventory. The lateral has the least contact in the back regions of the palate for both languages, but there is no significant difference in contact pattern between the stop and the nasal.

40|$|Introduction Electroglottography (EGG) is {{a common}} method for {{providing}} noninvasive measurements of glottal activity. The object {{of this study was}} to characterise EGG based parameters, specifically the open quotient (OQ), during fricative production, and during the phones preceding and following the fricative in a carrier phrase. With the OQ measures we aim to quantitatively establish if the relatively weak voicing during the fricative production may be differentiated from the stronger voicing of the contextual vowel. Our long term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which voicing is initiated and maintained as a guide to improving strategies for initiating and maintaining voicing in patients with laryngeal impairment such as unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) (Pinho, Jesus, & Barney, 2009). Methods Data were collected from two adult female (JG and HV) and two adult male (LJ and RS) speakers of EP. None had reported speech, language or hearing disorders, and all had normal vocal qualities. They were assessed by an experienced Speech and Language Therapist using a standardised evaluation protocol (Jesus, et al., 2009). Speakers were recorded producing 51 utterances, including 9 isolated words containing the EP voiced fricatives /v, z, Z/, in initial, medial and final word position, and the same 9 words embedded in 51 different carrier sentences, that presented a variety of consonantal (taps, <b>laterals,</b> <b>stops</b> and nasals) and vocalic (close, open front and back vowels) contexts in real EP sentences (only vowel-fricative-vowel sequences were analysed). To analyse the EGG signal we built Matlab scripts based on the open source software “MOQ interface” (Henrich, Alessandro, Doval, & Castellengo, 2004; Henrich, Gendrot, Michaud, & Tuan, 2005). We used the method “DEGG DECOM”, reported as the one that presented the best results compared to OQ measurements derived from the inverse-filtered glottal flow (Henrich, et al., 2004). These functions, developed for the singing voice (Henrich, et al., 2004), assume a quasi-periodic signal and were therefore considered to be more suitable for voiced fricative analysis. To characterise the fricatives in terms of their production mechanisms, we analysed the OQ derived from the EGG signal during the steady state of the fricative and of the adjacent vowels. The strategy used to correlate and extract information from these different modes of speech production was based on average values calculated for the OQ within phone 1 (vowel), phone 2 (fricative) and phone 3 (vowel). Results We calculated for each phone (1, 2 and 3) the average of the OQ values derived from EGGDEGG. In cases where the peaks do not stand out clearly and the OQ cannot be calculated reliably, it does not make sense to talk of an OQ at all (Henrich, et al., 2005). Therefore, zero and nonsense OQ values (e. g., fundamental frequency derived from EGG, with values equal or greater than 400 Hz) were not included in subsequent analysis. For both female and male data, an increase in the OQ values during fricative production (phone 2) was observed when compared to OQ values from the adjacent vowels (phone 1 and phone 3), as shown in Table 1. Discussion There was a small increase in the OQ values during the fricative, relative to that of the adjacent vowels. We can hypothesise that a more physically efficient voice is related with a decrease of the OQ value during the production of vowels (Howard, 1995). Changes observed in the EGG waveform during fricative production, thought to result from the rise in the supraglottal pressure due to a supraglottal constriction (Rothenberg & Mahshie, 1988), may be useful in a definition of weak voicing (Pinho, Jesus, & Barney, 2009). Some differences in the OQ values were also observed for different places of articulation: alveolar (/z/) fricatives showed OQ values slightly lower (59 ± 9) than labio-dentals (/v/) and postalveolars (/Z/) (61 - 65 ± 9). Further work is needed to relate these results to vocal fold mechanics. In future work we plan to extract the OQ from the inverse-filtered glottal flow (a signal we simultaneously acquired during data collection) in order to extend our study of OQ to UVFP patients where EGG cannot be reliably collected. <br/...|$|R

However, Washington would retain the lead thanks to a failed two-point conversion attempt, at 21-19.

Para tal, o trabalho se desenvolve sob o enfoque fonético e fonológico. Para o estudo fonético efetuamos análises acústicas, e examinamos os seguintes parâmetros: duração, freqüência e intensidade. Os resultados indicam que a duração das consoantes varia bastante entre as expressões que inserem segmentos simples contra os geminados, tendo os últimos duração duas vezes maior do que os simples. A intensidade é maior nas geminadas com a presença da lateral e da oclusiva alveolar. O parâmetro de freqüência não mostra relação com geminação. A orientação teórica adotada no estudo fonológico é o da Fonologia Multilinear, e a análise dos dados deu-se pelos constituintes silábicos presentes na estrutura interna da sílaba: ataque, rima, núcleo e coda. Quanto às posições que as consoantes geminadas ocupam dentro da estrutura silábica, defendemos que elas pertencem a sílabas separadas: a primeira consoante forma a coda da sílaba da esquerda, enquanto a segunda forma o ataque da sílaba da direita.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho éfazer uma descrição articulatória, com uma perspectiva fonética, de fones consonantais do português - mais especificamente, analisar o contato da língua com o palato, para a produção de cada fone. Para isso, foram desenvolvidos três estudos: a descrição articulatória de fones consonantais da fala normal; descrição de fones consonanatais na fala alterada decorrente da fissura labiopalatina; e análise da coarticulação lingüística em sequências consonantais. Eles foram realizados com dois falantes, um com fala normal e outro com fala alterada, ambos adultos do sexo masculino. O corpus foi formado por palavras contendo os fones [+anterior]: /s/, /z/, /t/, /d/, /n/, /l/, //, /p/ e /m/ e os fones [-anterior]: / /, / /, //, / /, /k / e /g/, sendo que cada fone estava no meio da palavra, em início de sílaba, na posição tônica, antecedido e seguido pela vogal [a]. Os dados foram analisados por meio da eletropalatografia, que fornece informações do contato da língua com o palato em tempo real, por meio dos palatogramas e dos índices de contato. A descrição consonantal da fala normal mostrou que os fones fricativos caracterizaram-se pela ausência de contato no eixo {{longitudinal}} central; e os oclusivos, pela constrição total em alguma região articulatória. Dentre os fones laterais, o fone [l] apresentou um contato longitudinal lateral mínimo e o fone [] apresentou contato das laterais da língua ao longo do palato. O tapa caracterizou-se por contato rápido da língua no alvéolo. Quanto ao ponto articulatório, os fones alveolares apresentaram maior constrição nas regiões alveolar e pós-alveolar. Dentre os fones considerados palatais, o fone [] apresentou constrição palato/velar e o fone [], constrição alveopalatal. O contato dos fones velares foram mínimos, não sendo possível identificar a constrição dentro da área registrada pelo palato artificial. A descrição consonantal da fala decorrente de fissura labiopalatina mostrou que o falante apresentou um padrão articulatório diferente do falante normal na grande maioria das consoantes e que houve variações no ponto articulatório do mesmo fone. Na produção dos fones fricativos linguais, o contato língua-palato foi ausente ou mínimo; os fones oclusivos apresentaram tendência a ter um contato quase total da língua com o palato; os fones laterais foram produzidos com articulação próxima do padrão normal; ocorreu recuo da língua na produção de fones alveolares; e fones velares foram produzidos mais anteriormente. A contrastividade dos fones foi realizada por meio dos modos articulatórios - fricativo, oclusivo, lateral e tapa - que foram mantidos na fala decorrente da fissura labiopalatina. O terceiro estudo verificou o efeito coarticulatório na fala normal nas sequências consonantais [sp], [st], [sk] e [s]. Constatou-se que o fone [s] mostrou-se resistente àcoarticulação com os fones [p] e [k] e sensível àcoarticulação com os fones [t] e []. Dessa forma, quando não houve gestos linguais concorrentes o /s/ na posição de coda influenciou o segmento seguinte, provocando uma coarticulação progressiva. Quando houve concorrência no gesto lingual, o /s/ mostrou-se sensível àcorticulação, observando-se uma coarticulação recíproca. Estes efeitos, exceto na sequência [s], restringiram -se ao ponto de transição de um fone para outro. A partir dos três estudos, constatou-se que a eletropalatografia mostrou ser um recurso eficiente para fornecer detalhes da produção da fala. This research aims {{to make an}} articulatory {{description of}} the consonantal phones of Portuguese language, with a phonetic perspective. More specifically, to analyse the linguopalatal contact {{in the production of}} each phone. Having this in mind, three studies were developed, one concerning the articulatory description of consonantal phones in normal speech, a second one on consonantal phones in impaired speech resulting from cleft lip and palate, and a third study, an analysis about linguistic coarticulation in clusters. They were made with two adult male speakers, one with normal speech and another one with impaired speech. The words which compound the corpus contain the phones [+front]: /s/, /z/, /t/, /d/, /n/, /l/, //,/p/ and /m/, and [-front]: / /, / /, //, / /, /k / and /g/; each phone {{was in the middle of}} the word, in the beginning of the syllable, in stressed position, preceded and followed by the vowel [a]. The data were analysed through Electropalatography, which provides information about linguopalatal contact in real-time, through palatograms and contact index methods. The consonantal description of the normal speech pointed that fricatives are characterised by the absence of central longitudinal axis contact; the stops, by complete constriction in some articulatory region. Among laterals, the phone [l] presented minimal lateral longitudinal contact, and the phone [] presented lateral linguopalatal contact. The tap was characterised by a rapid apicoalveolar contact. In relation to the place of articulation, the alveolars presented more constriction in alveolar and postalveolar regions. Among palatals, the phone [] showed palatovelar constriction, and the phone [], bigger alveopalatal constriction. The contact between velars was minimal so that it was impossible to identify the constriction in the area registered by the artificial palate. The consonantal description of the impaired speech resulting from cleft lip and palate suggested that the speaker presented an articulatory pattern different from the normal speakers, in most consonants and there were variations in the place of articulation of the same phone. In the release of lingual fricatives, the linguopalatal contact was minimal or absent; the stops presented a tendency to have an almost total linguopalatal contact; the laterals were released with an articulation close to the normal pattern; therefore, it was observed retreat of the tongue in alveolars and more front velars. The phonetic contrast was performed through manner of articulation fricative, <b>stop,</b> <b>lateral,</b> tap, which remained in the impaired speech deriving from cleft lip and palate. The third study verified the coarticulatory effect in normal speech, in the clusters [sp], [st], [sk] and [s] so that it can be inferred that the phone [s] showed resistance to coarticulation with [p] and [k], and sensibility to coarticulation with [t] and []. By this mean, when there were no concurrent lingual gestures, the /s/ in coda position influenced the proceeding cluster so that a progressive coarticulation occurred whereas when there were concurrence in lingual gestures, the /s/ was sensible to coarticulation observing mutual coarticulation. These effects were limited to a transition point from one phone to another, with exepction to the cluster [s]. Its verified through these three studies that lectropalatography is an efficient resource to provide details regarding speech production...|$|R
