40|$|The spin Hall {{effect in}} two {{dimensional}} hole systems is studied {{by using the}} four-terminal Landauer-Büttiker formula {{with the help of}} Green functions. The spin Hall effect exists even when there are not any correlations between the spin-up and -down heavy <b>holes</b> (<b>light</b> <b>holes)</b> and when the Γ-point degeneracy of the heavy <b>hole</b> and <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> bands is lifted by the confinement or recovered by the strain. When only a heavy hole charge current without any spin polarization is injected through one lead, under right choice of lead voltages, one can get a pure heavy (<b>light)</b> <b>hole</b> spin current, combined with a possible impure <b>light</b> (heavy) <b>hole</b> spin current from another two leads. The spin Hall coefficients of both heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> depend on the Fermi energy, devise size and the disorder strength. It is also shown that the spin Hall effect of two dimensional hole systems is much more robust than that of electron systems with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the spin Hall coefficients do not decrease with the system size but tend to some nonzero values when the disorder strength is smaller than some critical value.

Heavy holes are shown to initially dominate the transport {{due to their}} higher valence band density of states, but at large diffusion distances, the <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> begin to dominate due to their larger diffusion length.

The heavy hole does not couple with the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> and the spin-orbit split-off hole.

At the k not equal 0 points, there is strong band mixing among the heavy <b>hole,</b> <b>light</b> <b>hole,</b> and spin-orbit split-off hole. The optical transitions do not obey the Delta n= 0 selection rule. The compressive strain in the GaN well region increases the energy separation between the so 1 +lh 1 energy level and the hh 1 energy level. Consequently, the compressive strain enhances the TE mode optical gain, and strongly depresses the TM mode optical gain. Even when the carrier density is as large as 10 (19) cm(- 3), there is no positive TM mode optical gain. The TE mode optical gain spectrum has a peak at around 3. 26 eV.
