5|$|The {{recurrent}} <b>laryngeal</b> nerves are {{the nerves}} {{of the sixth}} pharyngeal arch. The existence of the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve was first documented by the physician Galen.|$|E
5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} <b>laryngeal</b> cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the {{recurrent}} <b>laryngeal</b> nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior <b>laryngeal</b> nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes. The gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. The gland receives parasympathetic nerve supply from the superior <b>laryngeal</b> nerve and the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve.|$|E

40|$|The author puts {{up to date}} {{his ideas}} on Indo-European <b>Laryngeals,</b> which have been {{published}} from 1956 onwards. He takes into account new materials {{as well as new}} proposals about the most difficult points. He starts exposing some General Phonetics facts which favor his theory and then he offers some new evidence from Anatolian languages which enlarge our knowledge of Indo-European <b>Laryngeals.</b> Then he explains minutely the different treatments of <b>Laryngeals</b> in Post-Anatolian Indo-European, arriving frequently to more economical and simple solutions. The paper ends with a synopsis of the treatments of the six <b>Laryngeals</b> (three with a palatal appendix and three with a labial one) in Indo-European...|$|R
50|$|In {{all other}} {{daughter}} languages, {{comparison of the}} cognates can support only hypothetical intermediary sounds derived from PIE combinations of vowels and <b>laryngeals.</b> Some indirect reflexes are required to support the examples above where the existence of <b>laryngeals</b> is uncontested.|$|R
5|$|Although {{uncommon}} in dogs, bilateral recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve disease {{may be the}} cause of wheezing (stridor) when middle-aged dogs inhale.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} <b>laryngeal</b> nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior <b>laryngeal</b> nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} <b>laryngeal</b> nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior <b>laryngeal</b> nerve.|$|E
5000|$|The palatal glide [...] spreads {{across the}} <b>laryngeals</b> [...] and , {{yielding}} a glide onset, {{a brief moment}} of coarticulation and a glide release. The <b>laryngeals</b> [...] and [...] are variably deleted between sonorants, which also applies across a word boundary.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Laryngeals</b> {{generally}} {{disappeared as}} independent phonemes. When they appeared after a vowel, they caused compensatory lengthening of that vowel, as {{in almost all}} Indo-European branches. <b>Laryngeals</b> between consonants disappeared as well, but in the first syllable, they are reflected as *a. Compare: ...|$|R
50|$|Work {{particularly}} {{associated with}} {{research of the}} scholar Jorma Koivulehto has {{identified a number of}} additions to the list of Finnic loanwords from an Indo-European source or sources whose particular interest is the apparent correlation of PIE <b>laryngeals</b> with three post-alveolar phonemes (or their later reflexes) in the Finnic forms. If so, this would point to a great antiquity for the borrowings, since no attested Indo-European language neighbouring Uralic has consonants as reflexes of <b>laryngeals.</b> And it would bolster the idea that <b>laryngeals</b> were phonetically distinctly consonantal.|$|R
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve and the superior <b>laryngeal</b> nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} <b>laryngeal</b> neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E

5|$|The infrahyoid muscles lie {{in front}} of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two carotid arteries. The trachea, laryngx, lower pharynx and {{esophagus}} all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} <b>laryngeal</b> nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} <b>laryngeal</b> nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives cardiac branches {{to the deep}} cardiac plexus, and branches to the trachea, esophagus and the inferior constrictor muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open the vocal cords, are innervated by this nerve.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the <b>laryngeal</b> mask airway, i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP mask), nasal BiPAP mask, simple face mask, and nasal cannula.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, {{there have}} been four {{recorded}} deaths, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 {{years old and had}} cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Severe <b>laryngeal</b> oedema and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any desensitisation program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting.|$|E
5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, <b>laryngeal</b> diphtheria, {{bacterial}} tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E

5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve.|$|E
5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. Studies {{have shown}} that 218% of lung cancer patients develop hoarseness because of recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve compression, usually left-sided. This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates inoperable tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung cancer surgery in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
