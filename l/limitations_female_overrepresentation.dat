40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} trends in gender gaps in education, their causes and {{potential}} policy implications. I show that female educational attainment has surpassed, or {{is about to}} surpass, male educational attainment in most industrialized countries. These gaps reflect male overrepresentation among secondary school drop-outs and <b>female</b> <b>overrepresentation</b> among tertiary education students and graduates. Existing evidence suggests that this pattern {{is a result of}} a combination of increasing returns to education and lower female effort costs of education. Widening gender gap in education combined with recent wage and employment polarization will likely lead to widening inequalities and is linked to declining male labor force participation. The paper discusses evidence on educational policies that both widen and reduce gender gaps in educational outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) {{is caused}} by antibodies against a "self" protein-platelet factor 4 -bound to heparin. We observed an <b>overrepresentation</b> of the <b>female</b> gender in 290 patients who developed HIT after cardiac or orthopedic surgery compared with the representation found in national databases (study 1). Therefore, we investigated gender imbalance in HIT by logistic regression analysis of a randomized controlled trial of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (study 2), and we analyzed individual patient data from 7 prospective studies comparing HIT frequency between UFH and LMWH, evaluating effects of gender, heparin (UFH vs LMWH), and patient type (surgical vs medical) (study 3). All 3 studies showed <b>female</b> <b>overrepresentation,</b> which for study 3 was a common odds ratio (OR) of 2. 37 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 37 - 4. 09; P = 3 D. 0015). Study 3 also showed an interaction between gender, heparin, and patient type. Although UFH was more likely than LMWH to cause HIT (P <. 0001), this effect was predominantly seen in women compared with men (common OR, 9. 22 vs 1. 83; P = 3 D. 020) and in surgical patients compared with medical patients (common OR, 13. 93 vs 1. 75; P = 3 D. 005). We conclude that females {{are at greater risk}} for HIT and that using LMWH to prevent HIT may have greatest absolute benefit in females undergoing surgical thromboprophylaxis...|$|R
5000|$|The Finnish {{national}} quota law, {{introduced in}} 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national {{and a local}} level), neither sex in the governing body can be under 40%. The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries' quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)—the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before {{the passage of the}} law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of <b>female</b> <b>overrepresentation</b> in [...] "soft-sector" [...] boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female [...] "underrepresentation" [...] in [...] "hard-sector" [...] boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female—chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated. Presidential elections were held in Finland on 16 January 2000, with a second round on 6 February; the result was a victory for Tarja Halonen of the Social Democratic Party, who became the country's first female President.|$|R

40|$|Aim: This paper {{reports a}} study that {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} nurse researchers internationally disproportionately include females as participants in their research. Background: A bias toward predominantly male samples has been well-documented in medical research, but recently a gender bias favoring women in nursing research has been identified in studies published in four North American journals. Method: We extracted information about study samples and characteristics of the studies and authors from a consecutive sample of 834 studies published in eight leading Englishlanguage nursing research journals in 2005 - 2006. The primary analyses involved onesample t-tests that tested the null hypothesis that males and females are equally represented as participants in nursing studies. Studies from different countries, in different specialty areas, and with varying author and methodologic characteristics were compared with regard to the key outcome variable, percent of participants who were female. Results: Overall, 71 % of participants, on average, were female, including 68 % in clientfocused research and 83 % in nurse-focused studies (all p <. 001). Females were significantly overrepresented as participants in client-focused research in almost all specialty areas, particularly in mental health, community health, health promotion, and geriatrics. The bias favoring female participants in client-focused studies was especially strong in the United States and Canada, but was also present in European countries, most Asian countries, and in Australia. <b>Female</b> <b>overrepresentation</b> was persistent, regardless of methodological characteristics (e. g., qualitative versus quantitative), funding source, and most researcher characteristics (e. g., academic rank). Studies with male authors, however, had more sex-balanced samples. The mean percentage female in client-focused studies with a female lead author was 70. 0, compared to 52. 1 for male lead authors. Conclusion: Nurse researchers not only in North America but around the globe need to pay attention to who will benefit from their research and to whether they are adequately inclusive in studying client groups about which there are knowledge gaps.

Methodology: Forty semi-structured interviews were undertaken with affected and unaffected individuals at either high or average risk of developing melanoma due to family history. Interviews addressed key issues such as: the role of genetics in causal attributions for melanoma; genetic testing intentions and motivations; perceived accuracy of genetic testing in predicting melanoma onset, and the impact of varied accuracy on testing intentions; views on the testing of children; perceived benefits and limitations of testing; and information needs and communication preferences. Results: In-depth thematic analysis revealed a number of important qualitative differences between groups at varying risk of melanoma, and genders. Specifically, participants with a family history of melanoma believed genetic factors {{play an important role in}} melanoma causation; conveyed strong intentions to pursue genetic testing; and viewed the benefits of genetic testing as outweighing the <b>limitations.</b> <b>Females</b> appeared to endorse the testing of children more firmly than males, and males` intentions to pursue testing appeared more contingent on penetrance than females`. Across groups, the most preferred communication option was an informational video.

[...] 11 pages, 5 figuresPlanktonic copepods are a very successful group in marine pelagic environments, with {{a key role in}} biogeochemical cycles. Among them, the genus Oithona {{is one of the more}} abundant and ubiquitous. We report here on the effects of caloric (food) restriction on the ageing patterns of the copepod Oithona davisae. The response of O. davisae to caloric restriction was sex dependent: under food <b>limitation,</b> <b>females</b> have lower age-specific mortality rates and longer lifespans and reproductive periods; male mortality rates and life expectancy were not affected. Males are more active swimmers than females, and given their higher energetic demands presumably generate reactive oxygen species at higher rates. That was confirmed by starvation experiments, which showed that O. davisae males burn through body reserves much faster, resulting in shorter life expectancy. Compared with common, coastal calanoid copepods, the effects of caloric restriction on O. davisae appeared less prominent. We think this difference in the magnitude of the responses is a consequence of the distinct life-history traits associated with the genus Oithona (ambush feeder, egg-carrier), with much lower overall levels of metabolism and reproductive effortThis research was funded by projects CTM 2011 - 23480 and CGL 2014 - 59227 -R of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (co-financed with FEDER funds, EU) Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In many animals, {{females are}} fed by males during {{courtship}} or incubation (mate-feeding). According to the mate appraisal hypothesis, females may evaluate the parental capacity of males, whereas the pair bond hypothesis suggests that feeding may strengthen the pair bonds with them. Following the nutrition hypothesis, by contrast, females obtain direct nutritional benefits from being fed by males {{during periods of}} high-energy expenditure, such as egg formation and incubation. However, there is little support for these hypotheses at an interspecific level. We tested predictions from these hypotheses in a dataset of 170 species of passerine birds. As predicted by the nutrition hypothesis, we found that mate-feeding has evolved more often in species in which the female incubates and builds the nest alone and have noncarnivorous diets. This suggests that mate-feeding is a behavioral strategy that compensates for nutritional <b>limitations</b> of <b>females</b> during breeding, as both incubation and nest building are energetically costly processes, and noncarnivorous diets are deficient in proteins. We also found that incubation feeding has evolved more often in species that place nests at elevated sites, suggesting that these species face low predation risk that allows males to feed females. In the particular case of incubation feeding, we found that species that have evolved this behavior produce larger clutch size and have higher hatching success. Our results support the nutrition hypothesis from an interspecific perspective, suggesting that mate-feeding is a strategy to compensate for nutritional <b>limitations</b> of <b>females</b> during reproduction {{and that it has}} fitness consequences.

Information on exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) has mainly been generated by secondary care-based clinical cohorts. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Electronic medical records database (England and Wales). Participants: 58 589 patients with COPD aged ≥ 40 years with COPD diagnosis recorded between 1 April 2009 and 30 September 2012, and with at least 365 days of follow-up before and after the COPD diagnosis, were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Mean age: 69 years; 47 % female; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s 60 % predicted. Outcome measures: Data on moderate or severe exacerbation episodes defined by diagnosis and/or medication codes 12 months following cohort entry were retrieved, together with demographic and clinical characteristics. Associations between patient characteristics and odds of having none versus one, none versus frequent (≥ 2) and one versus frequent exacerbations over 12 months follow-up were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: During follow-up, 23 % of patients had evidence of frequent moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations (24 % one; 53 % none). Independent predictors of increased odds of having exacerbations during the follow-up, either frequent episodes or one episode, included prior exacerbations, increasing dyspnoea score, increasing grade of airflow <b>limitation,</b> <b>females</b> and prior or current history of several comorbidities (eg, asthma, depression, anxiety, heart failure and cancer).

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement {{that the cost of}} oviposition underlies selective oviposition in insects, there is no consensus regarding which factors mediate the cost of oviposition. Models have suggested that egg costs are often paramount in those insects that do not continue to mature eggs during the adult stage (pro-ovigenic insects). Here we address the hypothesis that egg costs are generally less significant in synovigenic insects, which can replenish oocyte supplies through continuous egg maturation. A dynamic optimization model based on the biology of a highly synovigenic parasitoid, Aphytis aonidiae, suggests that the maximum rate of egg maturation is insufficient to balance the depletion of eggs when opportunities to oviposit are abundant. Transient egg limitation therefore occurs, which imposes opportunity costs on reproducing females. Thus, whereas the most fundamental constraint acting on the lifetime reproductive success of pro-ovigenic species is the fixed total number of eggs that they carry at eclosion, the most fundamental constraint acting on a synovigenic species is the maximum rate of oocyte maturation. Furthermore, the ability of synovigenic species to reverse the flow of nutrients from the soma to oocytes (i. e. egg resorption) has a dramatic influence on the cost of oviposition. Whereas females in hostrich environments may experience oviposition-mediated egg <b>limitation,</b> <b>females</b> in host-poor environments may experience oosorption-mediated egg limitation. Both forms of egg limitation are costly. Contrary to initial expectations, the flexibility of resource allocation that typifies synovigenic reproduction actually appears to broaden the range of conditions under which costly egg limitation occurs. Egg costs appear to be fundamental in mediating the trade-off between current and future reproduction, and therefore are an important factor favouring selective insect oviposition...|$|R

50|$|In {{a context}} where a vast {{majority}} of prisoners (or even all) are male, hiring women to watch male prisoners can be seen as problematic. Many actions performed in correctional facilities, such as shower patrol, strip searches, and many other normal prison activities, are seen as <b>limitations</b> for <b>female</b> workers. Since female guards are not allowed to be in contact with nude, male inmates or their genitalia, this can put pressure on effective security.

Close proximity to inmates during these instances is shame-inducing for them and can add various levels of frustration and powerlessness to what was already a shameful and powerless situation (being in prison). Problems with female security may range from common privacy to invasion of privacy, and further with experiences of sexual assault from the guard or the inmates.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the maintenance of gynodioecy in natural populations requires evidence concerning the phenotypic expression and reproductive consequences of male sterility. We have recently discovered male sterility in populations of Kallstroemia grandiflora from northwestern Mexico. Here we describe the development of anther and pollen grains in hermaphrodite and female plants and explore whether females experience any compensatory advantage over hermaphrodites. The major difference in anther development between morphs was the early disintegration of tapetal cells in anthers of pistillate flowers. Abnormalities in developing pollen grains in pistillate flowers were seen in the microspore mother cells, microspore tetrads, and young and mature pollen grains.

We recorded a higher production of pollen grains in long-styled morph, and a higher seed set in shortstyled morph. The high intra-morph variability of sexual organ position may explain the hybridization phenomena allowing and easier intra-morph pollination. The fruit set is constant, although its winter-flowering period might decrease pollen transfer. Nevertheless, the lower competition for pollinators with neighbouring plants and the longlasting anthesis may offset its reproductive success. Even if our results show no evidence of imminent threats, changes in plant–pollinator interactions might increase inbreeding, resulting in an increased extinction risk...|$|R
40|$|A male Drosophila {{model of}} {{locomotor}} deficit induced by chronic pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a proconvulsant used to model epileptogenesis in rodents, {{has recently been}} described. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) ameliorate development of this behavioral abnormality. Time-series of microarray profiling of heads of male flies treated with PTZ has shown epileptogenesis-like transcriptomic perturbation in the fly model. Gender differences are known to exist in neurological and psychiatric conditions including epileptogenesis. We describe here the effects of chronic PTZ in Drosophila females, and compare the results with the male model.

Gender differences thus exist in the Drosophila model. Gender neutral, Dorso-Ventral axis formation may be considered as the candidate causal pathway in chronic pentylenetetrazole induced behavioral deficit.

However, {{there is little evidence}} on this theoretical trade-off and its proximate background. Our aim was to study whether pigment availability modulates this potential relationship in blue-footed booby females. We supplemented females with dietary carotenoids after laying the first egg and assessed the change in foot color, a carotenoid-based sexually selected trait in both sexes. We measured the change in body mass and in the levels of plasma antioxidants and carotenoids. Also, we registered the mass and volume of eggs. Surprisingly, experimental females reduced zeaxanthin concentration in plasma, but not other carotenoids or total antioxidant levels. Conversely, they increased foot color intensity and laid heavier second eggs and larger second and third eggs than controls. Furthermore, under natural conditions (controls), ornamentation was negatively associated with the mass and volume of second eggs, but the association was reversed under conditions of high carotenoid availability (experimental females). Results suggest that carotenoid availability may mediate the theoretical trade-off between ornamentation and fecundity.

40|$|Rather {{than being}} a passive, {{haphazard}} process of wear and tear, lifespan can be modulated actively by components of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) pathway in laboratory animals. Complete or partial loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding components of the insulin/IGFI pathway result in extension of life span in yeasts, worms, flies, and mice. This remarkable conservation throughout evolution suggests that altered signaling in this pathway may also influence human lifespan.

40|$|Background: Lumbar muscle {{function}} {{is considered to}} be an important component of longterm low- back pain. The change in the median frequency of the power spectrum of the electromyographic (EMG) signal is commonly used to estimate muscle fatigue. Aim: The main purpose was to evaluate a test method to estimate lumbar muscle fatigue using frequency analysis of the electromyographic signal during isometric contraction. Methods: In the different studies, 73 healthy subjects participated; 55 of these constituted a reference group which was compared to 57 patients with long-term low-back pain. The subjects performed a back extensor test in seated position: maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque, 45 s isometric fatigue contraction at 80 % of MVC, 5 s contractions after 1, 2, 3 and 5 min in the recovery period. Surface EMG was recorded from the lumbar muscles bilaterally at spinal levels L 1 and L 5. To study reliability, this test was repeated five times by I I of the healthy subjects and once by 20 of the patients. In a further study, 15 of the healthy subjects performed the fatigue test at 40 % and 80 % of MVC with both 2 cm and 4 cm interelectrode distances. EMG variables were initial median frequency, median frequency slope (obtained from linear regression of the fatigue contraction) and recovery halftime (obtained from non-linear regression of the recovery data). Activity, participation and other health-related factors were estimated by the patients in five questionnaires. Results: The reliability was somewhat higher for patients (ICC> 0. 6) than for healthy subjects. The initial median frequency and, to a greater extent, the slope were sensitive to the exerted torque. The patients differed from the healthy subjects by lower MVC torque, higher initial median frequency at L 5, and by flatter slope and longer recovery half-time at both lumbar levels. Using logistic regression entering EMG initial median frequency, slope and recovery half-time in combination with MVC, out 80 % of the patients an the healthy subjects could be correctly classified. By analyses of individual linear and non-linear regressions, it was found that patients with not significantly negative slopes and/or not exponential-like EMG recovery had lower self-efficacy and more activity <b>limitations.</b> <b>Female</b> patients had significantly flatter slopes, lower physical functioning and self-efficacy than male patients. The results indicate that the ability to fatigue the lumbar muscles in a 80 % MVC contraction might be a healthy sign. Conclusion: The most important findings concerning the validity of the present test are that patients with long term low-back pain and back-healthy subjects could be correctly classified in about 80 % of the cases, and that subjective assessments of health-related factors were related to EMG fatigue and recovery...|$|R

Daphne laureola is a gynodioecious woody perennial that flowers from January to April in southern Spain, a period characterized by cold temperatures, frequent rains and irregular snowfalls. • Methods: Pollinators were excluded at four different times during the flowering season {{in order to determine}} the effect of decreased exposure to pollinators on fruit set in female and hermaphrodite individuals. The role of nocturnal and diurnal pollination on reproductive success in each gender was simultaneously evaluated by selective exclusion. • Key results: A 50 % reduction in the flowering period decreased fruit set of females by 50 %, whereas the corresponding decrease in self-compatible hermaphrodites was only approx. 25 %. Day-active hymenopterans and lepidopterans were infrequent visitors, and nocturnal pollinators were inefficient, suggesting that pollen beetles, Meligethes elongatus, were the main pollinators of D. laureola in the study region. • Conclusions: Beetles were less abundant in pollenless females, although discrimination did not apparently result in pollination <b>limitation</b> of <b>female</b> reproduction. A preference of beetles for sunny locations emphasized the relevance of abiotic conditions for pollination of this early blooming shrub. © 2004 Annals of Botany Company. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A recent {{literature}} review indicates that pollen <b>limitation</b> of <b>female</b> fertility {{is a common}} feature of flowering plants. Despite the ecological and evolutionary significance of pollen limitation, most studies have only examined fertility in a single population at one time. Here we investigate pollen limitation of fruit and seed set in five populations of Narcissus assoanus, a self-sterile, insect-pollinated geophyte, over 2 – 3 years in southern France. In common with many early spring flowering plants, pollinator visitation to N. assoanus is often infrequent. Supplemental hand-pollination of flow-ers with outcross pollen significantly increased overall fruit and seed set by 11 % and 19 %, respectively. Four of the five populations experienced some pollen limitation during the study. For a given year, there was significant variation in pollen limitation among populations. Two of the populations were pollen limited in one year but not in other years {{in which they were}} studied. Seed:ovule ra-tios for open- and hand-pollinated flowers averaged 0. 29 and 0. 33, respectively. While hand pollination signifi-cantly increased the seed:ovule ratio, the low value obtained indicates that the majority of ovules in flowers do not mature seeds despite hand pollination. The role of genetic and environmental factors governing low seed:ovule ratios in N. assoanus is discussed.

40|$|BACKGROUND Research {{suggests}} that patients presenting to hospital with self-cutting {{differ from those}} with intentional overdose in demographic and clinical characteristics. However, large-scale national studies comparing self-cutting patients with those using other self-harm methods are lacking. We aimed to compare hospital-treated self-cutting and intentional overdose, to examine the role of gender in moderating these differences, and examine the characteristics and outcomes of those patients presenting with combined self-cutting and overdose. METHODS Between 2003 and 2010, the Irish National Registry of Deliberate Self-Harm recorded 42, 585 self-harm presentations to Irish hospital emergency departments meeting the study inclusion criteria. Data were obtained on demographic and clinical characteristics by independent data registration officers. RESULTS Compared with overdose only, involvement of self-cutting (with or without overdose) was significantly more common in males than <b>females,</b> with an <b>overrepresentation</b> of males aged < 35 years. Independent of gender, involvement of self-cutting (with or without overdose) {{was significantly associated with}} younger age, city residence, repetition within 30 days and repetition within a year (females only). Factors associated with self-cutting as the sole method were no fixed abode/living in an institution, presenting outside 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., not consuming alcohol and repetition between 31 days and 1 year (males only). CONCLUSION The demographic and clinical differences between self-harm patients underline the presence of different subgroups with implications for service provision and prevention of repeated self-harm. Given the relationship between self-cutting and subsequent repetition, service providers need to ensure that adequate follow-up arrangements and supports are in place for the patient...|$|R
40|$|Populations of gynodioecious species vary in {{the ratio}} of female versus {{hermaphroditic}} individuals they contain, and many exhibit higher frequencies of females under poor resource conditions. One important factor limiting female frequencies within populations is predicted to be pollen limitation of seed production, caused by either low abundance of pollen donors or insufficient pollen transfer. However, empirical studies measuring variation in pollen limitation with population sex ratios or resource gradients in gynodioecious plants are inconsistent. Part of this inconsistency may be that pollen limitation and its causes are context-dependent. Another possibility is that sex-specific daily flower production and/or sex-biased visitation are more relevant to the likelihood of pollen limitation than sex ratio based on counting individual plants. In this study, we examined context-dependent pollen limitation in gynodioecious/subdioecious Fragaria virginiana. We specifically examined the potential for resource availability to influence sex-specific daily flower production, sex-biased pollinator visitation, and their relationships with pollen limitation in experimental populations that contained either high or low frequencies of female plants. High resource availability reduced apparent female frequency by increasing daily flower production by hermaphrodites relative to females. This is important because pollinators increasingly discriminated against female flowers as floral sex ratios became more female-biased. Contrary to expectation, females in high-female populations were not consistently more pollen limited than those in low-female populations. The level of pollen <b>limitation</b> of <b>females</b> was better explained by sexbiased pollinator foraging and visitatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract,The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the factors that {{contribute}} to gender discrimination in retail shops, focusing on general dealer shops at Murambinda Growth point in Buhera, Zimbabwe. Despite the fact that policy makers continue to grapple with possible strategies to promote and advance progress towards equal opportunities for women, gender discrimination in retail shops still exists. Recent research also shows that workplace discrimination continues to be an impediment to gender equality. Women, who bear the disproportionate burden of the worldâ€™s poverty, continue to face systematic discrimination in areas of employment, healthcare and education. This discrimination is quite significant in increasing poverty levels among women as it makes it more difficult for women to sustain livelihoods. It is from that premise that the study sought to find out why, after all the advances that have been made in womenâ€™s education and in breaking the corporate glass ceiling, is the situation of women unchanging? Using the descriptive survey design, the study examined the possible <b>limitations</b> on <b>female</b> labour market participation. The study established that there are a number of factors that contribute to the discrimination of women in working environments, chief among them being patriarchy, religion, culture and socialisation. Over and above all, the study recommends that all efforts targeted at addressing gender discrimination in the workplace must take into consideration the fact that gender roles are socially constructed and they are heavily influenced by the above mentioned factors...|$|R
