5|$|After further {{slippage}} in the timescales, {{the opening}} date was revised from late June 2015 to 19 August 2015. The delay was explained as being due to needing to undertake additional work to stabilise the road foundation in two <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> make it suitable to lay tarmac on. The road finally {{opened on the}} evening of 19 August 2015, costing £20.4M in total, of which Sefton Council funded £5.9M (approximately 30%) of the cost.|$|E
5|$|Fort Defiance {{was also}} being {{constructed}} at this time, located farther southwest, past Fort Box, near present-day Red Hook. In {{addition to these}} new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green, and more cannons placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River. Hulks were sunk at strategic <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> deter the British from entering the East River and other waterways.|$|E
5|$|Humpback whales {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> see {{humpback}} whales {{from a safe distance}} of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).|$|E

5|$|President Bush {{declared}} Louisiana {{a federal}} disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began pouring in, 153,000 {{by the time}} of the deadline. Over $311million in aid was granted to Louisiana. A total of $50million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistan Air Force retaliated {{for these}} attacks by bombing Okha harbour scoring direct hits on {{fuelling}} facilities for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and the missile boats' jetty. The Indian Navy anticipated this attack {{and had already}} moved the missile boats to other <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> prevent any losses. However, {{the destruction of a}} special fuel tank prevented any further incursions until Operation Python, executed three days later.|$|E
5|$|After {{its second}} landfall, {{additional}} floods occurred in several towns, and in Sinaloa over 100,000people were rendered homeless and four people died. As {{a result of}} Manuel's impacts, 107municipalities were declared disaster regions. Damage in Sinaloa totaled MXN$500million (US$37.9million). The Mexican Army was dispatched in several <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> aid in post-tropical cyclone relief operations. Following the storm, looting in heavily impacted areas became commonplace, and as such government forces were also dispatched to prevent further looting. Overall, 123people {{lost their lives in}} Mexico while damage exceeded MXN$55billion (US$4.2billion).|$|E

5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> be substituted, allowing the use of crane shots. With the photography done, Moore took the film to South Korea to edit to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing. Visual effects were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs {{on either side of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E

50|$|In 1873 a {{committee}} from the Foundry Methodist Church, located at 14th and G streets NW in Washington, D.C., began {{a search for}} a permanent <b>location</b> <b>to</b> hold annual camp meetings. They wanted a location with sufficient space for thousands of attendees, a supply of clean water, and a shaded <b>location</b> <b>to</b> provide relief from the summer sun. They wanted the <b>location</b> <b>to</b> be less than a day's trip from Washington, D.C., and protection from the sale of liquor, because Methodists did not believe in drinking alcohol.|$|R

5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E

5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> avoid the lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow {{and they would}} be assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It was only in the latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E
5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E
5|$|Rapid forces, {{whether for}} an {{offensive}} or defensive purpose, {{were needed to}} deny vital <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> the enemy. Long before the Germans did, the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks. As early as 1936 the French had commissioned the design of light airborne tanks, but these plans had been abandoned in 1940, as they possessed no cargo planes large enough to carry them. A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing. These would send forward forces over the Scheldt estuary into the Isles, supplied by overseas shipping.|$|E

5|$|Reproduction is {{by either}} asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get {{detached}} from the colony by a storm or other means, {{and some of these}} fragments may end up in suitable <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical to the parent colony. This fragmentation is probably the most frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held {{portions of the}} mainland and certain strategic islands. The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and were attempting to cover their shipping by moving only by night, close to shore, and heaving to during the day under camouflage nets. The LRDG was tasked to patrol the coast, find the ships and report their <b>locations</b> <b>to</b> the air force for bombing. This it did with success. It remained in Yugoslavia {{for the rest of}} the war.|$|E
