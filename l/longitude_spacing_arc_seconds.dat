40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) {{determined by}} interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (InSAR) based on the SRTM mission are available free of charge. The <b>spacing</b> of 1 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> corresponds to the pixel size of the used SAR images, so no better resolution is possible with the used technique. But the morphologic details are even a little below the possibility of such spacing, limiting the possibility to remove the height values not belonging to the bare ground. Approximately the same accuracy, but more morphologic details can be achieved with height models determined by automatic image matching of SPOT 5 stereo scenes. Outside the USA where the spacing of the SRTM DEMs is limited to 3 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds,</b> even with ASTER stereo models in mountainous areas more details can be reached. The C-band SAR as well as optical images do lead to height models describing {{the top of the}} visible surface. Morphologic details enable a filtering of points located on buildings and on top of the forest surface, leading to a better DEM definition. Nevertheless in open areas a better accuracy is available like in forest areas. A clear dependency of the root mean square errors upon the tangent of the terrain inclination can be seen in all data sets. Available small horizontal shifts of the DEMs should be respected by a least squares fitting of the analysed DEMs...|$|R

40|$|These {{lecture notes}} have been {{prepared}} for the Summer school on ”Moduli <b>spaces</b> and <b>arcs</b> in algebraic geometry”, Cologne, August 2007. The goal is to explain the relevance of <b>spaces</b> of <b>arcs</b> to birational geometry. In the first section we introduce the <b>spaces</b> of <b>arcs</b> and their finite-dimensional approximations, the spaces of jets. In the second section we see how to relate the <b>spaces</b> of <b>arcs</b> of birational varieties. If f is a proper birational morphism between varieties Y and X, then the induced map f ∞ {{at the level of}} <b>spaces</b> of <b>arcs</b> is ”almost bijective”. The key result is the Birational Transformation Theorem, which shows that if X and Y are nonsingular, then the geometry of f ∞ is governed by the order of vanishing along the discrepancy divisor KY/X. In the third section we give some applications to invariants of K-equivalent varieties, and to the description of the log canonical threshold in terms of the codimensions of certain subsets in <b>spaces</b> of <b>arcs.</b> 1.

40|$|We {{assess the}} new EGM 2008 Earth {{gravitational}} model using {{a set of}} 1056 astrogeodetic vertical deflections over parts of continental Europe. Our astrogeodetic vertical deflection data set originates from zenith camera observations performed during 1983 - 2008. This set, which is completely independent from EGM 2008, covers, e. g., Switzerland, Germany, Portugal and Greece, and samples a variety of topography ? level terrain, medium elevated and rugged Alpine areas. We describe how EGM 2008 is used to compute vertical deflections according to Helmert?s (surface) definition. Particular {{attention is paid to}} estimating the EGM 2008 signal omission error from residual terrain model (RTM) data. The RTM data is obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation model and the DTM 2006. 0 high degree spherical harmonic reference surface. The comparisons between the astrogeodetic and EGM 2008 vertical deflections show an agreement of about 3 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds</b> (root mean square, RMS). Adding omission error estimates from RTM to EGM 2008 significantly reduces the discrepancies from the complete European set of astrogeodetic deflections to 1 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> (RMS). Depending on the region, the RMS errors vary between 0. 4 and 1. 5 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds.</b> These values not only reflect EGM 2008 commission errors, but also short-scale mass-density anomalies not modelled from the RTM data. Given (1) formally stated EGM 2008 commission error estimates of about 0. 6 - 0. 8 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds</b> for vertical deflections, and (2) that short-scale mass-density anomalies may affect vertical deflections by about 1 <b>arc</b> <b>second,</b> the agreement between EGM 2008 and our astrogeodetic deflection data set is very good. Further focus is placed on the investigation of the high-degree spectral bands of EGM 2008.
