40|$|AIMS: Oral {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIa inhibitors might {{enhance the}} early benefit of an intravenous agent and prevent subsequent cardiac events {{in patients with}} acute coronary syndromes. We assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of 1 month treatment with three dose levels of the oral GP IIb/IIIa blocker <b>lefradafiban</b> in patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction without persistent ST elevation. METHODS: The Fibrinogen Receptor Occupancy STudy (FROST) {{was designed as a}} dose-escalation trial with 20, 30 and 45 mg <b>lefradafiban</b> t. i. d. or placebo. Five hundred and thirty-one patients were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio to <b>lefradafiban</b> or placebo in a double-blind manner. Efficacy was assessed by the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and recurrent angina. Safety was evaluated by the occurrence of bleeding classified according to the TIMI criteria and by measuring clinical laboratory parameters. RESULTS: There was a trend towards a reduction in cardiac events with <b>lefradafiban</b> 30 mg when compared with placebo and <b>lefradafiban</b> 20 mg. The benefit was particularly apparent in patients with a positive (> or = O. 1 ng. ml(- 1)) troponin I test at baseline and less so in those with a negative test result. In patients receiving <b>lefradafiban,</b> the cardiac event rate decreased with increasing minimal levels of fibrinogen receptor occupancy. There was a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of bleeding: the composite of major or minor bleeding occurred in 1 % of placebo patients, 5 % of patients receiving <b>lefradafiban</b> 20 mg and in 7 % of patients receiving 30 mg, with an excessive risk (15 %) in the 45 mg group which resulted in early discontinuation of this dose level. Gingival and arterial or venous puncture site bleedings were most common and accounted for more than 60 % of all haemorrhagic events. There was an increased incidence of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1. 5 x 10 (9) /l) in the <b>lefradafiban</b> groups (5. 2 % vs 1. 5 % in the placebo group), which did not result from bone marrow depression but rather from a reversible redistribution of neutrophils by margination or clustering. CONCLUSION: One month's treatment with the oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor <b>lefradafiban</b> in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction without persistent ST elevation resulted in a decrease in cardiac events with <b>lefradafiban</b> 30 mg and a dose-dependent increase in haemorrhagic events. The observed favourable trend towards a reduction in cardiac events in patients with elevated troponin levels requires confirmation in a large clinical trial...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Lefradafiban</b> is the orally active prodrug of fradafiban, a {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. The present phase II study {{aimed to}} determine the dose of <b>lefradafiban</b> that provides 80 % blockade of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors by fradafiban, and to study the pharmacodynamics and safety of different doses in patients with stable angina undergoing angioplasty. DESIGN: A double blind, placebo controlled, dose finding study. SETTING: Four academic and community hospitals in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: 64 patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. INTERVENTIONS: 30 mg, 45 mg, and 60 mg of <b>lefradafiban</b> three times daily or placebo was given for 48 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary safety end point was the occurrence of bleeding, classified as major, minor, or insignificant according to the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) criteria. Efficacy indices included per cent fibrinogen receptor occupancy (FRO), ex vivo platelet aggregation, and plasma concentrations of fradafiban. RESULTS: Administration of <b>lefradafiban</b> 30, 45, and 60 mg three times daily resulted in a dose dependent increase in median FRO levels of 71 %, 85 %, and 88 %, respectively. Inhibition of platelet aggregation was closely related to FRO. There were no major bleeding events. The 60 mg <b>lefradafiban</b> group had a high (71 %) incidence of minor and insignificant bleeding. The incidence of bleeding was 44 % in the 30 mg and 45 mg groups, compared with 9 % in placebo patients. Puncture site bleeding {{was the most common}} event. The odds of bleeding increased by 3 % for every 1 % increase in FRO. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lefradafiban</b> is an effective oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker. The clinical effectiveness of doses up to 45 mg three times daily should be investigated...|$|E
40|$|As the {{glycoprotein}} GPIIb/IIIa receptor is {{the final}} common pathway in platelet aggregation, antagonists of this receptor cause a profound inhibition of aggregation induced by any agonist. The short-term efficacy and safety of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty was demonstrated with murine 7 E 3 Fab, but this antibody was immunogenic. Abciximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody that is less immunogenic. The first major trial with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist was the EPIC trial with abciximab, which showed that abciximab reduced the ischemic complications of coronary balloon angioplasty and atherectomy in high-risk patients, but increased the risk of bleeding. Subsequent studies showed that using less concurrent heparin reduced bleeding. Abciximab also reduced the rate of revascularization. Further {{studies have shown that}} the benefits of abciximab extended to all patients undergoing angioplasty (EPILOG), including patients with unstable angina (CAPTURE) and acute myocardial infarction (RAPPORT). Clinical trials with eptifibatide and tirofiban have failed to demonstrate benefit, at the doses used, in angioplasty. Abciximab and eptifibatide, but not oral xemilofiban, improve the safety of the coronary stenting procedure. Shortterm intravenous treatment with lamifiban, eptifibatide or tirofiban is beneficial in acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non-Q wave myocardial infarction). Orally active GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being developed for use in acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. However, no benefit has been shown with <b>lefradafiban</b> in acute coronary syndromes and sibrafiban and orbofiban are harmful. Eptifibatide, lamifiban and abciximab improve coronary patency in myocardial infarction, and long-term trials of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being conducted in acute myocardial infarction. Abciximab can cause thrombocytopenia, and all the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increase the incidence of bleeding, but there is no excess of intracranial hemorrhage. (C) 2001 Prous Science.
