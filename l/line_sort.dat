We generalize this to the situation when a network sorts almost all binary sequences and relate it to {{the behavior of the}} sorting network on arbitrary inputs.

The ability to sort cell subpopulations of different sizes would facilitate investigation at genomic and proteomic levels of mechanisms by which cells attain and maintain their size. Currently available cell sorters, however, cannot directly measure cell volume electronically, and it would therefore be desirable to know which of the optical measurements {{that can be made}} in such instruments provide the best estimate of volume. We investigated several different light scattering and fluorescence measurements in several different cell <b>lines,</b> <b>sorting</b> cell fractions from the high and low end of distributions, and measuring volume electronically to determine which sorting strategy yielded the best separated volume distributions. Since we found that different optical measurements were optimal for different cell lines, we suggest that following this procedure will enable other investigators to optimize their own cell sorters for volume-based separation of the cell types with which they work...|$|R

The introductory chapters describe current state of handling of selected recyclables and the technologies of their collection.

Subsequently, the outputs of the model are evaluated for three settings of its input variables, which represent the three imagined scenarios of the modeled <b>sorting</b> <b>line’s</b> operation. Sensitivity analyses focused on selected input variables of this model were also performed. A separate chapter is dedicated to changes in the model outputs in the case of including the waste transportation prices to the selected scenario.
