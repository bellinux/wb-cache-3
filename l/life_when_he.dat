5|$|One theory interprets Putana {{as being}} the first foe faced by Krishna (further {{numerous}} demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct faced by yogis.

5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his <b>life,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's <b>life</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> lived in Los Angeles. He also {{made a conscious decision}} to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E

5|$|Beer, as {{he still}} named himself, studied with Antonio Salieri and the German master {{and friend of}} Goethe, Carl Friedrich Zelter. Louis Spohr {{organised}} a concert for Beer at Berlin in 1804 and continued his acquaintance with the lad later in Vienna and Rome. A portrait of Jacob commissioned by the family at this time shows him 'confidently facing the viewer, his hair romantically dishevelled… his left hand rests on the keyboard, and his right hand grasps a musical manuscript… plac its subject {{in the tradition of}} the young Mozart'. Beer's first stage work, the ballet Der Fischer und das Milchmädchen (The Fisherman and the Milkmaid) was produced in March 1810 at the Court Opera in Berlin. His formal training with the Abbé Vogler at Darmstadt between 1810 and 1812 was, however, of crucial importance, and at around this time he begins to sign himself 'Meyer Beer'. Here, with his fellow students (who included Carl Maria von Weber), he learnt not only the craft of composition but also the business of music (organising concerts and dealing with publishers). Forming a close friendship with Weber and other pupils, Meyerbeer established the Harmonischer Verein (Musical Union), whose members undertook to support each other with favourable press criticism and networking. On 12 February 1813 Beer received the first of the string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his <b>life</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was appointed 'Court Composer' by Grand Duke Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt.|$|E
