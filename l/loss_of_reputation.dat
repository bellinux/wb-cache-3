Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a faction, their reputation with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>reputation.</b> The type of reputation the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; a bad reputation may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E

The data used in this study were derived from both primary and secondary sources. The secondary data for the study was derived from the review of literature. The primary data was obtained through the use of a questionnaire which was distributed to client (government) and consultant representatives (quantity surveyor, civil engineer, architects, project managers and mechanical and electrical engineers), only organizations registered with the ministry of public work and transport in Swaziland and other professional bodies were surveyed.

2500|$|Recognizing {{that the}} Supreme Court has long {{held that a}} {{restoration}} of capital “s not income,” and thus is not taxable, and that personal injury recoveries have traditionally been considered “nontaxable {{on the theory that}} they roughly correspond to a return of capital,” the D.C. Circuit accepted Murphy’s argument in its August 2006 decision. The D.C. Circuit reasoned that Murphy’s award for emotional distress or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> is not taxable because her damages “were awarded to make Murphy emotionally and reputationally ‘whole’ and not to compensate her for lost wages or taxable earnings of any kind.” The D.C. Circuit also explained that a 1918 opinion of the Attorney General stating that proceeds from an accident insurance policy were not taxable income and a 1922 IRS ruling that damages based on <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> were not taxable income, both issued relatively near the Sixteenth Amendment’s ratification in 1913, support its ruling. The D.C.
