5000|$|Until a {{permanent}} new order could be imposed {{under the terms}} of the Congress of Vienna, the region lay under joint Bavarian-Austrian administration, whose seat was in Kreuznach. When these terms eventually came about, Kreuznach passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 and from 1816 it belonged to the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the province of the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine (as of 1822 the Rhine Province) and was a border town with two neighbouring states, the Grand Duchy of Hesse to the east and the Bavarian exclave of the Palatinate to the south. The two saltworks, which had now apparently been taken away from Napoleon's sister, were from 1816 to 1897 Grand-Ducal-Hessian state property on Prussian territory. In 1817, Johann Erhard Prieger opened the first bathing parlour with briny water and thereby laid the groundwork for the fast-growing spa business. In 1843, Karl Marx married Jenny von Westphalen in Kreuznach, presumably at the Wilhelmskirche (William's Church), which had been built between 1698 and 1700 and was later, in 1968, all but torn down, leaving only the churchtower. In Kreuznach, Marx set down considerable portions of his manuscript Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right (Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie) in 1843. Clara Schumann, who was attending the spa in Kreuznach, and her half-sister Marie Wieck gave a concert at the spa house in 1860. With the building of the Nahe Valley Railway from Bingerbrück to Saarbrücken in 1858/1860, the groundwork was laid for the town's industrialization. This, along with the ever-growing income from the spa, led after years of stagnation to an economic boost for the town's development. Nevertheless, the railway was not built for industry and spa-goers alone, but also as a <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> for a war that was expected to break out with France. Before this, though, right at Kreuznach's town limits, Prussia and Bavaria once again stood at odds with each other in 1866. Thinking that was not influenced by this led to another railway line being built even before the First World War, the [...] "strategic railway" [...] from Bad Münster by way of Staudernheim, Meisenheim, Lauterecken and Kusel towards the west, making Kreuznach into an important contributor to transport towards the west. Only about 1950 were parts of this line torn up and abandoned. Today, between Staudernheim and Kusel, it serves as a tourist attraction for those who wish to ride draisines.In 1891, three members of the Franciscan Brothers of the Holy Cross came to live in Kreuznach. In 1893, they took over the hospital Kiskys-Wörth, which as of 1905 bore the name St. Marienwörth. Since 1948, they have run it together with the Sisters of the Congregation of Papal Law of the Maids of Mary of the Immaculate Conception, and today run it as a hospital bearing the classification II. Regelversorgung under Germany's Versorgungsstufe hospital planning system. In 1901, the Second Rhenish Diakonissen-Mutterhaus ("Deaconess's Mother-House"), founded in 1889 in Sobernheim, moved under its abbot, the Reverend Hugo Reich (1854-1935), to Kreuznach. It is now a foundation known as the kreuznacher diakonie (always written with lowercase initials). In 1904, the pharmacist Karl Aschoff discovered the Kreuznach brine's radon content, and thereafter introduced [...] "radon balneology", a therapy that had already been practised in the Austro-Hungarian town of Sankt Joachimsthal in the Bohemian Ore Mountains (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic). Even though the Bad Kreuznach's radon content was much slighter than that found in the waters from Brambach or Bad Gastein, the town was quickly billed as a [...] "radium healing spa" [...] - the technical error in that billing notwithstanding. In 1912, a radon inhalatorium was brought into service, into which was piped the air from an old mining gallery at the Kauzenberg, which had a higher radon content than the springwater. The inhalatorium was destroyed in 1945. In 1974, however, the old mining gallery itself was converted into a therapy room. To this day, radon inhalation serves as a natural pain reliever for those suffering from rheumatism. In the First World War, both the Kreuznach spa house and other hotels and villas became as of 2 January 1917 the seat of the Great Headquarters of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser actually lived in the spa house. Used as the General staff building was the Oranienhof. At the spa house on 19 December 1917, General Mustafa Kemal Pasha - better known as Atatürk ("Father of the Turks") and later president of a strictly secular Turkey - the Kaiser, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff all met for talks. Only an extreme wintertime flood on the Nahe in January 1918 led to the Oberste Heeresleitung being moved to Spa in Belgium.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of small businesses}} contribute substantially to the South African economy. In recent years the South African Government has prioritised the development of township retail industries by implementing numerous initiatives. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine how formal independent small retail businesses in Soweto manage their <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers, namely facilities, inventory and transportation, in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency in order to survive. The <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers should not only be managed as a cohesive unit, but also be aligned with the orientation of the selected supply chain strategy, in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. During 2014, a quantitative survey was conducted among 650 formal independent small Sowetan businesses of which the responses of 556 retailers were analysed in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. The study also investigated the role of the relevant industry group in the management of the <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers by the business owners. The data was analysed and tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Pearson Chi-square test and factor analyses were performed. Two binary logistic regression models were developed to determine the influence of the management of the <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers on the small retailers’ odds of survival. The results showed that the small retailers manage facilities and inventory focused more towards responsiveness, whereas transportation is managed focused on either cost-efficiency or responsiveness.

40|$|Background: Small {{businesses}} {{are seen as}} the impetus behind a country’s economic growth. The South African government’s continued commitment to prioritise the development of small businesses, the promising rise of the retail sector in South Africa and the substantial contribution of small businesses to trade, business services, personal services and construction make the small retailers {{a force to be}} reckoned with. Businesses often fail because of a lack of strategic fit between the competitive and supply chain strategies. It is imperative that the supply chain design, resources and processes provide the necessary capabilities to support the desired competitive strategy. Managing the three <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers of facilities, inventory and transportation can contribute to achieving a strategic fit between the selected competitive strategy and supply chain strategy. The <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers should not only be managed as a cohesive unit, but should also be aligned with the orientation of the selected supply chain strategy, in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. Objective: The objective of this article is to provide guidelines from literature that small business retailers can use in managing their <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers to be aligned with the orientation of their selected supply chain strategy in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. Method: An extensive literature review was conducted pertaining to the management of the three <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers by small retailers. Results: It was determined that small responsive retailers typically order inventory on a frequent basis, hold excess inventory, provide customers with a seamless in-store experience and are located close to their customers. These responsive retailers make use of direct delivery from suppliers (and to customers) to increase their flexibility and reduce lead times. On the other hand, small cost-efficient retailers typically do not hold excess inventory, and their stores are usually located further away from customers. These cost-efficient retailers take advantage of both economies of scale when purchasing inventory and economies of distance when transporting inventory. Conclusion: Literature guidelines with regard to the management of the <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> chain drivers are provided to assist small retailers in achieving a strategic fit between the selected competitive strategy and supply chain strategy. </p...|$|R

50|$|Israeli {{forces were}} by now pouring across the canal on two bridges, {{including}} one of indigenous design, and motorized rafts. Israeli engineers under Brigadier-General Dan Even had worked under heavy Egyptian fire {{to set up the}} bridges, and over 100 were killed and hundreds more wounded. The crossing was difficult because of Egyptian artillery fire, though by 4:00 am, two of Adan's brigades were on {{the west bank of the}} canal. On the morning of October 18, Sharon's forces on the west bank launched an offensive toward Ismailia, slowly pushing back the Egyptian paratroop brigade occupying the sand rampart northward to enlarge the bridgehead. Some of his units attempted to move west, but were stopped at the crossroads in Nefalia. Adan's division rolled south toward Suez City while Magen's division pushed west toward Cairo and south toward Adabiya. On October 19, one of Sharon's brigades continued to push the Egyptian paratroopers north towards Ismailia until the Israelis were within 8 or 10 km of the city. Sharon hoped to seize the city and thereby sever the <b>logistical</b> and <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> for most of the Egyptian Second Army. Sharon's second brigade began to cross the canal. The brigade's forward elements moved to the Abu Sultan Camp, from where they moved north to take Orcha, an Egyptian logistics base defended by a commando battalion. Israeli infantrymen cleared the trenches and bunkers, often engaging in hand-to-hand combat, as tanks moved alongside them and fired into the trench sections to their front. The position was secured before nightfall. More than 300 Egyptians were killed and 50 taken prisoner, while the Israelis lost 18 dead. The fall of Orcha caused the collapse of the Egyptian defensive line, allowing more Israeli troops to get onto the sand rampart. There, they were able to fire in support of Israeli troops facing Missouri Ridge, an Egyptian-occupied position on the Bar-Lev Line that could pose a threat to the Israeli crossing. On the same day, Israeli paratroopers participating in Sharon's drive pushed the Egyptians back far enough for the Israeli bridges to be out of sight of Egyptian artillery observers, though the Egyptians continued shelling the area.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of new concepts in military operations and reductions in manpower of our military forces, the promotion of autonomous systems has been pushed to the forefront. Autonomous containers will play an essential role in the ability to deliver <b>logistical</b> <b>supplies</b> to waterborne littoral vessels enabling them to maintain station and complete there military operations while reducing the threat to personnel. Programmed to deliver supplies to a specified local in a reasonable timetable, these containers will play an essential role to vessels such as Riverine Warfare patrol craft, Special Operations craft and Coast Guard search and rescue boats. Development of a successful autonomous system that can deliver <b>logistical</b> <b>supplies</b> in littoral human threat arenas would serve as an immense reduction in <b>logistical</b> <b>supply</b> costs. The research that is to be conducted will focus on the unique characteristics of an autonomous sustainment cargo container and its throughput evaluation.
