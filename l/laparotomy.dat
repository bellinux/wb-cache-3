5|$|Surgical {{exploration}} may {{be necessary}} to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as <b>laparotomy,</b> in some patients. Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. <b>Laparotomy,</b> an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} recommended {{to perform a}} <b>laparotomy</b> when the diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy is made.

25|$|Most {{cases of}} Meckel's {{diverticulum}} are diagnosed when complications manifest or incidentally in unrelated {{conditions such as}} <b>laparotomy,</b> laparoscopy or contrast study of the small intestine.

25|$|By {{degree of}} {{invasiveness}} of surgical procedures: Minimally-invasive surgery involves smaller outer incision(s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in laparoscopic surgery or angioplasty.

25|$|An incisional hernia {{occurs when}} the defect {{is the result of}} an incompletely healed {{surgical}} wound.

25|$|CT is {{only able}} to detect 76% of hollow viscous {{injuries}} and patients who have negative scans must often be observed and rechecked if they deteriorate. However, CT has been demonstrated to be useful in screening patients with certain forms of abdominal trauma {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary <b>laparotomies,</b> which can significantly increase the cost and length of hospitalizations. A meta-analysis of CT use in penetrating abdominal traumas demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy >= 95%, with a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 98%. This suggests that CT is excellent for avoiding unnecessary <b>laparotomies</b> but must be augmented by other clinical criteria to determine the need for surgical exploration (23.37 positive likelihood ratio, 0.05 negative likelihood ratio).|$|R
40|$|Gut {{ischaemia}} following {{cardiac surgery}} carries a high mortality {{and is usually}} due to non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia. We reviewed 4464 patients undergoing cardiac surgery over a 5 -year period. Sixteen of them developed gut ischaemia post-operatively, 13 of whom were discovered at <b>laparotomies</b> while the remaining 3 were post-mortem diagnoses. Eleven patients {{were found to have}} extensive ischaemia and all 11 died irrespective of the treatment and the delay in diagnosis. In five patients ischaemia was localized, involving the caecum in three and terminal ileum in two. They all underwent local resections and survived. The differences in the groups were analysed and the average time between onset of symptoms and <b>laparotomies</b> was longer in the localized ischaemia group compared to the extensive ishaemia group. Our experience illustrates the continuing difficulty in diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia before gut infarction has occurred. We conclude that different pathologies might be involved in post-cardiac surgery gut ischaemia and although early diagnosis and treatment is considered to be crucial, early <b>laparotomies</b> do not necessarily equate to survival in cases of extensive ischaemia. There is a need to evaluate aggressive strategies for early diagnosis if prognosis is to be improved in these cases...|$|R
