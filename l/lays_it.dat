500|$|The comedy The Careless Husband (1704), {{generally}} considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and <b>lays</b> <b>it</b> gently on his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|E

2500|$|Weinstock {{assumes that}} it is Locatelli who replied to [...] "A.B.", asserting that Bellini and Romani were trying to achieve {{perfection}} before taking the opera to London. Then a torrent of anti-Beatrice letters appeared after the first performance, followed by a pro-Bellini reply, signed [...] "A friend of M. Bellini". [...] This letter removes the blame from Bellini and <b>lays</b> <b>it</b> {{at the feet of}} Romani, outlining the timetable for the delivery of the libretto, which was contracted to be due in two parts: one in October and then the second in November. The author states that, except for a limited amount of text, nothing had been received by mid-January and the piece continues by describing the legal proceedings taken by Bellini and the various setbacks which occurred even after Romani arrived in Venice. [...] On 2 April, this provoked a response from Romani himself, presenting his case against Bellini based largely on the composer's inability to decide on a subject, as well as justifying all the work which he did after arriving in Venice, only to find his melodramma [...] "touched up in a thousand ways", {{in order to make it}} acceptable to [...] "the Milords of the Thames [...] await him", a sarcastic reference to planned trip to London. Another, a more [...] "venomous" [...] version of this letter, was sent to Milan's L'Eco.|$|E
