25|$|The Cookstown {{extension}} {{included two}} massive engineering features. One was the eight-span masonry bridge which carried the line fifty {{feet above the}} River Main just outside Randalstown and the other, a few miles further on, was a <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> with a swing section across the River Bann near its outflow from Lough Neagh. Nevertheless, Dargan was {{able to carry out}} the work on the Cookstown extension speedily and the line was deemed to be ready for a Board of Trade inspection on 13 October 1856.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{line from}} Sydney arrived at Albury in 1881 (see Transport-Rail below). A {{temporary}} wooden railway bridge joined {{the line to}} the Victorian network in 1883. New South Wales and Victoria had different track gauges until 1962, when the first train ran direct from Sydney to Melbourne. The States could not initially agree which should be the transfer point so they had an expensive and attractive iron <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> sent from Scotland which accommodated both gauges. The bridge is still standing astride the Murray and is in daily use.|$|E
2500|$|The third bridge, built 1863–64, was an iron girder <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> {{on stone}} piers. At the same time, a brick viaduct was {{constructed}} to span the flood plain {{to the south}} of the river. [...] The bridge was freed of tolls in about 1870.|$|E
5000|$|Puente de las Calabazas is a {{single-span}} <b>lattice</b> girder <b>bridge</b> near Coamo, Puerto Rico on the Carreterra Central {{that dates}} from 1882. It {{was designed by}} Ricardo (or Raimundo?) Camprubi and was fabricated by Eugen Rollin and Co., a Belgian firm that exported via Spain from Braine le Comte, Belgium. Prolific engineer Camprubí designed several single span <b>lattice</b> <b>bridges</b> in Puerto Rico. He also designed the first two-span <b>lattice</b> girder <b>bridge</b> in Puerto Rico, the Padre Inigo Bridge (in Coamo, No. 174), which is also NRHP-listed. [...] All of these {{were part of the}} Carretera Central.|$|R
50|$|A 243 m long railway viaduct {{near the}} castle and a 98 m long <b>lattice</b> truss <b>bridge</b> {{north of the}} town were opened for the Glauchau-Wurzen railway in 1875, another <b>lattice</b> truss <b>bridge</b> for the Waldheim-Rochlitz railway was opened in 1893. The {{worn-out}} state of the latter contributed to {{the closure of the}} line in 1998.|$|R
50|$|The {{through route}} {{remained}} open for occasional freight services and for empty passenger stock movements across the city. The Bellgrove section that {{passed to the}} NBR remains in intensive passenger use, but the elevated section across the city is the iconic part of the line, with large span <b>lattice</b> <b>bridges</b> over Saltmarket, London Road and Gallowgate.|$|R

50|$|A <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is a form}} of {{truss bridge}} that uses a large number of small and closely spaced {{diagonal}} elements that form a lattice. It was patented by architect Ithiel Town in 1820 and 1835 as Town's lattice truss.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, the {{original}} iron <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Parramatta River was replaced. The new bridge only has one track, {{although it was}} built to allow a second track to be laid in the future. It sits on the refurbished piers of {{the original}} bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Surprise Creek Bridge, at 28.7km, is a 72.54m long steel <b>lattice</b> girder <b>bridge</b> set on tall {{concrete}} piers at {{the head}} of a waterfall. The approach spans are pin jointed. This is followed by a timber trestle bridge at 29.16km, and then Christmas Creek Bridge at 29.23km. The sixth and final steel <b>lattice</b> girder <b>bridge</b> on the section, the Christmas Creek Bridge is 39.6m long, with wrought iron trestles.|$|R
50|$|The iron <b>lattice</b> <b>bridges</b> {{crossing}} the Gwydir River at Bundarra and Bingara {{are regarded as}} significant bridges of the colonial period. Around mid-1838 a war of extirpation, according to local magistrate Edmund Denny Day, was waged all along the Gwydir River. Aborigines in the district were repeatedly pursued by parties of mounted and armed stockmen and Day claimed that great numbers {{of them had been}} killed at various spots.|$|R

50|$|This {{section of}} the railway still retains some {{original}} features; mainly the cast iron <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge,</b> opened on 26 September 1892. The footbridge is currently closed as it is deemed unsafe. Passengers {{and members of the}} public now have to walk up to the level crossing, cross the road and then onto a footpath.|$|E
50|$|The main {{post office}} is located east of <b>Lattice</b> <b>Bridge</b> (LB) Road, around 100 meters before it meets Old Mahabalipuram Road. The two main theatres {{in the area are}} the Jayanthi (currently {{demolished}} {{to make way for a}} housing project) and the Theyagaraja/Sathyam S2. The South Chennai RTO is also located here on ECR Road.|$|E
5000|$|Proskouriakov was {{the first}} in Europe to reject then {{existing}} <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> trusses with lots of vertical and diagonal members, which were extremely difficult for truss analysis. Instead, he designed a statically determinate triangular web truss with the minimum number of diagonals, which provided better distribution of stresses due to moving loads throughout a bridge structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{main section}} of the CGUR is still in existence; it runs from Shields Junction on the Paisley to Glasgow line, and runs to College East Junction (later High Street Junction) between High Street and Bellgrove on the former NBR Coatbridge line. From Shields Jn the line climbs on viaduct and swings north to cross the Clyde by the Union Railway Bridge, then {{crossing}} Bridgegate, London Road and Gallowgate by long-span <b>lattice</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} four span {{wrought iron}} <b>lattice</b> truss <b>bridge</b> opened on 23 January 1881. It {{was the second}} oldest bridge out of the twelve related wrought iron <b>lattice</b> truss series <b>bridges</b> built in Australia. Each of the four lattice truss spans was 48.5 metres long which joined onto what {{was thought to be}} the longest timber viaduct in Australia.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} reached from High Town via a modern {{footbridge}} over a main road and a valley, the present bridge having opened in 1994. This replacement tubular steel bridge occupies {{the site of}} a <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> closed and demolished several years previously. A section of the original footbridge adorns the centre island of one of the road traffic roundabouts.|$|E
50|$|It {{took its}} popular name from a mill two miles (3 km) {{to the west}} at the {{intersection}} of Mill Brook and what is now Kittle Road. Grant's Mill was often used in giving directions, as at that time the road was not maintained year-round. Marks called it the <b>Lattice</b> <b>Bridge</b> in his reports to the town; officials referred to it by his name.|$|E
5000|$|Having been a {{constituent}} {{part of the}} GWR, in 1963 the former CR lines were to be passed to London Midland Region of British Railways. It was hence decided {{as part of the}} Beeching cuts to close the old CR mainline between Oswestry & Whitchurch, but as a precursor to transfer {{the decision was made to}} close the W&ER on 10 September 1962. [...] The 45m <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Dee near Bangor was dismantled.|$|E

50|$|The station {{initially}} {{opened to}} provide a station for the workers in the nearby industries, primarily shipbuilding. This area of Wallsend was a hive of activity, and included many famous shipbuilders, such as the Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company. The station was modest, with just two platforms, an iron <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> (of the standard NER design), and open waiting areas on the Up platform with a wooden 'shed' for waiting and the booking office on the Down platform.|$|E
50|$|The major {{engineering}} feature {{was a heavy}} (and expensive) steel <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> {{over the}} Wollondilly River {{to the north of}} Goulburn. The line then passed through rolling hills to the town of Crookwell, and was opened in 1902. A platform was provided at Argyle, near the Goulburn Training Centre (now the Goulburn Correctional Centre), and stations were built at Kenmore, Norwood, The Forest, Woodhouselee, Roslyn, McAlister and Crookwell, with sidings at each of these locations. Several intermediate sidings were provided for stock loading and similar activities.|$|E
