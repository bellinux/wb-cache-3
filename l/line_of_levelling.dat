5000|$|Passing tones {{filling the}} {{intervals}} of a chord {{may be considered}} forming lines between the voices of this chord. At the same time, if the chord tones themselves are involved in lines from one chord to another (as usually is the case), <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>level</b> unfurl between <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>level.</b> The most interesting case is when the lines link an inner voice to the upper voice. This may happen not only in ascending (a case usually described as a [...] "line from an inner voice"), but also in descending, if the inner voice has been displaced above the upper line by a register transfer, a case known as [...] "reaching over" [...] (Übergreifen, also translated as superposition or overlapping). In the example from Schubert’s Wanderers Nachtlied below, the descending line G-F-E-D {{at the end of}} the first bar may be read as a reaching over.|$|R

60|$|To {{search for}} any living creatures in that borderless domain of colored dune, of {{shifting}} cloud of sand, of purple curtain shrouding mesa and dome, appeared the vainest {{of all human}} endeavors. It seemed a veritable rainbow realm of the sun. At first only the beauty stirred Hare--he saw the copper belt close under the cliffs, the white beds of alkali and washes of silt farther out, the wind-ploughed canyons and dust-encumbered ridges ranging west and east, the scalloped slopes of the flat tableland rising low, the tips of volcanic peaks leading the eye beyond to veils and vapors hovering over blue clefts and dim <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> lanes, and so on, and on, out to the vast unknown. Then Hare grasped a little of its meaning. It was a sun-painted, sun-governed world. Here was deep and majestic Nature eternal and unchangeable. But it was only through Eschtah's eyes that he saw its parched slopes, its terrifying desolateness, its sleeping death.|$|R

In this paper, we present an improved method {{to select the}} most meaningful <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> (boundaries <b>of</b> <b>level</b> sets) from an image. This extraction can be based on statistical arguments, leading to a parameter free algorithm. It permits to roughly extract all pieces <b>of</b> <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> an image, that coincide with pieces of edges. By this method, the number <b>of</b> encoded <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> is reduced by a factor 100, without any loss of shape contents. In contrast to edge detections algorithm or snakes methods, such a level lines selection method delivers accurate shape elements, without user parameter: no smoothing involved and selection parameters can be computed by Helmholtz Principle...|$|R

These he speedily discovered were beyond all comparison inferior, both in arms, in discipline, and in methods of fighting, to the Scots. For a dashing foray they would be excellent. Hardy, agile, and full of impetuosity, they would bear down all resistance instantly, were that resistance not too strong; but against stubborn and well armed troops they would break like a wave against a rock. Archie saw that with such troops anything like regular war would be impossible, and that the struggle {{must be one of}} constant surprises, attacks, and forays, and that they could succeed only by wearing out and not by defeating the enemy. With such tactics as these they might by long perseverance succeed; but this was just what Fergus had warned him they would not practise, and that their courage was rather of a kind which would lead them to dash desperately against the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>levelled</b> spears, rather than continue a long and weary struggle under apparently hopeless circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Many methods {{relying on}} the {{morphological}} notion of shapes, (i. e., connected components <b>of</b> <b>level</b> sets) have been proved to be very useful for pattern analysis and recognition. Selecting meaningful <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> (boundaries <b>of</b> <b>level</b> sets) yields to simplify images while preserving salient structures. Many image simplification and/or segmentation methods are driven by the optimization of an energy functional, for instance the Mumford-Shah functional. In this article, we propose an efficient shape-based morphological filtering that very quickly compute to a locally (subordinated to the tree of shapes) optimal solution of the piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah functional. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency, usefulness, and robustness of our method, when applied to image simplification, pre-segmentation, and detection of affine regions with viewpoint changes...|$|R
