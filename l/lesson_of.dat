5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the lessons the U. S Army drew {{from the war}} in Vietnam and how these lessons influence current Army attitudes toward peace operations. The thesis finds that the Army's failure in Vietnam contributes not only to the Army's aversion toward peace operations, but also to its reluctance to participate in any limited war. It posits that culture has explanatory power in describing the Army's attitudes and policies toward peace operations. The thesis {{examines the}} development <b>of</b> the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam, especially the emergence of the 'never-again' school by surveying the articles written in Army, Military Review and Parameters about Vietnam and peace operations between 1972 and 1995. The thesis describes the Army's confusion over the meaning of Vietnam in the 197 Os, shows the Army's building a consensus around certain <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam in the l 98 Os and examines application <b>of</b> these <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> to peace operations in the 199 Os. Two events were influential in shaping the Army's understanding <b>of</b> the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam: the publication of the book, On Strategy, in 1982 and a speech given in 1984 by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Harry Summers's book on America's failure in Vietnam and Secretary Weinberger's speech on pre-conditions for U. S. military intervention codified the Army's accepted <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam. These two events codified the many <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam into The <b>Lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam. The thesis concludes by focusing on how the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam influence the Army's attitude toward peace operations attitudes and influenced its policy. It first describes how Operation Desert Storm curtailed the growth of the competing LIC subculture. Second, the thesis illustrates the hesitant attitudes of authors writing in the periodicals and the Army's reluctance to embrace peace operations. Autobiographies of senior officers are used to support the attitudes found in the military journals. NANAU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R
