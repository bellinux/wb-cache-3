5|$|As soon as {{the troops}} {{returned}} from France, the British Army began implementing lessons <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> campaign and re-organizing formations. As part of this, the army's five motor divisions (made up of two brigades) were to be reformed as regular infantry divisions (made up of three brigades). As a result, the 66th Infantry Division was disbanded on 23 June. The 197th Infantry Brigade {{was transferred to the}} 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, the 198th Infantry Brigade went to the 1st London Division, and the 199th Infantry Brigade was assigned to the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{thought was}} not always cohesive, and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{information}} <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2002 and 2006 expeditions, there was {{public support for}} the making of Davidson Seamount into a marine sanctuary. A key group of research scientists, fishermen, officials, educators, and marine biologists was formed in 2006 to discuss whether or not to make Davidson Seamount a National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and if so whether to make it its own sanctuary, or incorporate it into the nearby Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The group decided that the seamount was eligible for sanctuary designation, and the majority of the group recommended its incorporation into the nearby Monterey Bay sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{key role}} in the 1982 Falklands War, several lessons were <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's performance, which led to {{approval}} for an upgrade of the fleet to FRS.2 (later known as FA2) standard to be given in 1984. The first flight of the prototype took place in September 1988 and a contract was signed for 29 upgraded aircraft in December that year. In 1990, the Navy ordered 18 new-build FA2s, at a unit cost of around £12million, four further upgraded aircraft were ordered in 1994. The first aircraft was delivered on 2 April 1993.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E

5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the UK Ministry of Defence began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU).

British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children {{had been killed by}} peers emulating professional wrestling moves <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E

In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could be <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated {{the timing of the}} gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
