40|$|L'auteur décrit et interprète le particularisme de la procédure d'arbitrage des conflits collectifs du travail en France qui offre l'image contradictoire de l'échec des modalités officielles de règlement et de la vertu des procédures informelles. Two facts appear {{when one}} {{attempts}} {{to report on}} results from arbitration and procedures to settle labor conflicts in France:On one hand, legal procedures are not very much used though this was not always the case. In 1936, for example, in a very particular situation, they produced quite good results. Compulsory conciliation and facultative arbitration established after 1950 are not very much used. In the same way, mediation based on American procedure introduced in 1955, was at first well accepted by social partners then increasingly less. On the other Labour Inspection is often used and efficient, though {{it is only a}} substitute for legal procedure. This can be proved by statistical analyses made on datas obtained from the Ministry of Labour compared with other variables such as size of enterprise, reasons for and results of strikes, etc. To explain the failure of official procedures and the relative success of unofficial ones, two kinds of factors may be involved:Technically, official legal procedures are cumbersome, slow and reinforce oppositions rather than eliminate them. Members of those institutions cannot consult people at the grass-roots level as is more and more done in the French "professional relations" system. In the other case, the <b>Labour</b> <b>Inspector</b> is well informed and can intervene effectively at the right moment. The confidence with which he is regarded and his professional practices allow him to suggest possible compromises between opposing parties. As regards ideology, there is strong opposition to forced procedures. Employers are sensitive to the market economy and wish to preserve their independence and authority. Trade unions are divided and afraid of loosing their right to strike and possibility of negotiating. The adaptability of the Labour Inspector’s role is much more compatible with compromise. Remote procedures may not be in force again in spite of the collective negotiations and settlements of labour conflicts Law Project, considered too far removed from present professional practices. Could the <b>Labour</b> <b>Inspector</b> go further through institutionalization of his conciliation functions or specialization in conciliation methods? Probably not. More than lack of means, it is the difference between control and conciliation methods which separates interested opposing groups within Labour Inspection due to long-established hierarchical and trade union problems. This is especially the case when collective pay-offs increase altering the relationships between the Minister of Labour and the <b>Labour</b> <b>Inspector.</b> In summary, in spite of the French tradition of using legal procedures, empirical solutions are more and more acceptable as they are well received by social partners and compatible with the permanent negotiations of the French "professional relations"...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} {{compete in a}} liberalized market economy, firms require flexibility, especially in managing labour. Presently, the labour sector in India is quite restrictive with regard to labour laws. In order to surpass the stringent labour regulations, the industry is largely resorting to contract labourers, who are governed by the “Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act of 1970 ”. To safeguard the welfare of contract labourers, certain provisions have been made mandatory by the Act. These include payment of minimum wages, provident fund benefits and others. A primary survey carried out {{in one of the}} industrially advanced provinces of India, viz. Karnataka, reveals that many of these stipulations are not followed in practice.

40|$|Background: To prevent injuries, {{identification}} of the involved risk factors is necessary. Two recent in-depth investigations were {{carried out in the}} health service of Oslo on workers seeking treatment of severe occupational injuries. The interviews were rather time-consuming, and hence rather costly. The aim of thepresent study was to find a less time-consuming method which nevertheless would identify preventable risk actors. Methods: In-depth investigations of 15 injuries with nail guns and 28 injuries related to scaffolding were onducted in an out-patient clinic in Trondheim, Norway. Patients were interviewed by health personnel just efore or after the treatment based on specifically designed questionnaires. A group of specialists analysed the information collected. Results: Some risk factors were identified: design weaknesses inherent in nail guns, presence of snow and ice at the injury location, foreign body in the eye and lack of control/inspection of scaffolding when erected. On average, about two man hours were used for each injury. The most relevant questions were those directly related to the narrative, in particular how the injury occurred, and if any special conditions were involved. Quite a few data elements require epidemiological representative studies in order to assess them as potential risk factors. Conclusions: This relatively low time-consuming method revealed some risk factors. However, it could be more effective if the interviews were conducted by telephone {{a few days after the}} treatment by a specialist in that particular injury type; such as an experienced <b>labour</b> <b>inspector,</b> in order to probe more deeply into the technical risk factors...|$|E

40|$|The term {{affirmative action}} {{originated}} in the United States some 30 years ago to describe a process of liberating minority groups. The objective of affirmative action within an organisational context, is to democratise the workplace by enabling members of previously disadvantaged groups to progress higher up {{the ranks of the}} corporate world. The affirmative action drive only took off in South Africa when it became part of the democratisation process and the focus was directed towards liberating the historically disadvantaged black majority. Prior to 1994, the reasons for implementing affirmative action programmes were largely political because of the race-based discrimination. Historically disadvantaged people were a minority in senior positions, the reason being that although the blacks were given a chance to compete with their white counterparts, due to their poor education standards and lack of experience only a few was appointed. The Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 aims to correct the demographic imbalances in the nation’s workforce by compelling employers to remove barriers to advancement of blacks, coloureds, Indians, women and disabled, and actively to advance them in all categories of employment by affirmative action. The Employment Equity Act consists of two main sections. The first replaces and refines the prohibition on unfair discrimination in item 2 (1) (a) of Schedule 7 of the Labour Relations Act. The second aspect deals with imposing a duty to the employers to adopt affirmative action programmes. The Employment Equity Act places a positive obligation on all employers “to promote equal opportunity in the workplace by eliminating unfair discrimination in any employment policy or practice”. Where unfair discrimination is alleged, the onus of proving that discrimination is fair, or practice is not discriminatory at all, rests upon the employer. Disputes about unfair discrimination must be referred to the CCMA, and if not settled by conciliation, to the Labour Court, which has the power to order compensation or the payment iv of damages, or to direct the employer to take steps to prevent the same unfair discrimination or similar practice occurring in the future in respect of other employees. The second section of the Employment Equity Act deals with the imposition of the duty to designated employers to adopt affirmative action programmes. All employers with more than 50 employees, or which have annual turnovers equal to or above the annual turnovers for small businesses of their class, municipalities, organs of state, and those designated as such by collective agreement, must implement affirmative action measures for people from designated groups. This entails consulting with employers, conducting an analysis of employment policies, practices, procedures and the working environment to identify barriers, drawing up employment equity plans and reporting thereafter to the Director-General of the Department of Labour on progress made in implementing the plan. Any employee may bring alleged contraventions of the Act {{to the attention of the}} employer, another employee, or any trade union, workplace forum, <b>labour</b> <b>inspector</b> or the Director- General of the Employment Equity Commission. Labour inspectors appointed under the Basic Conditions of Employment Act may enter and inspect employer’s properties and documents, and are responsible for ensuring that the employer has consulted with employees as required, conducted the pre-equity plan analysis prepared its plan and is implementing it, submitted and published its reports, set up the necessary managerial infrastructure, and informed its employees of progress. Should employers be found not to have complied with these requirements, labour inspectors must request a written undertaking that they will do so. If an employer fails to give such an undertaking, the <b>labour</b> <b>inspector</b> can issue a compliance order setting out inter alia what steps the employer must take and when, and the maximum fine, if any, that can be imposed if the employer fails to comply. If the employer does not pay attention to the compliance order within the prescribed period, the Director-General may apply to have it made an order of the Labour Court. The Director-General may also conduct independent ad hoc reviews of selected designated employers. Failure by an employer to comply with the provision of the Act lead to the employer being liable for the contravention of the Act...|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{compliance}} amongst employers with minimum wage legislation {{is a problem}} faced by many developing countries. South Africa is no exception, informal evidence suggesting that {{a large proportion of}} the employed in the country earn wages below the stipulated minima. This dissertation attempts to measure non-compliance or, in other words, 'violation' of employers in South Africa of minimum wage legislation, and to investigate the determinants of this violation. This study constitutes the first attempt to measure enforcement and compliance in South Africa. In order to measure the strength of government enforcement of minimum wages in South Africa, the number of <b>labour</b> <b>inspectors</b> is used as a proxy measure, while employer noncompliance, or violation, is measured using an approach developed by Kanbur (2007), referred to here as the 'Kanbur Index of Violation'. Derived from the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (1984) poverty measures, this index is used to measure the share of violated workers receiving sub-minimum wages, as well as the depth of violation, namely, the average gap between the stipulated minima and the actual wage paid. This is the first attempt in the literature on minimum wage enforcement to use the methodology proposed by Kanbur (2007) for the measurement of violation. The estimates obtained for South Africa show that the sectors where violation is most prevalent include the Security, Taxi and Farming sectors. A multivariate analysis is employed, using standard OLS, probit, and quantile regression techniques to investigate the determinants of the probability of a worker being violated by their non-compliant employer, as well as of the depth and extent of the violation, that is, the shortfall of their wage from the minimum. Another innovation of this paper, in addition to the use of the Kanbur index as a measure of violation, is the introduction of a number of spatial/density variables, such as the log of workers per square kilometre, the density of <b>labour</b> <b>inspectors</b> in a District Council, and the unemployment density in the area. The construction of these variables was made possible by mapping the statutory minima, which are location specific, to the geographic units in the Labour Force Survey data for South Africa. The principal findings of this analysis are that violation is an outcome of a range of 8 variables, including individual, firm-level/contractual, sectoral, as well as spatial/density characteristics. A key marker of the probability of minimum wage violation and the depth of violation is the density of <b>labour</b> <b>inspectors</b> in the District Council where the worker is employed. Firm-specific characteristics such as firm size also play a leading role. The results from this dissertation carry important policy implications for minimum wage legislators in South Africa, especially regarding interventions around the enforcement of sectoral minima...|$|R
