50|$|The {{electric}} locomotives of Bavarian Class EP 2 were in light passenger train service in Germany for almost 50 years. After their initial classification as EP 2 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen), they were redesignated as E 32s from 1927 to 1968 in the DRG's numbering plan and, {{later in the}} DB classification scheme. In their final years, post-1968, they were given the EDV-compatible classification of 132. Characteristic of the E 32 was its short length and <b>link</b> <b>drive</b> (Stangenantrieb).|$|E
5000|$|DB {{had over}} 700 new Köf II engines newly built and further {{developed}} after the war. In the GDR, 32 Kö II were (re-)built in Dessau maintenance works for DR (among them the last ever built of 1968). More than 360 very similar vehicles were produced exclusively for industrial railways, series N3 with chain <b>link</b> <b>drive</b> and , {{referred to as}} N3 by the manufacturers, and series N4 with side rod drive and [...] The first proper development of small shunting locomotives in the GDR was the V 10 B, which was further developed into class V 15.

30|$|Moreover, <b>link</b> <b>drive</b> {{mechanisms}} [19, 20] {{and parallel}} link mechanisms [21 – 23] are proposed. Ishii and Kobayashi propose a parallel link mechanism using double-screw-drive mechanism [24]. Arata et al. [25] proposed a parallel link mechanism using spring links. It {{is difficult to}} obtain wide motion range of about ±[*] 90 ° for each joint by the <b>link</b> <b>drive</b> mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates {{different}} approaches to integrating the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator model (MOVES) with microscopic traffic simulators to allow for project-level emissions analysis. The integration methodology is based on using the second-by-second vehicle trajectory output from the traffic simulator to define the <b>link</b> <b>drive</b> schedule required to run MOVES. This {{raises the question of}} how to define a representative vehicle trajectory for each link, because tracking the emissions for individual vehicles is computationally intractable. In this study, the accuracy of two aggregation methods and one sampling method, for defining the representative trajectory, are compared for both freeway and arterial links. The results indicate that the sampling method outperforms either one of the aggregation methods, and that using as few as five probes can achieve over 95 % accuracy in a timely manner...|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, several noninterference wrist {{mechanisms}} for articulated forceps have been proposed. The wrist {{mechanism of the}} Kymerax [4], a system of handheld articulated robotic forceps, adopts {{a combination of the}} wire-pulley drive and gear drive mechanism [9]. The mechanism of the gripper axis is decoupled from the pitch and roll axis. Thus, a hybrid drive mechanism of the manual drive gripper axis and motor drive pitch and yaw axes is realized. Nishizawa and Kishi [10] proposed a noninterference mechanism using a wire-pulley and gear mechanism. In the mechanism, a middle plate connects two parts that make rolling contact with each other. Therefore, the path length of the wires is independent of the joint angle. The wrist mechanism of the Radius [3] is a combination of the torque tube, gear, and <b>link</b> <b>drive</b> mechanisms [11]. The mechanism of the gripper axis is decoupled from pitch and roll axes. However, it is not suitable for dissections since the open motion of the gripper is driven by a spring force and the dissecting force is small. Compared to interference mechanisms, the noninterference mechanisms need more parts to realize decoupling between joints.|$|E

Given the level of agreement between the model and real data, the model itself can be used in the future to further our understanding and measurements of friends’ influence as well as to study related aspects such as the presence and impact of influential users. In this work we have entirely neglected the time difference between the co-collection behavior of users.
