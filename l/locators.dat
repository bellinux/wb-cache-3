In 1987 Reynolds moved to a software model with its first release of the ERA dealer management software, which was a complete rewrite of its prior programming.

25|$|The {{location}} resolution {{process is}} the procedure by which, starting from the CRID of a given content, one or several <b>locators</b> of that content are obtained.

25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses.

Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name.

25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault <b>locators,</b> in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E

25|$|There were {{fears that}} the plane's {{tracking}} equipment and emergency locator beacon could have been damaged after the crash or weakened by interference, and that this would hamper the search. The head of the National Search and Rescue Agency told the Associated Press that he believed the aircraft was probably lost at sea. From 5 January 2007, {{the main focus of}} the search was relocated to areas south of Manado, after Manado's Sam Ratulangi Airport reported detecting a signal from the plane a day before. However, the rugged terrain coupled with thick and low hanging clouds continued to hamper the search efforts, and three relatives of missing passengers who overflew part of the area on a military reconnaissance plane admitted that the chances of finding the plane were slim. Officials said that it was unlikely any bodies had survived in one piece. On 14 January, at Indonesia's request, Singapore sent four towed underwater locator beacon detectors, sometimes called Towed Pinger <b>Locators,</b> and six consultants in their use to aid in the search. These would successfully locate the black boxes. On 24 January, the British ship MN Endeavour joined the search. The ship is operated by local mining firm PT Gema Tera Mustikawati and is usually used by oil and gas drilling companies to map the seabed. By 24 January, the Indonesian government had spent an average of Rp 1 billion (about US$110,000) a day on the search.|$|E

500|$|Now {{augmented}} by reinforcements from the UK, the Mediterranean Fleet detached Illustrious, four cruisers, and four destroyers {{to a point}} [...] south-east of Taranto. The first wave of a dozen aircraft, all that the ship could launch at one time, flew off by 20:40 and the second wave of nine by 21:34. Six aircraft in each airstrike were armed with torpedoes and the remainder with bombs or flares or both to supplement the three-quarter moon. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had positioned a Short Sunderland flying boat off the harbour to search for any movement to or from the port and this was detected at 17:55 by acoustic <b>locators</b> and again at 20:40, alerting the defenders. The noise of the on-coming first airstrike was heard at 22:25 and the antiaircraft guns defending the port opened fire shortly afterward, as did those on the ships in the harbour. The torpedo-carrying aircraft of the first wave scored one hit on the battleship [...] and two on the recently completed battleship [...] while the two flare droppers bombed the oil storage depot with little effect. The four aircraft loaded with bombs set one hangar in the seaplane base on fire and hit the destroyer [...] with one bomb that failed to detonate. The destroyer , or Conte di Cavour, shot down the aircraft that put a torpedo into the latter ship, but the remaining aircraft returned to Illustrious.|$|E
