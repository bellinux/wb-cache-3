On November 6, 2006, the 1.465 t 121.10 m long span was removed and carefully passed between the 120-meter gap of the two existing support points. Once removed, the steel structure was lowered onto a transport barge. The new structure that arrived the night before on another transport barge was lifted into place.

50|$|The {{lock gates}} were 56 ft wide and 90 ft high. The locks were {{carefully}} {{designed to address}} the great variation in {{the height of the}} river, the difference between high and low water being 55 ft. This condition made it necessary to build a series of three sets of gates, increasing in height from the lower entrance to the huge upper guard gate, only two sets being used at one time. When the river was low, the upper guard gates remained open continually and the lower sets were operated. When the water rose enough to drown the lower gates, they were swung open and the <b>lifting</b> <b>work</b> was done by the others. The upper approach was formed by masonry wall extending from the guard gate in a long sweep of 1200 ft, and the bank behind was armored against floods with riprapped stone.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists - much like {{their counterparts in}} Greece and Rome - were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well. Accordingly, <b>lifting</b> <b>work</b> was organized at the workplace {{in a different way}} than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place, or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working {{at each end of the}} wall. Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load. Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340. While ashlar blocks were directly lifted by sling, lewis or devil's clamp (German Teufelskralle), other objects were placed before in containers like pallets, baskets, wooden boxes or barrels.|$|E

40|$|Background: Robotic {{vehicles}} such as {{straddle carriers}} represent a popular form of cargo handling amongst container terminal operators. Objectives: The {{purpose of this}} industry-driven study is to model preventative maintenance (PM) influences on the operational effectiveness of straddle carriers. Method: The study employs historical data consisting of 21 273 work orders covering a 27 -month period. Two models are developed, both of which forecast influences of PM regimes for different types of carrier. Results: The findings of the study suggest that {{the reliability of the}} straddle fleet decreases with increased intervals of PM services. The study also finds that three factors – namely resources, number of new straddles, and the number of new <b>lifting</b> <b>work</b> centres – influence the performances of straddles. Conclusion: The authors argue that this collaborative research exercise makes a significant contribution to existing supply chain management literature, particularly in the area of operations efficiency. The study also serves as an avenue to enhance relevant management practice. </p...|$|E
40|$|Six healthy {{subjects}} rapidly {{lifted and}} lowered a small (250 g) weight {{with the first}} dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) of one hand while the work performed was recorded continuously until fatigue (defined as losing the ability to continue <b>lifting).</b> <b>Work</b> was recorded in units of chart recorder trace displacement from baseline (centimeters) as an isotonic transducer followed {{the movement of the}} weight. In all experiments, the temperature of the hand was first adjusted by immersion in a controlled-temperature water bath. In the warmest condition, the skin surface temperature over the FDI was 30. 5 (0. 30) degrees C [mean (SE) ]. After moderate cooling, this surface temperature was 21. 5 (0. 16) degrees C. Cooling significantly reduced the time taken to reach fatigue and more than halved the work capacity. An intermediate degree of cooling was also used in four subjects, showing that most of the effects seen were changing incrementally. Before work, and at fatigue, intracellular metabolic conditions in the FDI were studied by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) spectroscopy, with occlusion of the blood flow maintained during measurements. The mean intracellular pH of the FDI was also calculated. The changes observed were all consistent with the fact that intense work requires energy which must be derived largely from intracellular stores of phosphocreatine and glycogen. Less work made less demand upon reserves, and created lower concentrations of waste products and by-products. The observations did not, however, allow us to explain why fatigue occurred at a particular point or why work capacity was reduced by cooling...|$|E

To study associations between physical activity level at work and risk of chronic low back pain. Associations were examined in a Norwegian prospective study using data from the HUNT 2 and HUNT 3 surveys carried out in the whole county of Nord-Trøndelag. Participants were 7580 women and 7335 men who supplied information about physical activity level at work. Levels considered were sedentary work, work involving walking but no heavy <b>lifting,</b> <b>work</b> involving walking and heavy lifting, and particularly strenuous physical work. Nobody in the cohort was affected by chronic low back pain at baseline. After 11 years, participants reported whether they suffered from chronic low back pain. Generalized linear modelling with adjustment for potential confounders was applied to assess associations with risk factors. In age-adjusted analyses both women and men showed statistically significant associations between physical activity at work and risk of chronic low back pain, suggesting positive relationships. For particularly strenuous physical work the relative risk of chronic low back pain was 1. 30 (95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 71) in women and 1. 36 (95 % CI 1. 17 - 1. 59) in men, compared to sedentary work. Women still showed a general association with activity level after adjustment for education, leisure time physical activity, BMI, smoking and occupational category. In men, the higher risk was only maintained for particularly strenuous work. In this cohort, women had a higher risk of chronic low back pain with work involving walking and heavy lifting or particularly strenuous work, compared to sedentary work. Men participating in particularly strenuous work also experienced a higher risk of chronic low back pain...|$|E

40|$|This field study, {{conducted}} at an acute care hospital, evaluated a participatory ergonomics (PE) intervention {{to implement a}} safe patient lifting program. Participatory ergonomics is a method that actively involves employees in developing and implementing ergonomic improvements for their workplace to increase acceptance and effectiveness of workplace changes (Imada, 2002). Although professional guidelines recommend employee participation {{as a component of}} safe patient lifting programs, PE is not consistently applied in practice and not yet well validated as an intervention in the research literature. The goal of the PE intervention {{in the present study was}} to encourage usage of patient lifting equipment in order to decrease the incidence, severity, and cost of injuries to nurses and aides. With management support, representative employees in teams provided program suggestions that were implemented including lifting equipment purchases, storage locations, and a patient mobility assessment process. ^ Four primary sources of data were used to evaluate the intervention; PE process measures, objective usage frequency, employee surveys, and workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation records. After assessing pre and post lifting equipment usage patterns via researcher observations, it was concluded that usage frequency increased after the intervention, as hypothesized. Additional post intervention measures of usage including employee interviews provided convergent support for this finding. As expected, results from a pre and post survey indicated improved employee perceptions of involvement in decisions about patient <b>lifting</b> <b>work</b> procedures, with an increase in perceived management support by employees. Employee support for safer patient lifting as well as co-worker support remained high on both the pre and post survey.

40|$|Background context: The Neck Disability Index {{frequently}} is used {{to measure}} outcomes of the neck. The statistical rigor of the Neck Disability Index has been assessed with conflicting outcomes. To date, Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the Neck Disability Index has not been reported for a suitably large population study. Because the Neck Disability Index is not a condition-specific measure of neck function, initial Confirmatory Factor Analysis should consider problematic neck patients as a homogenous group. Purpose: We sought to analyze {{the factor structure of}} the Neck Disability Index through Confirmatory Factor Analysis in a symptomatic, homogeneous, neck population, with respect to pooled populations and gender subgroups. Study design: This was a secondary analysis of pooled data. Patient sample: A total of 1, 278 symptomatic neck patients (67. 5 % female, median age 41 years), 803 nonspecific and 475 with whiplash-associated disorder. Outcome measures: The Neck Disability Index was used to measure outcomes. Methods: We analyzed pooled baseline data from six independent studies of patients with neck problems who completed Neck Disability Index questionnaires at baseline. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis was considered in three scenarios: the full sample and separate sexes. Models were compared empirically for best fit. Results: Two-factor models have good psychometric properties across both the pooled and sex subgroups. However, according to these analyses, the one-factor solution is preferable from both a statistical perspective and parsimony. The two-factor model was close to significant for the male subgroup (p<. 07) where questions separated into constructs of mental function (pain, reading headaches and concentration) and physical function (personal care, <b>lifting,</b> <b>work,</b> driving, sleep, and recreation). Conclusions: The Neck Disability Index demonstrated a one-factor structure when analyzed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis in a pooled, homogenous sample of neck problem patients. However, a two-factor model did approach significance for male subjects where questions separated into constructs of mental and physical function. Further investigations in different conditions, subgroup and sex-specific populations are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to find the factors that cause engine failures in diesel locomotives within Transnet. The research will focus on the diesel locomotives in the region of Thabazimbi and Pretoria. Diesel locomotives need to be in good working order for {{them to be able to}} haul goods for the growth of the economy. The company must deliver everything on time according to customer demand. The failures affect the company financially: they have to repair the engine, which costs about R 1. 2 million to rebuild, and a new engine costs R 3. 2 million. Corrective actions play an important role in coal transportation. Reliable engineering and maintenance ensures that the product is always available. Reliability is known as the probability that an item or device can perform the required functions without failures for a specific period of time. Maintenance and reliability engineers should know all the techniques to solve engineering issues. The research shows that the company had the same problem as China and Ukraine. The failures were caused by maintenance that was not done properly on the diesel locomotive. The company has a maintenance strategy that they used on the diesel locomotive. It was found that the major cause of engine failures was using the wrong type of cylinders on the 39 200 class diesel locomotive. The 39 200 class uses millmille cylinders, not chrome cylinders. These cylinders differ from the usual material used to make cylinders. It was found that most artisans and the logistics department did not know which cylinders were supposed to be used on the 39 200 class diesel locomotive. The locomotives were newly built in South Africa, but not all the artisans, planners and trade hands were aware of the different cylinders used on the locomotive. The reliability and maintenance engineers, including the logistics department, have to work together in purchasing new material by making sure the specifications are clear to the supplier. The company had to do root cause analyses because they wanted to be competitive in the railway industry. The company should increase resources in the Thabazimbi depot to avoid locomotives having to be hauled to Koedoespoort owing to the insufficient number of artisans and trade hands they have at Thabazimbi. The workshop in Thabazimbi should do all the <b>lifting</b> <b>work</b> required on the locomotive, change radiators, change out compressors and change out cylinders. M. Ing.

Daily tool box talk to create awareness and propagate the incident and case studies among all the workmen. Fifth element is the communication and consultation. It includes monthly EHS meeting, EHS notice board, and EHS newsletter. Sixth element is to measure performance by inspection, internal audit and external audit. Seventh element is review and changes. Reviewing & managing changes is designed to expedite control and manage changes to policies, procedures, standards, organizational management and the execution or sequence of EHS related critical activities. Risk management has four stages namely identifying hazards, access the risk, determine the controls, and implement the controls, monitor, review and update. The approach must passes through a hierarchy of elimination, substitution, engineering control, administrative control, training and Personal protective equipment.
