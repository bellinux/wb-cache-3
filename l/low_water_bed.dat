40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of oscillatory flow on front amplitude, front speed, front spread in porous media for {{different}} solid medium of same particle size at different Reynolds number. The solid material of 6. 5 mm is used as spherical balls of steel and glass material. Normal water {{is used as a}} fluid. The size of porous bed is less than the 1 / 10 of diameter of the tube. The steel spherical balls of diameter 6. 5 mm constitute a porous bed which will act as Steel Water Bed and glass spherical balls of diameter 6. 5 mm constitute a porous bed which will act as Glass Water Bed. The front amplitude of steel <b>water</b> <b>bed</b> was found to be decreasing with distance and value was low as compared to glass <b>water</b> <b>bed.</b> The value for front speed of Steel <b>water</b> <b>bed</b> was higher in comparison to the glass <b>water</b> <b>bed.</b> Front spread is observed for hot phase.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{relation between}} the occurrence of brain tumors in children and exposure to electric blankets or electrically heated <b>water</b> <b>beds</b> was investigated in a multicenter, population-based case-control study conducted on the West Coast of the United States. Information on maternal exposure during pregnancy or direct exposure to the subject child was collected by in-person interview from the mothers of 540 case children and 801 control children. Cases were 19 {{years of age or}} younger and were diagnosed between 1984 and 1991. Controls were recruited using a random digit dialing procedure. The risk of brain tumor occurrence from in utero exposure to either electric blankets (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CO 0. 6 - 1. 2) or heated <b>water</b> <b>beds</b> (OR = 0. 9, 95 % Cl 0. 6 - 1. 3) was not elevated. Brain cancer risk did not vary by use in any tnmester of pregnancy, and children with mothers who reported use throughout their pregnancy had no increased risk. Similar results were observed for exposure to the child, in that no association between brain cancer and use of electnc blankets (OR = 1. 0, 95 % Cl 0. 6 - 1. 7) or heated <b>water</b> <b>beds</b> (OR = 1. 2, 95 % Cl 0. 7 - 2. 0) was observed. Risks did not vary significantly by age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, or histologic category for either in utero exposure or child's exposure.
