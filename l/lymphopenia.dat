5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (<b>lymphopenia)</b> and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{disorders}} can cause decreases in {{white blood cell}}s. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called neutropenia or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called lymphocytopenia or <b>lymphopenia)</b> may be seen.|$|E

2500|$|Blood—hematologic disorder—hemolytic anemia (low {{red blood}} cell count), {{leukopenia}} (white blood cell count<4000/µl), <b>lymphopenia</b> (<1500/µl), or low platelet count (<100000/µl) {{in the absence of}} offending drug; sensitivity = 59%; specificity = 89%. [...] Hypocomplementemia is also seen, due to either consumption of C3 and C4 by immune complex-induced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency, which may predispose to SLE.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{high risk}} that {{thalidomide}} can cause excessive blood clots. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via neutropenia, leukopenia, and <b>lymphopenia,</b> and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia. [...] There is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells. [...] The drug can also damage nerves, causing peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible.|$|E
2500|$|A {{range of}} {{laboratory}} investigations are performed, where possible, to diagnose {{the disease and}} assess its course and complications. An ELISA test for antigen and IgM antibodies give 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity {{for the presence of}} the infection. Other laboratory findings in Lassa fever include <b>lymphopenia</b> (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase [...] levels in the blood. Lassa fever virus can also be found in cerebrospinal fluid. In West Africa, where Lassa is most prevalent, it is difficult for doctors to diagnose due to the absence of proper equipment to perform tests. In cases with abdominal pain, in countries where Lassa is common, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed for example as appendicitis and intussusception which delays treatment with the antiviral ribavirin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lymphopenia</b> : Most {{common in}} {{clinical}} trials was a significant and dose-related reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ counts in 10 to 59% of patients. However, only 0 to 2% of patients experienced reductions below the accepted lower limit. Consequences of <b>lymphopenia</b> may be infections and/or treatment related malignancies (see below).|$|E

50|$|Fludarabine is {{associated}} with profound <b>lymphopenia,</b> and as a consequence, {{increases the risk of}} opportunistic infections significantly. Patients who have been treated with fludarabine will usually be asked to take co-trimoxazole or to use monthly nebulised pentamidine to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The profound <b>lymphopenia</b> caused by fludarabine renders patients susceptible to transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, an oftentimes fatal complication of blood transfusion. For this reason, all patients who have ever received fludarabine should only be given irradiated blood components.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} (in more than 10% of patients) include low blood cell counts (pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, <b>lymphopenia),</b> airway infections, {{as well as}} unspecific {{reactions}} such as fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and sleeping problems.|$|E

50|$|Lymphocytopenia, or <b>lymphopenia,</b> is the {{condition}} of having an abnormally low level of lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a white blood cell with important functions in the immune system. The opposite is lymphocytosis, which refers to an excessive level of lymphocytes.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} {{cytotoxic}} drugs, it can often cause alopecia, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea and vomiting, myelosuppression with leukopenia (especially neutropenia), <b>lymphopenia,</b> thrombocytopenia, anemia and immunosuppression. At therapeutic doses, those side effects are usually relatively milder compared with carmustine and lomustine.|$|E

50|$|At that time, a {{chest x-ray}} is ordered to confirm pneumonia. If the chest appears clear and SARS is still suspected, a HRCT scan will be ordered, {{because it is}} visible earlier on this scan. In severe cases, it {{develops}} into respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and in 70-90% of the cases, they develop <b>lymphopenia</b> (low count of lymphocyte white blood cells).|$|E
50|$|After {{inoculation}} by the vector, {{the virus}} travels via lymphatics to lymph nodes, and replicates in macrophages and neutrophils, resulting in <b>lymphopenia,</b> leukopenia and fever. Subsequent replication occurs in other organs leading to viremia. Symptoms in horses occur {{one to three}} weeks after infection, and begins with a fever that may reach as high as 106 °F (41 °C). The fever usually lasts for 24-48 hours.|$|E
50|$|In studies, {{the most}} serious side effects of the {{combination}} olaratumab/doxorubicin were neutropenia (low count of neutrophil white blood cells) with a severity of grade 3 or 4 in 55% of patients, and musculoskeletal pain grade 3 or 4 in 8% of patients. Common milder side effects were <b>lymphopenia,</b> headache, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and reactions at the infusion site; all typical effects of cancer therapies.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of c-fos in biological context {{has been determined}} by eliminating endogenous function by using anti-sense mRNA, anti-c-fos antibodies, a ribozyme that cleaves c-fos mRNA or a dominant negative mutant of c-fos. The transgenic mice thus generated are viable, demonstrating that there are c-fos dependent and independent pathways of cell proliferation, but display a range of tissue-specific developmental defects, including osteoporosis, delayed gametogenesis, <b>lymphopenia</b> and behavioral abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Patients with CHH usually {{suffer from}} {{cellular}} immunodeficiency. In {{the study of}} 108 Finnish patients with CHH there was detected mild to moderate form of <b>lymphopenia,</b> decreased delayed type of hypersensitivity and impaired responses to phytohaemagglutinin. This leads to susceptibility to and, in some more severe cases, mortality from infections early in childhood. There has also been detected combined immunodeficiency in some patients Patients with CHH often have increased predispositions to malignancies.|$|E
50|$|XMEN {{disease is}} a rare genetic {{disorder}} {{of the immune system}} that illustrates the role of Mg2+ in cell signaling. XMEN stands for “X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and neoplasia.” It is characterized by CD4 <b>lymphopenia,</b> severe chronic viral infections, and defective T-lymphocyte activation. Investigators in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Lenardo, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health first described this condition in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{high risk}} that {{thalidomide}} can cause excessive blood clots. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via neutropenia, leukopenia, and <b>lymphopenia,</b> and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia. There is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells. The drug can also damage nerves, causing peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible.|$|E
50|$|This {{disorder}} {{is considered a}} combined immunodeficiency because it includes both decreased lymphocyte numbers and defective lymphocyte function. It can also be classified {{as a type of}} autosomal recessive hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome. Laboratory manifestations include progressive <b>lymphopenia</b> that primarily affects CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, reduced B cell and/or NK cell counts in some patients, eosinophilia, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Antibody responses to vaccines are frequently poor. Loss of Dock8 protein expression can be demonstrated by diagnostic intracellular flow cytometry testing.|$|E
