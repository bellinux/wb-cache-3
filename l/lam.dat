40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the molecular basis of the differences observed in the immunogenicity of various BCG vaccines, which may {{play a major role}} in BCG vaccination efficiency, the presence and the partial structure of the lipoarabinomannans (<b>LAMs)</b> were investigated in four different BCG strains (Pasteur, Glaxo, Copenhagen, and Japanese strains). According to their cell-wall extraction mode, the <b>LAMs</b> were subdivided into two classes, namely, parietal <b>LAMs</b> and cellular <b>LAMs.</b> From a structural point of view, the cellular <b>LAMs</b> and parietal <b>LAMs</b> both belong to the ManLAM class since the relevant structural features, described for ManLAMs, that is, the phosphatidyl-myo-Ins anchor and the manno-oligosaccharide caps were characterized. In addition, thanks to NMR experiments realized on the native ManLAMs, we prove the existence of succinyl groups and we determine their location on the C- 2 of the 3, 5 -di-O-alpha-D-Araf units. The average number of succinyl groups was estimated at one and four per ManLAMs molecule for Glaxo and Japanese vaccines, respectively, and two for Pasteur and Copenhagen strains...|$|R
