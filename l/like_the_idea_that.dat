25|$|Sampson and {{the other}} {{researchers}} interpreted the delay of ceratopsid horn and frill development to sexual maturity as further evidence for the hypothesis that these traits evolved primarily for competition over mates. They disagreed with more functional explanations for these structures, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the frills served as attachment points for enlarged jaw muscles. The researchers also marshalled support {{from the fact that}} the horns and frills of ceratopsids are the primary source of variation between species within the family and observations of modern animals, whose horns are also primarily used to acquire mates. Nevertheless, they argued that there was still no evidence for sexual dimorphism in ceratopsids.|$|E

[...] "His life, {{or at least the}} ending of it, was the catalyst for the complete transformation of the world {{and that is what we}} want our music to be.

5000|$|Alana de la Garza {{was cast}} as NYPD Detective Jo Martinez. [...] The show's {{procedural}} aspect, the series' serialized nature, and the believability {{of the world}} interested de la Garza.

50|$|Bernhard claims Gregory Peck {{had been}} the choice to portray Ambassador Thorn from the beginning. Peck got {{involved}} with the project through his agent, who was friends with producer Harvey Bernhard. After reading the script, Peck reportedly <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{it was more of}} a psychological thriller rather than a horror film and agreed to star in it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{enough that he}} had not been on {{friendly}} terms with his sister, and he resented her suicide as a last injury that she had done him. He did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> she had been forced to it by poverty; that seemed to reflect on the family. The idea struck him that possibly there was a more respectable reason for her act.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{was full}} of sympathy. Inwardly, too, she was {{relieved}} to find Anne's non-appearance so simply accounted for. She had been vaguely suspicious, {{down there in the}} garden--suspicious of what, she hardly knew; but there had seemed to be something a little louche in the way she had suddenly found herself alone with Ivor. Not that she minded, of course; far from it. But she didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> perhaps she was the victim of a put-up job.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} the novels," [...] said Mr. Touchett. [...] "I believe the novels {{have a great deal}} but I don't suppose they're very accurate. We once had a lady who wrote novels staying here; she was a friend of Ralph's and he asked her down. She was very positive, quite up to everything; but she was not the sort of person you could depend on for evidence. Too free a fancy--I suppose that was it. She {{afterwards}} published a work of fiction in which she was understood to have given a representation--something in the nature of a caricature, as you might say--of my unworthy self. I didn't read it, but Ralph just handed me the book with the principal passages marked. It was understood to be a description of my conversation; American peculiarities, nasal twang, Yankee notions, stars and stripes. Well, it was not at all accurate; she couldn't have listened very attentively. I had no objection to her giving a report of my conversation, if she liked but I didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> she hadn't taken the trouble to listen to it. Of course I talk like an American--I can't talk like a Hottentot. However I talk, I've made them understand me pretty well over here. But I don't talk like the old gentleman in that lady's novel. He wasn't an American; we wouldn't have him over there at any price. I just mention that fact to show you that they're not always accurate. Of course, as I've no daughters, and as Mrs. Touchett resides in Florence, I haven't had much chance to notice about the young ladies. It sometimes appears as if the young women in the lower class were not very well treated; but I guess their position is better in the upper and even to some extent in the middle." ...|$|E

5000|$|For some, {{the mere}} idea of reading as a {{communal}} activity is repellent. The literary critic Harold Bloom said, [...] "I don't like these mass reading bees....

5000|$|When Emma-Lee {{designed}} the artwork for Never Just a Dream, she {{was inspired by}} a photo of a red velvet frame. In addition to being eye-catching she <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it visually captured the acoustic quality of her warm [...] "velvety" [...] voice.

[...] Harmer said of the bass line, [...] "I immediately gravitated to the creepy, stalker-ish theme that Ben created with the lyrics and the piano chords.... I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> once a stalker gets obsessed with an idea, it just keeps repeating in his head, so I wanted the bass line to have a repetitive, incessant theme." ...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2013, Stevens left Butler {{to become}} the new {{head coach of the}} Boston Celtics.

5000|$|... "Her best {{films were}} {{when she was}} {{presented}} as a woman on her high horse with slightly pretentious, often comically stated <b>ideas</b> about <b>the</b> world. It was for men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal, sporty and democratic. We <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> aristocratic people would be humanized by democratic values—in her case, by slightly rough-necked and good-natured males."

5000|$|Casting {{occurred}} {{over the course of}} one month. On February 19, 2014, Judd Hirsch was cast as Abe. [...] When Miller and the casting department developed a list of actors for the role, they felt that Hirsch would be the best actor to portray Abe. Hirsch was the first person casting director Barbara Fiorentino asked about the role, and they sent the script to Hirsch. The series' premise, its historical aspect, and its intelligence impressed Hirsch.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> for Right There was {{originally}} conceived by screenwriter Ian Taylor, a longtime writing collaborator, in 2010. The story was further developed by Suher and Capello, however, {{the project was}} put on hold as IM Filmworks was then {{in the process of}} filming several other short films.A fan of silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the project personally appealed to Suher who wished to pay homage to the genre and [...] "recapture this golden era of cinema".

5000|$|Contrary to {{critical}} reception, McNiven believed {{that people did}} not initially like the character - notably because they [...] "maybe didnt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> an angel could fall" [...] and saw her as [...] "really selfish" [...] - but over time saw her as a [...] "strong female power character".

5000|$|Following {{the series}} renewal in July 2014, creator Noah Hawley {{revealed}} that the second season would take place in 1979 and focus on Sioux Falls, South Dakota, as referenced by Lou Solverson {{and others in the}} first season. The ten episodes are set in Luverne, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota, and Sioux Falls. Hawley agreed that this takes place before the events of the film, but he believes all the stories connect: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> somewhere out there is a big, leather-bound book that's the history of true crime in the Midwest, and the movie was Chapter 4, Season 1 was Chapter 9 and this is Chapter 2," [...] he said. [...] "You can turn the pages of this book, and you just find this collection of stories. ... But I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> these things are connected somehow, whether it's linearly or literally or thematically. That's what we play around with." [...] This book was realized in season 2, episode 9, [...] "The Castle". Production on the second season began in Calgary on January 19, 2015, and completed on May 20, 2015.

5000|$|... "When {{you start}} to make {{statements}} about things, as people <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tabloid media in this country, and theyll always pick up on it, and theyll always give it some kind of sensationalist slant, so when we became aware of fundamentalism in America, and that Jesus loves America, what they said was, well, if these people are attacking Christianity, then they must be Satanists.

50|$|Uneasiness {{appears to}} set in after <b>that</b> date about <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> there were sisters, Eormengith, Eormenburg and Domne Eafe, of which one name didn't seem {{to be part of}} the set. From the 12th century onwards, some writers have <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a Kentish monastic princess should be called Eormenburg rather than Domne Eafe, and thus only refer to Ermenburg (or variants), as the Abbess of Thanet and mother of Mildrith. Following a lead perhaps given by William of Malmesbury in c. 1135 books such as 'Villages of Britain', web sites such as 'Hidden {{historical}} heroines', and modern lists of saints refer to her simply as Ermenburg.|$|R

5000|$|In 1989, Robinson {{moved to}} one of Auckland's west coast beaches, Karekare.
