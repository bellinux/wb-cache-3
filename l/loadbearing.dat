50|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} the repetition of six units of similar design around a central courtyard. The lower two storeys form a podium built to the property alignment. The podium is faced in Helidon sandstone with a granite base. The five upper levels are divided into six towers each separated from the next by deep recessed bays which act as light courts. The external brick walls of the upper levels are channelled and rendered to resemble the banded sandstone of the podium.

5000|$|The Crittenden is a 195 foot 17-story {{high rise}} solid {{apartment}} building in the The Flats of downtown Cleveland located on St. Clair Avenue. [...] The building is notable for {{being one of the}} tallest inhabited masonry <b>loadbearing</b> structures in the entire world. This is to say, that the entire superstructure is made of brick and so is unique among high rises as it is widely believed that you cannot make tall structures completely out of brick. Despite the skinny profile of the Crittenden, it is actually quite wide with a seemingly endless expanse. The building was designed by Richard L. Bowen & Associates who are a renowned Cleveland architecture firm that is responsible for bringing architecture, engineering, and construction services under one company as opposed to many. It is also the tallest all-residential structure in the flats and the Warehouse District. It is worth mentioning that {{it is one of the}} first new residential towers constructed in the Warehouse District.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{objective}} of the program was to incorporate new technologies into a fully powered and integrated suit, components developed under it could be issued individually to troops in the short term to enhance their effectiveness. Non-lethal weapons, new armor materials, more compact communications gear, advanced night vision, and 3-D audio can be used as individual pieces of equipment before they are all put together in one powered exoskeleton. Items developed for TALOS including an increased tactical data storage capability which allows for ten times the capacity of current data storage has transitioned to fulfill an immediate operational requirement, as well as a new armor solution being used for special operations non-standard commercial vehicles.

50|$|The {{building}} {{is faced with}} sandstone ashlar except for the inner walls of the arcade. These brick walls are finished with lined and unpainted render imitating ashlar. Each phase of construction has used {{a different type of}} sandstone. A colour difference is discernible between the Highfields stone used for the first phase of construction, and the Helidon sandstones used for the later stages. The external walls sit on a porphyry plinth. A matching porphyry dwarf wall adjoins the building on some elevations surmounted by a wrought iron fence.The first and second phases of construction employ a fire protection system in parts of the building. Vaulted coke concrete floors are supported on concrete encased wrought iron joists and bearers. Beams are supported at walls by engaged piers or on freestanding concrete encased cast iron columns. Steel roller shutters slide down to protect openings. The structure of the third phase of the building consists of reinforced concrete slabs supported on <b>loadbearing</b> masonry columns and steel girders. The roofs of the earlier sections are hipped corrugated iron, easily distinguished from the roof of the third stage which is a flat reinforced concrete slab protected by a bituminous membrane.|$|E
50|$|In July 1836 Sharpey was {{appointed}} to the chair of anatomy and physiology in the University of London in succession to Jones Quain. In this capacity Sharpey gave the first complete course of lectures on physiology and minute anatomy. His lectures then continued for 38 years. Sharpey {{was appointed}} in 1840 one of the examiners in anatomy at the university of London, and he was {{also a member of the}} senate of the University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 9 May 1839. In 1846 he described the skeletal <b>loadbearing</b> fibres that now bear his name, Sharpey's fibres. He was made a member of its council in 1844, and was appointed one of the secretaries in place of Thomas Bell in November 1853, an office which he held until his retirement. He was also for fifteen years, from April 1861, one of the members appointed by the Crown on the general council of medical education and registration. Sharpey was also one of the trustees of the Hunterian Museum; in 1859 he received the degree of honorary LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. Among his pupils were Michael Foster and Burdon Sanderson.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{building on}} the site is a two storeyed Police Station located centrally on the Neil Street boundary of the site. The symmetrically arranged building comprises a two storeyed front section with a one storeyed wing running eastward from {{the centre of the}} rear of the building. To the south of this wing in the open space between the two wings is a recent one storeyed extension. The Police Station is flanked on the Neil Street elevation by face brick fences and gate posts, sections of which have been removed. The complex hipped and gabled roof of the police station is clad with terracotta coloured ceramic tiles. Projecting through the main roof of the building are four substantial face brick chimney shafts with concrete caps and overhanging shallow gabled concrete awnings. As well, a similar chimney shaft penetrates the roof of the rear wing. Generally the building is constructed from <b>loadbearing</b> brickwork and has rendered concrete detailing. The facades of the building are lined on both storeys with verandah loggias formed by large round arched openings. Most of these openings, although originally open have been infilled with glazing.|$|E
5000|$|At around 150 feet (50 m) tall, it {{dominates the}} Lancaster skyline and is visible for many miles around. It also offers {{spectacular}} {{views of the}} surrounding area including Morecambe Bay. The building is in the Edwardian Baroque style and was designed by John Belcher. It {{has been described as}} [...] "England's grandest folly" [...] and the [...] "Taj Mahal of the North". The dome is externally of copper, the main stone used is Portland stone although the steps are of hard wearing granite from Cornwall. The external stonework is hung on a steel frame as found in modern buildings and only forms a weatherproof covering without being <b>loadbearing.</b> In recent times this steelwork has caused problems for the conservation of the building. Externally around the dome are sculptures representing [...] "Commerce", [...] "Science", [...] "Industry" [...] and [...] "Art" [...] by Herbert Hampton, who was also responsible for the design of the Queen Victoria Memorial, Lancaster commissioned by James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton the previous year. The interior of the dome has allegorical paintings of [...] "Commerce", [...] "Art" [...] and [...] "History" [...] by George Murray. The floor is of white, black and red marble.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, {{aircraft}} manufacturers {{were planning}} to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the [...] "80-metre box" [...] was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m wingspan and length to be accommodated. Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines, and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 m <b>loadbearing</b> width. The US FAA initially opposed this, then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45 m runways without restrictions. The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400. Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders {{may be required to}} be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than 25 m from the centre line of the aircraft, compared to 21 m for the 747-400, and 747-8.|$|E
5000|$|The 1877, Oldham style, {{spinning}} mill was five storeys high {{built on a}} basement with a hipped mansard roof. It was built of yellow sandstone with decorative courses of red Accrington brick. It had a floor separation of 4.1 m and was 16 bays long 55m and 40m wide [...] with a six-stage water tower and stair column on one corner. The other corners had clasping pilasters behind which were the urinals. This wide mill designed using Stott 1871 patent for fireproof construction. The cast iron columns did not support each longitudinal rolled iron beam- but supported a capital that held a cross beam. It {{was placed in the}} centre of every second arch. Thus the span of 1.53m allowed the floor placing of the columns to be at 3.2m. This accommodated the longer and wider mules of the time. On each floor there were eight pairs if 1,050 spindle mules. The rigid box frame of columns, beams and cross beams was lighter and stronger than previous methods and barely need any <b>loadbearing</b> support from the exterior walls thus the windows could become larger allowing sufficient light to penetrate to the centre of the 40m mill. The 1914 Chimney was round, though there were two other detached chimney from earlier phases.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is asymmetrically arranged, with principal facades to both Creek and Ann Streets. It is a <b>loadbearing</b> brick structure with concrete foundation and basement substructure. Concrete detailing is {{found throughout the}} building, and includes door and window surrounds, tracery, stairs, roof detailing, internal vaulting and dome and internal corbelling. The building's ecclesiastical function is apparent in the traditional cruciform floor plan, with transepts extending from the north-south running nave, {{to the east and}} west, the western transept facing Ann Street. A rectangular wing, housing the early Session House, abuts the northern end of the building, also with principal entrance to Ann Street. The unglazed terracotta tiled roof of the church is gabled over the nave and transepts, with the Session House separately gabled with end to Ann Street. Complementing the forms of the steeply pitched gabled roofs, is a square planned tower at the principal corner of the site, and turned through 45°, thus truncating the corner of the building and providing a suitable position for a corner entrance. The tower houses the principal semicircular arched doorway at ground level, accessed via several concrete steps, above which are several elongated rectangular and small circular openings with large semicircular arched openings near the cornice line. A simple concrete parapet, with ribbed detail and four simple corner pinnacles, surmounts the tower and partially conceals the pyramidal roof that has a concrete apex surmounted by a fine wrought iron finial.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates met in London in {{the early}} 1990s and {{were part of a}} group of architects, theorists and artists who met {{regularly}} between 1994 and 1995. The group (informally called Papers on architecture) had a common interest in the urban character of London and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson. Among the earliest realised projects by Sergison Bates architects are the public house (pub) in Walsall and the semi-detached house in Stevenage, both of which use motifs of informal architecture. A number of other small scale projects, primarily in London, followed, which also displayed an interest in creating a robust architectural expression through the use of lightweight low-tech construction methods (i.e. thin brick-slip façade panels on the Studio house in Bethnal Green and cement boards as cladding for a timber panel structure in the self-build housing project in Tilbury). This preoccupation with breathing layered wall constructions culminated in the exhibition project and book “Brick-work: thinking and making”. The unrealised competition design for a museum on the Danish island Bornholm (included in “Brick-work”) indicated a shift towards a more heavy and monolithic construction form and spatial expression. Two examples of this change in direction are the Urban housing project in Finsbury Park built with a <b>loadbearing</b> wall of brickwork and precast concrete, and the Centre for the applied arts in Ruthin that adopted structure and pigmented façade elements made of concrete cast in situ. From 2010 Sergison Bates architects were awarded commissions through design competitions for projects in Flanders (Belgium), Switzerland and Austria. In 2016 the firm completed their most prestigious building to date, the Welcome centre and offices for the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Shanghai (China).|$|E
