50|$|Flight 402 was a Hong Kong to Tokyo to Vancouver flight, {{which took}} off at 16:14 Japan Time from Kai Tak International Airport {{on the first}} leg of the journey.

At 20:05 local time, the pilot radioed the control tower that he was diverting to Taiwan, and was told the visibility at the airport had increased above minimums again to five-eighths of a mile. The pilot then decided to make another approach before diverting.|$|E

Four obsta-cle removal methods are considered to assess the challenges faced by the SATS Program in providing LLM capabilities to 3, 416 U. S. airports. Two views of runway obstacle analysis are presented: a critical object analysis and a detailed multiobject analysis that includes terrain informa-tion. A comparison is made between decision altitudes (DAs) derived by approach lighting infrastructure and glide path angle thresholds and DA values considering other airport characteristics such as terrain. A detailed case study is presented to compare the single critical object analysis with the more detailed multiobject analysis, which was performed for Blacksburg Airport, in Virginia...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Vision (SV) {{may serve}} as a revolutionary crew/vehicle {{interface}} enabling technology {{to meet the challenges of}} the Next Generation Air Transportation System Equivalent Visual Operations (EVO) concept – that is, the ability to achieve or even improve on the safety of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, maintain the operational tempos of VFR, and potentially retain VFR procedures independent of actual weather and visibility conditions. One significant challenge lies in the definition of required equipage on the aircraft and on the airport to enable the EVO concept objective. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of the presence or absence of SV, the location (head-up or head-down) of this information during an instrument approach, and the type of airport lighting information on <b>landing</b> <b>minima.</b> Another key element of the testing entailed investigating the pilot’s awareness and reaction to non-normal events (i. e., failure conditions) that were unexpectedly introduced into the experiment. These non-normals are critical determinants in the underlying safety of all-weather operations. This paper presents the experimental results specific to pilot response to non-normal events using head-up and head-down synthetic vision displays...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{vision is}} a computer-generated {{image of the}} {{external}} scene topography that is generated from aircraft attitude, high-precision navigation information, and data of the terrain, obstacles, cultural features, and other required flight information. A synthetic vision system (SVS) enhances this basic functionality with real-time integrity to ensure {{the validity of the}} databases, perform obstacle detection and independent navigation accuracy verification, and provide traffic surveillance. Over the last five years, NASA and its industry partners have developed and deployed SVS technologies for commercial, business, and general aviation aircraft which have been shown to provide significant improvements in terrain awareness and reductions in the potential for Controlled-Flight-Into-Terrain incidents/accidents compared to current generation cockpit technologies. It has been hypothesized that SVS displays can greatly improve the safety and operational flexibility of flight in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) to a level comparable to clear-day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), regardless of actual weather conditions or time of day. An experiment was conducted to evaluate SVS and SVS-related technologies as well as the influence of where the information is provided to the pilot (e. g., on a Head-Up or Head-Down Display) for consideration in defining <b>landing</b> <b>minima</b> based upon aircraft and airport equipage. The "operational considerations" evaluated under this effort included reduced visibility, decision altitudes, and airport equipage requirements, such as approach lighting systems, for SVS-equipped aircraft. Subjective results from the present study suggest that synthetic vision imagery on both head-up and head-down displays may offer benefits in situation awareness; workload; and approach and landing performance in the visibility levels, approach lighting systems, and decision altitudes tested...|$|E

After the flight was given descent clearance to 10000 ft, regional air traffic control (ATC) advised that weather in St. Maarten was below <b>landing</b> <b>minimum.</b> The captain elected to divert to San Juan, but shortly after that, the tower at St. Maarten advised them that the weather had improved sufficiently for landing.

One significant challenge lies in the definition of required equipage on the aircraft and on the airport to enable the EVO concept objective. A piloted simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of the presence or absence of Synthetic Vision, the location of this information during an instrument approach (i. e., on a Head-Up or Head-Down Primary Flight Display), and the type of airport lighting information on <b>landing</b> <b>minima.</b> The quantitative data from this experiment were analyzed to begin the definition of performance-based criteria for all-weather approach and landing operations. Objective results from the present study showed that better approach performance was attainable with the head-up display (HUD) compared to the head-down display (HDD). A slight performance improvement in HDD performance was shown when SV was added, as the pilots descended below 200 ft to a 100 ft decision altitude, but this performance was not tested for statistical significance (nor was it expected to be statistically significant). The touchdown data showed that regardless of the display concept flown (SV HUD, Baseline HUD, SV HDD, Baseline HDD) a majority of the runs were within the performance-based defined approach and landing criteria in all the visibility levels, approach lighting systems, and decision altitudes tested. For this visual flight maneuver, RVR appeared to be the most significant influence in touchdown performance. The approach lighting system clearly impacted the pilot's ability to descend to 100 ft height above touchdown based on existing Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 91. 175 using a 200 ft decision height, but did not appear to influence touchdown performance or approach path maintenanc...|$|E
