5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} <b>loading</b> <b>ramps,</b> cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} incident, on August 13, 1992, the same vessel {{pulled out of}} its berth at the Departure Bay {{terminal}} while vehicle <b>loading</b> <b>ramps</b> were still lowered and resting on the ship. Three people were killed, including two children, one was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when a van from Alberta containing 6 people fell 15 m (about 50ft) from the upper deck onto the lower car deck and finally into the sea below. The van had been stopped and instructed to wait on the loading ramp by terminal crew members. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the accident {{was caused by the}} vessel not properly following departing procedures and secondarily due to poor communication between terminal and ship crew members.|$|E
