25|$|Merchants in the United States {{have been}} {{fighting}} what {{they consider to be}} unfairly high fees charged by credit card companies in a series of <b>lawsuits</b> <b>that</b> started in 2005. Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their monopoly power to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the National Retail Federation and major retailers such as Wal-Mart. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion settlement in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Amazon, chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, news analysts, lawyers, {{current and}} former {{government}} officials of the Thai justice system, such as Seripisut Temiyavet, came out to state that the DSI was not handling {{the investigation of the}} temple with proper legal procedure. It was questioned why the DSI would not let the abbot acknowledge the charges at the temple, which many considered legitimate under criminal law. The DSI replied that {{they did not want to}} visit the abbot at the temple at this stage, because the temple was crowded with people, who could force the DSI to commit itself to additional conditions. A spokesperson of the temple also questioned why the DSI did not pursue <b>lawsuits</b> <b>that</b> were still running against Paiboon and Phra Suwit. Was the DSI biased because they received orders from someone not disclosed? The DSI had seen its independence questioned before, even by leading people within the department itself. In short, the temple's practitioners and spokespeople felt the charges were politically motivated, and had no confidence in the justice system under the junta. Moreover, they felt that if the former abbot would turn himself in, this would set a precedent for more baseless persecutions of other monks.|$|E
500|$|As such, he saw {{the film}} as {{offering}} artistic commentary on the cultural impact of Disney, and thus clearly falling under fair use.

Not only did the court dismiss Mattel's complaint, [...] "he judges were so annoyed by the <b>lawsuits</b> <b>that</b> they awarded attorney's fees of nearly two million dollars to the artist ...

[...] The review described the latter portion of the book as [...] "a more intense personal chronicle of Godwin's deep involvement in what he calls the 'cyberporn panic' – the push to control Internet content." [...] Columbia Journalism Review concluded, [...] "Ultimately, Godwin shows, this strong response laid the groundwork for <b>lawsuits</b> <b>that</b> enabled the Supreme Court to declare the 'decency' amendment unconstitutional. He was in the thick of things throughout this effort, and his journal lets the reader relive the tension and uncertainty of trying to halt a media stampede before it crushed everything in its path." ...|$|E
500|$|Investigations {{were held}} in various states, {{including}} Arkansas, Michigan, and Missouri, which led to <b>lawsuits</b> <b>that</b> accused brokers of illegally reselling tickets from the Best of Both Worlds Tour. [...] "When you allow the hijacking of the market, it's literally the worst of both worlds. You get charged too much, and there's no access for the locals", said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon. Numerous ticket brokers accessed tickets prior to fans {{as a result of}} a software program by RMG Technologies Inc, which permitted its clients to circumvent Ticketmaster.com's CAPTCHA access controls, and use the copyrighted website in a manner that violated the site's [...] "Terms of Use". Ticketmaster took legal action against RMG Technologies via the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming that the developed software for ticket brokers illegally [...] "allows them to cut in line". RMG Technologies representative denied the allegations and said they should not be held accountable because Ticketmaster is getting still paid for the tickets. [...] "This may be the only time in history that any seller sued its customers for paying them too much money", the attorney for RMG Technologies wrote in court documents.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 Ohio {{experienced}} an unintended {{consequence of a}} new statute {{that resulted in a}} brief period of overlap voting, when absentee voting has started and before the close of voter registration. [...] This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot. [...] Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate <b>lawsuits</b> <b>that</b> Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an absentee ballot. On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. [...] United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the absentee ballot deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer. [...] The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff, Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote. [...] The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008. [...] In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting. [...] Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court “abused its discretion” in granting the restraining order.|$|E
