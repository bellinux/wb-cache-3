The procedure to find this controller as follows; first, the plant is balanced so that controllability and observability Grammians is equal to square Hankel singular values diagonal matrix, then look for the controller gain and estimator gain that are solutions of Riccati equations. Next, construct a state space realization of LQG controller. To verify the performance of the obtained controller, its was applied for the spring mass system. Further, by using MATLAB program, the performance of the closed <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> with the LQG controller and the open <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> is compared.

In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places.

40|$|The task of {{implementing}} a supervisory controller is non-trivial, even though different theories ex-ist that allow automatic synthesis of these controllers {{in the form}} of automata. One of the reasons for this discord is due to the asynchronous interaction between a plant and its controller in imple-mentations, whereas the existing supervisory control theories assume synchronous interaction. As a consequence the implementation suffer from the so-called inexact synchronisation problem. In this paper we address the issue of inexact synchronisation in a process algebraic setting, by solving a more general problem of refinement. We construct an asynchronous closed <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> by introducing a communication medium in a given synchronous closed <b>loop</b> <b>system.</b> Our goal is to find sufficient conditions under which a synchronous closed <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> is branching bisimilar to its corresponding asynchronous closed <b>loop</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|R

Closed <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since open <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature. For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread.|$|E

The observed hot counterpart of the plasma that probably envelopes the cool confined plasma, moves comparatively faster (∼ 34 km s^- 1) to the later (29 km s^- 1) in form of the spreaded intensity feature. The propagating plasma and intensity reflect from the region of another footpoint of the loop. The subsonic speed of the moving plasma and associated intensity feature may be most likely evolved in the post flare <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> through impulsive flare heating processes. Complementing our observations of moving multi-temperature intensity features in the post flare <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> and its reflection, we also attempt to solve two-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations numerically using the VAL-IIIC atmosphere as an initial condition to simulate the observed plasma dynamics.
