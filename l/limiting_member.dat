40|$|The present {{invention}} {{includes an}} attachment apparatus comprising a rotation <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> adapted to be threaded onto a threaded member; and a preload nut adapted to be threaded onto the threaded member. The rotation <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> comprises {{a plurality of}} pins; and the preload nut comprises plurality of slots, preferably wherein the plurality of pins and the plurality of slots are the same in number, which is preferably three. The plurality of pins of the rotation <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> are filled into a corresponding plurality of slots of the preload nut to form a rotatable unit adapted to be threaded onto the threaded member. In use, the rotatable unit is threaded onto the threaded member. The present invention thus provides a unitized removable device for holes, including holes other than circular in shape, which have an established depth before an end of, or before an enlargement of the hole. The configuration of some exposed part of the device, or the head, is shaped and formed for its intended purpose, such as clamping, anchor points, eye bolts, stud anchor, and the like. The device allows for the installation, preloading and removal of all components of the device, as a unit, without damage to the member for which attachment is required by simple rotations of some exposed part of the device...|$|E
40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} device {{used as a}} load <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> in a structure to control its response to applied loads is described. It functions by utilizing a spool assembly having flanged ends and an interior cavity of sufficiently large diameter to cause it to deform plastically at a prescribed load. In application, the spool is utilized as a pivot point for the legs of an airplane seat. When properly designed and integrated into the seat arrangement the spool will twist about its axis, deforming plastically when the impact load exceeds the spool yield value. Through this deformation, the spool absorbs the kinetic energy of {{the movement of the}} seat at a substantially constant rate, thereby controlling the level of loads transmitted to the seat occupant. By proper sizing and collection of materials, it is possible to control load response in a predictable manner...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis {{should not be}} seen solely as a problem but also {{as an opportunity to}} reform the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in a non-conventional way: through jurisprudence. By instituting a very short-term financing facility as an emergency measure, the European Council of Finance Ministers (Ecofin) will give de facto responsibility for imposing the conditions on Greece to the European Commission. This ‘ties the hands ’ of the Ecofin and thus makes the imposition of structural reforms more credible since it puts unambiguous limits on Member States ’ increasing debt and deficits. Furthermore, this process works much faster than creating new legislation in the conventional way and implicitly leads to more political integration. In the end, it shows that the EU needed this crisis to enforce structural reforms, and by <b>limiting</b> <b>Member</b> States ’ fiscal policy, moves towards further political integration, albeit not via the front door but through the back door.

40|$|In 2014 the District Court of The Hague {{returned}} {{its decision}} {{in a case}} concerning peacekeeper (Dutchbat) wrongdoing during the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina. The district court dismissed the UN as party to the suit, basing this decision on the organization’s statutory immunity from prosecution. As a basis for holding the Netherlands liable for Dutchbat’s actions, the district court utilized the effective control standard. This standard triggered liability for conduct undertaken either under direct order from Dutch officials, or {{in violation of the}} mission mandate. The district court strictly interpreted effective control, concluding the Netherlands was liable for conduct only insofar as it pertained to Dutchbat personnel who actively separated male Muslim refugees, who were later executed by the Bosnian Serbian Army. The decision reflected a commitment to <b>limiting</b> <b>Member</b> States’ liability so as to sustain enthusiastic troop contribution to peacekeeping. This policy could have negative repercussions as peacekeepers adopt increasingly complex responsibilities, especially in areas afflicted by terrorism. These missions frequently involve asymmetrical warfare, and some have become the most dangerous on record. Zealously encouraging Member States to deploy troops to areas under constant threat of unpredictable terrorist acts strongly calls into question the prudence of this policy...|$|E
40|$|We {{reconsider the}} steady planar flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid within a small {{distance}} r of a sharp reentrant corner of angle π/p, 1 / 2 ≤ p < 1. Previous theoretical studies {{of this problem}} {{have been unable to}} resolve a boundary layer near the downstream wall. For a range of angles π/p, including the benchmark problem p = 2 / 3, and for several non-zero solvent viscosities, we have solved the equations for the downstream boundary layer numerically and additionally found asymptotic results for a frozen stress limit and for high solvent viscosities. For each angle and viscosity we find a one-parameter family of attached ‘potential ’ flows, for each of which the stress is proportional to r 2 p− 2 and the velocity proportional to rp(3 −p) − 1 as proposed by Hinch [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 50 (1993) 161]. The <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> of the family has zero shear stress on the upstream wall. The stress is that of a purely elastic neo-Hookean solid in the interior of the flow, with boundary layers on both the upstream and downstream walls having the similarity structure proposed by Renardy [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 58 (1995) 83]. The behaviour of these flows is discussed. We propose a form of elastic Kutta condition to determine the separation angle for flows having an upstream lip vortex...|$|E
40|$|The contour {{dynamics}} {{method is}} extended to vortex rings with vorticity varying linearly from the symmetry axis. An elliptic core model is also developed to {{explain some of}} the basic physics. Passage and collisions of two identical rings are studied focusing on core deformation, sound generation and stirring of fluid elements. With respect to core deformation, not only the strain rate but how rapidly it varies is important and accounts for greater susceptibility to vortex tearing than in two dimensions. For slow strain, as a passage interaction is completed and the strain relaxes, the cores return to their original shape while permanent deformations remain for rapidly varying strain. For collisions, if the strain changes slowly the core shapes migrate through a known family of two-dimensional steady vortex pairs up to the <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> of the family. Thereafter energy conservation does not allow the cores to maintain a constant shape. For rapidly varying strain, core deformation is severe and a head-tail structure in good agreement with experiments is formed. With respect to sound generation, good agreement with the measured acoustic signal for colliding rings is obtained and a feature previously thought to be due to viscous effects is shown to be an effect of inviscid core deformation alone. For passage interactions, a component of high frequency is present. Evidence for the importance of this noise source in jet noise spectra is provided. Finally, processes of fluid engulfment and rejection for an unsteady vortex ring are studied using the stable and unstable manifolds. The unstable manifold shows excellent agreement with flow visualization experiments for leapfrogging rings suggesting that it may be a good tool for numerical flow visualization in other time periodic flows...|$|E

40|$|How {{much does}} European {{citizenship}} cost in the EU? This {{was the question}} that has raised so much controversy over the Maltese citizenship-for-sale programme. The outright selling of Maltese nationality to rich foreigners led to unprecedented responses by the European Parliament and European Commission. This paper examines the affair and its relevance for current and future configurations of citizenship of the EU. It studies {{the extent to which}} member states are still free to lay down the grounds for the acquisition and loss of nationality without any EU supervision and accountability. It provides a comparative overview of member state schemes and the exact price for buying citizenship and a residency permit in the EU. It is argued that the EU’s intervention on the Maltese citizenship-for-sale affair constitutes a legal precedent for assessing the lawfulness of passport-for-sale or golden migration programmes in other EU member states. The affair has also revealed the increasing relevance of a set of European and international legal principles <b>limiting</b> <b>member</b> states’ discretion over citizenship matters and providing a supranational constellation of accountability venues scrutinising the impact of their decisions over citizenship of the Union. The Maltese citizenship-for-sale affair has placed at the forefront the EU general principle of sincere cooperation in nationality matters. Member states’ actions in the citizenship domain cannot negatively affect in substance the concept and freedoms of European citizenship. That notwithstanding, the European institutions’ insistence on the need for Maltese nationality law to require a ‘genuine link’ {{in the form of an}} effective residence criteria for any rich applicants to benefit from the fast-track naturalisation poses a fundamental dilemma from the angle of Union citizenship: what is this genuine link really about? And what is precisely ‘habitual’, ‘effective’ or ‘functional’ residence? It is argued that by supporting the ‘real connections’ as the most relevant standard, the European institutions may be paradoxically fuelling nationalistic misuses by member states of the ‘genuine link’ as a way to justify restrictive integration policies on the acquisition of nationality...|$|E
