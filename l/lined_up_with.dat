5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fuseli {{would later}} create {{one of the}} more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783, {{entitled}} The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). The three of them are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E

5|$|When Oliver {{arrived in}} Adelaide he started playing for West Suburbans and {{immediately}} began to draw attention from the two largest South Australian Football League (SAFL) clubs, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Australian businessman Edwin T. Smith was sending Oliver letters asking him to come train with Norwood whilst John Woolard, then captain of Port Adelaide who like Oliver grew up in Broken Hill, was also enquiring about his services. Before Oliver made his debut with Port Adelaide he was <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a job shovelling furnace waste. Disgruntled, {{he spoke to the}} Musgrave brothers father who suggested he approach West Torrens and train with them, to which Oliver agreed. Port Adelaide secretary James Hodge prevented this move as Oliver had signed a contract with him shortly beforehand. Hodge later took Oliver out on a fishing trip to resolve the feud and found him a better job.|$|E

25|$|Still the Saints {{were just}} {{trailing}} 10-3 {{near the end}} of the third quarter, and had a great chance to tie the game when defensive tackle Renaldo Turnbull blocked Butler's 45-yard field goal attempt. New Orleans defensive end Vince Buck recovered the ball and returned it 62 yards for a potential touchdown, only to see the play wiped out by an offsides penalty on teammate Robert Massey, who had <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his hand over the neutral zone. The penalty not only eliminated the score, but it also gave Chicago a first down, and seven plays later, Butler kicked a 25-yard field goal to put them up 13-3.|$|E

25|$|Super Attack Ball: The team's second {{finishing}} attack, {{received in}} episode 3. To be summoned, Soccer Yellow throws a medal {{into the sky}} and the Super Attack Ball descends from the Moon. It is then passed from member to member and Boxing Red punches it into the enemy. The Sport Rangers' first attempt to use the Super Attack Ball was unsuccessful, they were unable to smoothly pass it to each other. To improve on their teamwork, they <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their legs strapped to the person next to them and tried to run together. With their new team skills, they were able to complete the combination attack during their second try.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the local {{direction of the}} magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|E
25|$|On {{the topic}} of {{predictable}} probabilities, the double-slit experiments are a popular example. Photons are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, {{and the distribution of}} its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but {{there is no way to}} predict where in the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use weak measurement to acquire more information without violating the Uncertainty principle).|$|E

25|$|Tolstoy's actions became {{instrumental}} {{in the life of}} the Seventh. Stalin read Pravda closely and he generally trusted Tolstoy's comments. He remained highly suspicious of spontaneous outpourings of mass enthusiasm both before and after the war, seeing them as veiled instances of oppositionist feelings. However, he also realized squelching such mass expressions in wartime could be unwise, and he had Tolstoy's comments to give them credence in the case of the Seventh Symphony. Tolstoy's interpretation of the Seventh, in fact, <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Stalin's stated support of nationalism and patriotism. At least as important was that without the help of the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union would not overcome Nazi Germany. The Soviets had been seen not long ago in the Western press as godless villains and barbarians. Now the Americans and British had to believe that the Soviet Union was helping protect the values those countries cherished from fascism for the Soviets to continue receiving those countries' support.|$|E
25|$|Clarkson {{describes}} {{one of her}} earliest memories as that {{of hiding}} in several Hong Kong basements during the Japanese invasion of the territory in 1941. It was only through his Canadian government connections that her father gained his family the opportunity in 1942 to flee the occupation to Canada, {{as part of the}} repatriating of Canadian government staff from the fallen city. Even so, the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, prevented the Poys' immediate entry into the country until the Department of External Affairs intervened and cited an unfilled quota in the prisoner of war exchange programme with the Japanese Imperial Forces that would permit the Poy family free passage into Canada. The family settled in Ottawa, though William had lost almost all of his substantial fortune, and the Poys lived in a cramped duplex. Clarkson attended public school in the city and, in October 1951, was <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her class to see Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), as the royal motorcade passed through the city.|$|E
25|$|Nick Barmby {{marked his}} 500th career {{appearance}} {{against one of}} his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, and it looked like the match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to go down as an own goal. It got worse for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater tangled with Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory.|$|E

500|$|Landing was {{originally}} planned on the [...] Runway 31. Difficulties in controlling the aircraft made lining up almost impossible.

When they came out they were instead <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the shorter (6,888ft) and closed Runway 22, and had little capacity to maneuver. Fire trucks had been placed on Runway 22, anticipating a landing on nearby Runway 31, so all the vehicles were quickly moved out of the way before the plane touched down. Runway 22 had been permanently closed a year earlier in 1988.|$|E
