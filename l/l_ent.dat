40|$|Hokkai Cave was {{discovered}} in 2006 in southwestern Hokkaido, northern Japan, and has been conserved in its natural condition. This paper reports {{the results of a}} basic speleological study of the cave's environment conducted during 2006 – 2009, including a geomorphological survey, monitoring of cave air temperature, airflow and groundwater currents, and an initial interpretation of the cave's speleogenesis. These basic cave data are important to help improve palaeoclimatic speleothem sample selection, because speleothem geochemistry is also controlled by cave geometry and micro-meteorology. Hokkai Cave is a 479. 8 m-long, zigzag, horizontal system, with two entrances. The cave floor is mainly covered with clay, gravels and breakdown blocks. An underground river flows in the centre of the cave and a dry riverbed, and many springs and dolines are present around the cave. Pure white stalagmites in the cave are possibly suitable for use in Asian Summer Monsoon reconstruction studies. Air temperature in the inner cave (> 15 m from entrances) was stable throughout the year (7. 5 – 7. 7 °C); in contrast, air temperature near the entrance was variable because of the influence of the outside air temperature. Inversion of airflow direction is driven by the air temperature gradient between the inside and the outside of the cave. When air temperature inside is warmer than outside, air flows from Ent. U (upper) to <b>Ent.</b> <b>L</b> (lower) and from Ent. U to the inside. When air temperature outside is warmer than inside, air flows from <b>Ent.</b> <b>L</b> to <b>Ent.</b> U and from the inner cave to Ent. U. These results agree with findings from previous studies. Inversion of airflow direction also affects the variation pattern of air temperature near the entrances.

Methods and Results: Quantification of bacterial adhesion was performed using the crystal violet staining technique. Preconditioning of surfaces with surfactin caused a reduction on the number of adhered cells of <b>Ent.</b> sakazakii and <b>L.</b> monocytogenes on stainless steel. The most significant result was obtained with L. monocytogenes where number of adhered cells was reduced by 10 (2) CFU cm(- 2). On polypropylene, surfactin showed a significant decrease on the adhesion of all strains. The adsorption of surfactin on polystyrene also reduces the adhesion of L. monocytogenes and Salm. Enteritidis growing cells. For short contact periods using nongrowing cells or longer contact periods with growing cells, surfactin was able to delay bacterial adhesion. Conclusions: The prior adsorption of surfactin to solid surfaces contributes on reducing colonization of the pathogenic bacteria.

40|$|The {{research}} program was initiated to learn whether diazomethane ring expansion might prove a reasonable method of arriving at perhydroazulenes {{that are related}} to some sesquiterpenes. In the course of the investigation, which involved 4 -methyl-cis 3 a, 4, 7, 7 a-tetrahydrophthalan as a model, it was concluded that a methyl group can have powerful directive effects; possibly more electronic in nature than steric. Also, the choice of an oxygen heterocyclic system {{as a model for the}} carbocyclic systems resulted in an analysis of the long range directive effects of oxygen. Additional studies using a sulfur hetero-atom confirmed the long range hetero-interactions. As part of the study using oxygenated systems, the sex attractant of the bark beetle, Dendroctonus brevicomis, was prepared by an unambiguous synthesis. The initial question of the program, that of investigating the use of diazomethane ring expansion, was answered and evidence shows that the desired product is that obtained in greater quantity. Overall yields, however, appear to be prohibitive in using this as a synthetic route. The poor ring expansion may result from electronic and/or steric effects.

40|$|In this essay, {{written for}} the 30 th Anniversary of Cardozo’s Arts and Entertainment Law Journal, I revisit the ruinous {{litigation}} strategy copyright owners pursued after Napster to secure control {{of the market for}} personal uses of copyrighted works, which I wrote about ten years ago in War Stories, 20 Cardozo Arts & <b>Ent.</b> <b>L.</b> J. 337 (2002). The litigation campaign had effects that copyright owners now have reason to regret. Medical experts tell us that powerful antibiotics are highly effective in killing off both good and bad bacteria, but at a significant risk. Bugs that survive the treatment grow bigger, stronger, and resistant to antibiotics. They become much more dangerous because they are harder to kill. Copyright owners’ indiscriminate litigation against new entrants into the entertainment and information marketplace killed off a broad swath of potential competitors and partners. The ones who were left faced a less crowded field because old media had helpfully cleared it for them. The scorched-earth litigation strategy temporarily cleared the field, and made room both for tepid, content-industry-controlled efforts to distribute music, books, and video online, and for new entrants with the stamina and resources to survive copyright infringement suits. Apple, Amazon, and Google took advantage of that environment to grow into dominant distributors who are obligatory partners for any serious online content distribution plan, and who insist on calling the shots on price, format, and other matters that content owners believe should rightfully be under their own control...|$|R

Modern media {{licenses}} involving Internet sites, video games, multimedia projects, {{and independent}} motion pictures follow the publishing industry’s shifts {{of power and}} control. Those acquiring rights have significant leverage at the outset but lose that power as completion deadlines near. Marketing leverage depends significantly {{on the importance of}} the participants to the marketing strategy, so that if live appearances are critical to marketing, then those individuals have much more influence than for those projects where the persons involved are excluded from marketing. In addition, these so-called “new media” industries do not have the meaningful custom or trade practice helpful to interpret common licensing provisions. As a result, the licenses should be more specific, detailing the obligations and authority of each party. New media projects are far less standardized than book publishing, resulting in the need for considerable detail and for incorporation of an easy-to-use dispute resolution mechanism. In the context of identity-interest licenses for new media, a well-crafted license requires that (i) the identity interests are correctly identified; (ii) the obligations of each party are carefully specified; and (iii) the range of remedial measures is tightly controlled. This paper first identifies what types of interests are typically licensed in such transactions. It then identifies common uses of these interests so that full use can be made of each interest acquired. Finally, the paper outlines the essential elements needed for an effective license of the identity interests relevant to each transaction...|$|R

However, the molecular dent t es of transporters med at ng these fluxes are mostly unknown. As a first step to integrate transport with pollen development and function, a genome-wide analys s of transporter genes expressed n the male gametophyte at four developmental stages was conducted. About 1269 genes encoding classified transporters were collected from the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Of 757 transporter genes expressed in pollen, 16 % or 124 genes, including AHA 6, CNGC 18, TIP 1. 3 and CHX 08, are specifically or preferentially expressed relative to sporophyt c t ssues. Some genes are h ghly expressed n m crospores and b cellular pollen (COPT 3, STP 2, OPT 9); while others are act vated only n tr cellular or mature pollen (STP 11, LHT 7).

40|$|Text {{classification}} is {{the task}} of assigning predefined categories to free text documents. Due to the ever-increasing amount of electronic documents, digital libraries and web resources, document classification is critical in higher level document processing tasks such as information extraction, named entity recognition and event modelling. Text categorization {{is considered to be}} challenging because of the large number of features in a typical text document. In spite of this, various categorization algorithms have reached accuracies in the vicinity of 90 %. It has generally been found that probability based algorithms perform better on Natural Language Processing tasks compared to other types of algorithms. This is in addition to probabilistic algorithms being highly extensible. In this thesis paper, a tool called MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit) was used to perform document classification using a set of probabilistic algorithms to determine the effect of imbalanced data on the performance of these algorithms when compared to balanced data. The data used for the research was taken from Reuters Corpus (RCV 1) which contains categorized newspaper articles. Although the corpus contains many fine levels of categorization, this research used four upper level topic codes which were further organized into binary categories of a document belonging to a category or out of it. The documents were then converted into a form acceptable to MALLET and tested for categorization with the chosen algorithms. The algorithms used for the research were Naïve Bayes, Balanced Winnow and three variations of Max Ent, namely Max <b>Ent,</b> Max <b>Ent</b> <b>L</b> 1 and MC Max Ent. It was firstly found that these probability based algorithms performed marginally better than other algorithms reported in previous works on similar genre of input data. However, a significant finding from the research was that the algorithms performed similarly or in some cases even better, for imbalanced data compared to balanced data. This was due to the vocabulary properties of the documents used for training and asserts the resilience of the probability based algorithms for text categorization...|$|R
40|$|In {{last few}} decades, the {{increasing}} consumer demand for natural and chemical additive-free products has stimulated food industry {{to look for}} novel and alternative strategies for food biopreservation. In such a perspective, a promising role could be played by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) producing bacteriocins, defined as ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides that exhibit antagonism mainly against Gram-positive bacteria. Among LAB, Enterococcus spp. strains are highly adapted to several food systems because of their strong tolerance to salts and acids. They are often found in high numbers and are believed to contribute to cheese ripening and {{to the development of}} aroma, especially in cheese products made in the Mediterranean area. Enterococcus spp. species have been previously reported to produce bacteriocins, with few strains belonging to E. faecium and E. faecalis being investigated also with regard to their potential as probiotics. However, such a role in Enterococcus spp. is still controversial considering both their increased association with nosocomial infections and their harbouring multiple antibiotic-resistant genes. In addition, several putative virulence factors have been recently described in enterococci. Therefore, any bacteriogenic Enterococcus spp. strain, and, generally, every bacteriocin producing isolate, should be carefully evaluated also for safety and virulence traits. In this work, four LAB strains, isolated from home made white brine cheese, were selected for their effective inhibition against Listeria monocytogenes. According to their biochemical and physiological characteristics, the strains were classified as members of Enterococcus genus, and then identified as E. faecium by 16 S rDNA sequecing. Their bacteriocin production and inhibitory spectrum were characterized together with the occurrence of several bacteriocin genes (entA, entB, <b>ent</b> P, <b>ent</b> <b>L</b> 50 B). Their virulence potential and safety were assessed both using PCR targeted to the genes gelE, hyl, asa 1, esp, cylA, efaA, ace, vanA, vanB, hdc 1, hdc 2, tdc and odc and by phenotypical tests for antibiotic resistance, gelatinase, lipase, DNAse and α- and β-haemolysis. The E. faecium strains harboured at least one enterocin gene while the occurrence of virulence, antibiotic resistance and biogenic amines genes was limited. Considering their strong antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes strains, the four E. faecium strains exhibited promising potential as bio-preservatives cultures for fermented food productions. Moreover, {{on the basis of their}} technological properties, the results of this study suggest that they could be efficiently used as adjunct non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) in many milk processing applications...|$|R
