50|$|The said type of {{gate valve}} {{is having a}} {{rotating}} member inside a rotating valve chamber wherein {{the center of the}} valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member & the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal <b>lathe</b> <b>machine.</b> This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} for tool path generation of numerical control (NC) <b>lathe</b> <b>machine</b> tools during the development of flexible transfer lines (FTL). The approach that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) can automatically generate a tool path of the NC <b>lathe</b> <b>machine</b> tools and decides the part reverse position by just giving the dimensions of a cylindrical type of the work piece. Conventionally, this reverse position is decided by an experienced operator because {{it was difficult to}} decide automatically in the FTL. The GA approach of our system adopts the moving points of the tool path as an individual. We propose two individuals expressions. The first expression is defined by adopting an absolute value of the tool path as absolute individuals expression (AIE) and the second expression is defined by adopting the incremental value of the tool path as incremental individuals expression (IIE).
