40|$|THE first {{recorded}} citation {{of the word}} ‘‘bainite’ ’ is in an article [1] published 12 years after Davenport and Bain introduced isothermal transformation as a technique to study the progressive evolution of phases {{as a function of}} time and temperature. This long interval {{is a reflection of the}} fact that although the phase was named in 1934, it was not used even by Bain and his coworkers in articles published subsequently, referring instead to a dark etching acicular aggregate somewhat similar to martensite. Anyone who reads the 1930 article, I think, would agree with me that such modesty, although laudable, was not needed given the breathtaking quality of the experimental work and the number of insights revealed, some of which have now become legend. The sheer amount and depth of experimental work reported in the article is impressive. Take, for example, the dilatometry. In order to avoid complications resulting from the expansion of the dilatometer rods themselves, a substantial part of the equipment was immersed into the molten <b>lead</b> <b>bath</b> to achieve the desired temperature. The specimen grips were designed to be self-aligning because the hot sample in its austenitic condition had to be introduced quickly before the assembly again was immersed into the molten metal. The dilatometric measurements were sufficiently accurate to note that during the formation of bainite or martensite, ‘‘the volume change is not necessarily uniformly reflected in all dimensions. Indeed, the thickness of flat disk specimens actually decreases as the volume increases. ’ ’ The observation was not explained at the time, but we now know that this is a consequence of anisotropic transformation plasticity resulting from crystallographic variant selection. Indeed, the exploitation of such anisotropy is the basis of methods for designing welding alloys capable of compensating for the thermal contraction that leads to pernicious residual stresses.

40|$|Impeller-stirred mixing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes employed throughout the chemical, metallurgical and allied industries. The research reported in this thesis is focused on impeller stirred mixing associated with the refining of lead bullion. The aim of this process is to sequentially remove contained impurities such as copper, antimony, silver and bismuth. This occurs in hemispherical vessels, called kettles, where reagents are initially added to the <b>lead</b> <b>bath</b> to form surface dross that contains both the required impurity and a large amount of lead oxide. This dross is then continuously mixed back into the bath to remove the lead oxide and capture more of the required impurity. A key requirement for this process is to obtain and remove dross that contains a high concentration of the impurity. Although this process has been in operation for many years, there is very little known on how the fluid dynamics associated with the mixing process affects final dross content. The aim of this research is to fully investigate the lead refining process using scientific analysis methods that help understand the mixing process and provide design tools which can be used to optimise process conditions. The three methods of analysis used are: (1) Direct readings from a real kettle, (2) Physical modelling (using water), and finally (3) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The use of physical modelling, exploiting the techniques of similitude, to predict vortex was also validated. An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) probe was used for the velocity measurement at various locations inside the water model and this gave valuable insight about the flow phenomena occurring inside the refining kettle. A particular important finding was that when fluid is stirred above certain rotational speed the vortex depth becomes independent of the Reynolds number of the operation. With regards CFD technology, the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method was used to capture the free surface and the Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) and Algebraic Slip Model (ASM) to simulate the dross phase. Appropriate methods were also used to represent the moving impeller region. Validation of simulation results against experimental data was very encouraging. Computed vortex depth showed the similar trend as observed during the experiments on the physical model. A design strategy was developed that integrates results from both physical and computational modelling to allow optimal process conditions to be predicted at the kettle design stage. The use of this integrated physical and computational modelling methodology successfully helped eliminate surface swirl by introducing baffles to the kettle. The design and introduction of these flow controllers was also validated to ensure that it optimised the dross mixing process and final impurity content in the dross.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mechanical}} properties and fracture characteristics of four grades of reactor uranium {{has been carried out}} within the range - 196 Â°C and + 800 Â°C. Although the investigation is general and broadly-based without detailed examination of each aspect, particular emphasis has been placed upon the ductile/brittle transition which occurs at about room temperature. Having considered the scientific and technological interest in this field of uranium metallurgy, there follows a comprehensive review of the relevant published work. This includes a discussion of previous reports upon the structure, transformation mechanisms, deformation, fracture and mechanical properties of uranium together with a survey of current theories of fracture. The experimental work involved vacuum and <b>lead</b> <b>bath</b> heat treatment, tensile, notch bend, compression and hardness testing followed by bright-field, polarized light end replies metallography. An initial {{study of the}} microstructural effects of mechanical and thermal treatment showed how the required control of microstructural variables could be achieved. Additionally, this preliminary work suggested that the important criterion in grain-refinement upon beta-alpha quenching by alloying with iron and aluminium in the amount of dispersed network phase present which retards alpha grain growth. Contributory factors appear to be solution of these added elements in the beta phase and beta grain growth. Three modes of fracture were observed in the alpha phase: crystallographic (low temperature), intercrystalline (in the region of room temperature and ductile (above room temperature). It is considered that the best explanation for the process of crystallographic failure (twin parting) is that it is nucleated at the apices of growing thick twins by a reaction involving emissary dislocations. Propagation is suggested to occur along the composition planes of the twins because these are the sites of structural distortion and stress thereby providing planes of inherent weakness in the lattice. Tests after thermal cycling established that an intergranular path of fracture is favoured because the anisotropy of thermal expansion gives rise to residual grain boundary stresses to a varying degree after most heat treatments thereby lowering the surface energy for fracture in these areas. Ductile failure occurred by the formation of cavities at cuboid inclusions which grew and, in the centre of the externally necked region, coalesced to form a macroscopic fissure which propagated outwards to cause failure. Below about 300 Â°c cavity formation tended to occur at an early stage by cuboid cleavage, whilst above 300 Â°C cavities tended to be formed at a later stage by inclusion/matrix parting. The ductile/brittle transition cay be attributed to increasing dislocation friction stress with decreasing temperature such that stresses at twin apices and composition planes were not readily accommodated and parting failure thereby facilitated. It is possible that with decreasing temperature there is a change in the electronic configuration to cause stronger covalent bonding and the transition can be explained in these terms. All these changes in fracture behaviour are reflected in the tensile properties and consequently an explanation for the effect of temperature upon many of these properties follows. A number of variables were shown to lower the ductile/brittle transition temp- ature including:- a) decreasing volume fractions of the finely dispersed intermetallic network (i. e. increasing purity), b) decreasing grain size, c) increasing amounts of cold-work or pre-strain, d) decreasing strain-rate. These effects can be mainly explained by invoking current theories of fracture. Additionally the transition temperature was shown to be sensitive to heat treatment. Heat treatment can cause variations in the surface energy for fracture at grain boundaries giving rise to intercrystalline embrittlement and promoting brittle fracture, thus providing an explanation. The brittle (parting) fracture stress of polycrystalline alpha decreases progressively with decreasing temperature. This {{may be related to the}} anisotropic structure which results in a very low yield stress. No simple fracture stress/grain size (d) relationship was found but if account is taken of all the influencing factors in alpha uranium the results might be explained in terms of the usual d -Â½ relationship. Beta uranium was shown to be brittle both in the beta region (when fracture appears to take an intergranular path) and when retained to room temperature (and below) by quenching an iron and aluminium rich grade (when failure appears to be by crystallographic cleavage). </p...|$|E

40|$|Localized {{electrochemical}} deposition (LECD) {{was performed by}} microanode-guided electroplating (MAGE) in two different baths to investigate the effect of solvent on the deposit morphology. One of the baths contained an ordinary aqueous solution prepared from distilled water and ionic liquid by mixing choline chloride with ethylene glycol; the other bath contained the same concentration of nickel chloride. A nonuniform micro deposit was obtained in the ionic liquid and it appeared {{as if it had}} been directly accumulated with huge nodular nickel particles; a uniform micro pillar was formed in the aqueous solution and this micro pillar exhibited a smooth appearance. The distinct deposit morphology is governed by the nature of the bath, which is characterized by the electrical resistivity and viscosity. The activation energy that arose from the electrical resistivity (E) and viscosity (Eg) in the different baths was estimated. The sum of activation energies (i. e., EsumEþEg) is much higher in the ionic liquid than in the aqueous solution. The higher activation energy in the ionic liquid <b>bath</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of nodular deposits.
