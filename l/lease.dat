This would enable Morningstar, Inc. to move before its early 2009 <b>lease</b> expiration at its present location, 225 W. Wacker Drive. However, financial troubles have caused delays that have necessitated that Morningstar who had intended to occupy over half of the building seek <b>lease</b> proposals from other downtown office towers. Morningstar would suffer holdover penalties and other damages if it were unable to move before its <b>lease</b> expires. Morningstar is hesitant to pursue other opportunities because their <b>lease</b> at 108 North State Street is at a below market price in the low $20s/square foot.|$|E

Harwood describes the early work such as Love on a Mortal <b>Lease</b> as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes Love on a Mortal <b>Lease</b> as a work in which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problems associated}} with marketing a durable through <b>leases</b> and sales. Academic research in this area has argued that in a monopolistic environment, <b>leasing</b> dominates selling. Hence, <b>leasing</b> and selling should not co-exist and the firm should concentrate its efforts solely on <b>leasing.</b> We show that the relative profitability of <b>leasing</b> and selling hinges on the rates at which <b>leased</b> and sold units depreciate. In particular, we find that <b>leasing</b> does not dominate selling in all cases; if sold units depreciate at a significantly higher rate than <b>leased</b> units, a monopolistic firm is better off by only selling its product. In addition, we find that if leaded and sold products depreciate at different rates, then the optimal strategy for the firm involves a combination of both <b>leasing</b> and selling. We conclude the paper with an empirical analysis of the depreciation rates of <b>leased</b> and sold units of a popular car model. We find that the depreciation rate of <b>leased</b> cars has been significantly lower than the depreciation rate of sold cars. <b>Leasing,</b> Selling, Durable Goods, Automobiles...|$|R
