40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} {{a set of}} principles, or guidelines, which aim to give practical and useful information {{in the process of}} developing user interfaces on mobile devices. When talking about mobile devices the main focus is on PDAs and Smartphones, but it also incorporates portable PCs (including ultra portable PCs), tablet PCs and other mobile phones. The commonly used platforms, or operating systems, on these devices are Windows Mobile, Palm, Symbian, Linux and the new mobile adapted OS X. The guidelines aim to be platform independent, but most of the examples and illustrations are from the Windows Mobile environment. The problem scope is found in the space between three main axes: user interface categories, user interface challenges and design approaches. The first two have been emphasized more than the latter. Five user interface categories have been defined: form based, icon based, document based, graphic based and repetition based user interfaces. These categories are on an abstraction level above simple components and mechanisms but within the graphical user interface paradigm. As user interface challenges go, a selection of six relatively common and often encountered challenges has been selected: switching between portrait and <b>landscape</b> <b>screen</b> orientation, software keyboard showing/hidden, content larger than its display container, finger optimized user interface, switching between stylus and finger optimized user interface and user interface able to run on equipment with different screen size. These challenges are found within the problems of utilizing screen space, flexible layout at run-time and flexible layout at design-time. For designing and developing user interface four design approaches has been selected: programming, drawing, modeling and marking up a user interface. Each of these has differing pros and cons, which are dependent on the task at hand and where in the development process one might be. Current mobile device applications have been examined. These were grouped under user interface categories and paired up against one or two selected challenges. The challenges where in most case handled in a relatively basic way. In some cases these solutions maintained usability, but far from always. Some challenges were rarely handled at all. The guidelines found and presented conform to some main principles, which are: Facilitating scrolling functionality in one form or another (e. g. Panning and Borders Facilitate Scrolling), adjust or adapt components which the user interface consists of (e. g. Struts and Straps and Simple Adaptation of Existing Components), group content differently (e. g. Group Similar Components in Tab Folders and Partial Tab Folders) and do nothing, or lock the user interface (e. g. Lock User Interface in One Orientation) ...|$|E

5000|$|In any event, the precipitating {{events were}} two incidents, one in 1207 {{and the next}} in 1220. In 1207, Go-Toba decided to {{organize}} the creation of 46 <b>landscape</b> <b>screens</b> for the Saishō Shitennō Temple which he had built in 1205 (interestingly, apparently [...] "in order to enlist divine aid in the overthrow the feudal government"); each of these screens would also have a waka on the famous landscape depicted, composed by a leading poet, who would compose the requisite 46, with the best poems for each landscape selected. Of course, Teika was asked to contribute, but one (on the [...] "Wood of Ikuta", a famous and picturesque woodland attached to the Ikuta Shrine of Settsu Province, modern-day Kobe; it was famous for being a battlefield between the Minamoto and Taira clans, {{as well as for}} its scenic beauty) was rejected by Go-Toba; not because it was a bad poem, but because it was a [...] "poor model", as Keene puts it. Teika, already annoyed by the minimal notice for the contest and the lack of time for composing the poems (he had to turn them in two days after he was first informed of the contest), began complaining about Go-Toba and attacking his poetic judgement, both with regard to the Shin Kokinshū and the poems selected from the screens. Nothing came of this incident, but nevertheless, the damage had been done.|$|R
25|$|Other {{painters}} {{were critical}} of Ōkyo's style.

Nevertheless, his style proved popular with the public, and commissions came in to do Western-style <b>landscapes,</b> decorative <b>screens,</b> and nudes. He did life drawings and used them for material in his paintings. Ōkyo was probably the first Japanese artist to do life drawings from nude models. The subject was still considered pornographic in Japan. During his career he painted for wealthy merchants, the shogunate, even the emperor.|$|R

40|$|Japanese knotweed, {{commonly}} known as crimson beauty, Mexican bamboo, Japanese fleece flower, or Reynoutria, was probably introduced to the U. S. as an ornamental. Initially useful for erosion control, as an ornamental, and for <b>landscape</b> <b>screening,</b> Japanese knotweed spreads quickly to form dense thickets that can alter natural ecosystems or interfere with landscaping. It is a semi-woody, bushy perennial {{and a member of}} the Polygonaceae (Knotweed) family. Height: Japanese knotweed can grow 1 - 3 m (3 - 10 ft) tall. Stem: The stout stems are glaucous, and erect, swelling at leaf axils. Leaves: The broadly ovate leaves are petiolate, truncate to somewhat triangular, and pointed at the tip. Length is generally 5 - 15 cm (2 - 6 in) long, and 5 - 12 cm (2 - 5 in) wide, with a prominent basal angle. Flowers: Minute greenish-white flowers appear in axillary panicles with three styles and minute stigmas. Outer sepals are narrowly winged along the midrib. Blooms August- September. Fruit: The fruiting calyxes are wing-angled, 8 - 9 mm long (0. 3 in). Achene is triangular, shiny, 3 - 4 mm (0. 1 - 0. 15 in) long. Life History Knotweed spreads rapidly from stout long rhizomes. Seeds are distributed by water in floodplains, transported with fill dirt, and to a lesser extent are wind-blown. Populations escaped from neglected gardens, and discarded cuttings are common urban paths of distribution. Once established, populations are quite persistent and can outcompete existing vegetation. Origin and Distribution Japanese knotweed, native to Japan, was introduced into the United States prior to 1890. By the turn of the century, it was established in the eastern United States and was reported naturalized around Philadelphia, PA...|$|R

The utilities were installed in connection with the exterior rehabilitation being conducted by the firm of Ford, Powell, and Carson, Architects. Five visits to the project between February and October of 1999 involved monitoring of mechanical trench excavations, selective screening of trenching backdirt, and surface collections. Monitoring of excavations and the inspection of trench profiles and contents have identified substantial disturbances on the courthouse grounds. These disturbances include utility line trenching associated with previous installations of water, sewer and electric lines, and grade modifications and introduced fill associated with <b>landscaping.</b> Selective <b>screening</b> and surface collections yielded artifacts relating to the construction and use of the three successive courthouses that have existed on the site.

40|$|This essay {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the way landscape garden locations are deployed in the film The Ruling Class (Peter Medak, 1972). It situates the film in relation to a turning point in <b>screen</b> <b>landscapes,</b> comparing it to The Go-Between (Joseph Losey, 1971). It also explores how locations were utilised as {{part of the process of}} adapting Peter Barnes's play into the film. Matching the genre hybridity of Peter Barnes???s original play, The Ruling Class pursues its protagonist???s transformation through a landscaped trajectory. The film progresses from formal to picturesque gardens, mobilising a paradigm shift in the history of English landscape architecture to deconstruct the relationship between the aristocracy and landownership. My essay considers the way in which the film thus creates a dialectics between two historical landscape styles and, in doing so, treats the gardens like the film???s other cultural references: as surfaces, pastiches detached from their provenance. It is apt that a film which attacks the aristocracy denies even the aesthetic pedigree of the ruling class???s landscapes. Despite the widespread use of the country estate as a chronotope in British cinema, there has been no other scholarly exploration of the aesthetics of such <b>screen</b> <b>landscape</b> gardens. Almost all other writing on country estates in cinema focuses on issues of ???heritage??? and dismisses shots of gardens as meretricious. My essay, however, focuses on the semantic significance of screen gardens and develops a new methodology, in which an original analysis of screen garden aesthetics is supported by: careful reference to authorities on landscape history; research of the history of the film???s locations; fieldwork which assesses the formal differences and similarities between the screen gardens and the actual country estate; research on the film???s production history and its place in the history of British country-estate cinema; and Foucault???s theory of heterotopias. The film has rarely been discussed, so the essay makes a key contribution to this collection, which is one of the first books on 1970 s British cinema...|$|R
40|$|Antikythera 1, concept/authored by awarded Finnish poet Saila Susiluoto is a tactile 2, {{interactive}} po- etry {{application for}} iPad and touchscreen tablets. It {{is based on}} the Antikythera Mechanism. A col- lection of over 200 poems across six story worlds, Antikythera is an audio-visual universe of gen- erative, experimental and game-like experience for reading poetry on screens. The app engages the reader through concepts such as non-linearity, randomness and appearing/disappearing lines that respond to the reader’s touch and sensor readings of the tablet device. As the primary designer associated with the project, my role has spanned through various stages from concept to final production.

40|$|International audienceThe light {{emission}} efficiency of (AlGaIn) N heterostructures and {{light emitting diodes}} is exceptionally high, despite the high density of threading dislocations generally found in such structures. It has become common to attribute the high efficiency to compositional fluctuations or even phase separation in the active GaInN quantum well region. The resulting localization of charge carriers is thought {{to keep them from}} recombining nonradiatively at the defects. Here, we show that carriers are mobile at room temperature rather than localized and that under suitable growth conditions hexagonal V-shaped pits decorating the defects exhibit narrow sidewall quantum wells with an effective bandgap significantly larger than that of the regular c-plane quantum wells. Thereby nature provides a unique, hitherto unrecognized mechanism generating a potential <b>landscape</b> which effectively <b>screens</b> the defects themselves by providing an energy barrier around every defect. Thus even for mobile charge carriers nonradiative recombination is effectively suppressed leading to the unexpectedly high emission efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Cancer {{screening}} procedures have brought great {{benefit to the}} public's health. However, the science of cancer screening and the evidence arising from {{research in this field}} as it is applied to policy is complex and has been difficult to communicate, especially on the national stage. We explore how epidemiologists have contributed to this evidence base and to its translation into policy. Methods: Our essay focuses on breast and lung cancer screening to identify commonalities of experience by epidemiologists across two different cancer sites and describe how epidemiologists interact with evolving scientific and policy environments. Results: We describe the roles and challenges that epidemiologists encounter according to the maturity of the data, stakeholders, and the related political context. We also explore the unique position of cancer screening as influenced by the legislative landscape where, due to recent healthcare reform, cancer screening research plays directly into national policy. Conclusions: In the complex <b>landscape</b> for cancer <b>screening</b> policy, epidemiologists can increase their impact by learning from past experiences, being well prepared and communicating effectively. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

5000|$|Homeowners {{sometimes}} {{use their}} screened porches {{in lieu of}} climate control when the latter is unavailable. For example, when the loss of electricity prevents air conditioning systems from working, a screened porch may be a cooler sleeping location. At the same time, screened porches {{can be used to}} permit an outdoors experience while being sheltered from direct sunlight and flying insects; some builders even include skylights in their designs when a porch would otherwise be excessively dark. Some people experience a sense of intimacy and quiet privacy when spending their leisure hours on a screened porch. [...] In the field of <b>landscape</b> architecture, a <b>screened</b> porch may even be used to divide surrounding gardens or lawns into smaller zones; at the Walter Gropius House in the northeastern United States, the screened porch serves as a transitional zone between a normal room of the house and a normal outdoors area, and its extended roof supports help to create the appearance of a frame around the surrounding terrain, dividing the land into multiple zones comparable to the rooms of a house.|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} since 2001, cinema has {{witnessed}} what David Butler {{refers to as}} a ‘golden age’ of fantasy film production. The majority of fantasy films released during this time have originated from British literature, and have to some extent been produced and located within Britain, showcasing a wealth of national characters, acting talent, and <b>landscapes</b> on <b>screen.</b> Yet, despite vital revisionist work conducted on British horror, science fiction and melodrama, there remains a hesitancy to embrace fantasy as a genre intrinsically connected with national cinema and domestic film production values. This thesis applies the contention that perceptions and understandings of British film and fantasy {{are influenced by the}} critical ‘writing machine’, which informs existing tensions between aesthetics, genre and film production, and also wider meanings attached to ideas around national identity and representation. However, this study argues that such discursive processes do not function as a homogenous entity and instead are prone to fluctuation across different critical sites and at different ‘moments’ in time. In order to determine how British cinema and fantasy genre are appropriated by the critical ‘writing machine’, this research adopts a historical reception studies approach to examine meanings and associations as generated by the contemporary British mainstream press in the subsequent decade since 2001 onwards. Building on work conducted by Barbara Klinger and Kate Egan, amongst others, this thesis examines a broad range of critical materials, including press reviews and film-related articles, which circulated across a national, regional and local spectrum of mainstream distribution. This research contributes to existing scholarship by investigating how the critical ‘writing machine’ operates to inform and influence cultural appropriations of British cinema and fantasy genre, and considers how these meanings can shift over time...|$|R
40|$|Following its {{introduction}} to clinical use, noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has dramatically altered the <b>landscape</b> of prenatal <b>screening.</b> Due to its high detection rate of trisomies 21, 18, and 13, along with sex chromosome aneuploidies, many patients are choosing NIPT over traditional screening and diagnostic methods. Previously, this testing was offered to women whose pregnancies were at {{an increased risk}} for aneuploidies. Now, guidelines from professional organizations recommend that NIPT should be included as a screening option for all pregnant women. Additionally, laboratories have started to expand NIPT to include microdeletions and microduplications, and are investigating the detection of monogenic disorders as well. With the rapid introduction of NIPT, surveying health care providers can help to determine how screening guidelines are being implemented in the clinical setting, {{an important aspect of}} two of the core public health functions: policy development and assurance.

40|$|Introduction: The {{pharmaceutical}} industry urgently needs {{new ways of}} profiling the safety and efficacy of new cardiovascular (CV) drugs and more effectively transitioning these compounds through the stages of CV drug screening. This article reviews new technologies and methodological innovations and assesses whether these frameworks offer improved {{solutions to the problems}} facing the contemporary CV drug development. Areas covered: The article comprises literature derived from a systematic search (from 2000 onwards) using the US patent office and ESP@CENET search engines as well as through multiple Boolean terms. The article focuses on patents relating to technologies and resources and categorises the patents according to their niche in the CV drug <b>screening</b> <b>landscape.</b> Expert opinion: The CV drug pipeline is stalling due to the inability of many contemporary drug screening frameworks to discriminate between safe, efficacious therapy and hazardous off-target effect. Given the current limitations of drug screening frameworks, there is little scope for expanding the CV drug portfolio with newer, safer drugs with improved mechanisms of action. New screening modalities are urgently needed. Searches reveal that there are few examples of truly new technologies and systems in the patent literature. This apparent failure to revamp facets of the CV drug screening process can only perpetuate the inability of current platforms to improve the CV drug pipeline. Consequently, with few exceptions, there is stagnation in pre-clinical assay design that limits the {{pharmaceutical industry}}'s ability to search for new drugs in new and more effective ways...|$|R
