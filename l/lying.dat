40|$|<b>Lie</b> {{groups of}} automorphisms of cotangent bundles of <b>Lie</b> groups are {{completely}} characterized and interesting results are obtained. We give prominence {{to the fact}} that the <b>Lie</b> groups of automorphisms of cotangent bundles of <b>Lie</b> groups are super symmetric <b>Lie</b> groups. In the cases of orthogonal <b>Lie</b> lgebras, semi-simple <b>Lie</b> algebras and compact <b>Lie</b> algebras we recover by simple methods interesting co-homological known results. The <b>Lie</b> algebra of prederivations encompasses the one of derivations as a subalgebra. We find out that <b>Lie</b> algebras of cotangent <b>Lie</b> groups (which are not semi-simple) of semi-simple <b>Lie</b> groups have the property that all their prederivations are derivations. This result is an extension of a well known result due to Müller. The structure of the <b>Lie</b> algebra of prederivations of <b>Lie</b> algebras of cotangent bundles of <b>Lie</b> groups is explored and we have shown that the <b>Lie</b> algebra of prederivations of <b>Lie</b> algebras of cotangent bundle of <b>Lie</b> groups are reductive <b>Lie</b> algebras. We have studied bi-invariant metrics on cotangent bundles of <b>Lie</b> groups and their isometries. The <b>Lie</b> algebra of the <b>Lie</b> group of isometries of a bi-invariant metric on a <b>Lie</b> group is composed with prederivations of the <b>Lie</b> algebra which are skew-symmetric with respect to the induced orthogonal structure on the <b>Lie</b> algebra. We have shown that the <b>Lie</b> group of isometries of any bi-invariant metric on the cotangent bundle of any semi-simple <b>Lie</b> groups is generated by the exponentials of inner derivations of the <b>Lie</b> cotangent algebra.
