In 1885, anticipating a bequest, the town council adopted an ordinance accepting the <b>legacy</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> of Nehemiah to be set apart as a library fund for the city. They provided a board of nine directors to have exclusive control of the fund {{for the city and}} the power to purchase, lease or construct a building that would be suitable for a library. The town council would have custody of the building and the grounds and they would appoint suitable librarians and assistants and decide how much they would be paid.|$|E

He transferred to the ward of Bassishaw in 1559, vacant {{by the death of}} alderman John Machell, and embarked upon his third term as Master of the Drapers' Company.
