Sera from HIV- 1 - or HIV- 2 -infected subjects provided the antibody, and lymphocytes from normal donors provided the effector cells. About 60 % of HIV- 1 antibody-positive sera mediated ADCC when tested against any given HIV- 1 isolate-infected target cell (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type IIIB, B 40, A 2587), and about 75 % of HIV- 2 antibody-positive sera mediated ADCC when tested against target cells infected with HIV- 2 isolates (<b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus type 2 and SBL- 6669) or simian immunodeficiency virus from macaques. Within each type, individual sera showed different reactivity patterns, and the probability that a serum was ADCC positive was higher when it was tested against several strains. When the ADCC reactivity of sera against different strains was compared, diversity as detected by ADCC appeared to be greater among HIV- 1 strains than among HIV- 2 strains.

In contrast, it does not bind, or weakly binds, the envelope of four heterologous HIV isolates and does not neutralize heterologous isolates HTLV-IIIRF and HTLV-IIIMN. The antibody-binding site was mapped to a 24 -amino-acid segment, using recombinant and synthetic segments of HTLV-IIIB gp 120.

40|$|The {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) {{is thought}} to result from infection of T cells by a pathogenic human retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus (LAV). In this report, we describe the antiviral effects of a thymidine analogue, 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (BW A 509 U), which, as a triphosphate, inhibits the reverse transcriptase of HTLV-III/LAV. This agent blocks {{the expression of the}} p 24 gag protein of HTLV-III/LAV in H 9 cells following exposure to virus. The drug also inhibits the cytopathic effect of HTLV-IIIB (a virus derived from a pool of American patients) and HTLV-III/RF-II (an isolate obtained from a Haitian patient that differs by about 20 % in the amino acid sequence of the envelope gene from several isolates of HTLV-III/LAV, including HTLV-IIIB, analyzed so far). 3 '-Azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine also completely blocks viral replication as assessed by reverse transcriptase production in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to HTLV-IIIB.

40|$|The new {{antiviral}} agent, azidothymidine (AZT; BW A 509 U), {{is currently}} the only successful drug in use for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The effect of this thymidine analog, 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine, on the replication of the <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus strain of the human immunodeficiency virus was evaluated by using susceptible H 9 and Jurkat cells. Cells were pretreated with concentrations of drug ranging from 0. 5 to 100 microM, infected, and maintained in medium containing drug. Virus production was assayed by reverse transcriptase assays, and virus-specific DNA was analyzed by Southern blots probed with cloned human immunodeficiency virus sequences. At 4 to 8 days postinfection, infected cells without drug reached a peak of reverse transcriptase activity that was sustained. Increasing concentrations of AZT caused increasing delays in virus production; however, replicate cultures at nontoxic levels of the drug (up to 25 microM) eventually produced as much virus as did non-drug-treated infected cells, despite the continued presence of the drug. Levels of intracellular, unintegrated, virus-specific DNA paralleled reverse transcriptase levels. Virus-caused cytopathic effect was likewise delayed in drug-treated cultures.

In direct comparisons of serial dilutions of <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus type 1, the antigen assay was 100 -fold more sensitive than the reverse transcriptase assay in detecting the virus. The antigen assay reacted strongly with 60 different HIV isolates but did not cross-react with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type II, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus type 5, or poliovirus type 1 or with extracts from four different control human cell lines and eight different phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes. Peripheral blood lymphocyte samples from 50 individuals were evaluated by both the antigen assay and the reverse transcriptase assay. The cells from the 34 seropositive individuals were all positive by the antigen assay (range, 3 to 9 days; average time, 5. 9 days) and the reverse transcriptase assay (range, 7 to 16 days; average time, 9. 6 days).

40|$|The {{etiologic}} {{agent for the}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is now firmly established as the retrovirus termed the human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or the <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus, LAV. The disease is characterized by profound and progressive loss of immunity, but molecular evidence indicates {{that only a few}} cells in peripheral blood are being productively infected with this virus. In the present study we have investigated a disrupted HTLV-III viral preparation for biologic effects on normal lymphoid cells. Relatively dilute concentrations of this preparation were found to stimulate immunoglobulin secretion by peripheral blood lymphocytes; at the same dosages, the preparation was inhibitory for the B-cell differentiation responses that are induced with other known polyclonal B-cell activators, pokeweed mitogen, Staphylococcus aureus, and Epstein-Barr virus. This preparation was also inhibitory at high concentrations for T-lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytomitogens and antigens and resulted in a reduced expression of Tac antigen on phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes. Paradoxically, incubation of lymphocytes of certain healthy donors with the HTLV-III preparation alone resulted in increased expression of Tac and Leu- 12 antigens. These findings show that a disrupted preparation of HTLV-III virus can mimic many of the immunologic abnormalities present in patients with HTLV-III infection. Nonviable viral proteins may be responsible for some of the immunologic perturbations that occur in HTLV-III-infected states...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus 1 (HIV- 1) nef gene encoded by the HIV- 1 isolate <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus type 1 was expressed in Escherichia coli {{under the control of}} the tac promoter. The protein is found mainly in the soluble part of the bacterial lysate; a simple two-column purification scheme has been developed allowing isolation of the recombinant protein without using denaturing agents. Analysis of the circular dichroism spectra reveals that the purified protein is folded and has a helix content of 16 % and a beta-pleated sheet content of 31 %. GTPase activity and binding of guanine nucleotides were measured for Nef and compared with the results obtained under identical experimental conditions for p 21 rasC, which represents a typical, well-characterized guanine-nucleotide-binding (GNB) protein. Within the limits of error, native Nef does not show GTPase activity and does not bind guanine nucleotides strongly (association constant, Kass less than 5 x 10 (3) M- 1). An upper limit for the association constant of Nef for ATP was determined by equilibrium dialysis as 5 x 10 (3) M- 1. Nef can be autophosphorylated by ATP; under the experimental conditions used, 1 - 2 % of the protein become phosphorylated. Correspondingly, our Nef preparation shows a low, but significant, ATPase activity. In conclusion, Nef is not a member of the GNB protein family, but a possible role as a protein kinase cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|Acquired immune {{deficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is characterized}} by opportunistic infections and by 'opportunistic neoplasms' (for example, Kaposi's sarcoma). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is epidemiologically associated with AIDS, especially in male homosexuals. A subset of T lymphocytes positive for the CD 4 antigen (also termed T 4 antigen), is depleted in AIDS and PGL patients. A retrovirus found in T-cell cultures from these patients is strongly implicated in the aetiology of AIDS {{because of the high}} frequency of isolation and the prevalence of specific antibodies in the patients. Here we have detected cell-surface receptors for the AIDS retrovirus (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus- 1 (LAV- 1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD 4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD 4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD 4 + cells with HTLV-III or LAV- 1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD 4. In contrast, receptors for HTLV-I and HTLV-II were not restricted to CD 4 + cells, were not blocked by anti-CD 4 antibodies; cells productively infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II expressed surface CD 4. Hence, we conclude that the CD 4 antigen is an essential and specific component of the receptor for the causative agent of AIDS...|$|E

However, in 18 out of the 335 patients (5. 37 %), a sharp increase in B cells exceeding 20 % and 300 /mm 3 was observed. This increase in B cells was mainly accounted for CD 5 -CD 19 + B cell subpopulations and was associated with: (i) evolution of the disease, since only four patients presented it at their first consultation (one <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> syndrome (LAS) and three AIDS); (ii) advanced stages of disease since, at the time of B cell augmentation, two patients were staged as LAS, four as ARC and 12 as AIDS; (iii) a high incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) since three out of the 18 patients presented a histologically confirmed NHL and three others a clinical pattern compatible with this diagnosis. However, in three patients with B hyperlymphocytosis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement revealed the existence of a polyclonal expansion of B cells. These results justify inclusion of a pan-B cell marker in routine phenotypic studies of HIV-infected individuals, as well as the search for NHL among patients presenting this abnormality...|$|E

Cultures infected with virus for 2 h were treated with clinically achievable concentrations of AZT, ddC, or a 3 -day-alternating regimen of AZT and ddC. Media were completely changed every 3 days and replaced with antiviral agent, and virus production was assayed by p 24 antigen and virus-specific DNA. Cells treated with no antiviral agent exhibited breakthrough infection by day 6 in culture, whereas cells treated with 0. 1, 1. 0, or 3. 0 microM AZT had a prolonged time to viral breakthrough. For each regimen of AZT alternating with 0. 05 or 0. 1 microM ddC, there was consistently prolonged HIV inhibition compared with continuous treatment with AZT alone. The viral suppression achieved with the alternating combinations required AZT as well as ddC and was superior to 3 days of treatment with ddC alternating with 3 days of no antiretroviral treatment. Levels of unintegrated HIV DNA paralleled the detection of p 24 antigen, with the most prolonged {{inhibition of}} virus-specific DNA occurring with AZT alternating with ddC (compared with all regimens except continuous treatment with ddC).

The aim {{of the present study}} was to further examine the influences exercised by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; formerly called human T-lymphotropic virus type III or <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus, HTLV-III/LAV) on normal human B lymphocytes. An unfractionated protein preparation, made from HIV purified by density gradient centrifugation, was previously shown to induce differentiation of normal human B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. In the present analyses, this B-lymphocyte response peaked on day 6 or 7 after culture initiation and was found to be independent of the requirement for monocytes but to require T cells. Responses could also be elicited in cultures of purified B cells by the addition of T cells that had been exposed to HIV antigen. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (puromycin and cycloheximide) abrogated the responses. In contrast to its stimulatory effects, the same virus preparation was previously shown to inhibit polyclonal responses that are normally elicited in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures by a T-dependent stimulus (pokeweed mitogen) and T-independent stimulus (Epstein-Barr virus). The present studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of the HIV antigen studied herein are targeted primarily at the B lymphocytes. The role of T lymphocytes in the HIV antigen-mediated inhibitory effects, although demonstrated, could not be conclusively established as an essential pathway. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which components of HIV exert stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on human B lymphocytes and thereby lead to the dysfunction of these cells in HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} established human monocytic {{cell line}} Mono Mac 6 expressing distinct characteristics of mature monocytes/macrophages was tested for its susceptibility to infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Inoculation {{of the cells}} with the T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus strains human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB and <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus type 2 led to a noncytopathic productive infection becoming apparent only after a latency period of up to 56 days. The infectibility of the Mono Mac 6 cells was dependent on low levels of CD 4 expression, as demonstrated by blocking experiments with various CD 4 -specific antibodies. Increasing with time after infection (greater than 200 days), the cultured Mono Mac 6 cells released virus variants which showed shortened latency periods when passaged onto uninfected Mono Mac 6 cells. Also, cytopathogenicity for several CD 4 + T cells of the Mono Mac 6 -derived virus was drastically increased; thus, the infection of the H 9 cell line with low doses of virus (less than 0. 1 50 % tissue culture infective dose per cell) led to giant syncytium formation within 1 day and subsequent death of all fused cells. We propose Mono Mac 6 cells as a new model {{for the study of}} human immunodeficiency virus infecting the monocyte/macrophage lineage, particularly with regard to virus-host cell interaction and the influence of cell differentiation and activation on latency and development of virulence. The human immunodeficiency virus-infected Mono Mac 6 cell may also serve as a valuable tool for in vitro testing of antiviral therapies...|$|E
40|$|Two glycopolypeptides with {{molecular}} weights 160000 and 120000 (gpl 20) {{are regularly}} recognized by {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -specific antisera in lysates of cells persistently infected with HIV. In the present study, gpl 20 was characterized asthe major envelope glycopolypeptide of HIV. Gpl 20 was identified as the external viral glycoprotein by radiosequencing and by its presence in purified virus. However gpl 20 was predominantly shed as a soluble protein into the culture fluid. Furthermore gpl 20 was precipitated by sera from horses infected with equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV), but not by sera from uninfected animals. This may indicate conserved epitopes common to the envelopes of HIV and EIAV. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in man {{is caused by a}} retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) previously named <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus (LAV), human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or AIDS-associated retrovirus (Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983; Gallo et al., 1984; Levy et al., 1984). HIV is related to visna virus of sheep (Gonda et al., 1985), to equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) (Montagnier et al., 1984), caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (Chiu et al., 1985), and simian immunodeficiency viruses (Daniel et al., 1985; Kanki et al., 1985; Schneider et al., 1986) which are members of the subfamily of lentiviruses within the family of retroviruses. Like lentiviruses of ungulates HIV is transmitted easily as a virus particle both in vivo (Evatt et al., 1985) and in vitro (Popovic et al., 1984), whereas HTLV-I and HTLV-II, human retroviruses from the subfamily of oncornavir-uses, are transmitted more efficiently by cell-to-cell contact (Miyoshi et al., 1981;Chen et al. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{antiretroviral}} agent, 2 '-beta-fluoro- 2 ', 3 '-dideoxyadenosine (FddA), is an acid-stable compound whose triphosphate form is {{a potent}} reverse transcriptase inhibitor with in vitro anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (hu-PBL-SCID mice) provide a useful small-animal model for HIV research. In the present study we utilized this experimental system for the in vivo evaluation of the anti-HIV activity of this new compound when administered prior to infection. Initial studies revealed that, following a challenge with 50 100 % tissue culture infective doses of HIV type 1 <b>lymphadenopathy-associated</b> virus, 39 of 42 (93 %) control mice developed HIV infection, as evidenced by positive coculture or positive PCR. Administration of zidovudine decreased the infection rate to 5 of 16 (31 %), while administration of FddA decreased the infection rate to 0 of 44 (0 %). In follow-up controlled studies, the anti-HIV activity of FddA was confirmed, with 18 of 20 control mice showing evidence of HIV infection, compared with 4 of 20 FddA-treated mice. In addition to having direct anti-HIV effects, FddA {{was found to have}} a protective effect on human CD 4 + T cells in the face of HIV infection. Mice treated with FddA were found to have a significantly higher percentage of CD 4 + T cells than controls (10. 3 % +/- 3. 4 % versus 0. 27 % +/- 0. 21 %; P = 0. 01). Thus, FddA, with its potent anti-HIV activity in vivo, high oral bioavailability, long intracellular half-life, and ability to preserve CD 4 + cells in the presence of HIV, appears to be a promising agent for clinical investigation...|$|E
