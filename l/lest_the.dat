5|$|By 21:00, {{heavy rain}} was falling which helped {{disguise}} the withdrawal. The heavy bombardment commenced and the units {{began to fall}} back to the river. Half of the engineers' boats were too far west to be used (43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation process. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing {{it to be a}} resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci {{refused to}} copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering {{portrait}} of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness {{to be based on}} the work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly sacked. The Mint did not dismiss him, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint for the rest of his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.|$|E
50|$|After the {{backbone}} network of <b>the</b> <b>LESt</b> was developed, <b>the</b> company built only shorter extensions at various extremities {{and the town}} center. Issues related to the struggle between competing tramway enterprises proved burdensome to the local authority, and so merger of the companies was sought during the First World War. This was accomplished from 1 January 1917, when <b>the</b> <b>LESt</b> was absorbed by its larger competitor, the GLSt.|$|R

6000|$|Let us keep to {{the terms}} we began with; <b>lest</b> by <b>the</b> {{changing}} of words [...] we make a change of ideas, and alter the very state of the question.|$|R
5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to burn through, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> log break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
60|$|Surely if ever a boy {{had been}} warned of coming danger I was that one, and the great fear in my mind was <b>lest</b> at <b>the</b> {{critical}} moment I fail to do my duty.|$|R
60|$|Then, folding {{his arms}} on his naked breast, he {{appeared}} to summon his energy, <b>lest,</b> in <b>the</b> scene that he knew must follow, his manhood might be betrayed into some act unworthy of his name.|$|R
6000|$|Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow {{railway station}} that evening, above the luggage-scales: 'I feared <b>lest</b> at <b>the</b> last, the roof would fall upon me and cheat me. It is indeed all finished, O my father?' ...|$|R
5|$|Federalist state legislatures, {{primarily}} those {{north of}} the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt {{a second set of}} resolutions affirming the first, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> lack of a reply be seen acquiescence. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives {{at the outset of the}} 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially the endorsement of nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{for infants}} or adults, all rites omitted at baptism must be {{afterwards}} supplied.

The same is to be said of those baptized in danger of death by laymen.|$|E
25|$|For Camus, {{the beauty}} people {{encounter}} in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning {{in their own}} lives, {{which may not be}} the objective meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.|$|E

25|$|In my judgment, U.S. {{involvement}} in Zaire defies justification. It {{is true that}} the U.S. has not utilized the full measure of resources available for Zaire, nor responded to Mobutu's requests for arms and ammunition. This restraint by the Administration is commendable, but if Mobutu qualifies for neither arms nor ammunition, then he should not qualify for any form of military assistance, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> United States be drawn into the hapless conflict in Zaire, inch by inch.|$|E
25|$|One {{of their}} kings {{tried to make}} a canal to it (for it would have been of no little {{advantage}} to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris {{is said to have been}} the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, stopped making the canal, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> sea should mix with the river water and spoil it.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Christianity it {{is common}} to hang {{decorated}} common ostrich eggs on the chains holding the oil lamps. The initial reason was probably to prevent mice and rats from climbing down the chain to eat the oil. Another, symbolical explanation is based in the fictitious tradition that female common ostriches do not sit on their eggs, but stare at them incessantly until they hatch out, because if they stop staring even for a second the egg will addle. This is equated to the obligation of the Christian to direct his entire attention towards God during prayer, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> prayer be fruitless.|$|E

25|$|But Ranjit Singh {{hesitated to}} act upon their advice, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> Mirza should compel him to {{surrender}} unconditionally, by detaining her in Mughal camp. One night he escaped {{with a few}} friends, leaving Kumher to its fate. Next morning the Muslim troops scaled {{the walls of the}} fort and overpowered the defenders. Rani Kishori fell prisoner into their hands and was taken with all honour to the camp of Nawab. In obedience to his orders his officers erected lofty and secluded tents for her residence and well trained servants were appointed to wait upon her, in hopes that after a few days her grief might subdue.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September, {{the fleet}} under Mahmud Pasha {{arrived at the}} island, docking in the harbour of St. George. Niccolò sent envoys to enquire as to the reason for their presence, since he had kept up the payment of tribute. Mahmud Pasha replied by {{demanding}} the surrender of Mytilene and the entire island. Mehmed himself crossed over with his army to the island via Agiasmati, and repeated his demand to Niccolò, but the latter replied that he would submit only by force. Mahmud Pasha then persuaded the Sultan to return to Anatolia and leave the siege to him, <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> Venetian fleet cut him off on Lesbos.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2008, Viacom {{compromised}} {{to protect}} YouTube users' personal data in their $1billion copyright lawsuit. Google agreed it will anonymize user information and internet protocol addresses from its YouTube subsidiary before handing the data over to Viacom. The privacy deal also applied to other litigants including the FA Premier League, the Rodgers & Hammerstein {{organization and the}} Scottish Premier League. The deal however did not extend the anonymity to employees, because Viacom wishes to prove that Google staff {{are aware of the}} uploading of illegal material to the site. The parties therefore will further meet on the matter <b>lest</b> <b>the</b> data be made available to the court.|$|E
