Of 326 organisms from species capable of p-lactamase induction, induction was shown in 68 % and was predictable from the cefoxitin-sensitivity and identification data. No induction of P-lactamase occurred in the remaining species. A comparison of p-lactamase activities against cefotaxime, cefoperazone and <b>latamoxef</b> showed that induction of enzyme activity against cefotaxime and cefoperazone occurred at similar rates. Induction of activity against <b>latamoxef</b> did not occur or was minimal with three bacterial species.

40|$|Mechanisms {{responsible}} for resistance to β-Iactam antibiotics were investigated in clinical isolates of Bacteroides spp., {{the most common}} anaerobic Gram negative pathogen. Among 108 isolates of Bacteroides spp. obtained from clinical material in Nottingham, 69 (64 %) were identified as Bacteroides fragilis. Approximately one-fifth of the Bacteroides spp. produced elevated levels of β-Iactamases, {{and many of these}} strains showed increased resistance to β-Iactam antibiotics usually regarded as β-Iactamase stable. Four β-Iactamase types were identified: Type one was represented by zinc dependent metallo-β-lactamases that hydrolysed cefoxitin, <b>latamoxef</b> and imipenem. Type two displayed intermediate to high specific activity in tests with nitrocefin as substrate and hydrolysed cefoxitin and <b>latamoxef,</b> but not imipenem. Type three exhibited intermediate levels of specific activity and caused reduced susceptibility to cefoxitin, <b>latamoxef</b> and imipenem, although they hydrolysed these antibiotics inefficiently. Type four probably represented enhanced production of the β-Iactamases characteristic of most bacteroides strains. Organisms producing this enzyme normally remained susceptible to cefoxitin, <b>latamoxef</b> and imipenem, and the enzyme was fully susceptible to β-Iactamase inhibitors, including clavulanic acid. Several strains were detected that exhibited reduced susceptibility to imipenem that was not related to metallo-β-Iactamases production. In contrast, one strain that produced a metallo-β-lactamase remained fully sensitive to imipenem as judged by conventional titration. Investigation of isolates producing metallo-β-lactamase and several similar ones encountered in an earlier study showed a correlation between the degree of resistance to imipenem and specific imipenemase activity. In an attempt to elucidate reduced susceptibilty to imipenem that was not related to metallo-β-lactamase production, cell envelope properties and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of selected strains were investigated. Studies of outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide composition of B. fragilis strains unexpectedly showed that metallo-β-Iactamase producers displayed unusual cell envelope profiles. Those strains that showed reduced susceptibility that was not associated with β-Iactamase appeared to be normal, although two of these strains displayed abnormally high crypticity values. Between three and six PBPs were visualised in tests with 3 H-benzylpenicillin. PBPs 1 to 3 were present in all strains, but were observed in imipenem-resistant strains only when tests were carried out in the presence of β-lactamase inhibitors. Competitive binding experiments indicated that imipenem showed affinity for the high molecular weight PBPs of sensitive B. fragilis. The low molecular weight PBPs 4 to 6 were detected intermittently and only in certain strains, notably those that exhibited reduced susceptibility to imipenem. PBP 6 was found only in strains showing non-enzymic resistance. The results suggest that several different types of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics are circulating in clinical isolates of Bacteroides spp. in Nottingham: firstly, strains that produce a metallo-β-lactamase that hydrolyses 'β-lactamase-stable' compounds, including imipenem; secondly, strains producing enzymes that hydrolyse cefoxitin and <b>latamoxef,</b> but not imipenem; thirdly, strains that possess a permeability barrier that affects imipenem as well as other β-Iactam antibiotics; fourthly, strains with altered penicillin-binding proteins; and fifthly strains that produce raised amounts of 'normal' β-lactamase. The latter strains slowly hydrolyse imlpenem and other β-lactam compounds and this may be a factor in the reduced susceptibility to these agents. Clinical isolates that possess these resistance mechanisms may appear susceptible according to conventional break-point criteria in vitro. Never the less, they exhibit considerably reduced susceptibility to β-Iactam agents and the therapeutic implications of this need investigating. At present such strains represent a relatively small proportion of clinical isolates of Bacteroides spp., but the prevalence of resistance needs to be carefully monitored...|$|E

In {{this era of}} antibiotics resistance, a revival of old antibiotics is now featured. We examined the clinical usefulness of <b>latamoxef</b> (LMOX) {{for the treatment of}} S. maltophilia infection. Patients and methods: The observational study was retrospectively performed at Okayama University Hospital (Okayama, Japan) from January 2011 to December 2013. LMOX was administered to 12 patients with S. maltophilia infection, with eleven of those patients being admitted to the intensive care unit. Results: Underlying conditions of the patients included postoperation, hematological transplantation, hepatic transplantation, and burn. Major infectious foci were surgical site infection (six cases), respiratory infection (four cases), blood stream infection (three cases), and burn site infection (one case). The doses of LMOX administered ranged from 1 g/d to 3 g/d for ten adult patients and from 40 mg/kg/d to 80 mg/kg/d for two pediatric patients. Microbiologic failure was seen in five (41. 7 %) of 12 cases, and 30 -day and hospital mortality rates were 25 % and 50 %, respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of LMOX were higher in the deceased group (4 – 64 µg/mL) than in the surviving group (1 – 4 µg/mL).

The opposite pattern was found with one strain (NCTC 10257) on Mueller-Hinton agar. This strain behaved inconsistently on Iso-Sensitest agar. Previous studies have shown that medium-dependent susceptibility in X. maltophilia is not related to /J-lactamase expression. The present study demonstrated that 22 and 25 kDa outer membrane proteins were induced on media with higher nutrient concentrations. The possible relationship of these proteins to sensitivity is considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-vitro}} {{activity of}} 24 /Mactam antibiotics was compared using {{three groups of}} pneumococci and an agar dilution method comprising 100 penicillin-susceptible, 100 intermediately penicillin-resistant, and 100 highly penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains. Our results show that intermediately penicillin-resistant and highly peni-cillin-resistant pneumococci had decreased sensitivity to other 0 -lactam agents. According to their relative in-vitro activity, the antimicrobials were classified into three groups. The first group included drugs more active than penicillin (imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefpirome), which could be useful {{for the treatment of}} infections due to penicillin-resistant strains. The second group showed slightly lesser activity than did penicillin, and included: ampicillin, cefdinir, cef-uroxime, cefoperazone, azkxallin, mezlocillin, piperatilh'n, cephalothin, and cefa-mandole. The remaining antibiotics (oxacillin, cefixime, ceftizoxime, cefetamet, cefaclor, ceflazidime, cefoxitin, cefonicid, and <b>latamoxef)</b> showed poor activity against penicillin-resistant strains, precluding their use for empirical treatment in areas with a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant strains...|$|E
40|$|Nearly all m-vitro kinetic models {{hitherto}} employed only consider serum concentration {{curves of}} the antibiotic. Data thus obtained at best reflect {{the situation in}} septicaemia. However, they are not applicable for infections where infecting bacteria are not localized within the blood. This paper presents a method for calculating {{the time course of}} the non-protein bound drug in tissue water The concept makes use of serum concentration curves, the extent of serum protein binding and the peak time of total drug concentration in the tissue. This is practicable since all data necessary for calculation are available experimentally Using cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, <b>latamoxef</b> (moxalactam) and ceftriaxone as examples, the vast differences between the total concentration of the antibiotic in serum and the concentration of the non-protein bound antibiotic in the tissue water are demonstrated. Therefore, only the results of in-vitro experiments, which are based on time courses of the non-protein bound drug in the tissue water, are considered relevant for assessing therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic...|$|E
40|$|Bacteroides fragilis strains TAL 2480 and TAL 3636 {{were used}} to assess outer {{membrane}} permeability to various /J-lactam compounds. These strains were chosen because they possess /j-lactamases capable of hydrolysing all commonly employed /Mactams except monobactams. The /Mactamases are located in the periplasmic space and could be released by sonication and osmotic shock. Permeability was calculated by the method of Zimmerman & Rosselet (1977, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 12, 368 - 72). The rank ordeT of penneative ability (from fastest to slowest) was as follows: cephaloridine, imipenem, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefoperazone, nitrocefin, cephalothin, and <b>latamoxef.</b> Our results showed that ionic charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular weight influenced /Mactam drug uptake by B. fragilis. These results are similar to findings for Escherichia coli, where increased negative charge and increased molecular weight are associated with decreased drug uptake. However, unlike E. coli, increased drug hydrophobicity, for a given charge and molecular weight of the drug, was associated with increased uptake by B. fragilis...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{bacterial}} meningitis continues to cause substantial mortality and morbidity despite {{the advent of}} new antimicrobial agents and of modern intensive care facilities. In Dallas, the case-fatality rate for {{bacterial meningitis}} in newborn and young infants is 17 % (40 of 231 patients). Three pathogens, Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes, accounted for 84 % of the causative agents. Although new / 9 -lactam antibiotics have been extensively evaluated in experimental meningitis due to these pathogens, there is limited clinical experience from which to judge efficacy and safety. Currently, conventional therapy with ampicillin and an amino-glycoside should be used as initial empirical therapy for neonatal meningitis. Once the pathogen has been identified and the susceptibilities determined, the most appropriate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics can be selected. <b>Latamoxef</b> (moxalactam) and cefotaxime are highly active agents in vitro against Gram-negative enteric bacilli and may prove useful for therapy of meningitis due to those organisms. Additional experience with these compounds is required {{before they can be}} recom-mended for routine use...|$|E
