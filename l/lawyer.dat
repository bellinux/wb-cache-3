The Worlds Cause <b>Lawyers</b> Make: Structure and Agency in Legal Practice adds to that {{growing body of research}} by examining the connections between <b>lawyers</b> and causes, the settings in which cause <b>lawyers</b> practice, and the ways they marshal social capital and make strategic decisions. The book describes the constraints to cause <b>lawyering</b> and the particulars that shape what cause <b>lawyers</b> do and what cause <b>lawyering</b> can be, while also focusing on the dynamic interactions of cause <b>lawyers</b> and the legal, professional, and political contexts in which they operate. It presents a constructivist view of cause <b>lawyering,</b> analyzing what cause <b>lawyers</b> do in their day-to-day work, how they do it, and what difference their work makes.
