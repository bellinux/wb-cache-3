5|$|Since <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> demand {{ambulances}} {{be marked}} {{with one of}} the Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount offensive weapons, military ambulances are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as non-combatants; however, this application does not always exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. The <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.|$|E
5|$|American {{experts in}} {{military}} law {{agreed that the}} 1950 events violated the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> prohibiting targeting of noncombatants, but said that prosecuting ex-soldiers a half-century later was a practical impossibility. Nevertheless, Army Secretary Caldera said early in the investigation that he couldn't rule out prosecutions, a statement that survivors later complained may have deterred some 7th Cavalry veterans from testifying.|$|E

5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> at the time {{did not apply to}} them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Alps, 154 French {{soldiers}} were {{captured by the}} Italians.

However, this designation has not always protected hospital ships from enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|The report, {{released}} on 15 September 2009, concluded {{that both sides}} had committed violations of the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> It stated that Israel had used disproportionate force, targeted Palestinian civilians, used them as human shields and destroyed civilian infrastructure.

5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations of the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> as civilians {{were caught in the}} ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E
5|$|Three JNA officers, Mile Mrkšić; Veselin Šljivančanin; and Miroslav Radić, {{were indicted}} by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on {{multiple}} counts {{of crimes against}} humanity and violations of the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> having surrendered or been captured during 2002 and 2003. On 27 September 2007, Mrkšić was sentenced by the ICTY to 20 years' imprisonment for murder and torture, and Šljivančanin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charges of torture. Radić was acquitted. Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal, then reduced again to ten years after a second appeal, and he was granted early release in July 2011.

40|$|After September 11, 2001, {{additions}} and {{modifications to}} federal law placed renewed {{focus on the}} ability of the government to prosecute American citizens for extraterritorial misconduct that violates the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> This Note argues that federal laws, in their totality, provide the ability to prosecute American citizens who violate the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> while outside the territorial limits of the United States. Although the scope of prosecutable offenses under the War Crimes Act is limited, other federal laws present prosecutors with multiple options for bringing an American citizen to justice in either a federal court or military court-mardal for a violation <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The cases <b>of</b> United States v. Passam and United Stales v. Green demonstrate that Americans who violate the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> can be, and have been, prosecuted by using means other than the War Crimes Act. This Note highlights deficiencies, however, in federal laws that create circumstances where immunity from prosecution exists for certain assaults that violate the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The Note then concludes with recommendations for congressional action to change federal law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to fix existing deficiencies and strengthen the ability of the U. S. government to hold American citizens accountable for extraterritorial misconduct that violates the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the conflict's {{early months}} it {{appeared}} that Gaddafi's government—with its greater fire-power—would be victorious. Both sides disregarded the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the United Arab Emirates provided the NTC with weaponry and training. NATO {{announced that it would}} enforce the no-fly zone. On 30 April a NATO air strike killed Gaddafi's sixth son and three of his grandsons in Tripoli.|$|E
