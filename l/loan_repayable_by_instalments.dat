50|$|From about 1985, {{like many}} other banks, Takugin opened {{branches}} in Tokyo and Osaka, and became concerned with real estate. In ordinary banking activity,finance is not provided above the 70% of real estate value, {{but at the time}} of the bubble it was foreseen that land values would rise steeply, so real estate financing was offered at 120-130% of value. Many credit facilities at this time were taking a similar form of finance, but Takugin had been somewhat slow off the mark. It therefore had to set collateral at a lower precedence than the collateral which had been already given to other credit providers. This meant that the part of the <b>loan</b> <b>repayable</b> to Takugin would be less if the borrowing real estate company were to go bankrupt. Ultimately, this is exactly what was to happen.|$|R
