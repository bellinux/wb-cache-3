40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{treatment}} of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> in deceased estates {{and the effect}} thereof on marriages in community of property {{is the cause of}} various problems for executors. In terms of section 3 (3) of the Estate Duty Act 45 of 1955 <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets of the deceased. Consequently <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the estate duty addendum of the deceased estate. <b>Life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> however are not always reflected in the liquidation account of the deceased estate as assets, notwithstanding the fact that <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets for estate duty purposes. In this regard a distinction should be made between two situations: firstly where <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured estate and secondly where <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured. For spouses married in community of property this creates a problem especially when you keep in mind that <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are in many instances a person's biggest monetary asset. When <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has a claim on half of the <b>policy</b> proceeds. When <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has no claim on the policy proceeds. The problem that arises in this regard {{is that there is no}} certainty as to what extent <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> should be included in the calculation of estate duty, and how these policies must be reflected in the estate of the deceased. This uncertainty has been perpetuated by courts. This research will illustrate how the courts came to different conclusions where the facts were more or less similar. Master...|$|R

5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy,</b> as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E
