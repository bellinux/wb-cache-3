Benedetti may have worked {{in collaboration with the}} Castellani brothers of Rome, who were leading goldsmiths in classical styles, and collectors and dealers in antiquities. Moevs, an authority on Roman pottery, claims that the images on the cup derive from fragments of several scenes on Greek and Roman ceramics, including some in the Castellani collection, which were combined and modified to create the scenes on the Warren cup. An appendix to that article by silversmith Claudio Franchi provides corroborating technical evidence.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to design a cruise ship {{terminal}} and urban waterfront master plan for the settlement of Lyttelton. My design acknowledges the existing environment and historic urban form but does so in a contemporary design solution. This is a two level solution that has first identified and addressed problems in the existing urban fabric and restored connections to the historic waterfront. Secondly it has delivered an iconic design for a new cruise ship terminal, aimed at generating public support for a well designed solution. I have studied a wide written history of Lyttelton’s architecture and settlement {{to understand how the}} existing urban fabric and architectural styles have evolved to what exists today. I have studied literature from various sources, including Sir Miles Warren and Peter Beaven, who are widely considered as authorities on Canterbury architecture. Their responses to designing contemporary buildings in a historic fabric are of interest to my design problem. I undertook a chronological / evolutionary investigation to comprehend the evolution of Lyttelton’s urban development and architecture. This enabled me to understand how the local conditions produced the current urban layout and architectural typologies and then appropriately respond in a contemporary design. This methodology ensured that my design is appropriate for, and acknowledges, the character of Lyttelton. The site has been carefully selected to ensure good urban connections between the township and its waterfront. I concluded in my historical investigation that there exists a history of <b>liberty</b> in <b>style</b> in Lyttelton enabling a contemporary design response. To answer my research question, the design acknowledged the historic nature and urban character of Lyttelton, not through style but in appropriate massing in a tentative master plan that reflects the urban town, pattern and scale...|$|R
40|$|Essa pesquisa desenvolve um olhar sobre a obra poÃtica de Arnaldo Antunes e sua histÃria de leituras, atravÃs de um sistema complexo de relaÃÃes, onde se misturam escrituras variadas. Para compreender melhor como suas idÃias sÃo construÃdas e articuladas procuramos aproximar sua produÃÃo poÃtica de tendÃncias artÃsticas surgidas no inÃcio do sÃculo XX, que operaram uma mudanÃa profunda nas artes e na cultura, que perduraram durante todo o sÃculo e ainda estÃo presentes na produÃÃo artÃstica contemporÃnea deste e de outros poetas. AtravÃs desse percurso, procuramos descobrir os modelos que lhe serviram de inspiraÃÃo e marcas da histÃria de leitura que nos permite ler os processos de influÃncia, desleitura, apropriaÃÃo, escritura, e a forma como essas categorias poÃticas estÃo reconfiguradas num trabalho de superaÃÃo, no objetivo de atingir autonomia literÃria. O corpo teÃrico se estabelece a partir de autores como Pierre Bourdieu, Dominique Maingueneau, Harold Bloom, Roland Barthes e mais um suporte de outros autores. Verificamos que o alto nÃvel de desenvolvimento cientÃfico e tecnolÃgico atingido pelas sociedades modernas provoca novos ordenamentos sociais, exigindo tambÃm uma renovaÃÃo das prÃticas sociais contemporÃneas. Sendo assim, a identidade de um sujeito desta mesma sociedade vai se revelar no {{interior}} dos sistemas de representaÃÃo e na forma como ele se deixa representar. No movimento de interaÃÃo com vÃrios campos do conhecimento, no contÃgio incessante com vÃrios cÃdigos de linguagem, Arnaldo Antunes demonstra que a leitura da tradiÃÃo aparece como uma revitalizaÃÃo da arte, que se opÃe Ã banalidade e Ã materialidade do mundo contemporÃneo e os ganhos tÃcnicos e experimentais sÃo contribuiÃÃes que dÃo desenvolvimento e orientam os rumos de sua escrita para alcanÃar liberdade de estilo e escritura prÃpria. This research unfolds a view {{in regard}} to the poetic composition of Arnaldo Antunes and the history of his literature perpassing a complex environment of relations. In which the various literary creations are mixed. In order to understand better the way how these ideas are outripend and articulated, we rather bring his poetic production somehow nearer to the artistic tendencies, which arose {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. These created a profound transformation in the fields of art and culture, a fact we see in the course of the whole century and still today are enduring in the contemporaneous productions through this and other poets. Based on this progression, we try to find out the models which helped them to be inspirited and also the historical marks in literature, which allow us to find out and read the processes in unreding, appropriation, scripts and literature and therewith the forms these poetical categories are reconfigured in a effort of superation. Thus a proper and autonomic literature could be achieved. The theoretical body is based and established by authors like Pierre Bourdieu, Dominique Maingueneau, Harold Bloom, Roland Barthes and some others supporting as well. We verify that the high level of scientific and technological development of the modern society provokes new social arrangements, demanding also a renewal in the social habits in our times. That lifts up, the identity of an individual in this particular society having to reveal itself in the inner of the representation systems, - and in the same way he will have to allow to be represented by the others. In the interacting movement in several fields and in the constant being inspired on through the various linguistic codes, Arnaldo Antunes demonstrates the reading of the tradions flowing to unfold itself as a revitalization of arts, standing up against the banality and materialism of the contemporaneous world, but rather that the technical and experimental profits are contributions, which permit the development and orientation of the direction his writing can have to achieve the <b>liberty</b> of <b>style</b> and the literature as such...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the stylistic {{responses}} of Catalan fin-de-siècle architecture as an effort to strengthen national identity. This research will focus on the Catalan scenario as a case study for the general perceived condition of international efforts to create national modern styles that represents the local character in a word that suffers the effects of changes in the late modern age. Some examples include: the annex of Scotland to the UK in the 1700 ’s, the Belgian division between Walloons and Flemings, the newly unified Italy and Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire in process of division, and Turkey's modernization process. The names associated with these movements and the criticism they prompted reflects a need to establish a new style, partly based on hybrid mythologies between the popular tradition and romantic creations, on a Wagnerian way. This condition can be seen throughout Belgium and Turkey’s Art Nouveau, Germany’s Jungendstill, the Austro-Hungary Sezession, Italy’s <b>Liberty,</b> Scotland’s Modern <b>Style</b> or Catalonia’s Modernisme. The investigation’s approach will implement the study of relationships between relevant Catalan architects of the Fi-de-Segle - Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, among others - with the Catalan cultural project. The Catalan expression Fi-de-Segle is adopted here to refer the specific situation in Catalonia, in contrast to the european ambience that the term Fin-de-Siècle represent. The scope of the study will focus on the Ateneo Barcelonés. While not directly related to any official institution of conservative catalanism, like the Catalan League, the Ateneo is a representative sample of the thoughts of Barcelona architects during the period, several of then directly or indirectly linked to the Catalan ideals. Part of the research methodology for this study will focus on conducting a thorough review of the Ateneo’s records on open sessions of academic courses imparted in the years between 1860 and 1914, all the while looking for clear allusions to the use of architecture and style as a instrument for building Catalan national identity. The founding of the Ateneo in 1860, though it was first named Ateneo Catalan, coincides with several of the discussions that formed the basis of conservative catalanist ideology during the fi-de-segle. More so, the year 1914 coincides with the end of the presidency of the architect Domènech i Montaner in the Ateneo, the Great World War in Europe, and the emergence of a more left-wing political orientation in Catalonia, that ended with the hegemony of conservative catalanism. Within these records is contained a detailed review of the activities of the institution in the previous academic year - relating to architecture or fine arts - and official documents, such as the speeches given by the presidents elected each year, which serves as an thermometer for reading a general ideology of the Ateneo. Also, program records are available that describe courses, contests and awards granted there. Many works and projects show a distinct relationship with the disciplines of architecture and applied arts, and it is this investigation’s purpose to study these relations and better comprehend how architecture helped shape the Catalan national identity project.
