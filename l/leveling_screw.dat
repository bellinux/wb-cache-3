5000|$|Footscrew Nunatak (...) is a nunatak 1,865 m high to the {{southwest}} of Windy Gully, standing 1.4 nmi km southeast of Altar Mountain in the Quartermain Mountains of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It {{is one of a}} group of names in the area associated with surveying applied in 1993 by the New Zealand Geographic Board, a footscrew being a <b>leveling</b> <b>screw</b> of a tripod as used with surveying instruments.|$|E
5000|$|Pressurized {{walls are}} {{temporary}} walls built with reams of [...] " [...] (6 mm) to [...] " [...] (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard), metal 2 × 3s (approx. 5 × 7 cm) or 2 × 4s, or taped, plastered and compounded. Most installation companies utilize LATTICE strips of wood {{to cover the}} joints of the above drywall. After the frame-out process, 1" [...] (32 mm) sheet rock screws are used to attach the drywall to the pressurized 2×4s that contact the floor, the ceiling and {{the sides of the}} property's walls. In order to prevent structural or architectural damage, only T-nuts and <b>leveling</b> <b>screw</b> pads are used on those studs. No additional fasteners or adhesives are used to add stability to the frame work.|$|E
50|$|Some telescopes {{designed}} to measure star transits are zenith telescopes {{designed to}} point straight up {{at or near the}} zenith for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an altazimuth mount, instead of a meridian circle, fitted with <b>leveling</b> <b>screws.</b> Extremely sensitive levels are attached to the telescope mount to make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer.|$|R
40|$|Tool devised {{for use in}} {{measuring}} contact angles between balls and races in previously operated ball bearings. Used on both inner and outer raceways of bearings having cross-sectional widths between approximately 0. 5 and 2. 0 in. Consists of integral protractor mounted in vertical plane on bracket equipped with <b>leveling</b> <b>screws</b> and circular level indicator. Protractor includes rotatable indicator needle and set of disks of various sizes to fit various raceway curvatures...|$|R

Make {{sure it is}} stable, and mount the level on the top.Adjust the <b>leveling</b> <b>screws</b> until the pond bubble is centralised.As long as the pond bubble is central, the {{automatic}} compensators are able to finely level the instrument. To ensure this is the case, whilst looking through the scope, gently tap the level. The view will waver {{for a few moments}} before steadying. If this does not happen, the instrument is not level enough for the compensators to cope, and needs adjustment.|$|R

5000|$|A {{precision}} level (1:24000) {{is used to}} check the installation of precision machine tools in two axes. A lathe is manufactured with its base in a level plane {{and if it is}} not installed level distortions in the frame cause machining errors. Small milling machines are often roughly leveled but large mills are installed level. A worn lathe may have a twist introduced to the machine's bed to ensure that it turns parallel to the spindle axis, by twisting the bed (that is worn) to the spindle axis. A lathe has several <b>leveling</b> <b>screws.</b> Usually, such a fix has limited utility for only part of the cutting tool (carriage) travel. A lathe usually requires two or more leveling trials as the machine castings [...] "settle into" [...] the adjustments.|$|R
25|$|The NGA {{hired the}} {{structural}} engineering firm Robert Silman Associates {{to determine the}} cause of the problem. Although the Gallery began raising private funds to fix the issue, eventually federal funding was used to repair the building. In 2012, the NGA chose a joint venture, Balfour Beatty/Smoot, to complete the repairs. Anodized aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved {{to the center of the}} top edge of each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored silicone gaskets installed, and <b>leveling</b> <b>screws</b> rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011, and originally was scheduled to end in 2014. By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the façade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014. The East Building remained open throughout the project.|$|R

Introduction: By methods {{which need}} not be given here it has been satisfactorily proven that light {{is a form of}} energy {{resulting}} from the rapid vibration of the molecules composing the luminous object. It can also be shown that light is propagated in straight lines by means of transverse waves in the ether which pervades everything. The change in direction of propagation of the waves of light when passed into a more dense medium depends on their less velocity in the denser than in the rarer medium. White light consists of all wave length within a considerable range and when it is passed through a prism, we find that the waves which give rise to the sensation of the color red are not changed in direction so much as are those which produce the sensation of violet color. It follows that the waves producing the red color move less slowly in glass than do those producing the violet and that, since the velocity varies directly as the wave length, violet light consists of waves of less length than does red light. A spectrometer is an instrument fitted for observing a spectrum, having in addition a graduated circle and vernier by means of which the deviation of the emergent light is measured. It consists of a circular table with a graduated circle and vernier which may be leveled by three <b>leveling</b> <b>screws.</b> To the circle are attached two tubes called the collimator and the telescope, These are cylindrical tubes which have their axes parallel to, and directed over the center of the graduated circle. The telescope, with a vernier attached, turns around the circle...|$|R
