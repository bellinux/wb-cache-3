5|$|A large Tesco {{supermarket}} {{was constructed}} {{on the outskirts}} of Chatteris at a cost of £22 million. It was due to be opened in November 2014, but has been left unopened and empty following the company's decision to halt the opening of 49 out-of-town supermarkets following poor financial results. As of April 2016, Tesco are <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> retailer to take over the store, which remains mothballed.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The {{remaining}} members then {{spent the next}} few months <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Flammen's death was challenged by Danish National Archives's Peter Birkelund. In the film Flammen commits suicide {{in the basement}} of his house after the Gestapo find him, presumably because of Ketty's betrayal. Birkelund, however, says Flammen was killed on a coastal road while the Gestapo was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> resistance member. In contrast, the filming of Citron's death, which would require 250 soldiers, was consciously altered by Madsen for budgetary reasons.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{went into}} the match as the champions of their {{respective}} countries – {{the first time that}} the final had been contested by domestic champions since 1999, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich 2–1 at Barcelona's home, the Camp Nou – both winning with games to spare. Manchester United won their 11th Premier League title with a 0–0 draw at home to Arsenal on 16 May, while Barcelona were confirmed as La Liga champions for the first time in three years when Real Madrid lost to Villarreal on the same day. Both Manchester United and Barcelona were also <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> Champions League title to cap a season in which they had won multiple trophies: Manchester United had already won four out of a possible seven trophies in 2008–09 and were playing for the possibility of becoming the third team to retain the European Double (the domestic league and the European Cup), while Barcelona were aiming to become the first Spanish club to win a Treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E

5|$|John Carver, {{right-hand}} man to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United, arrived as the club's new assistant manager on 17 December 2009, but the club suffered another 1–0 defeat at home, against Coventry City, two days later. Argyle travelled to Cardiff on Boxing Day to play Cardiff City at their new stadium, and {{came away with}} an important three points thanks to a late goal from Sawyer. They recorded their biggest win of the season two days later against Reading. A brace from Judge, and first goals of the season for Kári Árnason and Ashley Barnes secured a 4–1 win at Home Park and six points from their two games over the Christmas period. Argyle returned to league action after their FA Cup ties on 16 January, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> three points against Crystal Palace but an early goal from young striker Victor Moses won the game for the visitors. Another must-win home game followed against Derby County and a fifth goal of the season from Jamie Mackie boosted their survival bid. A defeat by fellow struggler's Sheffield Wednesday, coupled with other results going against them, left Argyle five points from safety, with a tough match to come against West Bromwich Albion a week later. A single goal from striker Simon Cox kept Albion in touch {{at the top of}} the table and left Argyle deep in relegation trouble again, six points from safety.|$|E

25|$|Despite Ling {{announcing that}} the team were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> {{promotion}} season, they were stuck in mid-table {{during the first half}} of the 2012–13 campaign, before Ling was taken ill in mid-January. A disastrous run of losses under assistant manager Shaun Taylor followed, with the club dropping to just above the relegation zone. That led to Alan Knill being appointed as interim manager for the remainder of the season. Results picked up after this, and a run of three games unbeaten at the end of the season ultimately secured their Football League status with a 19th-place finish. Ling was dismissed at the end of the season, the board noting that results had been unacceptable even before his illness, and Knill's role was made permanent.|$|E
25|$|A film {{adaptation}} of the book was in development. It was written {{and would have been}} directed by Danny DeVito, starring Morgan Freeman as Zachariah and Pierce Brosnan as Jaggery. Dakota Fanning was originally cast as Charlotte Doyle, but had to drop out as production was continually halted and she eventually grew too old for the part. Saoirse Ronan was later cast, but the film was again halted because Freeman was seriously injured in a car accident two weeks before filming was scheduled to commence. DeVito returned to the subject in February 2013, saying he was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> young actress to star in the title role and scouting movie locations in Ireland. Shooting was supposed to start in July 2014.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after independence, {{the three}} parties united as the Front d'Action Patriotique (Patriotic Action Front, or F.A.P.), and reorganised Dahomey into one electoral constituency. It was {{proposed}} {{that there would}} be an agreed list of electoral candidates, and that all of the legislative seats would be given to the party with the highest number of elected representatives from that list. This arrangement did not last long; Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin broke from the union and, using the discontent among people over the increasing rarity of jobs in the country, incited demonstrations that lasted from September to October 1960. He nevertheless tried to disassociate himself from the rioting. In September, he claimed that a single party state was the only solution to the stagnation of the economy.

40|$|The {{retention}} of front-line workers {{is an ongoing}} challenge for public child welfare organizations. The objective {{of this study is}} to better understand whether and to what degree supervision influences a worker's decision to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> job. This study, part of a larger cross sectional workforce retention study, involves a survey of caseworkers and front line supervisors in thirteen (13) county-based social services organizations in a northeastern state. The approach used for this study is participatory research. Two supervisory factors were identified, knowledge and support. The logistic regression analysis comparing the effects of supervision on a respondent's decision to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> job was significant for both factors: supervisor knowledge and supervisor support. [...] Action theory, emphasizing the relationship between two kinds of theory: espoused theory and theories-in-use, provide the framework for this study, which considers the congruence between what child welfare organizations espouse and what actual behavior demonstrates in the area of supervision. The results of this study provide empirical support for the effect of supervisor behavior on a worker's decision to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> job...|$|R
