This paper reports on the findings of a study, consisting of a questionnaire survey, interviews and work-site visits, to compare the use of <b>low-waste</b> building <b>technologies</b> in public housing and private residential projects in Hong Kong. The results show that large panel formwork and prefabricated building components are widely used in public housing projects in Hong Kong. Due to the difference of the design with public housing, the use of smaller aluminium panel formwork is more common in the private housing projects. The barriers for the adoption of <b>low-waste</b> building <b>technologies</b> in the private sector are identified and discussed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Formwork {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} temporary works for reinforced-concrete superstructures in building projects. The use of traditional timber formwork has dominated the construction industry in Hong Kong for many years. Now, however, <b>low-waste</b> <b>technologies</b> for superstructure construction are becoming more common. The study reported here compares the advantages and disadvantages of using traditional timber formwork and a large panel steel formwork system integrated with precast concrete semi-slab (composite formwork system) in superstructure construction in Hong Kong. The study compares these two different formwork systems used in two identically designed school projects in Hong Kong. The comparisons are focused on construction cost, time required for completion of work and construction waste generation. By conducting a detailed cost comparison, this paper shows that, despite the fact that the composite formwork system is able to produce less construction waste, the traditional timber formwork system is still more favourable economically. However, if the composite formwork could be reused in other standard school projects after completion of the project, economic advantages would be realised.

40|$|The {{enormous}} amount of construction activity in China associated with its rapid economic development has produced {{a large amount of}} construction and demolition (C&D) waste over the past three decades. The majority of this waste has not been well processed, which has led to severe damage to the environment. Although there is clearly a need for better C&D waste management (WM) in China, the best ways to achieve this have yet to be fully explored. This paper is based on a study by the authors that aimed to identify the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for C&D WM in China. A questionnaire survey and 14 semi-structured interviews with practitioners, researchers and government officials were conducted in Shenzhen, a leading city in southern China for tackling C&D WM. Seven factors were identified as the CSFs for managing C&D waste: (1) WM regulations, (2) waste management system (WMS), (3) awareness of C&D WM, (4) <b>low-waste</b> building <b>technologies,</b> (5) fewer design changes, (6) research and development in WM, and (7) vocational training in WM. These CSFs can serve as valuable references for stakeholders to develop effective C&D WM strategies. The research also adds to the knowledge on how to reduce adverse environmental impacts caused by construction activities in rapidly developing economies. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|According to {{the recent}} Spanish legislation, the amount of {{non-hazardous}} construction and demolition waste (C&D waste) by weight must be reduced by at least 70 % by 2020. However, the current behavior of the stakeholders involved in the waste management process make this goal difficult to achieve. In order to boost changes in their strategies, we firstly describe an Environmental Management System (EMS) based on regulation measures and economic incentives which incorporate universities as a key new actor {{in order to create}} a 3 Rs model (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) in the C&D waste management with costs savings. The target areas are focused mainly on producer responsibility, promotion of <b>low-waste</b> building <b>technologies</b> and creation of green jobs to fulfill three main objectives: valorization of inert wastes, elimination of illegal landfills and stimulation of demand for recycled C&D wastes. To achieve this latter goal, we have also designed a simulation model—using the Systems Dynamic methodology—to assess the potential impact of two policies (incentives and tax penalties) in order to evaluate how the government can influence the behavior of the firms in the recycling system of C&D waste aggregates. This paper finds a broader understanding of the socioeconomic implications of waste management over time and the positive effects of these policies in the recycled aggregates market in order to achieve the goal of 30 % C&D waste aggregates in 12 years or less...|$|R

Also provides new methods of preparation of porous building materials based on aggloporite using local fuels and waste energy on the basis of milled peat, fuel briquettes and wood chips allow to replace expensive imported components that comprise the raw mixtures (coal, anthracite).

In industrial research obtained aggloporite this formulation has shown positive results in strength and density. Established that by decreasing the particle size of the fuel increases the redox potential of the combustion products, which reduces the height of the oxidizing zone and the speed of the sintering raw mix. These processes increase the productivity of sinter machine. Technology is implemented on the "Minsk factory of building materials".

It aims at achieving {{a better understanding of}} the characteristics of SSIs, helps to identify those industries that contribute significantly to environmental pollution and occupational exposure, and focuses attention on local management options. Four case studies confirm that the troublesome SSIs are highly concentrated in urban areas and give rise to local impacts primarily. Priorities for action will almost certainly include some combination of information and educational campaigns for SSI owners and workers, accompanied by policies and incentives to promote good housekeeping and the adaption of <b>low-waste,</b> efficient production <b>technologies,</b> and by some form of collective waste handling&mdash;possibly through industrial relocation, but more likely by local waste collection and treatment systems whether municipal or private. To succeed, coordinated actions are needed by national and local officials, local training and technology transfer centers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and in-dustrial associations.
