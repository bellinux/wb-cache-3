5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen {{through the prism of}} domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E
25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} as he held that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This {{was evident in the}} manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some in the nature of a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> that she herself had adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to prove its case and not the judge's duty to do so, even if it was an attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E

25|$|Abe {{first went}} about {{the task of}} {{removing}} Zusho, who was greatly relied upon by Narioki, by inviting him to Edo. Abe’s stated purpose was a desire to discuss the Ryūkyū crisis and its current handling. In {{the process of the}} conversation, Abe began to ask Zusho a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> that made it apparently clear to Zusho that Abe, as well as the Tokugawa shogun, knew the truth of the illegal Satsuma-Ryūkyū-Western trade relations, which were being carried out against the shogunate's policy of seclusion. Zusho’s devotion to Narioki pushed him to take full responsibility for the illicit trade by committing seppuku on December 18, 1848. On December 3, 1850, Narioki was called to Edo by the shogun and presented with a prized set of tea utensils, indicating the shogun's desire for Narioki to retire. On February 3, 1851, Nairoki retired and Shimazu Nariakira was made daimyō of Satsuma.|$|E
25|$|The 9/11 Commission Report {{noted that}} lack of {{preparedness}} could {{have led to the}} deaths of first responders {{at the scene of the}} attacks. The Commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Family members of 9/11 victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years. The radios were not working when Fire Department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate, and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed. However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives. Giuliani testified to the Commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements. A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a $33 million no-bid contract with Motorola, and implemented in early 2001. However, the radios were recalled in March 2001 after a probationary firefighter's calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene, leaving firemen with the old analog radios from 1993. A book later published by Commission members Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission, argued that the Commission had not pursued a tough enough <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> with Giuliani.|$|E

[...] He had had surgery to repair cartilage damage in high school, but that did not alleviate his problems. [...] When Jordan responded yes to a question about whether he had had any surgeries in the prior 12 months, it triggered a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> about his senior season meniscus surgery. He did not make the 2008 Wolverines due to a knee problem, but was advised to try out again after his knee healed. [...] After discovering a torn meniscus, he had a second knee surgery, which was successful. He attended every game that season in his family's season ticket section.|$|E

500|$|Her church trial {{took place}} at the Boston meeting house on two {{consecutive}} Thursdays in March 1638. [...] Hutchinson was accused of numerous theological errors of which only four were covered during the first day, so the trial was scheduled to continue the following week, when Wilson took an active part in the proceedings. [...] During this second day of interrogation a week later, Hutchinson read a carefully written recantation of her theological errors. [...] Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in communion with the church, with the possibility of even returning there some day. [...] Wilson, however, did not accept this recantation, and he re-opened a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> from the previous week. [...] With this, a new onslaught began, and when later given the opportunity, Wilson said, [...] "... your errors...is the slightinge of Gods faythfull Ministers and contenminge and cryinge down them as Nobodies." [...] Hugh Peter chimed in, followed by Thomas Shepard, and then Wilson spoke again, [...] "I cannot but reverence and adore the wise hand of God...in leavinge our sister to pride and Lyinge."

30|$|Market {{relationships}} {{are an integral}} part of today’s pastoral livelihoods. However, these new sets of pastoral actors are vulnerable to variation in social and political forces frequently outside of their control. In short, pastoralists cannot escape the market as their new arena of social and monetary exchange, nor can they transcend their traditional life ways or fully return to them. These factors make it necessary to call for alternative <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> and hypothesis generation about pastoralism and pastoralist’s lives, particularly as we explore current livelihood practices and pastoral economics in our highly globalized world.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to detecting deception in subjects they interview, Lightman {{and his team}} also use various interviewing and interrogation tactics to elicit useful information. Rather than by force, they use careful <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning,</b> provocative statements, theatrics and healthy doses of deception on their own part. In the show's pilot episode, Lightman is speaking {{to a man who}} is refusing to speak at all, and is able to discern vital information by talking to him and gauging his reaction to each statement. This approach is also taken in several other episodes (e.g., [...] "Do No Harm").|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{observed}} {{respect and}} attention to elders' speech in traditional cultures {{appears to have a}} 'universal' component which questions its possible biological bases. Animals present differential attention to the vocalizations of other individuals according to their characteristics but {{little is known about the}} potential propensity to pay more attention to vocalizations of elders. On the basis of several hundreds of vocal exchanges recorded, here we show that aged female Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli), despite being significantly less 'loquacious' than their younger adult counterparts, elicit many more responses when calling. These findings show that attention to elders' vocal production appears in non-human primates, leading to new <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> on human culture and language evolution...|$|R

40|$|Post-qualitative {{research}} methodologies {{require us to}} work within, against, and beyond our methodological inheritance {{to respond to the}} world’s ongoing becoming. It is our responsibility; yet do {{we have the ability to}} respond to that which is beyond and yet-to-come? This article begins by asking this question of the process it engages in: concluding. Following an exploration entangled practices of textual closure, (fore) closure, and the clôture of metaphysics, the article expands outward through the relation between closure and responsibility. Specifically, the lived concept of response-ability as an engaged practice of (re) opening the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> closure (beyond knowledge already known) to respond to and enact responsibility for that which is not-yet and/or to-come. Drawing from Kuokkanen, Spivak, and Barad, response-ability is explored respectively as necessary homework, as (not) hearing the call of the other, and as account-ability toward co-constitutive relationality. The article concludes with further <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> as to what it might mean to responsibly inherit (post-) qualitative methodological pasts and futurities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ethical {{considerations}} regarding {{the development of}} technologies are now a standard part {{of the field of}} bioethics, focused in large part on the interactions between science and government in establishing the social good.

This is even more significant in the present debate on the acceptability of nanotechnology. In this article, we first specify the strengths and limitations of the scientific analysis of the social acceptability of risks in nanotechnology. Next, we demonstrate the limitations of taking an empirical approach in the social sciences and the humanities to predicting the social acceptability of a technology. We argue that recognizing the assumptions underlying these two quantitative approaches should open up a road to more reflective approaches by the social sciences and the humanities...|$|R

40|$|IntuiTweet (2009 - 2010) was a dance {{improvisation}} project using Twitter as {{a platform}} for movement exchange: tweets were written by small group of dancers to promote kinaesthetic and corporeal exchanges in public spaces. Geographically disparate bodies were linked only {{by a set of}} improvisatory practices and by Twitter on their mobile devices. The improvisations left traces in the form of words. Making sense of this project in the context of mobile media narratives, two questions fold back on each other: why consider mobile media narratives through a project based in dance? And why consider dance through the lens of mobile media narratives? In pursuing these parallel but inverse <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning,</b> both the sense of narrative and the understanding of the movement practices are transformed.

40|$|It is my goal in {{this paper}} to offer a {{strategy}} for translating universal statements about utopia into particular statements. This is accomplished by drawing out their implicit, temporally embedded, points of reference. Universal statements of the kind I find troublesome {{are those of the}} form ‘Utopia is x’, where ‘x’ can be anything from ‘the receding horizon’ to ‘the nation of the virtuous’. To such statements, I want to put the questions: ‘Which utopias?’; ‘In what sense?’; and ‘When was that, is that, or will that be, the case for utopias?’ Through an exploration <b>of</b> these <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning,</b> I arrive at three archetypes of utopian theorizing which serve to provide the answers: namely, utopian historicism, utopian presentism, and utopian futurism. The employment of these archetypes temporally grounds statements about utopia in the past, present, or future, and thus forces discussion of discrete particulars instead of abstract universals with no meaningful referents...|$|R
40|$|The {{academic}} {{interest in}} ‘science and technology communication’ {{has evolved from}} different societal domains and fields of application, giving rise to different scholarly traditions. This contribution introduces current issues and agendas in a field that has its origin at the interface of (agricultural) innovation studies, rural development sociology and the communication sciences. The paper starts with a brief sketch {{of the history of}} the field. When compared to earlier approaches, current thinking about ‘communication, innovation and development’ pays greater attention to limitations in the potential of orchestrating change and innovation in pre-planned directions, and to political and institutional dimensions of both communication and innovation. In relation to this, new <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> are discussed. The article ends with a reflection on the usefulness of the thinking from different historical periods today. It is argued that approaches to science and technology communication need to be matched with the level of complexity of the issue at hand...|$|R
