There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro {{said that he and}} Yamazaki would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> third Investigations game, and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future, but that he could not make any promises.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

In an interview with What's on TV, when asked who Darren would choose out of Suzanne and Cindy, Dawson said, [...] "Cindy any time.

500|$|According to Media Create information, Chulip {{sold only}} 6,645 units {{during its first}} week of release in Japan. Despite such low sales, Chulip was re-released in Japan two {{separate}} times, first {{as part of the}} [...] "Victor the Best" [...] selection on April 24, 2003 and second as part of the [...] "Super Best Collection" [...] on July 6, 2006. Many of Chulips key development members and their design philosophies were carried over to the 2009 Wii game Little King's Story. That year, Kimura stated that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sequel to Chulip. He was also contemplating creating a version set in an American location such as The Bronx with a protagonist that is African-American, Caucasian, or other ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|Much of Albert Victor's time at {{his post}} in Aldershot was spent drilling, which he disliked, {{though he did}} like to play polo. He passed his examinations, and in March 1887, he was posted to Hounslow where he was {{promoted}} to captain. He was given more public engagements, visited Ireland and Gibraltar, and opened the Hammersmith suspension bridge. Of his private life, a childhood friend of Albert Victor later recalled that it was uneventful: [...] "his brother officers had said that they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> man of the world of him. Into that world he refused to be initiated." [...] However, letters dated 1885 and 1886 from Albert Victor to his doctor at Aldershot (known only as [...] "Roche") detail that he was taking medicine for 'glete' (gleet), then a term for gonorrhea discharge.|$|E
500|$|Edward Lycett Green, {{described}} by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as [...] "the emotional {{force behind the}} accusations", was next in the witness box. Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated {{that he had seen}} Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line when he should not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he [...] "did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and on one point regarding a question the prince put to Levett; his answer was [...] "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that [...] "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say anything without qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember'... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that [...] "is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".|$|E

500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E

We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director.

2500|$|When Mannerheim {{returned}} to St. Petersburg, {{he was asked}} if he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> journey through Turkestan to Beijing as a secret intelligence-officer. General Palitsyn, Chief of the Russian General Staff, wanted accurate, on-the-ground intelligence about the reform and modernization of the Qing Dynasty. The Russians wanted to know the military feasibility of invading Western China, including the provinces of Xinjiang and Gansu, in their struggles with Britain for control of Inner Asia known as [...] "The Great Game". After much deliberation, Mannerheim, disguised as an ethnographic collector, joined the French archeologist Paul Pelliot's expedition in Samarkand in Russian Turkestan (now Uzbekistan). From the terminus of the Trans-Caspian Railway in Andijan, the expedition started in July 1906, but Mannerheim spent the greater part of the expedition alone, after quarrelling with Pelliot over several logistic issues on their way to Kashgar in China's Xinjiang province.|$|E
2500|$|A tired-looking Nixon {{spoke with}} a quavering voice, {{delivering}} what {{was described as a}} [...] "15-minute monologue." [...] He spent most of the talk criticizing the press, his remarks interrupted only by brief interjections from reporters, though he acknowledged well into his remarks that the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 did not allow his campaign to get his message across during the final two weeks in his election bid. Nixon began his remarks stating that [...] "now that {{all the members of the}} press are so delighted that I have lost, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> statement of my own." [...] Nixon insisted that the press had attacked him since 1948 following the Alger Hiss case. He accused the press of printing articles supporting their favored candidates, stating that they should [...] "give... the shaft" [...] to future candidates, but should have [...] "one lonely reporter on the campaign who will report what the candidate says now and then". Nixon reserved praise for Carl Greenberg of The Los Angeles Times who he felt [...] "wrote every word I said". Also praised was Edwin Tetlow of The Daily Telegraph of London.|$|E
