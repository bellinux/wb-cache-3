25|$|On July 1, 2006 the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) {{came into}} effect prohibiting the {{inclusion}} of significant quantities of lead in most consumer electronics produced in the EU. In the US, manufacturers may receive tax benefits by reducing the use of lead-based solder. <b>Lead-free</b> solders in commercial use may contain tin, copper, silver, bismuth, indium, zinc, antimony, and traces of other metals. Most <b>lead-free</b> replacements for conventional 60/40 and 63/37Sn-Pb solder have melting points from 5 to 20°C higher, though there are also solders with much lower melting points.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is ball grid array (BGA) using tin-lead solder balls for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using <b>lead-free</b> solder paste.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{there is}} growing concern {{regarding}} the toxicity in lead-containing devices driven by the result of restriction of hazardous substances directive regulations.

25|$|Lead crystal {{glassware}} {{was formerly}} used to store and serve drinks, {{but due to}} the potential health risks of lead, this has become rare. One alternative material is crystal glass, in which barium oxide, zinc oxide, or potassium oxide are employed instead of lead oxide. <b>Lead-free</b> crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal, but it is lighter and it has less dispersive power.|$|E
25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy electronic ignition and mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the <b>lead-free</b> fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.|$|E
25|$|A glass solder is used, e.g., {{for joining}} {{together}} parts of cathode ray tubes and plasma display panels. Newer compositions lowered the usage temperature from 450 to 390°C {{by reducing the}} lead(II) oxide content down from 70%, increasing the zinc oxide content, adding titanium dioxide and bismuth(III) oxide and some other components. The high thermal expansion of such glass can be reduced by a suitable ceramic filler. <b>Lead-free</b> solder glasses with soldering temperature of 450°C were also developed.|$|E

But the A20 has now been diverted southwards, passing through Mottingham, {{and it is a}} dual carriageway that connects to the M20 motorway in Kent. Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 has replaced the Rochester Road section, which was always very congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of <b>lead-free</b> petrol).|$|E
25|$|For {{electrical}} and electronics work, solder wire {{is available in}} a range of thicknesses for hand-soldering, and with cores containing flux. It is also available as a paste or as a preformed foil shaped to match the workpiece, more suitable for mechanized mass-production. Alloys of lead and tin were commonly used in the past and are still available; they are particularly convenient for hand-soldering. <b>Lead-free</b> solders have been increasing in use due to regulatory requirements plus the health and environmental benefits of avoiding lead-based electronic components. They are almost exclusively used today in consumer electronics.|$|E
25|$|Matte solder {{is usually}} fused {{to provide a}} better bonding surface for bare copper. Treatments, such as benzimidazolethiol, prevent surface {{oxidation}} of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a tin-lead alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU, which restricts the use of lead. One of these <b>lead-free</b> compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60ppm germanium.|$|E
25|$|While {{the green}} glazed ware {{continues}} to be Atzompa's staple product, {{there has been some}} innovation in the pottery tradition here. In the 1970s, a local potter by the name of Dolores Porras gained notoriety when she went against convention and pioneered the production of multicolored glazed pottery. Porras taught herself how to paint on clay pieces, starting with red and white washes. Later she added blues, greens, grays and oranges. When she began to produce these pieces, she was considered to be crazy. However, her pieces began to sell and other potters began to imitate her work. Later on, she introduced the use of <b>lead-free</b> glazes. Today, her pieces are part of Atzompa's pottery traditions even though she herself is outsold by younger potters who produce cheaper and better wares.|$|E

2500|$|While most oil {{companies}} were switching to leaded gasolines en masse during the mid-to-late 1920s, American Oil chose to continue marketing its premium-grade [...] "Amoco-Gas" [...] (later Amoco Super-Premium) as a <b>lead-free</b> gasoline by using aromatics rather than tetraethyllead to increase octane levels, decades before {{the environmental movement}} of the early 1970s led to more stringent auto-emission controls which ultimately mandated the universal phase out of leaded gasoline. The [...] "Amoco" [...] <b>lead-free</b> gasoline was sold at American's stations in the eastern and southern U.S. alongside American Regular gasoline, which was a leaded fuel. <b>Lead-free</b> Amoco {{was introduced in the}} Indiana Standard marketing area in 1970. The Red Crown Regular and White Crown Premium (later Gold Crown Super Premium) gasolines marketed by parent company Standard Oil (Indiana) in its prime marketing area in the Midwest before 1961 also contained lead.|$|E

2500|$|Sodium {{potassium}} niobate ((K,Na)NbO3). This {{material is}} also known as NKN. In 2004, a group of Japanese researchers led by Yasuyoshi Saito discovered a sodium potassium niobate composition with properties close to those of PZT, including a high TC. Certain compositions of this material have been shown to retain a high mechanical quality factor (Qm≈900) with increasing vibration levels, whereas the mechanical quality factor of hard PZT degrades in such conditions.

2500|$|The town of Santa María Atzompa {{is known}} for its jade green-glazed pottery, which has been made the same way for generations. The color comes from the lead {{monoxide}} glaze that is applied to it. Atzompa's pottery tradition prior to the Conquest is similar to other settlements in the area, but after the Spanish introduced glazing techniques the green variation was adopted and has changed little since. Up until the mid 20th century, the ware was popular enough to be shipped to all parts of Mexico and even to the United States. However, restrictions against lead containing pottery has since deflated this market and it is mostly sold only locally. Despite the development and introduction of <b>lead-free</b> glazes, [...] Atzompa continues to have some of the highest lead content in Mexico, found both in the wares and in the potters and other people who live there.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, lead is {{prohibited}} in solder and flux in plumbing applications for drinking water use, per the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Historically, {{a higher proportion}} of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be wiped over the joint to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of lead poisoning began to be fully appreciated, lead solder was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The electrochemical couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin. [...] Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health, lead in plumbing solder was replaced by silver (food-grade applications) or antimony, with copper often added, and the proportion of tin was increased (see <b>Lead-free</b> solder.) ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 20th century, {{industrialization}} had chipped away at {{the production}} of handcrafts, especially for local use. [...] For example, by 1965 in San Miguel del Valle, only a few old men still weaved the local wood, using natural dyes because the demand was so low. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the construction of modern roadways, especially the Pan American Highway, allowed {{the development of a}} tourist industry, catering to those looking to explore traditional Mexico as well as the coastline. The modern Oaxacan handcraft industry took off, with its initial market being tourists. This led to an interest in traditional methods with the numbers of artisans multiplying, especially in textiles and ceramics from the 1960s to the late 1980s. By the end of this period, a number of communities’ economies had changed from agricultural to those based on one particular handcraft. The 20th century also saw some changes in technique, especially the use of synthetic dyes and paints and commercial thread, as well as <b>lead-free</b> glazes, but these have not completely replaced more traditional production.|$|E

Selling to the lucrative Christmas market is {{particularly}} profitable. Even though Day of the Dead motifs are not related to Halloween, they have found their way into many U.S. homes for this holiday, thanks to the Internet. Many artisans work with NOVICA.com, a company what works with third-world artists to help them sell their wares in other countries. This permits many artisans to sell directly, cutting out middlemen.

2500|$|Tin is a soft, {{exceptionally}} weak metal (MH 1.5); a 1-cm thick rod will bend easily under mild finger pressure. It has an irregularly coordinated {{crystalline structure}} (BCN 4+2) associated with incompletely ionised atoms. All of the Group 14 elements form compounds {{in which they}} are in the +4, predominantly covalent, oxidation state; even in the +2 oxidation state tin generally forms covalent bonds. [...] The oxides of tin in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely SnO and Sn(OH)2, are amphoteric; it forms stannites in strongly basic solutions. Below 13°C (55.4°F) tin changes its structure and becomes 'grey tin', which has the same structure as diamond, silicon and germanium (BCN 4). This transformation causes ordinary tin to crumble and disintegrate since, as well as being brittle, grey tin occupies more volume due to having a less efficient crystalline packing structure. Tin forms Zintl phases such as Na4Sn, BaSn, K8Sn25 and Ca31Sn20. It has good corrosion resistance in air on account of forming a thin protective oxide layer. Pure tin has no structural uses. It is used in <b>lead-free</b> solders, and as a hardening agent in alloys of other metals, such as copper, lead, titanium and zinc.|$|E
6000|$|The French {{translator}} thus proceeds:- [...] "They who accuse AEneas {{for want}} of courage, either understand not Virgil or have read him slightly; otherwise they would not raise an objection so easy to be answered." [...] Hereupon he gives so many instances of the hero's valour that to repeat them after him would tire your lordship, and put me to the unnecessary trouble of transcribing the greatest part of the three last AEneids. In short, more could not be expected from an Amadis, a Sir Lancelot, or the whole Round Table than he performs. Proxima quaeque metit galdio is the perfect account of a knight- errant. If it be replied, continues Segrais, {{that it was not}} difficult for him to undertake and achieve such hardy enterprises because he wore enchanted arms, that accusation in the first place must fall on Homer ere it can reach Virgil. Achilles was as well provided with them as AEneas, though he was invulnerable without them; and Ariosto, the two Tassos (Bernardo and Torquato), even our own Spenser--in a word, all modern poets--have copied Homer, as well as Virgil; he is neither the first nor last, but in the midst of them, and therefore is safe if they are so. Who knows, says Segrais, but that his fated armour was only an allegorical defence, and signified no more than that he was under the peculiar protection of the gods? born, as the astrologers will tell us out of Virgil (who was well versed in the Chaldean mysteries), under the favourable influence of Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun? But I insist not on this because I know you believe not there is such an art; though not only Horace and Persius, but Augustus himself, thought otherwise. But in defence of Virgil, I dare positively say that he has been more cautious in this particular than either his predecessor or his descendants; for AEneas was actually wounded in the twelfth of the [...] "AEneis," [...] though he had the same godsmith to forge his arms as had Achilles. It seems he was no [...] "war-luck," [...] as the Scots commonly call such men, who, they say, are iron-free or <b>lead-free.</b> Yet after this experiment that his arms were not impenetrable (when he was cured indeed by his mother's help, because he was that day to conclude the war by the death of Turnus), the poet durst not carry the miracle too far and restore him wholly to his former vigour; he was still too weak to overtake his enemy, yet we see with what courage he attacks Turnus when he faces and renews the combat. I need say no more, for Virgil defends himself without needing my assistance, and proves his hero truly to deserve that name. He was not, then, a second-rate champion, as they would have him who think fortitude the first virtue in a hero.|$|E
