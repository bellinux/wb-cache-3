40|$|Due to {{advances}} in medicine, there are {{increasing numbers of}} children with life limiting and life threatening conditions attending mainstream schools. Recent {{research shows that the}} needs of these children and their families are not being well met. Teaching for Life was a research project that examined the needs of teachers in relation to working with children with <b>life</b> limiting <b>or</b> <b>life</b> threatening conditions in school. It comprised an on-line questionnaire and focus groups with teachers. Teachers need support from health professionals. The integration of education, health and social care services {{are at the heart of}} the Government’s agenda for children. The session will provide an overview of the research, its findings and recommendations, and include discussion about how health professionals and teachers can better support one another in practice. Learning outcomes: 1. Have an overview of the needs of children with <b>life</b> limiting <b>or</b> <b>life</b> threatening conditions when in school. 2. Understand the experiences and concerns of teachers in mainstream schools in relation to working with children with <b>life</b> limiting <b>or</b> <b>life</b> threatening conditions. 3. Examine how we might better support teachers in mainstream schools. 4. Disseminate practical ideas for how teachers and health professionals might support one another when working with a child with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>or</b> <b>life</b> threatening condition...|$|R

5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily <b>life</b> <b>or</b> courses. Children learning {{a second language}} {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, {{the remnants of the}} depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences without power. Several trees were downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh water flooding.

5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to <b>life</b> <b>or</b> property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices.

These may directly kill or injure marine <b>life,</b> <b>or</b> may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E

5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political <b>life</b> <b>or</b> coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|Gregory also {{instructed}} Augustine {{on other}} matters. Temples {{were to be}} consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs.

They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus.|$|E

5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently.

Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this <b>life</b> <b>or</b> after-life).|$|E
