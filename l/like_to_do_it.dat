I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{negative}} reception from the preceding year's ceremony, the Academy rehired Gilbert Cates to oversee {{production of the}} awards gala. However, {{in an article published}} in The New York Times, it was stated that 2005 host Chris Rock would not return to host the show. According to a statement released by his publicist, [...] "He didn't want to do it in perpetuity, He'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again down the road." [...] Furthermore, many media outlets speculated that several AMPAS members felt uncomfortable with Rock's disparaging comments about Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Tobey Maguire. Initially, Cates sought actor and veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal to host the ceremony again. However, Crystal declined the offer citing his commitment to his one-man comedy show 700 Sundays.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E

But if you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> yourself, I think it would please her very much as an expression of your gratitude and love for her." ...|$|E
5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what {{everybody}} else <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It's</b> just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|R

Yukio <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> the old-fashioned way. While Yukio is always displaying his love and affection for Etsuko's elder sister, he seems strict when it comes to Etsuko. He often calls her a good-for-nothing, but Etsuko doesn't know that her father says these things to hide his true feelings. Yukio loves Etsuko more than anybody and cares for her greatly. He soon becomes the leader of the group cheering for Etsuko's boat club.|$|R

5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the large pavilion and lobby is circular and constructed of glass and metal supports to contrast with the solid geometric lines of the actual hall. Architect I. M. Pei, and structural engineer Leslie E. Robertson Associates has described {{the structure of the}} hall's interior as [...] "very conservative". [...] "It is conservative for reasons I no longer accept," [...] he said in 2000. [...] "I feel that the hall doesn't fully represent what I would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> was my first one." [...] Because the music performed in the hall was likely to be from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Pei was unwilling to impose modern styles of architecture on the interior.|$|R
60|$|As Master Newcombe stepped near, {{his spirits}} rose, {{as they had}} not always risen, as he {{approached}} Mistress Kate, for he perceived that, although she held the handle of her rod in her hand, {{the other end of}} it was lying on the ground, not very far away from the bait and the hook which, it was very plain, had not been in the water at all. She must have been thinking of something else besides fishing, he thought. But he <b>did</b> not dare <b>to</b> go on with that sort of thinking in the way he would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He had not too great a belief in himself, though he was very much in love with Kate Bonnet.|$|R
60|$|Often {{when she}} found them massed too thickly she would go in among them and thin them out with {{apparent}} recklessness, pulling them up by the roots and throwing them on the path, where John Gayther would come and find them and take them away. This heroic action {{on the part of}} the Mistress of the House pleased John very much. He respected the fearless spirit which <b>did</b> not hesitate <b>to</b> make sacrifices for the greater good, no matter how many beautiful blossoms she scattered on the garden path. John Gayther might have thinned out all this superfluous growth himself, but he knew the Mistress <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and he left for her gloved hands many tangled jungles of luxuriant bloom.|$|R
