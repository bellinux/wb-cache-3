40|$|Atopy can {{manifest}} in childhood as infantile eczema (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis and asthma. In practice, {{it is critical}} to identify the offending allergen in atopic individuals. This will not only influence therapeutic interventions, but may also {{have a significant impact on}} the individual’s quality of life. The most common clinical test for allergy detection is the introduction of an allergen directly into the skin in the form of a <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> is recommended in the diagnostic workup for allergies because it is reliable, safe, convenient, inexpensive, minimally invasive, and has the advantage of multiple allergen testing in one, 15 - to 20 -minute, <b>test.</b> <b>Skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> can be performed from birth onwards. Although there is a small risk of developing anaphylaxis, the test remains safe to perform in a consultation room or at the patient’s bedside. Worldwide, a <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> remains the test of choice for allergy because of its convenience and cost-effectiveness.

40|$|Introduction. Postorgasmic illness {{syndrome}} (POIS) is {{a combination}} of local allergic symptoms and transient flu-like illness. In this study, the investigators propose five preliminary criteria to establish the diagnosis. Aim. To describe the clinical details in 45 males being suspected of having POIS and to test an immunogenic hypothesis as the underlying mechanism of their presentations. Methods. Forty-five males were studied according to standardized protocol, including neuropsychiatric and medical sexological evaluations; their complaints were categorized using their own words, and their self-perceived intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT). <b>Skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> with autologous diluted semen in 33 men were also performed. Main Outcome Measures. Clinical features of POIS including self-perceived IELTs and the results of <b>skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> with autologous diluted seminal fluid. Results. Of the 45 included men, 33 subjects consented with <b>skin-prick</b> <b>testing.</b> Of them, 29 (88 %) men had a positive <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> with their own (autologous) semen, and four had a negative test. In 87 % of men, POIS symptoms started within 30 minutes after ejaculation. Complaints of POIS were categorized in seven clusters of symptoms, e. g., general, flu-like, head, eyes, nose, throat, and muscles. Local allergic reactions of eyes and nose were reported in 44 % and 33 % of subjects, a flu-like syndrome in 78 % of subjects, exhaustion and concentration difficulties in 80 % and 87 % of subjects. Of all subjects, 58 % had an atopic constitution. Lifelong premature ejaculation, defined as self-perceived IELT < 1 minute, was reported in 25 (56 %) of subjects. Conclusions. The combination of allergic and systemic flu-like reactions post-ejaculation together with a positive <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> in the majority of males underscores the hypothesis of an "immunogenic" etiology of POIS, e. g., that POIS is caused by Type- 1 and Type-IV allergy to the males' own semen, as soon it is triggered by ejaculation.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} atopy {{influences}} exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels in adults with established asthma. SETTING: Specialist respiratory unit {{in a university}} teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight asthmatics (mean FEV(1), 85. 7 %) receiving short-acting inhaled bronchodilators {{and a range of}} inhaled steroids (0 to 4, 000 microg/d). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were studied on two occasions, 5 to 7 days apart, between September and March. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: On the first day, FEV(1), exhaled NO, and histamine challenge were performed. On the second day, exhaled NO, total IgE, and <b>skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> to six common allergens were conducted. Exhaled NO was measured with the single exhalation method.

In a recent study based oil the review of epidemiologic studies conducted worldwide in unselected populations of children, we documented that the prevalence of atopic asthma (AA) was high in the populations with a high prevalence of atopy. We systematically reviewed 36 articles that studied 48 populations of unselected children and reported prevalence rates for asthma and atopy in the total sample and in the subpopulations. No {{significant difference was found}} in the prevalence of asthma cases in the quartiles of childhood populations subdivided for the prevalence of atopy. In addition, atopy did not increase significantly in the subgroups of populations subdivided for the quartiles. In both subgroups, however, AA increased with increasing atopy or with increasing (p < 0. 001). Using a positive <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> reaction to define cases of asthma as cases of AA is misleading because the prevalence of subjects so defined is heavily influenced by the environmentally generated changes in the prevalence of atopy or asthma.

Indoor and outdoor pollution {{play an important role}} too, but few studies have analyzed the association with BHR. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of urban residence on BHR. Methods: We studied two general population samples enrolled in two cross-sectional epidemiological studies performed in Northern Italy (Po Delta, rural area) and Central Italy (Pisa, urban area). We analyzed 2, 760 subjects (age range, 8 to 74 years).

The present study investigated the geographical variations in rhinitis in relation to atopy. The cross-sectional study involved 54, 178 children (aged 8 - 12 yrs) from 30 study centres in 22 countries worldwide. Symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis and rhinitis without conjunctivitis in the last 12 months were reported in parental questionnaires and children were <b>skin-prick</b> <b>tested.</b> The prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis and rhinitis without conjunctivitis varied widely (1. 5 - 24. 5 % and 1. 4 - 45. 2 %, respectively). For rhinoconjunctivitis, the population attributable fraction (PAF) varied 0 - 71 % for a positive <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> {{to one or more}} seasonal allergens and 0 - 41 % for perennial allergens. The PAF for sensitisation to seasonal and perennial allergens was higher in affluent countries (36 and 25 %, respectively) than nonaffluent countries (1. 3 and 12. 6 %, respectively). For rhinitis without conjunctivitis, the PAF for perennial allergens was 8 and 4 % for affluent and nonaffluent countries, respectively. No significant PAF was found for seasonal allergens. Overall, atopy explained only a limited proportion of rhinitis symptoms, suggesting that the importance of other environmental factors has been under emphasised, particularly in less affluent countries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of peanut allergy among children in Western countries {{has doubled in}} the past 10 years, and peanut allergy is becoming apparent in Africa and Asia. We evaluated strategies of peanut consumption and avoidance to determine which strategy is most effective in preventing the development of peanut allergy in infants at high risk for the allergy. METHODS: We randomly assigned 640 infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both to consume or avoid peanuts until 60 months of age. Participants, who were at least 4 months but younger than 11 months of age at randomization, were assigned to separate study cohorts on the basis of preexisting sensitivity to peanut extract, which was determined {{with the use of a}} <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> [...] one consisting of participants with no measurable wheal after testing and the other consisting of those with a wheal measuring 1 to 4 mm in diameter. The primary outcome, which was assessed independently in each cohort, was the proportion of participants with peanut allergy at 60 months of age. RESULTS: Among the 530 infants in the intention-to-treat population who initially had negative results on the <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test,</b> the {{prevalence of}} peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13. 7 % in the avoidance group and 1. 9 % in the consumption group (P< 0. 001). Among the 98 participants in the intention-to-treat population who initially had positive test results, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 35. 3 % in the avoidance group and 10. 6 % in the consumption group (P= 0. 004). There was no significant between-group difference in the incidence of serious adverse events. Increases in levels of peanut-specific IgG 4 antibody occurred predominantly in the consumption group; a greater percentage of participants in the avoidance group had elevated titers of peanut-specific IgE antibody. A larger wheal on the <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> and a lower ratio of peanut-specific IgG 4 :IgE were associated with peanut allergy. CONCLUSIONS: The early introduction of peanuts significantly decreased the frequency of the development of peanut allergy among children at high risk for this allergy and modulated immune responses to peanuts.

40|$|Background Current {{clinical}} advice regarding {{peanut allergy}} {{is based on}} small series of patients. Objective To determine, in {{a large group of}} peanut allergic subjects, the patterns of clinical severity, symptom progression and availability and use of rescue medications. Methods Questionnaire study of 622 self-reported allergic subjects Results A total of 406 patients (66 %) reported symptoms on contact with peanut. Only 121 (19 %) had been knowingly exposed to peanut before the first documented reaction, implying a high frequency of occult sensitization. Severe symptoms were more common in adults. Abdominal symptoms were significantly associated with collapse. Fifty per cent reported reactions in the previous year. Only 82 (13 %) had been admitted to hospital because of a reaction. Adrenaline was carried in some form by 65 % though only 78 subjects (12. 5 %) had ever received injected adrenaline. Only 18 / 43 subjects (41 %) who collapsed were given adrenaline. <b>Skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> weal size correlated weakly with severity but there were large overlaps between the groups. Peanut-specific IgE peaked in the teenage group, but did not correlate with severity. Conclusions Peanut allergy is characterized by more severe symptoms than other food allergies and by high rates of symptoms on minimal contact. <b>Skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> and peanut-specific IgE levels do not predict clinical severity.

A total of 88 highly trained ice hockey players and 47 control subjects were studied. All {{the subjects were}} subjected to <b>skin-prick</b> <b>tests,</b> resting spirometry examinations and histamine-challenge tests. Adequate induced sputum samples were obtained from 68 of the ice hockey players and from 18 symptom-free control subjects on a separate day. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in a histamine-challenge test was found in 21 (24 %) of the athletes and in five (11 %) of the controls. Current asthma (current asthmatic symptoms and increased bronchial responsiveness) was observed in 13 (15 %) of the athletes and in one (2 %) of the control subjects. Total asthma (current asthma or previously physician-diagnosed asthma) occurred in 19 (22 %) of the athletes and in two (4 %) of the controls.

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{bronchial}} hyperresponsiveness have previously {{been established in}} the general community. In settings where occupational asthma is a risk, {{it has not been}} established whether occupational sensitization or measures of exposure are important. Bronchial responsiveness to histamine was measured in a cohort of 506 workers exposed to acid anhydrides. <b>Skin-prick</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with conjugates of phthalic, maleic and trimellitic anhydride with human serum albumin and with common inhalant allergens. Employment and smoking histories were recorded. Occupational exposure was measured using personal air samplers and estimates of past exposure made by retrospective exposure assessment. Three hundred and seventy workers (73 %) had bronchial responsiveness measured (median age 39 yrs, range 18 - 77) and 46 (12 %) of these were hyperresponsive (provocative dose causing a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1; PD 20) < or = 8 micromol). Twelve (3 %) of these responsive workers had a <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> reaction to an acid anhydride conjugate, 124 (34 %) to a common inhalant allergen, and 148 (40 %) were current smokers. Multivariate analysis showed that occupational sensitization, sensitization to a common inhalant allergen, age, and pack-years of smoking were independent risk factors for bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Of these only occupational sensitization was completely independent of baseline FEV 1. It is concluded that sensitization to acid anhydrides is a significant risk factor for bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

In general, this method of blood testing (in-vitro, out of body) vs <b>skin-prick</b> <b>testing</b> (in-vivo, in body) has a major advantage: {{it is not always}} necessary to remove the patient from an anthihistamine medication regimen, and if the skin conditions (such as eczema) are so widespread that allergy skin testing cannot be done.

The aim was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of food allergy in Icelandic infants during their first year of life. Material and methods: Infants (n= 1, 341) were followed prospectively from birth to 12 months of age. Questionnaires were obtained at birth and 12 months. Children with symptoms of possible food allergy were assessed with a <b>skin-prick</b> <b>test</b> (SPT) and specific IgE. Food allergy was confirmed with a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Results: Out of 170 symptomatic children 44 infants (3. 27...|$|R
