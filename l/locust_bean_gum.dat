40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{determination}} of the physical/rheological characteristics is described for a series of commercial galactomannans of which the structural details have been reported previously. Both solubility of the galactomannans and rheological properties of galactomannan solutions and galactomannan/xanthan mixtures were determined. Using a statistical analysis approach an attempt was undertaken to recognize correlations between structural and rheological data. The best correlation found was between the abundance of galactose substituents at a regular distance (type of galactomannan) and the storage modulus (G') of mixed galactomannan/xanthan gels, underscoring the hypothesis that branching hinders the formation of a network with xanthan gum. Also, the G' for the group of <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>gums</b> correlated with the degree of blockiness, that is, the size and occurrence of nonsubstituted regions on the mannose backbone. In addition, galactomannans displayed an apparent decrease in gelling ability with increasing average molecular weight. That G' also relates to the type of galactomannan can therefore partly be attributed to differences in average molecular weight for the various galactomannan types. However, within the series of <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>gums</b> tested, also an increase of G' with molecular weight was observed. This {{can be explained by the}} decreasing number of loose ends of the polymers and the concomitant increasing efficiency in network participation with increasing molecular weight...|$|R

Methods: The microspheres were prepared by spray drying technique using <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> and xanthan <b>gums</b> as polymers.

30|$|Previous {{workers have}} {{observed}} that rural households in Nigeria derived up to 80 % of their incomes from the sales of NTFPs (Jimoh et al. 2013). In addition, Ogunsawa and Ajala (2002) and Zaku et al. (2013) reported that over 70 % of the country’s households depend directly on fuelwood as their main sources of energy, with daily consumption estimated at 27.5 million kg/day. Thus, harvesting and processing of NTFPs in many areas in the country have shifted from subsistence exploitation and sales at the local markets to international cross-boundary trade. For example, in the high forest zones of Eastern and Western Nigeria, harvesting of game meat and snails for sales are now major income generating activities almost all year round (Onuche 2011). While in the Savannah zone of Central and Northern Nigeria, honey, fuelwood, <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> seeds, <b>gum</b> arabic, and charcoal production generate lots of incomes for the rural households (Jimoh and Haruna 2007; Jimoh et al. 2013).

40|$|AbstractMany food {{products}} such as ice cream, yoghurt, and mayonnaise are some examples of emulsion-based food. The physicochemical properties of emulsions {{play an important role}} in food systems as they directly contribute to texture, sensory and nutritional properties of food. One of the main properties is stability which refers to the ability of an emulsion to resist physical changes over time. The aim of the present work was to analyze the effect of processing conditions and composition on sodium caseinate (NaCas) emulsions stability. The main destabilization mechanisms were identified and quantified. The relationship between them and the factors that influence them were also investigated. Emulsions stabilized with NaCas were prepared using an ultrasound liquid processor or a high pressure homogenizer. Stability of emulsions was followed by a Turbiscan (TMA 2000) which allows the optical characterization of any type of dispersion. The physical evolution of this process is followed without disturbing the original system and with good accuracy and reproducibility. To further describe systems, droplet size distribution was analyzed with light scattering equipment. The main mechanism of destabilization in a given formulation depended on different factors such as NaCas concentration, droplet size or processing conditions. The rate of destabilization was markedly lower with addition of sugar or a hydrocolloid to the aqueous phase. Xanthan (XG) and <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> (LBG) <b>gums</b> produced an increase in viscosity of the continuous phase and structural changes in emulsions such as gelation. Sugars interacted with the protein decreasing particle size and increasing emulsion stability. The stability of caseinate emulsions was strongly affected not only by the oil-to-protein ratio but also by processing conditions and composition of aqueous phase. The structure of the protein and the interactions protein–sugar or the presence of a hydrocolloid played a key role in creaming and flocculation processes of these emulsions...|$|R

50|$|Guar gum is more soluble than <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>gum,</b> as it {{has more}} {{galactose}} branch points. Unlike <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>gum,</b> it is not self-gelling. However, either borax or calcium can cross-link guar gum, causing it to gel. In water, it is nonionic and hydrocolloidal. It is not affected by ionic strength or pH, but will degrade at extreme pH and temperature (e.g. pH 3 at 50 °C). It remains stable in solution over pH range 5-7. Strong acids cause hydrolysis and loss of viscosity, and alkalies in strong concentration also tend to reduce viscosity. It is insoluble in most hydrocarbon solvents. The viscosity attained is dependent on time, temperature, concentration, pH, rate of agitation and practical size of the powdered gum used.
