5000|$|The Baumol-Tobin {{model is}} an {{economic}} model of the transactions demand for money as developed independently by William Baumol (1952) and James Tobin (1956). The theory relies on the tradeoff between the <b>liquidity</b> <b>provided</b> by holding money (the ability to carry out transactions) and the interest forgone by holding one’s assets {{in the form of}} non-interest bearing money. The key variables of the demand for money are then the nominal interest rate, the level of real income that corresponds to the amount of desired transactions, and the fixed transaction costs of transferring one’s wealth between liquid money and interest-bearing assets. The model was originally developed to provide microfoundations for aggregate money demand functions commonly used in Keynesian and monetarist macroeconomic models of the time. Later, the model was extended to a general equilibrium setting by Boyan Jovanovic (1982) and David Romer (1986).|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} views on this question, {{the money and the}} banking view: the money view, as argued, for example, by Goodfriend and King, and Capie, suggests, that the lender of last resort should provide {{liquidity}} to the market by open market operations only because it suffices to limit panics. What they call [...] "banking policy" [...] (discount window lending) may even be harmful because of moral hazard. The banking view finds that in reality the market does not allocate liquidity efficiently in times of crisis. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>provided</b> through open market operations is not efficiently distributed among banks in the interbank market, and there is a case for discount window lending. In a well-functioning interbank market only solvent banks can borrow. However, if the market is not functioning, even solvent banks may be unable to borrow, most likely because of asymmetric information.|$|E

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this paper show that integrative financial and operating measures of <b>liquidity</b> <b>provide</b> investors and creditors with additional information beyond that provided by static measures of short-term liquidity such as the current and quick ratios. Analyzing a sample of restaurant firms over the period 1994 - 2003, our analysis of these dynamic measures of <b>liquidity</b> <b>provide</b> a drastically different view of short-term solvency than those produced from the static measures. Specifically, the static measures of liquidity imply that restaurant companies are not liquid However, restaurant companies, when evaluated under this integrative framework, were shown to be more liquid based on their financial and operating liquidity than their current and quick ratios implied. Thus, financial analysts, creditors and managers should evaluate both dynamic liquidity measures as well as static measures in their evaluation of the risk associated with covering their short-term obligations when evaluating the short-term financial liquidity and short-term credit worthiness of firms. In addition, careful attention should be paid to both financial and operating measures of liquidity to establish what changes, if any, have occurred in a company’s liquidity position over time. This is an important finding for managers and investors in all industries since short-term illiquidity implies a high risk of default if the banks refuse to refinance {{all or part of the}} debt. This in turn may impact the cost of short-term financing and may result in an impact on their overall financing costs and required returns from equity investors...|$|R

The critical assumption is that nancial markets are characterized by limited enforcement of con-tracts, and, in the event of default only a fraction of borrowersassets can be seized. Limited enforcement reduces the fraction of assets that count as collateral and thus individuals with liquidity shocks face bor-rowing constraints.

To attract trading volume, most exchanges introduced makertaker fees, an incentive scheme that rewards liquidity suppliers and charges liquidity demanders.

Although posted liquidity improves, after accounting for the fees, trading costs are unaffected. Yet trading behavior changed, and liquidity suppliers benefitted through decreased adverse selection.
