5|$|Moran {{introduced}} and supported legislation to increase benefits {{and pay for}} federal workers, {{in part due to}} the Federal Government’s large presence within the 8th District – 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He introduced a bill signed into <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> a federal worker’s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity. In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce.|$|E

25|$|Special {{elections}} for lieutenant governor were forbidden by {{an amendment to}} the State Constitution after the death of Thomas W. Wallace and subsequent election of Joe R. Hanley in 1943, and according to traditional interpretation of the statute, there is no provision in state <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> the governor and legislature to appoint a replacement, as there is with other statewide positions. As a result, it was suggested that the stalemate could continue until the 2010 elections, when a Lieutenant Governor would be elected.|$|E
25|$|Before 2010, {{the usage}} of PGD was in a legal grey area. In 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that PGD {{can be used in}} {{exceptional}} cases. On 7 July 2011, the Bundestag passed a <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> PGD in certain cases. The procedure may only be used when there is a strong likelihood that parents will pass on a genetic disease, or when there is a high genetic chance of a stillbirth or miscarriage. On 1 February 2013, the Bundesrat approved a rule regulating how PGD can be used in practice.|$|E

25|$|Toubou legal customs are {{generally}} based on Islamic <b>law,</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> restitution and revenge. Murder, for example, is settled directly between {{the families of}} the victim and the murderer. Toubou honour requires that someone from the victim's family try to kill the murderer or a relative; such efforts eventually end with negotiations to settle the matter. Reconciliation follows the payment of the Goroga (Islamic tenet of Diyya), or blood money. Among the Tomagra clan of the Teda people in the Tibesti region, there is a derde (spiritual head). He is recognized as the clan judge, who arbitrates conflict and levies sanctions.|$|E
25|$|In a {{move that}} some saw as a {{reaction}} to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed anti-secession <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> the use of force on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in Macau between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct-cross strait charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan during the Lunar New Year Period.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{government}} was showing a more indulgent attitude toward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which purpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and investments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an inflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the case of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, Águila was arrested under charges of dangerousness, a <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> the authorities to detain people whom they think are likely to commit crimes; even when they have not yet committed them.|$|E

During summer 1973, it broadcast separate stations in English and Dutch simultaneously, on 389 mtr – 773 and 252 mtr (announced as 259) 1187kHz. Two aerials and twin transmitters were used for about six weeks until the aerial mast failed. To accommodate the second aerial, a second short mast, {{just in front of}} the bridge, was employed as the other end for the main mast.|$|E
25|$|The Congress of the Philippines enacted Republic Act No. 9522, {{also known}} as the Archipelagic Baselines Law, which is the basis of the claim. According to the {{document}} the region is bounded by the Philippine Basin on the north and east, and by Luzon on the west and south. It asserted that, according to scientific data based on seismic, magnetic, other geological features, the Benham Rise is an extension of the Philippines’ continental shelf. In summary, the baselines, the basis used for delineating the maritime territorial and jurisdictional zones (including the continental shelf), conform with the requirements of the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The claim is only a partial claim since the <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> the Philippines to expand its territorial boundaries also includes islands in the South China Sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasonable}} relation test {{applied to}} Article 12(1) by the Privy Council {{has been applied}} {{in a number of}} local and foreign cases. It was reformulated into a three-stage test by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong (1998). The Court applied {{a modified version of the}} test to situations involving the discriminatory application of neutral laws in Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), and expressed the view that Article 12(1) would only be infringed in such cases where there was intentional and arbitrary discrimination, or inequalities due to inadvertence or inefficiency on a very substantial scale. The element of arbitrariness was also mentioned by the Court in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) – it said a <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> a public authority to exercise arbitrary discretionary power is in violation of Article 12(1).|$|E

25|$|In December 2015, Sweden {{passed a}} {{temporary}} <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> {{the government to}} oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and is valid until 21 December 2018. The government decided that the new rules will apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The new law led to the mandatory train change and passage though border control at Copenhagen Airport for travellers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency. Sweden introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), but that could not stop the migrant flow, since {{they have the right}} to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground. First when the transport companies had to stop foreigners on the Danish side, asylum seekers were efficiently stopped. This caused considerable disruption to the train traffic since the railway station did not have capacity for such checks.|$|E
500|$|A 501(h) {{election}} or Conable {{election is}} a procedure in United States tax <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization {{to participate in}} lobbying that is limited only by the financial expenditure on that lobbying, regardless of its overall extent. [...] This allows organizations taking the 501(h) election to potentially perform {{a large amount of}} lobbying if it is done using volunteer labor or through inexpensive means. [...] The 501(h) election is available to most types of 501(c)(3) organizations that are not churches or private foundations.

500|$|According to author John Hagen, Toronto's then-mayor, William Dennison, was openly {{antagonistic}} to {{the influx}} of American hippies, draft resisters, and those who supported them who were coming to Canada in large numbers {{during the height of}} the Vietnam War. In his 2001 book, Northern Passage: American Vietnam War Resisters in Canada, Hagen wrote: [...] "The mayors of Canada's largest cities used the (War Measures Act) in a backlash against American war resisters." [...] Dennison stated: [...] "a few hippies and deserters are Toronto's only problem." [...] Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal asserted that military resisters were part of a [...] "revolutionary conspiracy." [...] Vancouver's mayor, Tom Campbell, commented: [...] "I don't like draft dodgers and I'll do anything within the <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> me to get rid of them." [...] While all three men supported use of the War Measures Act to harass war resisters and hippies, Campbell was the most aggressive; he told the Toronto Star: [...] "I believe the law should be used against any revolutionary whether he's a US draft dodger or a hippie." [...] According to Hagen, the RCMP and the FBI cooperated in their effort to harass American war resisters during the late 1960s.|$|E

500|$|A {{section of}} critics {{wrote on the}} {{relevance}} of the movie to the current times. In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy. He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, [...] "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps. Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village. Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that [...] "we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East, racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if they live in a society that embraces or condemns diversity.|$|E
