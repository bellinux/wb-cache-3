5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the early}} fully {{imported}} 200B sedans and coupes retained the {{independent rear suspension}} from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched to coil springs with a <b>live</b> <b>axle,</b> while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> in the rear with leaf springs. Seen as a giant step backwards, {{the reason for the}} change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car's overall handling dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} unequal length control arms with torsion bars, while the rear suspension used a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> supported by asymmetric leaf springs. Chrysler used this design {{through the entire}} production of the Valiant and other A-body models, with revisions to the suspension components themselves for the 1962, 1967, 1968, and 1973 models.|$|E
50|$|The Prince Sedan AISH had <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> {{in front}} and the back.|$|R
25|$|All models had {{a ladder}} frame with three <b>live</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem axles on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms.|$|R
50|$|The M809 series had {{a ladder}} frame with three <b>live</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on leaf springs and the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms.|$|R
25|$|Braking duties were {{handled by}} 11.3-inch discs {{up front and}} drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front {{suspension}} consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a <b>live</b> <b>axle,</b> with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.|$|E
25|$|At {{the level}} of suspensions, the 250 GT Lusso had double {{wishbones}} and coil springs at the front, while the rear suspension comprised a <b>live</b> <b>axle,</b> leaf springs, semi-elliptical concentric coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers. Braking was provided by four-wheel disc brakes with hydraulic control, placed behind the polished aluminum Borrani wire wheels with single knockoffs.|$|E
25|$|The Riviera's {{suspension}} used Buick's standard design, {{with double}} wishbones {{up front and}} a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> located by trailing arms and a lateral track bar in the rear, but the roll centers were raised to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards understeer, contemporary testers considered {{it one of the}} most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.|$|E
50|$|The <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> are {{connected}} to the mainframe by a torque-rod as well as by radius-rods. The live shafts inside the back axle take none of the weight of the car.|$|R
2500|$|Most models had {{a ladder}} frame with three <b>live</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. The exception was the crane truck, {{which had a}} walking beam rear suspension for stability.|$|R
50|$|In {{development}} from 1996 (styling by Cliff Wilkins finalized in 1998), the third-generation Ram was unveiled on February 7, 2001 at the 2001 Chicago Auto Show, and debuted for 2002 model year on 1500 models and 2003 on 2500 and 3500 models. This {{was a major}} update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> {{in favor of an}} independent front suspension, but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> for maximum longevity and durability. This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.|$|R
25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (unibody) construction with four-wheel independent air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> design. This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|E
25|$|For the Japanese {{domestic}} market, the 610 was {{pitted against}} {{the second generation}} Toyota Corona Mark II. Also in Japan, the 610 was initially sold alongside the 510 but eventually replaced the 510. 610's were available as a four-door, two-door hardtop (HT), and a five-door wagon/light van. Trim levels in Japan were GL (Grand Luxe), SSS (Super Sports Sedan), DX (Deluxe) or STD (Standard). It borrowed its suspension and drive train from the outgoing 510, with some modifications. Likewise, the 610 four-door and two-door retained the class-leading, independent rear trailing arm design, while the wagon reused the rear <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> with leaf springs from the 510 wagon.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, TVR {{built its}} first {{original}} chassis. The Hotchkis-style rear suspension used the <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> from a Morris Eight, {{and the front}} suspension was of an independent trailing-arm design. The engine was a Ford 1172cc sidevalve from a 1936 van, tuned to 35hp. Even before the car was bodied, it was crashed by the man hired to create the bodywork, Les Dale. After repairs, the body was styled and built from aluminium, and painted British racing green. Although neither Wilkinson nor Pickard found the finished bodywork to be very aesthetically appealing, it was functional, {{and the two men}} conducted the first successful test drive on the runway at Squires Gate aerodrome in 1949. Later that year, TVR Number One was sold to Wilkinson's cousin for £325. It was later crashed and salvaged for parts.|$|E

50|$|The chassis was 6x6, {{with three}} <b>live</b> beam <b>axles,</b> adapted and {{strengthened}} for {{conditions in the}} USSR. It had a reinforced ladder frame with three <b>live</b> beam <b>axles,</b> the front on semi elliptical leaf springs, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms.|$|R
25|$|For 2007, Ford's Special Vehicle Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 rear drive ratio. Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear. Brembo 14-inch disc brakes with aluminum four-piston calipers are on the front with 11.8-inch disc brakes with single-piston calipers in the rear.|$|E
25|$|In North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the Datsun 810 from February 1977 to 1980—the direct {{ancestor}} {{of the long}} running Datsun/Nissan Maxima range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by {{two versions of the}} SOHC L-series I6 engine: a 2.0L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4L24E unit (as found in the Datsun 240Z) for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a carburetor for the base model and fuel injection for the sporty version. The 2.0L engine was good for 122PS JIS (90kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125hp SAE (93kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed manual transmission for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were rear-wheel drive and had a semi-trailing arm rear suspension. The station wagon variant, only sold in North America, had a rear <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> for load carrying reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.|$|E
500|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a pressed steel ladder frame with channel-section side members and {{fabricated}} and tubular cross members. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs and Watson Stabilator dampers front and rear, with a tubular beam axle at the front and a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> and radius rods at the rear. The standard wheelbase was , [...] with a wheelbase of [...] available for seven-passenger bodies. The front and rear tracks were both [...] wide. Center-locking wire wheels with 5" [...] x 33" [...] tires were used front and rear.|$|E
50|$|Swing axles were supplanted {{in general}} use by De Dion tube axles {{in the late}} 1960s, though <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> {{remained}} the most common. Most rear suspensions {{have been replaced by}} more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and deDion types are virtually unused today.|$|R

50|$|The {{two major}} {{complaints}} {{of the vehicle}} in the civilian market were poor fuel consumption and poor ride quality especially in the rear seats. The suspension was indeed harsh with <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> and leaf springs all around. It features almost no creature comforts, like power-windows and power-assisted steering.|$|R
500|$|The {{acquisition}} by Pigozzi {{took place}} in July 1954, just when Ford was poised to launch its new, modern Vedette, with a four-door saloon body of [...] "American" [...] style, much like the contemporary British Fords or Vauxhalls. The car was powered by an unusually small 2351cc sidevalve V8 engine called Aquillon in France, derived from Ford's Flathead engine family, whose displacement positioned the car into the [...] "13CV" [...] French tax class. Equipped with a two-barrel Zenith-Stromberg 32NX carburetor, it produced [...] Power {{was transferred to the}} rear <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> through a three-speed manual transmission with column shift. The Vedette had independent front suspension (by MacPherson struts) and drum brakes on all four wheels.|$|E
500|$|The Girling-manufactured brakes used [...] discs at {{the front}} and [...] drums at the rear. The {{suspension}} was independent {{at the front}}, using coil springs, and at the rear had a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> and semi-elliptic springs. Apart from {{the addition of a}} Panhard rod to better locate the rear axle, and stiffer front springs to cope with the weight of the V8 engine, the Tiger's suspension and braking systems are identical to that of the standard Alpine. The fitting points for the Panhard rod interfered with the upright spare wheel in the boot, which was repositioned to lie horizontally beneath a false floor; the battery was moved from beneath the rear seat to the boot at the same time. The kerb weight of the car increased from the [...] of the standard Alpine to [...]|$|E
500|$|Two {{transmissions}} {{were available}} for the BA—a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual, both floor-mounted. The automatic unit featured Sequential Sports Shift, a first for the Falcon nameplate in Australia. Utility body styles were also available with an optional column-mounted automatic shifter (without Sequential Sports Shift) {{in lieu of the}} floor-mounted system also offered. The new Control-Blade independent rear suspension (IRS) fitted to all sedans—first used in development of the Ford Focus and the Jaguar X-Type— was superior to the optional double wishbone IRS suspension used on AU sedans, and was cheaper. However, it was heavier than the previous live rear axle used for base models, and the change contributed to the base model XT sedan's [...] weight increase from the previous model. The wagons and utilities retained the leaf spring <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension of the AU wagon and utility; consequently, they did not gain as much weight as the sedan.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{started with}} three models, all fours: a <b>live</b> <b>axled</b> [...] and a [...] and [...] model, both chain-driven. These were likely the first {{automobiles}} to have pressure-lubricated camshafts. The bodies were attached with just four bolts, and the brakes were water-cooled, from a 2 imp gal reservoir.|$|R
50|$|G is the {{so-called}} design-group. As {{you can see from}} the above explanation, even very different vehicles can have the same Y ASW. G is used to distinguish between various designs with the same number of <b>live</b> <b>axles,</b> maximum speed and weight. For example, 464.0 and 464.1 were totally different designs.|$|R

2500|$|The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front {{suspension}} with reverse [...] "L" [...] {{lower control}} arms. The rear suspension {{was a new}} three-link system with a Panhard Rod that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle. This <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension, while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent rear suspensions. In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> system. At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent rear suspension would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.|$|E
2500|$|The 501 was an all-new platform, with a {{perimeter}} frame, double A-arm front suspension with {{torsion bar}} springs, and a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> with torsion bar springs at the rear. [...] The steering mechanism {{was similar to}} a rack and pinion system except that the rack was semi-circular instead of straight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{independent}} front suspension used a transverse mounted {{leaf spring}} mounted above the wheel centre line. The hubs were located with [...] the spring mounts {{at the top and}} control arms at the bottom. [...] The rear suspension used a <b>live</b> <b>axle</b> on semi-elliptic leaf springs, a conventional system neither as advanced nor as troublesome as the 3/20's swing axles.|$|E
50|$|The Jeep XJ {{utilizes}} {{front and}} rear solid (<b>live)</b> <b>axles</b> as opposed to independent {{front and rear}} axles. This configuration allows the XJ to have superior off-road capability and performance {{at the expense of}} some on-road comfort and driveability. Mid-1985 and later two-wheel drive models used the same basic suspension with a single tube connecting axle ends with no differential.|$|R
5000|$|The Samurai {{continued}} for sale outside the United States (where the newer version {{is referred to}} as the 'Coily'), with a substantial update in November 1995. This included a coil spring suspension, though the <b>live</b> <b>axles</b> were retained.
