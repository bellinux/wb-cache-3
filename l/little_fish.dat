25|$|On March 2, 1889, {{just months}} before North Dakota and South Dakota were {{admitted}} to the Union on November 2, 1889, Congress passed an Act which partitioned the Great Sioux Reservation and created five smaller reservations. Blue Horse, Red Cloud and other Oglala Lakota leaders spoke against the Act and refused to sign the bill. Red Cloud referred to provisions of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), arguing that the terms had not been fulfilled, and that payment for what was due must be made before giving up more land. In response, General George Crook disparaged Red Cloud and threatened that the Indians will be swallowed like <b>little</b> <b>fish</b> by the whites unless they agreed to sign the bill. Red Cloud was enraged and asked the Indians who signed the bill and the Commissioners to leave the reservation. Despite the protests and legal arguments of Oglala Lakota leaders, the Great Sioux Reservation was partitioned.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s Gielgud had more successes as a {{director}} than as an actor. He directed the first London performance of Britten's opera A Midsummer Night's Dream (1961) at Covent Garden and Hugh Wheeler's Big Fish, <b>Little</b> <b>Fish</b> on Broadway, the latter winning him a Tony for Best Direction of a Play in 1961. His performance as Othello at Stratford {{in the same year}} was less successful; Franco Zeffirelli's production was thought ponderous and Gielgud [...] "singularly unvehement." [...] As Gaev in The Cherry Orchard to the Ranevskaya of Ashcroft he had the best of the notices; his co-star and the production received mixed reviews. The following year Gielgud directed Richardson in The School for Scandal, first at the Haymarket and then on a North American tour, which he joined as, in his words, [...] "the oldest Joseph Surface in the business." ...|$|E

[...] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "As eye-popping as Nemo's peepers and as eccentric as this <b>little</b> <b>fish</b> with asymmetrical fins." [...] David Germain of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from Toy Story onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation." [...] The 3D re-release prompted a retrospective on the film nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger described it as [...] "a genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic." [...] On the 3D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by [...] "the dimensionality of the oceanic deep" [...] where [...] "the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3D explorers were born to boldly go".|$|E
