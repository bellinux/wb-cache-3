5|$|When Frederick III of Habsburg {{ascended to}} the throne, the Swiss {{suddenly}} faced {{a new situation}} {{in which they could}} no longer count on support from the empire. Worse yet, conflicts with the Habsburg dukes threatened to become conflicts with the empire itself. Under Frederick's reign, this did not occur yet. Frederick had sided in 1442 against the confederacy in the Old Zürich War where he had supported the city of Zürich, and he also refused to reconfirm the imperial immediacy {{of the members of the}} Confederacy. But Frederick's troubled reign did not <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> military operations against the Swiss. In Austria, Frederick was in conflict first with his brother Albert and then faced the pressure of Matthias Corvinus, who even drove him from Vienna and forced Frederick's court to assume an itinerant lifestyle.|$|E

25|$|For Marx and Engels, then, {{the ruling}} classes control the {{subordinate}} classes through {{domination of the}} ideas available in the culture. In this way the subordinate classes {{are said to be}} mediated by the effects of ideology, or “false consciousness” or a belief system that doesn’t allow them to see the oppression they are enduring for what it is. The problem with this idea, as many Marxists have noted, is that it doesn’t <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> members of the subordinate classes to act on the world around them through alternate forms of mediation.|$|E

Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting myopic prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began {{to be seen as}} an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.|$|E

25|$|Antipas' {{fall from}} power {{was due to}} Caligula and to his own nephew Agrippa, brother of Herodias. When Agrippa fell into debt {{during the reign of}} Tiberius despite his {{connections}} with the imperial family, Herodias persuaded Antipas to provide for him, but the two men quarrelled and Agrippa departed. After Agrippa was heard expressing to his friend Caligula his eagerness for Tiberius to die and <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> Caligula to succeed him, he was imprisoned. When Caligula finally became emperor in 37 AD, he not only released his friend but granted him rule of Philip's former tetrarchy (slightly extended), with the title of king.|$|E
25|$|Yet another impetus of both RISC {{and other}} designs came from {{practical}} measurements on real-world programs. Andrew Tanenbaum summed up many of these, demonstrating that processors often had oversized immediates. For instance, he showed that 98% {{of all the}} constants in a program would fit in 13 bits, yet many CPU designs dedicated 16 or 32 bits to store them. This suggests that, {{to reduce the number}} of memory accesses, a fixed length machine could store constants in unused bits of the instruction word itself, so that they would be immediately ready when the CPU needs them (much like immediate addressing in a conventional design). This required small opcodes in order to <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a reasonably sized constant in a 32-bit instruction word.|$|E
25|$|Some aspects {{attributed}} to the first RISC-labeled designs around 1975 include the observations that the memory-restricted compilers of the time were often unable {{to take advantage of}} features intended to facilitate manual assembly coding, and that complex addressing modes take many cycles to perform due to the required additional memory accesses. It was argued that such functions would be better performed by sequences of simpler instructions if this could yield implementations small enough to <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> many registers, reducing the number of slow memory accesses. In these simple designs, most instructions are of uniform length and similar structure, arithmetic operations are restricted to CPU registers and only separate load and store instructions access memory. These properties enable a better balancing of pipeline stages than before, making RISC pipelines significantly more efficient and allowing higher clock frequencies.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen {{reflected}} {{on the possibility of}} one or more sequels: [...] "This has definitely been set up {{in a way that will}} allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow." [...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the other two movies." ...|$|E

If Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey were lying to protect Stone and give him an alibi, then logically, they would alibi him for the entire time period.

On the other hand, if their alibi is imperfect, then it still <b>leaves</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the crime to be committed.|$|R

500|$|The title Christ, or Messiah, {{indicates}} that Jesus' followers believed {{him to be}} the anointed heir of King David, whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as [...] "the Messiah" [...] or, equivalently, [...] "the Christ". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as [...] "his Messiah". The tradition is ambiguous enough to <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, Gerd Theissen advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title [...] "Messiah". Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit {{in the sense that he}} would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, not in the sense that most people today think of the term.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as [...] "chaotic"; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a [...] "dense, clobbering sledgehammer", while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it [...] "manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis". The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn't <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the [...] "nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking," [...] as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as “heavy punk rock”, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. “Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, which I think is a very incorrect statement, because I feel like that’s a very pre-calculated, ‘this is weird because this time signature doesn’t go with this time…’. It’s very planned out. We’re not that smart.” ...|$|E
500|$|A {{master and}} [...] "usher" [...] (deputy headteacher) {{were to be}} {{appointed}} by the city out of the revenues assigned to them, who were required {{to have a good}} knowledge of classical languages, namely Latin and Greek. Additionally, the master was required to be a university graduate, of [...] "sound religion", and not to take on additional work. The salary of the usher was £6. 13s. 4d. and the master a [...] "handsome" [...] sum of £10, which by 1636 had risen to £50. The 1566 statutes declared the school was to provide Greek and Latin instruction for 90 sons of Norwich citizens free of expense and up to ten fee-paying pupils. By the 19th century the city was observed to generally <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> as many boarders and other day scholars to sufficiently remunerate the teachers. Admission was limited to boys thought to benefit from the education offered, and the school was highly selective as a result. The education was based on erudition, the eventual goal being that by the age of 18 the pupils would have learned [...] "to vary one sentence diversely, to make a verse exactly, to [...] an epistle eloquently and learnedly, to declaim of a theme simple, and last of all to attain some competent knowledge of the Greek tongue". Pupils were taught rhetoric based on the Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Greek centred around the works of Homer and Virgil. In addition to classical literature, etiquette was taught as both were deemed fundamental to a good education. Edward Coke studied at the school at the age of eight from 1560 until 1567, where he {{is said to have been}} taught to value the [...] "forcefulness of freedom of speech", something he later applied as a judge.|$|E

500|$|The game's audio {{was created}} by Martin Stig Andersen, a {{graduate}} from the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus. Andersen's specialisation was in acousmatic music, non-traditional music created from generated sounds that have no apparent visual source. He was drawn to work with Jensen on the game after seeing the initial trailer, having been drawn in by the expressions of the boy character; Andersen compared the early visuals to his acousmatic music: [...] "you have something recognizable and realistic, {{but at the same}} time it's abstract". Andersen sought to create acousmatic music exclusively incorporating the sound effects of the game's environments. Two examples he pointed to was the use of electricity noises while in the presence of a ruined neon [...] "HOTEL" [...] sign, and silencing the wind sound as the spider approached the boy in the forest. Andersen avoided the use of easily recognizable sounds, distorting them when needed as to allow players to interpret the sounds' meanings for themselves. Andersen constructed most of the game's sounds through a number of [...] "grains" [...] instead of longer sound loops, allowing him to adjust the playback to give better feedback to the player without sounding repetitious; one example he cites was the use of separate sounds for the boy's toe and heel when they make contact with the ground, giving a more realistic sound for movement. Many reviews for the game stated that there was no music in Limbo, but Andersen countered that his sound arrangements helped to evoke emotions; the acousmatic music was intended to <b>leave</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> interpretation by the player in the same manner as the game's art and story. Andersen noted that this helps with immersion within the game by making no attempt to control the emotional tone; [...] "if [...] scared it will probably make them more scared when there's no music to take them by the hand and tell them how to feel". Due to fans' requests, Playdead released the game's soundtrack on iTunes Store on 11 July 2011.|$|E
