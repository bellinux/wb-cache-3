This paper employs a structural approach to simultaneously examine the demand-side (consumer-related) and supply-side (bank-related) determinants of the quick spread of FX-based banking. The econometric analysis uses a unique newly constructed dataset on FX <b>and</b> domestic <b>currency</b> <b>loans,</b> <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> interest rates, covering 16 CEECs overtime.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the methodologies {{employed in the}} U. S. international economic accounts, in valuing direct investment in prices of the current period. Under international standards, all {{of the components of}} the international investment position should reflect current period prices, rather than historical cost or book values. Virtually all of the categories in the international investment position accounts except direct investment positions can be directly estimated in prices of the current period with reference to readily observable market prices. For example, the value of positions in portfolio investment securities, gold, <b>loans,</b> <b>currencies,</b> <b>and</b> bank <b>deposits</b> can be directly estimated based on face values or market prices of recent transactions. In contrast, direct investment positions typically involve illiquid ownership interests in companies that may possess many unique attributes - such as customer base, management, and ownership of intangible assets - whose value in the current period are difficult to determine, because there is no widely accepted standard for revaluing company financial statements at historical cost into prices of the current period. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{sequence}} of the reform is to liberalize the interest rate of foreign currency before that of domestic currency, lending before <b>deposit,</b> large amount <b>and</b> long term before small amount and short term. As a first step, the PBOC liberalized the interest rates for foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> large <b>deposits</b> (US$3 million <b>and</b> over) in September 2000. Rate for deposits below US$3 million remain subject to PBOC control. In March 2002, the PBOC unified foreign currency interest rate policies for Chinese and foreign financial institutions in China. Small foreign exchange deposits of Chinese residents with foreign banks in China {{were included in the}} PBOC interest rate administration of small foreign exchange deposits, so that domestic and foreign financial institutions are treated fairly with regard to the interest rate policy of foreign exchange deposits.|$|R

50|$|Another {{way to look}} at the {{monetary}} multiplier is derived from the concept of money supply and money base. It is the number of dollars of money supply that can be created for every dollar of monetary base. Money supply, denoted by M, is the stock of money held by public. It is measured by the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits.</b> Money Base, denoted by B, is the summation of <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> reserves. <b>Currency</b> <b>and</b> Reserves are monetary policy that can be affected by the Federal Reserve. For example, the Federal Reserve can increase currency by printing more money and they can similarly increase reserve by requiring a higher percentage of deposits to be stored in the Federal Reserve.|$|R

Among the notable results pertaining to long-run dynamics, more competitive financial intermediaries are associated with a higher share of <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> a lower share of equity.

Consumption in the model can be purchased with <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits,</b> <b>and</b> ES in intermediation implies that deposit costs are decreasing in aggregate deposits. The results suggest that indeterminacy does not depend on a large degree of ES nor a large intermediation sector, but on monetary policy and the determination of nominal interest rates. Monetary policies not targeting nominal rates allow for indeterminacy to arise for any degree of ES, while policies targeting nominal rates eliminates indeterminacy for all degrees of ES. ...|$|R

40|$|Most Central, Eastern and Southeastern European (CESEE) {{countries}} saw {{a substantial}} rise in foreign currency lending to households {{during the last}} decade. This involved risks to macrofinancial stability, in particular because most of these borrowers were unhedged. This paper provides evidence on eleven CESEE countries regarding (1) the extent of foreign currency lending to households from 1995 to 2009, (2) the supply and demand factors {{at work in the}} period before the crisis and (3) the regulatory responses to address the situation. Panel data estimates covering the period from 1996 to 2007 reveal that, on the demand side, foreign currency borrowing was attractive because interest rates for foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> were lower than those on domestic <b>currency</b> <b>loans,</b> <b>and</b> private sector consumption as well as housing prices were on the rise.
