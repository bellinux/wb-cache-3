He was elected in 1975, and reelected in 1978, {{as president of the}} Steel Workers' Union of São Bernardo do Campo and Diadema. Both cities are located in the ABCD Region, home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and others, and are among the most industrialized in the country. In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. Labour courts found the strikes illegal, and Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and <b>like</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension {{after the fall of the}} military régime.|$|E

Wilson, Gary Becker's 1965 article titled [...] "Crime and Punishment" [...] and George Stigler's 1970 article [...] "The Optimum Enforcement of Laws". Rational choice theory argues that criminals, <b>like</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> weigh costs/risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms. They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk and {{his family}} did not enjoy the {{benefits}} of white men. His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He stroked his breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing a coat and vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress <b>like</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> and have plenty to eat all the time, much of the time he was hungry and could not buy medicine or go to the doctor when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross. Sadly, it was rumored that Chief Flying Hawk died of starvation.|$|E
