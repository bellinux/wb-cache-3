2500|$|Between 1889 and 1928, {{the bank}} {{operated}} {{as the state}} bank and bank of issue of Iran, and held a virtual monopoly on banking in the country. Sir William Keswick was the bank's chairman. The bank was principally funded by Glyn, Mills & Co., J. Henry Schröder & Co. and David Sassoon & Co.. Despite holding a monopoly, the bank's management was farcical, according to Geoffrey Jones, and the bank struggled to make a profit. However, Jones also notes that British banks in this period were allowed to disguise their profits by making transfers to or from [...] "inner" [...] or [...] "secret" [...] reserves before reaching their published profits figure. The Imperial bank's real profits were on average {{twice as high as}} the published profits between 1890 and 1952. [...] The bank contributed to the Iranian economy by mobilizing domestic savings, but many were doubtful of the real use of these savings as the Bank was often [...] "discriminated against Persians in giving credit". In 1927, 80% of the <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> in Bushehr, Shiraz and Esfahan were to finance Iranian export of Opium, whereas most of the loans in the northern cities related to the trade with Russia. The imperial bank did not employ locals as managers; in contrast, the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was mixed British, French and Turkish ownership employed middle eastern nationals in managerial positions. The bank's first owner, Joseph Rabino, born in London to an Italian Jewish family, was always regarded with great suspicion by his board.|$|E

Methodology: We used a qualitative and deductive scientific method. The empirical material and data has been collected through four face-to-face interviews with three major banks operating in Umeå. Conclusions: We found that financial and accounting information is significant during credit assessment for SMEs, {{especially when it comes}} to evaluate their repayment ability and control of their financial stability. Still, there are other factors that play a major roll and have therefore to be taken into consideration such as acquaintance and what the loan is going to be used for.
