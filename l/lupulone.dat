40|$|<b>Lupulone,</b> a β-acid {{derived from}} hop {{extracts}} {{has been shown}} to exhibit cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. In this study we investigated the functional role of different modes of cell death that mediate anticancer effect of <b>lupulone</b> derivatives in prostate cancer cells. ELISA, immunoblotting and siRNA approaches were utilised to study cell death, expression of proteins of interest and their functional activities. We found that the anticancer effect of <b>lupulone</b> derivatives on prostate cancer cells is associated with induction of apoptosis and autophagy as determined by increases of DNA fragmentation and LC 3 I/ LC 3 II conversion respectively. Inhibition of apoptosis using a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in increased levels of autophagy. Following screening of proteins associated with autophagy we found that Atg 4 β expression was increased in prostate cancer cells after treatment with <b>lupulone.</b> Transfection of cells with siRNA against Atg 4 β resulted in increased levels of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with <b>lupulone</b> derivatives initiated two modes of cell death: apoptosis as a killing pathway and autophagy as a protection against cell death. Further studies are required to investigate the regulation of Atg 4 β activity in <b>lupulone</b> derivatives-induced negative crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Owing to {{the spread}} of {{antibiotic}} resistance among human infectious agents, {{there is a need to}} research antibiotic alternatives for use in animal agricultural systems. Antibiotic-free broiler chicken production systems are known to suffer from frequent outbreaks of necrotic enteritis due in part to pathogenic type A Clostridium perfringens. Hop (Humulus lupulus) bitter acids are known to possess potent antimicrobial activity. <b>Lupulone</b> was evaluated for in vivo antimicrobial activity to inhibit C. perfringens in a chick gastrointestinal colonization model. Methods: Using a week- 2 per os inoculated C. perfringens chicken colonization model, C. perfringens counts in mid-intestinal and caecal contents were compared between chickens administered <b>lupulone</b> at 62. 5, 125 and 250 ppm in drinking water versus 0 ppm control. Results: At day 22, post-hatch intestinal C. perfringens counts of lupulone-treated chickens were sig-nificantly lower (P < 0. 05) than water-treated control groups in both jejunal and caecal sampling sites across all <b>lupulone</b> dosages tested. Conclusions: <b>Lupulone</b> administered through water inhibits gastrointestinal levels of inoculated patho-genic clostridia within the chicken gastrointestinal tract. <b>Lupulone</b> was effective within the chemically complex mixture of material within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby making this agent a target of further research as an antibiotic alternative for this and possibly other intestinal infections...|$|E
40|$|Humulones and <b>lupulones</b> have affirmed {{themselves}} as key {{ingredients in the}} multi-billion dollar brewing industry. Originally exploited for their bacteriostatic properties, these compounds also exhibit high levels of biological activity against a variety of diseases. Although quantifiable, the isolation and separation of specific humulones and <b>lupulones</b> has proven difficult, thus establishing efficient synthetic routes will be of value to those desiring exact bittering qualities and to the pharmaceutical community. Our investigations are towards developing a synthetic route to a library of humulones, <b>lupulones,</b> and their derivatives as possible biologically active agents against myriad diseases. The key step in our efficient syntheses of individual humulones is a copper mediated asymmetric oxidative dearomatization involving a chiral ligand. New compounds will be biologically tested through our collaborations. Active agents {{may lead to a}} transformation in hops as sources to the next generation of medicines...|$|R
50|$|Hops contain beta acids or <b>lupulones</b> {{sensitive}} to oxidative decomposition {{which may be}} detrimental to the taste of beer. For this reason, beta acids are considered a negative factor in brewing and many brewers usually choose hops with a low beta acid content.|$|R
50|$|Hops are {{the flowers}} of the hops plant Humulus lupulus. These flowers contain over 250 {{essential}} oils, which {{contribute to the}} aroma and non-bitter flavors of beer. However, the distinct bitterness especially characteristic of pale ales comes {{from a family of}} compounds called alpha-acids (also called humulones) and beta-acids (also called <b>lupulones).</b> Generally, brewers believe that α-acids give the beer a pleasant bitterness whereas β-acids are considered less pleasant. α-acids isomerize during the boiling process in the reaction pictured. The six-member ring in the humulone isomerizes to a five-member ring, but it is not commonly discussed how this affects perceived bitterness.|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (M. tuberculosis), the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, still causes higher mortality {{than any other}} bacterial pathogen until now. With the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains, it becomes more important to search for alternative targets to develop new antimycobacterial drugs. <b>Lupulone</b> is a compound extracted from Hops (Hurnulus lupulus), which exhibits a good antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 10 µg/mL, but the response mechanisms of <b>lupulone</b> against M. tuberculosis are still poorly understood. In this study, we used a commercial oligonucleotide microarray to determine the overall transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv triggered by exposure to MIC of <b>lupulone.</b> A total of 540 genes {{were found to be}} differentially regulated by <b>lupulone.</b> Of these, 254 genes were upregulated, and 286 genes were downregulated. A number of important genes were significantly regulated which are involved in various pathways, such as surface-exposed lipids, cytochrome P 450 enzymes, PE/PPE multigene families, ABC transporters, and protein synthesis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed for choosed genes to verified the microarray results. To our knowledge, this genome-wide transcriptomics approach has produced the first insights into the response of M. tuberculosis to a <b>lupulone</b> challenge...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe SW 480 {{cell line}} {{is derived from}} a human colon adenocarcinoma, and SW 620 cells are derived from a lymph node {{metastasis}} of the same patient. We have previously shown that <b>lupulone</b> induces apoptosis in SW 480 cells, through a cross talk between the TRAIL-death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In SW 620 cells, <b>lupulone</b> induced apoptosis only through TRAIL-death receptor activation. Both cell lines exhibit the same p 53 mutations. Because p 53 plays {{a central role in}} the response to cellular stresses by upregulating the transcription of several genes controlling apoptosis, we aimed to study the involvement of p 53 on lupulone-triggered apoptosis. Our data show that in SW 620 cells, <b>lupulone</b> upregulated p 53 gene expression and caused a cloistering of p 53 in the nucleus, allowing p 53 to play a proapoptotic role by activating the TRAIL-death receptor pathway. In contrast, in lupulone-treated SW 480 cells, p 53 was translocated to the cytoplasm where it initiated a survival response associated with the up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 and Mcl- 1 proteins in an attempt to preserve mitochondrial integrity. These prosurvival effects of p 53 in lupulone-treated SW 480 cells were reversed by pifithrin-α, an inhibitor of p 53 function, which caused a blocking of p 53 in the nucleus leading to the down-regulation of Bcl- 2 and Mcl- 1, the up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax protein and TRAIL-death receptors leading to enhanced cell death. Our data support different functions of the same mutated p 53 in colon adenocarcinoma and derived metastatic cells in response to the chemopreventive agent <b>lupulone...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hops {{have been}} used in the brewing of {{alcoholic}} beverage for over 3000 years. Due to new consumer preferences towards sweeter drinks or 'Alcopops', beer consumption has taken a drastic decline. This has caused the economic value of hops as a commodity to decline, therefore new applications for this material are required. The hop extracts humulone (8) and <b>lupulone</b> (22) exist in several tautomeric forms. We present unequivocal evidence for the existence of the major tautomer of <b>lupulone,</b> colupulone and a derivative of humulone in polar media. The evidence has been obtained from single X-ray crystallographic data and computer modelling as well as IH and 13 e NMR spectroscopy. The first 2 D INADEQUATE spectrum of the tautomer of <b>lupulone</b> provides unambiguous chemical shift assignments for all of the structural carbon atoms. This project has also involved the investigation into known and novel derivatives of the major constituents of hops, humulone (8) and <b>lupulone</b> (22), as possible bactericides. The main mode of action of these compounds activity against bacterial cells is their ability to chelate metal ions and allow passive diffusion of these complexes out of cells. A number of chemical derivatives have been synthesised and, using a model developed as part of this research, tested for their potential to pass metal ions from aqueous to non-polar organic media. In addition to this some of the novel compounds have been screened on bacterial samples to determine the structure activity relationship of the known and novel derivatives. Chapter 1 covers the background ofhumulone (8) and the hop acids. Chapter 2 covers the biology ofthe hop acids including biological activity. Chapter 3 covers the structural analysis of the hop acids. collected during this project and the derivatisation work.

50|$|Bitterness scales {{attempt to}} rate the {{perceived}} relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, humulone undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- isohumulone which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of the beer. Likewise, hops contain <b>lupulones,</b> or beta acids. These beta acids are not considered in the initial bittering of the wort as much as their alpha acid counterparts since they do not isomerize through boiling, and therefore do not dissolve in the wort. However, beta acids can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging. At the same time, isomerized alpha acids undergo degradation and reduce the bitterness of the beer.|$|R
40|$|Acne is {{a common}} but serious skin disease, which affects {{approximately}} 80 % {{adolescents and young adults}} in 11 – 30 age group. 42. 5 % of men and 50. 9 % of women continue to suffer from this disease into their twenties. Bacterial resistance is now at the alarming stage due to the irrational use of antibiotics. Hence, search for new lead molecule/bioactive and rational delivery of the existing drug (for better therapeutic effect) to the site of action is the need of the hour. Plants and plant-derived products have been an integral part of health care system since time immemorial. Therefore, plants that are currently used for the treatment of acne and those with a high potential are summarized in the present review. Most active plant extracts, namely, P. granatum, M. alba, A. anomala, and M. aquifolium exhibit minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the range of 4 – 50 [*]µg/mL against P. acnes, while aromatic oils of C. obovoides, C. natsudaidai, C. japonica, and C. nardus possess MICs 0. 005 – 0. 6 [*]μL/mL and phytomolecules such as rhodomyrtone, pulsaquinone, hydropulsaquinone, honokiol, magnolol, xanthohumol <b>lupulones,</b> chebulagic acid and rhinacanthin-C show MIC in the range of 0. 5 – 12. 5 [*]μg/mL.

40|$|The Tyrrell group has, {{in recent}} years, {{developed}} {{a strong interest}} in the chemical synthesis and biological activity of the hop bitter acids <b>lupulone</b> 1, humulone 2 and their naturally occurring congeners, 1 a-d and 2 a-d. Previous work focused on investigating the chemistry of the a-acid humulone 2, demonstrating the propensity of this compound to have a cytotoxic effect against the SK-MES lung cancer cell line and the MCF- 7 breast cancer cell line. This thesis documents the recent research concerning the synthesis, the anticancer and antibacterial activity of the ß-acid <b>lupulone</b> 1, its naturally occurring congeners 1 a-d and further, novel, non-naturally occurring compounds. We resumed the group's previous collaboration with the Golston and Pirianov research group at St Georges, where the anticancer studies were performed. The synthesis centred on a Friedel-Crafts acylation of phloroglucinol 32, followed by a C-trialkenylation reaction between the acylphloroglucinol and an allyl bromide. We conducted experiments that focused upon the choice of base and solvent for the trialkenylation reaction, concluding that liquid ammonia as both the base and solvent offered the most efficient route to the ß-acids. It was shown that aliphatic allylic bromides lend themselves to the' reaction,. although some derivatives require purification by column chromatography in addition to recrystallisation. In contrast, aromatic allyl bromides did not participate in the alkenylation reaction. We further investigated an alternate G-alkenylation reaction involving the di¬lithiation of 1, 3, 5 -trimethoxybenzene. We discovered that by including copper (I) iodide in the reaction, prenyl bromide 23 and allyl bromide 41 could be successfully coupled. VVe also discovered that our 2 nd generation ß-acids 42 a-g could participate in a ring-closing metathesis reaction, forming novel spirocyclic compounds 50 a-b. Our antibacterial studies showed that ß-acids are effective against Gram-positive bacteria, but not Gram-negative bacteria in accordance with published observations. We took our investigations further and found that ß-acids are effective against mutlidrug-resistant 'Staphylococcus aureus', even where the commercially available ciprofloxacin 67 was not. Our anticancer studies showed that of the compounds tested, non-natural derivative 1 g featuring a cyclopropyl ring was most effective against the MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell lines, and non-natural derivative 1 j was most effective against the DU 145 and PC 3 prostate cancer cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Lupulones, hops beta-acids, {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{constituents}} of the hops resin and have an important contribution to the overall bacteriostatic activity of hops during beer brewing. The use of lupulones as natural alternatives to antibiotics is increasing in the food industry and also in bioethanol production. However, lupulones are easy oxidizable and {{have been shown to be}} very reactive toward 1 -hydroxyethyl radical with apparent bimolecular rate constants close to diffusion control k = 2. 9 x 10 (8) and 2. 6 x 10 (8) L mol(- 1) s(- 1) at 25. 0 +/- 0. 2 degrees C in ethanol water solution (10 % of ethanol (v/v)) as probed by EPR and ESI-IT-MS/MS spin-trapping competitive kinetics, respectively. The free energy change for an electron-transfer mechanism is Delta G degrees = 106 kJ/mol as calculated from the oxidation peak potential experimentally determined for lupulones (1. 1 V vs NHE) by cyclic voltammetry and the reported reduction potential for 1 -hydroxyethyl radical. The major reaction products identified by LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS and ultrahigh-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (orbitrap FT-MS) are hydroxylated <b>lupulone</b> derivatives and 1 -hydroxyethyl radical adducts. The lack of pH dependence for the reaction rate constant, the calculated free energy change for electron transfer, and the main reaction products strongly suggest the prenyl side chains at the hops beta-acids as the reaction centers rather than the beta,beta'-triketone moiety.

Häufig entziehen sich diese jedoch einer gezielten Untersuchung ihrer Wirkung auf die Aphiden, da sie als Substanzgemisch vorliegen. Beziehungen zwischen Substanzkonzentration und Verhaltensmustern aus Electrical Penetration Graphs (EPG) sind nur mit mäßigem Erfolg über statistische Verfahren darzustellen. Eine Versuchsanordnung zur gezielten Prüfung verhaltensbeeinflussender Substanzen mittels EPG wäre in diesem Falle hilfreich. Ein geeignetes einfaches Testsystem müsste {{mindestens}} folgende Komponenten beinhalten: – eine von den Aphiden akzeptierte Oberfläche, welche die Kutikula / Epidermis eines natürlichen Systems nachbildet – diese Oberfläche sollte evtl. durch den Versuchsansteller manipulierbar sein – eine dem Parenchym entsprechende Schicht, in welche die Testsubstanzen einzubringen wären – eine flüssige Phase, die dem Phloem entspricht und ebenfalls in ihrer Zusammensetzung variiert werden kann. In {{this work}} the behaviour of Phorodon humuli (Schrank) during feeding on artificial, semi-solid diets was examined by Electrical Penetration Graph {{in order to}} test the biological effects of secondary plant substances. Components of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) assumed to affect host selection (a mixture of the bitter substances humulone and <b>lupulone)</b> were added to the diet in different concentrations (0; 100; 300; 625; 1250; 2500; 5000; 7500 &# 956;l/ml deion.

For comparison additional recordings were taken with the aphids being offered the non-hop component resveratrol, in concentrations of 0; 0, 4; 0, 75; 1, 5; 3; 6; 12 &# 956;l/ml deionized water. The results clearly show an influence of the bitter substances on the hop aphid’s feeding behaviour. Depending on concentrations, the animals reacted to bitter substances with differences in probing frequency and -time, sucking activity and other parameters. The probing activity was positively correlated with the resveratrol, a substance foreign to hop, whereas the sucking activity was notedly negatively correlated. So the resveratrol distinctively plays the role of an allomone, the bitter substances from hop, however, more that of kairomones.

40|$|One {{third of}} the world’s {{population}} {{is estimated to be}} infected with M. tuberculosis, a pathogen which causes more human death and misery than any other bacterial disease. Whilst treatment is available, resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is a growing problem. Thus there is an urgent need to identify new compounds that can kill drug resistant isolates and are able to potentiate the activity of currently available antibiotics. The plant kingdom is a rich source of antibacterial compounds and a plant which has attracted particular interest is Humulus lupulus, more commonly known as the hop, which has been used as an antibacterial in beer for hundreds of years. Its antibacterial properties are thought to be due to the combined action of alpha and beta acids and polyphenols such as xanthohumol although the precise nature of their interactions and relative importance has yet to be determined. An optimised agar antimicrobial assay was developed and employed based on Mycobacterium smegmatis, to characterize the antibacterial activity of fifty commercially available hop varieties with a view to identifying novel antibacterial compounds. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between alpha and beta acid content and antibacterial activity. Chemical analysis of the most (Citra) and least (Galena) active hop variants using a combination of bioactivity based thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and HPLC revealed differences in the relative amounts of antimicrobial compounds such as humulone (alpha acid), <b>lupulone</b> (beta acid) and xanthohumol but failed to identify the presence of novel antibacterial compounds. Whilst no new antimicrobial compounds were identified, the Citra hop extract was able to potentiate the activity of the antibiotics imipenem and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of M. abscessus, a fast growing member of the mycobacterium family which infects individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis. The Citra hop extract also inhibited the growth drug resistant isolates of M. abscessus suggesting that it may have activity against other antibiotic resistant mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis With regards to the mode of action, scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct changes to the outer cell structure of the bacteria, suggesting that hops contain compounds that interact with the bacterial cell membrane and/or cell wall. These changes were more profound in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, a compound which also targets the cell wall. Overall hops were shown to contain compounds which inhibited the growth of mycobacterium and were able to potentate the activity of antibiotics currently used to treat these pathogens. These findings suggest hops may be a fruitful source from which to isolate next generation compounds with which to treat increasingly drug resistant strains of mycobacteria...|$|E
