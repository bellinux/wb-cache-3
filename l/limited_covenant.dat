Exercising a first-mover advantage, the incumbent increases {{his share of}} surplus by issuing public debt that appreciates {{in the event of}} merger.

5000|$|While Illinois courts {{state the}} rule above, logically the {{analytical}} steps {{should be in}} reverse order—because inadequate consideration is fatal to the claim. Thus, under McInnis v OAG [...] there are three requirements {{in order for a}} post employment restrictive <b>covenant</b> <b>limiting</b> a former employee’s right to work for a competitor to be enforceable under Illinois law:(1) it must be ancillary to a valid contract; (2) it must be supported by adequate consideration;(3) it must be reasonable, considering whether it: (a) is no greater than is required for the protection of a legitimate business interest of the employer, (b) does not impose undue hardship on the employee, and c) is not injurious to the public. The McInnis decision interpreted the Fifield decision, above, to mandate two years' employment in order for consideration to be adequate.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} Calvin’s understanding of civil govern- ment {{as well as}} the relationship between church and govern- ment against the background of radical political change during the sixteenth century. It becomes clear that Calvin had an organic understanding of church, government and people. These three entities are interwoven and interact {{on the basis of the}} covenant and civil contract. Calvin’s approach, however, is not <b>limited</b> to the <b>covenant,</b> but has a surprising richness and diversity. He integrated theological, juristic and philosophical concepts in his understanding of the state. It is further shown that Calvin’s high regard for civil government, entrenched the corpus christianum, even though he clearly distinguished between ecclesiastical and civil governance. It is also shown that Calvin had a fundamental influence on many of the political concepts which are generally accepted within modern democra- cies...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{experiences}} in other jurisdictions, this article takes the Law Commission’s 2014 proposals for {{the introduction of}} a ‘conservation covenant’ as occasion for reflection on the problems with utilising private law mechanisms as vehicles for furthering the collective interest in environmental protection. It argues that the certainty and security provided by private property relations may {{come at the expense of}} openness to environmental and social complexity, raising concerns regarding environmental justice. It considers how the legitimacy of any reform might be increased, arguing that fairer provision of opportunities for public involvement would be necessary to secure the promised public environmental benefits. It highlights the potential for better collection and dissemination of information about covenants and for the involvement of a more diverse range of actors in monitoring and enforcement. Overall, however, the primary role of the parties to a conservation <b>covenant</b> <b>limits</b> the extent to which it could be a suitable mechanism for setting or securing public conservation priorities...|$|R

[...] Meanwhile, residents were upset in 1866 when the West Pier, designed by Eugenius Birch, was built opposite the square's central garden: its entrance booths affected their sea views. [...] Otherwise, there was little for residents to worry about until the 1880s, by which time Hanson's covenants were about to expire. [...] Unusually, he had set a 71-year time <b>limit</b> on the <b>covenants</b> rather than granting them in perpetuity, and on 25 December 1889 they would expire. Residents would then lose their rights to use the gardens, among other things. Five residents, led by solicitor Somers Clarke (unrelated to the Brighton-born architect of that name), attempted unsuccessfully to purchase the gardens and extend the covenants by an Act of Parliament; two years later, though, the passing of the Brighton Improvement Act 1884 achieved the same aims. Brighton Corporation took ownership of the gardens, and householders signed new deeds confirming they wished for the covenants relating to their houses to be extended indefinitely.|$|R

(JEL G 32, G 34) According to conventional wisdom, the deep pockets of an incumbent serve to deter entry. In large part, the theoretical basis for this view rests upon the model of Bolton and Scharfstein (1990), who show that an unconstrained cash-rich incumbent can fund predation in order to increase the likelihood of ventur...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the accounting choice decisions of banks to employ Level 3 inputs in estimating the value of their financial assets and liabilities. Using a sample of 146 bank-year observations from 18 countries over 2009 - 2012, this study finds banks’ incentives to use Level 3 valuation inputs are associated with both firm-level and country-level determinants. At the firm-level, leverage, profitability (in term of net income), Tier 1 capital ratio, size and audit committee independence are associated with the percentage of Level 3 valuation inputs. At the country-level, economy development, legal region, legal enforcement and investor rights are also associated with the Level 3 classification choice. Lastly, ‘secrecy’, the proxy for culture dimensions and values, is found to be positively associated with the use of Level 3 valuation inputs. Altogether, these findings suggest that banks use the discretion available under Level 3 inputs opportunistically to avoid violating debt <b>covenants</b> <b>limits,</b> to increase earnings and manage their capital ratios. Results of this study also highlight that corporate governance quality at the firm-level (e. g. audit committee independence) and institutional features can constrain banks’ opportunistic behaviors in using the discretion available under Level 3 inputs. The results of this study have important implications for standard setters and contribute to the debate on the use of fair value accounting in an international context...|$|R
40|$|The {{covenant}} reading ceremonies in Joshua 8 : 30 - 35, 2 Kings 22 - 23, and Nehemiah 7 : 72 b- 8 : 18 betray {{a developing}} interplay {{between the people}} of Israel and {{the book of the}} law. These narratives are unique in the Hebrew Bible in presenting the oralization of a covenant document to a specific audience. Previous scholarship on these narratives has focused on reconstructing the source-critical history of each account and the historicity of the reported events. For the following study, Joshua 8 : 30 - 35 and 2 Kings 22 - 23 represent earlier pre-exilic and exilic traditions, while 2 Chronicles 34 - 35 and Nehemiah 8 illustrate later post-exilic perspectives. However, supplementing source-critical scholarship, narrative criticism is used to contribute a fresh view of the relationship that the narratives construct between the community of Israel and their authoritative text. This study analyzes the characterization of the people and the characterization of the book of the law, both within the broader context of ancient Near Eastern loyalty oaths and within the immediate context of the corpus of the Hebrew Bible. The sensory descriptions of the book of the law especially highlight how the textual artifact connects the particularized community of each respective narrative to the covenantal past of the Israelite people, while effectually executing that connection through differing loci of authority. This literary analysis reveals that each reading ceremony narrative manipulates the material functions of the text and its locus of authority according to its own ideology. The historical trajectory presented by these narratives portrays the people of Israel as progressively more exclusive, while portraying the book of the law as increasingly more written and less oral. Joshua 8 : 30 - 35 and 2 Kings 22 - 23 demonstrate that during the exilic period, the book of the law could be authorized either as Mosaic tradition or as a prophetic word from God. By the post- exilic period, authorization through Mosaic discourse became pervasive. 2 Chronicles 34 - 35 and Nehemiah 8 illustrate this well-documented post-exilic phenomenon. In these narratives, by providing continuity between a particularized community and the Mosaic covenant, the book of the law stakes a claim that the true people of Yahweh are <b>limited</b> to the <b>covenant</b> reading ceremony participants...|$|R
