5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the album's title Cheryl {{revealed}} she had already contemplated an album title which contained the phrase 3 Words before the title track was recorded. She had considered titles like Three Syllables, although the strongest contender was Unveiled as Cheryl [...] "felt like she didn't have any protection without the girls [...] " [...] and because it correlated with the veil on the album cover.

Knight said, [...] "although she is photographed all the time by the paparazzi, she is {{not in front of}} the camera for a shoot in the same way as professional models are – she is less used to the process." [...] He continued, [...] "Cheryl was great to work with, though [...] – it is just a different kind of shoot with a model who is experienced." ...|$|E
