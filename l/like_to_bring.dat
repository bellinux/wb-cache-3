[...] Satō was to discuss the status of Manchuria and [...] "any matter the Russians would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up." [...] Well aware of the overall situation and cognizant of their promises to the Allies, the Soviets responded with delaying tactics to encourage the Japanese without promising anything.

[...] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She said:I am going to give up the little gold I possess. [...] I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.

500|$|Ayola's first {{prolific}} television {{role was}} in the ITV drama Soldier Soldier, in which she starred throughout its third series in 1993 as soldier's wife Bernie Roberts. Ayola credits her chemistry with co-star Akim Mogaji, who played her on-screen husband Luke Roberts, for winning her her audition. She went on to appear in Gone With the Wind sequel Scarlett, and star in Welsh soap opera Tiger Bay. She has spoken critically {{of the way the}} BBC treated the soap, moving it around the schedules and declining to commission a second series. She acted alongside Pauline Quirke in both Maisie Raine and Being April, deeming Quirke to be a [...] "fantastic" [...] actress, and one she would work alongside again [...] "like a shot". In 1996, Ayola appeared at the National Theatre in Helen Edmundson's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 2001, she became a presenter of the BBC Wales arts programme Double Yellow, alongside poet Owen Sheers and performance artist Mark Rees. She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show's launch, and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series.

2500|$|Coltrane's {{spiritual journey}} was {{interwoven}} with his investigation of world music. He believed {{not only in}} a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but {{in being able to}} harness the mystical language of music itself. Coltrane's study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could [...] "produce specific emotional meanings." [...] According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. Coltrane said: [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain.

2500|$|The early RiffTrax {{were almost}} all solo efforts on Mike's part, {{but it soon}} became {{apparent}} {{that there was a}} strong demand for them, and Nelson was quickly able to recruit more riffers for the project. Most official RiffTrax (not counting fan-made iRiffs and the spin-off RiffTrax Presents series) have a stable cast of Mike and former Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-stars Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, a line-up that happens to be identical to that of The Film Crew and the last three seasons of MST3K. That said, the guest slots vary often; other MST3K alumni have been featured, such as Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Nelson, in addition to Internet personalities Richard Kyanka (of Something Awful fame), Josh Fruhlinger (writer of The Comics Curmudgeon) and Chad Vader, as well as actors Neil Patrick Harris, Fred Willard, and Joel McHale, and parodist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic. Nelson has said that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in other guests. The enthusiasm of guest riffers for the project led to the establishment of RiffTrax Presents, a series of tracks exclusively hosted by guest riffers and sanctioned by Nelson. The success of the guest format is such that [...] "Three Riffer Editions" [...] of some films previously solo riffed by Mike have been produced for the VOD service, which feature new riffs by Mike in conjunction with Murphy and Corbett, and Mike has ceased producing solo riffs since 2007. Most recent works created by Rifftrax are crafted by a small team of writers; longer works are divided into 20 to 30 minute sections for each writer to rewatch and develop riffs for before assembling the entire work.|$|E

Before {{becoming a}} police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada {{in the sport}} of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She's a very good cook, but does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it up for fear it will stereotype her. She {{does not want to}} admit that she does not know how to ride a bike. She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it's the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, he stares at her dumbfounded and asks [...] "Why?" [...] Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis' willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules.
