All the challenge relies on starting from individual perception and knowledge of increased mortality to a collective alert onset informing potential control actions having a community interest.

40|$|Quantitative {{restrictions}} {{to trade}} are declining, but in parallel sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures {{are increasingly being}} applied to impede agro-food trade. There is evidence that developing countries experience problems in meeting SPS measures. The objective {{of this paper is}} to determine whether Mauritius is facing barriers pertaining to SPS issues when exporting fishery products to the European Union. We first provide an overview of fishery exports from Mauritius before reviewing EU SPS requirements governing fishery exports. We then assess whether there are problems in meeting EU SPS requirements. We adopt a mixed methods approach which hinges on a documentary analysis of the impacts of SPS measures on developing country agro-food exports, an inventory analysis of Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) mission reports to developing countries exporting fishery products and of Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed notifications pertaining to fishery exports. These methods were complemented with interviews with key informants along the fish export supply chain. Our main finding is that SPS measures have not acted as a major barrier for Mauritian fishery exports to the European market. Nevertheless, the Mauritian institutional strategy for compliance to EU SPS measures has predominantly been reactive. In light of recent inspections of the FVO to assess compliance both at the level of the <b>local</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> and the exporters and the increasing importance of food safety as a competitive determinant of agro-food trade, we argue that Mauritius should not only adopt a reactive but increasingly a proactive stance to secure its market, to tap emerging ones and also to safeguard its image as a safe fish exporter...|$|E
40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{approaches to}} managing environmental compliance {{monitoring and enforcement}} in several OECD countries with decentralised systems of environmental governance. It focuses principally on strategies and instruments for promoting consistency {{in the implementation of}} national environmental law. The report reviews in detail the experience of Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States and draws on examples from several other countries. Three programmatic elements of environmental enforcement are key to ensuring its consistency: the targeting of compliance monitoring; the selection of an enforcement instrument and the timeliness of noncompliance response; and the size of monetary penalties for non-compliance. Accurate and complete information on the performance of sub-national and <b>local</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> is an important prerequisite for the evaluation of nationwide consistency of enforcement. To address these issues, OECD countries employ a range of mechanisms of institutional interaction: “vertical” (between different administrative levels) as well as “horizontal” (between <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> at the same level). The report presents multiple examples of the application of each mechanism in different decentralised systems. It analyses these good practices and suggests several ways to use them to ensure consistency in the implementation of the main elements of enforcement programmes. environmental enforcement, compliance assurance, environmental authorities, decentralised governance...|$|R

40|$|Cephalopods {{have been}} {{utilised}} in neurosci- ence research {{for more than}} 100 years particularly because of their phenotypic plasticity, complex and centralised nervous system, tractability for studies of learning and cellular mechanisms of memory (e. g. long-term potentia- tion) and anatomical features facilitating physiological studies (e. g. squid giant axon and synapse). On 1 January 2013, research using any of the about 700 extant species of ‘‘live cephalopods’’ became regulated within the European Union by Directive 2010 / 63 /EU on the ‘‘Protection of Animals used for Scientific Purposes’’, giving cephalopods the same EU legal protection as previously afforded only to vertebrates. The Directive {{has a number of}} implications, particularly for neuroscience research. These include: (1) projects will need justification, authorisation from <b>local</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities,</b> and be subject to review including a harm-benefit assessment and adherence to the 3 Rs princi- ples (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction). (2) To support project evaluation and compliance with the new EU law, guidelines specific to cephalopods will need to be developed, covering capture, transport, handling, housing, care, maintenance, health monitoring, humane anaesthesia, analgesia and euthanasia. (3) Objective criteria need to be developed to identify signs of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm particularly {{in the context of their}} induction by an experimental procedure. Despite diversity of views existing on some of these topics, this paper reviews the above topics and describes the approaches being taken by the cephalopod research community (represented by the authorship) to produce ‘‘guidelines’’ and the potential contribution of neuroscience research to cephalopod welfare...|$|R
