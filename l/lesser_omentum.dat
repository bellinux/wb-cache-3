50|$|The lesser sac, {{also known}} as the omental bursa, is the cavity in the abdomen that is formed by the <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>omentum.</b> Usually found in mammals, it is {{connected}} with the greater sac via the omental foramen (previously known as the Foramen of Winslow). In mammals, {{it is not uncommon for}} the lesser sac to contain considerable amounts of fat.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> is formed, by a {{thinning}} of the mesoderm or ventral mesogastrium, which attaches {{the stomach}} and duodenum to the anterior abdominal wall.

5000|$|The hepatoduodenal {{ligament}} is {{the portion}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> extending between the porta hepatis of the liver and the superior part of the duodenum.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the layers}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> where they are {{attached}} to the stomach, run the right and left gastric arteries, as well as the gastric veins.|$|E
50|$|At {{the right}} {{border of the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> the two layers are continuous, and form a free margin which {{constitutes}} the anterior boundary of the omental foramen.|$|E
5000|$|Anatomically, the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> {{is divided}} into ligaments, each {{starting}} with the prefix [...] "hepato" [...] to indicate that it connects to the liver at one end.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> is {{extremely}} thin, and is continuous {{with the two}} layers of peritoneum which cover respectively the antero-superior and postero-inferior surfaces of the stomach and {{first part of the}} duodenum.|$|E
50|$|The Hepatocolic {{ligament}} is {{an occasional}} fold of peritoneum that {{extends from the}} right side of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> and passes from the lower surface of the liver near the gallbladder to the hepatic flexure.|$|E
50|$|From {{its upper}} part it joins {{to the neck}} of the {{pancreas}} at a well-marked prominence, the omental tuber which abuts the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum.</b> Its right edge is marked by a groove for the gastroduodenal artery.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> (small omentum or gastrohepatic omentum) is {{the double}} layer of {{peritoneum}} that {{extends from the}} liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach (hepatogastric ligament) and {{the first part of}} the duodenum (hepatoduodenal ligament).|$|E
50|$|Accessory hepatic portal veins {{are those}} veins that drain {{directly}} into the liver without joining the hepatic portal vein. These include the paraumbilical veins as well as veins of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> falciform ligament, and those draining the gallbladder wall.|$|E
5000|$|Between the {{two layers}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> close to the right free margin, are the hepatic artery proper, the common bile duct, the portal vein, lymphatics, and the hepatic plexus of nerves—all these {{structures}} being enclosed in a fibrous capsule (Glisson's capsule).|$|E
5000|$|... anterior: {{the free}} {{border of the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> known as the hepatoduodenal ligament. This has two layers and within these layers are the common bile duct, hepatic artery, and hepatic portal vein. A useful {{mnemonic}} to remember these is DAVE: Duct, Artery, Vein, Epiploic foramen.|$|E

(a) hepatic, on {{the stem}} of the hepatic artery, and {{extending}} upward along the common bile duct, between the two layers of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> {{as far as the}} porta hepatis; the cystic gland, a member of this group, is placed near the neck of the gall-bladder; ...|$|E
50|$|One long {{branch of}} it {{runs from the}} lesser {{curvature}} or parallel to it in <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> {{as far as the}} pyloric antrum to fan out into branches in a way like the digits of a crow's foot to supply the pyloric antrum and the anterior wall of pyloric canal.|$|E
50|$|The caudal {{part of the}} septum transversum is {{invaded by}} the hepatic {{diverticulum}} which divides within it to form the liver and thus {{gives rise to the}} ventral mesentery of the foregut, which in turn is the precursor of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> the visceral peritoneum of the liver and the falciform ligament.|$|E
50|$|The omentum are {{specialized}} {{folds of}} peritoneum that enclose nerves, blood vessels, lymph channels, fatty tissue, and connective tissue. There are two omenta. First, is the greater omentum that hangs {{off of the}} transverse colon and greater curvature of the stomach. The other is the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> that extends between the stomach and the liver.|$|E
5000|$|The left gastric vein (or {{coronary}} vein) carries blood low in oxygen, tributaries {{derived from}} both {{surfaces of the}} stomach; it runs {{from right to left}} along the lesser curvature of the stomach, between the two layers of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum,</b> to the esophageal opening of the stomach, where it receives some esophageal veins.|$|E
50|$|The {{abdominal}} aorta lies {{slightly to the}} left of the midline of the body. It is covered, anteriorly, by the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum</b> and stomach, behind which are the branches of the celiac artery and the celiac plexus; below these, by the lienal vein (splenic vein), the pancreas, the left renal vein, the inferior part of the duodenum, the mesentery, and aortic plexus.|$|E
50|$|The Pringle {{maneuver}} is {{a surgical}} maneuver {{used in some}} abdominal operations. A large atraumatic haemostat is used to clamp the hepatoduodenal ligament (free border of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum)</b> interrupting {{the flow of blood}} through the hepatic artery and the portal vein and thus helping to control bleeding from the liver. More commonly, in the absence of soft clamp, manual compression of the hepatoduodenal ligament is performed.|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} {{surface of}} the left lobe of the liver presents behind {{and to the left}} the gastric impression. This is moulded over the upper front {{surface of the}} stomach, and to the right of this is a rounded eminence, the tuber omentale, which fits into the concavity of the lesser curvature of the stomach and lies in front of the anterior layer of the <b>lesser</b> <b>omentum.</b>|$|E
