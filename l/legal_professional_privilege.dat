40|$|The lawyer {{trained in}} an {{atmosphere}} of strict ethical constraints and supervised by professional colleagues, does not easily adjust to consumer and executive government pressures to make the lawyer and accountant criminally and tortiously responsible for the actions of the client he advises. There is no doubt that executive government will continue to be under increasing pressure from the public servants who administer statutes dealing with corporations and financial transactions, who become frustrated at the inability to convict the major perpetrators of corporate fraud and crime and who then turn their attention to the advisers, both legal and otherwise, who have assisted in the perpetration of the fraud or offence. Legislators tend to see these issues in terms of the consumer and public perceptions.

40|$|AbstractThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an {{international}} standard-setter and an inter-governmental body established in 1989 and has set various measures consisting of legal, regulatory and operational ones in governing money laundering and terrorism financing. Given the threats of such crimes and the vulnerabilities of some professions and businesses to such crimes, in 2003 the FATF included them under the AML/CFT regime. Since then, those professions and businesses became the gate-keepers and known as the designated non-financial business and professions (DNFBPs). As a consequence of such inclusion, several mandatory obligations were imposed on these gate-keepers, involving customer due diligence, record-keeping, reporting obligation, the compliance function and training programme for employees. It is within this context that {{the objective of this}} paper is to examine the extent to which the FATF is moulding the AML/CFT regime in Malaysia, which in turn, is shaping the compliance of legal profession, who now have to “police” their clients for evidence of money laundering and terrorist financing. The authors contend that the gate-keeping role of the legal practitioners inevitably raises controversial issues involving the violation of ethical conduct, <b>professional</b> <b>legal</b> <b>privilege</b> and also the independence of the legal profession...|$|R

5000|$|While {{the main}} {{perception}} of <b>professional</b> <b>legal</b> <b>privilege</b> is the client lawyer relationship some Australian States in particular NSW have extended this privilege to 'protected confidences' defined as [...] "communication {{made by a}} person in confidence to another person .... {{in the course of}} a relationship in which the confidant was acting in a professional capacity". The Division in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for 'Professional confidential relationship privilege' and how it is excluded or lost is at Division 1A This is often interpreted as being between a health professional and their patient. It may however, extend to confidential advice from social workers, and accountants.. NSW has also added a 'Sexual assault communications privilege' at Division 1B [...] Therefore, when considering the access and adducing decisions for medical records that may also cover sexual assault records, the first consideration of course will be relevance, and then any NSW court or tribunal may exclude any evidence of either 'Professional confidential relationship privilege' or 'Sexual assault communications privilege' or both. These sections of the Act aimed to provide further restrictions and protections against oppressive discovery that can cause undue harm to a party in court and may dissuade them from seeking medical care or counselling or damage those relationships, see for example, R v A and B [...] for an appeal on an application in a case for access to discovery across 'Professional confidential relationship privilege' and 'Sexual assault communications privilege' and how the exclusions are decided.|$|R
