5|$|Tropical Storm Elena was a weak {{tropical}} storm that moved ashore along Texas in the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. The sixth {{tropical storm}} of the season, Elena developed from a tropical wave {{to the south}} of Louisiana on August 29. It tracked generally west-northwest, strengthening <b>little</b> <b>before</b> making landfall on Matagorda Island on September 1 as a minimal tropical storm; the storm quickly dissipated over land. Elena dropped moderate rainfall along its path, causing two direct deaths in Houston from drowning; storm damage was minor, amounting to less than $10 million (1979 USD, $28 million 2007 USD). Lightning from the storm set fire to an oil supertanker in Houston, causing three indirect deaths and 13 injuries.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} wave, Gert crossed Honduras and the Yucatán peninsula before organizing into Tropical Depression Seven {{on the afternoon}} of July 23 in the Bay of Campeche. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert early the next day, gaining the record for the earliest formation of a seventh named storm in an Atlantic hurricane season. Gert strengthened <b>little</b> <b>before</b> making landfall south of Tampico, Tamaulipas, late on July 24, with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). It moved inland over central Mexico before dissipating on the next day. Gert struck in approximately the same area as Hurricane Emily just four days earlier, causing fear of flooding and landslides due to saturated lands. As a precaution, some 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatlán and Tamiahua.|$|E

5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a <b>little</b> <b>before</b> reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{provisional}} treaties between the Portuguese and the Bednore rulers, and the Padroado, the Christians {{were allowed to}} build churches and help foster the growth of Christianity in South Canara. The arrival of the British and the Dutch halted {{the activity of the}} Portuguese, and they were gradually unable to send the required number of missionaries to Mangalore. Shivappa Nayaka had previously expelled the Portuguese from their forts a <b>little</b> <b>before</b> 1660, which brought about considerable changes in the ecclesiastical situation. The appointment of the Vicar Apostolic of Mangalore was felt by the Holy See to be of critical importance. Nayaka pressured the church authorities to appoint a native priest as the Vicar Apostolic, which resulted in the appointment of Fr. Andrew Gomez to the post; however, he died before the nomination papers could reach Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. In particular, Arthur features {{in a number of}} well-known vitae ("Lives") of post-Roman saints, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century). According to the Life of Saint Gildas, written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. In the Life of Saint Cadoc, written around 1100 or a <b>little</b> <b>before</b> by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as wergeld for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns. Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carannog, Padarn, and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century. A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii, which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century). Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury's De Gestis Regum Anglorum and Herman's De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis, which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return, a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore.|$|E
