5|$|Hebron Church (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Great Capon Church, Hebron <b>Lutheran</b> Church, and Hebron Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> Church) is a mid-19th-century <b>Lutheran</b> church in Intermont, Hampshire County, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Hebron Church {{was founded in}} 1786 by German settlers in the Cacapon River Valley, making it the first <b>Lutheran</b> church west of the Shenandoah Valley. The congregation worshiped in a log church, which initially served both <b>Lutheran</b> and Reformed denominations. Its congregation was originally German-speaking; the church's documents and religious services were in German until 1821, when records and sermons transitioned to English.|$|E

50|$|Two main confessional {{movements}} arose {{during the}} 19th century: the Old <b>Lutherans</b> and the Neo-Lutherans. The Old <b>Lutherans</b> originated from the Schism of the Old <b>Lutherans,</b> while Neo-Lutheranism arose in Germany in the 1830s from the Pietist driven Erweckung, or Awakening. Neo-Lutheranism itself contained differing camps. It gave rise later to those calling themselves confessional <b>Lutherans.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium was {{the first}} <b>Lutheran</b> church body in North America. With the {{encouragement}} of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, the Ministerium was founded at a Church Conference of <b>Lutheran</b> clergy on August 26, 1748. The group {{was known as the}} German Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> Ministerium of North America until 1792, when it adopted the name German Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Frederick III was a <b>Lutheran</b> {{member of}} the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces. It was a United Protestant denomination, {{bringing}} together Reformed and <b>Lutheran</b> believers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, the Ministerium became less {{concerned}} with {{its relationship with the}} Reformed church and saw a significant increase in <b>Lutheran</b> identity and the importance of the <b>Lutheran</b> Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship would prove to be short-lived.|$|E
50|$|The {{main trends}} in Protestantism {{included}} {{the rapid growth}} of Methodist and Baptists denominations, and the steady growth among Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Anglicans. After 1830 German <b>Lutherans</b> arrived in large numbers; after 1860 Scandinavian <b>Lutherans</b> arrived. The Pennsylvania Dutch Protestant sects (and <b>Lutherans)</b> grew through high birth rates.|$|R
50|$|The {{name of the}} {{organization}} was further changed in 1980 to <b>Lutherans</b> Concerned/North America (LC/NA), to make visible the continental reach <b>Lutherans</b> Concerned had achieved through its programs and influence. The shortened name, <b>Lutherans</b> Concerned, continued {{to be used as}} the working name except in more formal documents and press releases.|$|R

5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between <b>Lutheran</b> and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either the <b>Lutheran</b> or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to reconcile the <b>Lutheran</b> and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc Dávid his court preacher.|$|E
5|$|The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Decision magazine, and World Wide Pictures {{film and}} {{television}} distribution were headquartered in Minneapolis between the late 1940s into the 2000s. Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye met while attending the Pentecostal North Central University and began a television ministry that by the 1980s reached 13.5 million households. Today, Mount Olivet <b>Lutheran</b> Church in southwest Minneapolis with about 6,000 attendees is the nation's second-largest <b>Lutheran</b> congregation. Christ Church <b>Lutheran</b> in the Longfellow neighborhood is among the finest work by architect Eliel Saarinen. The congregation later added an education building designed by his son Eero Saarinen.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod <b>Lutheran</b> Church (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, porthole windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the <b>Lutheran</b> Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest <b>Lutheran</b> church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> Church in America (ELCA). Danebod <b>Lutheran</b> Church remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Lutheran</b> {{calendar}} is most {{similar to}} the calendar of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican Calendar of Saints, though it also bears resemblance to the Roman Calendar of Saints because it commemorates {{many of the same}} individuals. However, the <b>Lutheran</b> calendar differs from both in two very significant ways, aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to the <b>Lutheran</b> tradition.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} General Council from 18671918. In 1918, following {{the celebration of the}} 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three <b>Lutheran</b> church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and the General Council) reunited to form the United <b>Lutheran</b> Church in America. This event, while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the <b>Lutheran</b> Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> Church in America (which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E
5|$|The Spirit Fruit Society {{was started}} by Jacob Beilhart (4 March 1867– 24 November 1908), {{who was born in}} Columbiana County, Ohio, to a <b>Lutheran</b> father and a Mennonite mother.

5000|$|Numerous {{waves of}} Old <b>Lutherans</b> {{immigrated to the}} United States as well during this time period. Among them was a group from Prussia of about 1000 Old <b>Lutherans.</b> They were from Erfurt, Magdeburg and the {{surrounding}} area, led by J. A. A. Grabau. They emigrated to the United States in summer 1839. Grabau and his friends founded the [...] "Synod of <b>Lutherans</b> immigrated from Prussia", afterward known as the Buffalo Synod.|$|R
50|$|In 1657, Stuyvesant, {{who did not}} {{tolerate}} full religious freedom in the colony, and was strongly committed to the supremacy of the Dutch Reformed Church, refused to allow <b>Lutherans</b> the right to organize a church. When he also issued an ordinance forbidding them from worshiping in their own homes, {{the directors of the}} Dutch West Indies Company, three of whom were <b>Lutherans,</b> told him to rescind the order and allow private gatherings of <b>Lutherans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most German-Brazilians are Roman Catholics or <b>Lutherans.</b> As {{with other}} Brazilians, {{there is a}} {{significant}} minority of non-religious people, and Pentecostalism is on the rise. Almost 85% of all <b>Lutherans</b> in Latin America and the Caribbean live in Brazil.|$|R

50|$|<b>Lutherans</b> do {{not accept}} that only a bishop can confirm as is the custom in the Anglicanism. Even in {{countries}} where <b>Lutherans</b> claim to retain apostolic succession such as Estonia, Sweden, Finland and Norway etc. a priest is allowed to confirm.|$|R
5000|$|Presently, <b>Lutherans</b> {{are divided}} {{over how to}} {{interact}} with other Christian denominations. Some <b>Lutherans</b> assert that everyone must share the [...] "whole counsel of God" [...] (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10) before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed closed (or close) communion. On the other hand, other <b>Lutherans</b> practice varying degrees of open communion and allow preachers from other Christian denominations in their pulpits.|$|R
5|$|As the {{population}} of German settlers in the region began to increase, the desire for <b>Lutheran</b> religious services and education also grew. Ministers, including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit, began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia. Muhlenberg was a German pastor, requested by colonists in Pennsylvania, {{who served as a}} missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787; he is considered the patriarch of the <b>Lutheran</b> Church in the United States. Johannes Schwarback and Muhlenberg's son, Peter, reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 (before Hebron Church's founding). Streit, charged with ministering to a <b>Lutheran</b> congregation in Winchester, settled there on July 19, 1785.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a <b>Lutheran</b> {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} <b>Lutheran</b> church and his early home {{environment}} was strictly religious. Jacob did not receive {{much in the way of}} formal education. His father died when he was six or seven years old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E
5|$|During the Livonian War, Estonia {{became part}} of the <b>Lutheran</b> Swedish kingdom. The Catholic Dome Church became a church with a <b>Lutheran</b> {{congregation}} and was then called the Castle Church. In 1625, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu, the castle and the nearby land property to Count Jacob De la Gardie, who planned to turn the dilapidated stronghold into a modern castle. Arent Passer, a well-known sculptor and master builder, was invited as a consultant.|$|E
