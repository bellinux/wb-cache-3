50|$|Seeing {{one another}} {{about the same}} time, the MiG flight and my flight dropped extra fuel tanks.. He was so low he was {{throwing}} up small rocks. I dropped down to get him, but to hit him I had to get down in his jet wash. He'd chop the throttle and throw out his speed brakes. I would coast up beside him, wingtip to wingtip. When it looked <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to overshoot him, I would roll {{over the top and}} come down {{on the other side of}} him.

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, <b>I</b> won't <b>be</b> able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it <b>like</b> <b>I</b> always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> happy.|$|R
