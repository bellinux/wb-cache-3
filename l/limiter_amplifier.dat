Therefore a <b>limiter</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage must be used before the detector, to remove amplitude variations in the signal which would be detected as noise. The limiter acts as a class-A amplifier at lower amplitudes; at higher amplitudes it becomes a saturated amplifier which clips off the peaks and limits the amplitude.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power <b>amplifiers</b> with <b>limiters,</b> a power <b>amplifier</b> capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices â€“ excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|R

The front-end amplifier is a critical part in optical receiver. Traditionally, it has been fabricated in expensive Gallium Arsenide and silicon bipolar technologies. However, the quest for low cost, low power consumption and small silicon area solutions in the commercial market has spurred a desire to implement the circuit in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This thesis describes {{the design of the}} front-end amplifier using AMI 0. 5 CMOS process. The target data rate is at least 500 Mb/s suitable for local area network application. The front-end amplifier is divided into two stages, the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and the <b>limiter</b> <b>amplifier</b> (LA). The resistive feedback TIA topology is selected for the TIA design. The LA circuit is realized by cascading two resistive load differential amplifiers with one buffer. The simulation results show that the designed TIA achieves 374. 4 MHz bandwidth with a corresponding achievable data rate of ~ 535 Mb/s. Its transimpedance gain is 4 kÎ© The LA bandwidth is 586. 8 MHz and the output swing is 4. 2 V.

40|$|Purpose. Automatic {{locomotive}} signaling {{of continuous}} type with a numeric coding (ALSN) has several disadvantages: {{a small number}} of signal indications, low noise stability, high inertia and low functional flexibility. Search for new and more advanced methods of signal processing for automatic locomotive signaling, synthesis of the noise proof digital locomotive receiver are essential. Methodology. The proposed algorithm of detection and identification locomotive signaling codes is based on the definition of mutual correlations of received oscillation and reference signals. For selecting threshold levels of decision element the following criterion has been formulated: the locomotive receiver should maximum set the correct solution for a given probability of dangerous errors. Findings. It has been found that the random nature of the ALSN signal amplitude does not affect the detection algorithm. However, the distribution law and numeric characteristics of signal amplitude affect the probability of errors, and should be considered when selecting a threshold levels According to obtained algorithm of detection and identification ALSN signals the digital locomotive receiver has been synthesized. It contains band pass filter, peak <b>limiter,</b> normalizing <b>amplifier</b> with automatic gain control circuit, analog to digital converter and digital signal processor. Originality.
