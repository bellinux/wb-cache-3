50|$|The ECB {{publishes a}} Convergence Report {{at least every}} two years to check how well the EU members {{aspiring}} for euro adoption comply with the criteria. The first full convergence report was published in November 1996, and concluded that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were completely compliant with the criteria {{at that point in}} time. As a majority of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999. In March 1998 a more positive second convergence report concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline. Subsequent convergence reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest convergence report was published in June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 - April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply - thus becoming the next 19th eurozone member. As the reference values for HICP inflation and long-term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated compliance check, whenever they believe they have met all both economic and <b>legal</b> <b>convergence</b> criteria. For example, Latvia asked for such an extraordinary compliance check in March 2013 (outside the regular 2-year interval for automatic assessments).|$|E

This criticism of the High Court is unsound. First, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that the High Court is now more fragmented than it has been during other periods of its history. Secondly, the precise reasoning process (and the underlying jurisprudence reflected by this) is a cardinal aspect of the development of precedent and <b>legal</b> principle. <b>Convergence</b> in conclusion only is of little utility and does not promote certainty and clarity in the law. One cannot make an informed assessment of the impact and breadth of a decision without an understanding of the (actual) premise underpinning the decision.

Conclusion without (genuine) reasons is not highly instructive. Coerced agreement, no matter how subtle, is undesirable. The High Court should resist calls to deliver more single majority judgments. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Regulation 1 / 2003, {{applicable}} since 1 May 2004, {{has been}} one of the most far-reaching EU competition policy reforms in the history of European integration. The long-standing centralised administrative ex ante notification regime for commercial intercompany agreements was replaced by a decentralised ex post private enforcement regime. This essentially altered the way in which anticompetitive conduct, such as cartels and other restrictive business practices, are prosecuted. Companies can no longer rely on the official Commission decision prior to concluding contractual agreements with other companies, but are increasingly exposed to the risk of being litigated by other market actors in civil disputes, a jeopardy that, so far, has constituted a relatively alien feature in the EU. The 2004 reform reflects a major step of <b>legal</b> <b>convergence</b> towards the US antitrust regime, which has private enforcement as one of its most characteristic features. Regulation 1 / 2003, however, formed only the prelude of further reform proposals. Further reform steps appear on the horizon. The Green and White Paper of 2005 and 2008 aim at further institutionalising, and thus, consolidating a pan-European system of private enforcement. The article examines the underlying interest constellation that has shaped this reform process, and demonstrates and explains the important role played by a community of transnational legal and economic competition experts...|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} world today subdivides into rival systems of dispersed and concentrated ownership, with different corporate governance structures characterising each. The United States and the United Kingdom {{fall into the}} former category and other major industrial countries tend {{to fall into the}} latter. There is anecdotal evidence that suggests market forces are serving to destabilise traditional structures and cause some form of convergence along American corporate governance lines. According to some corporate governance experts, a variable that will affect how far matters will progress is the law. They argue that because the law "matters", a transition to the US pattern of corporate governance will occur only gradually and tentatively unless there is a legal environment which is hospitable to dispersed share ownership. This paper provides evidence {{on the extent to which}} legal regulation does "matter" in the corporate governance context. The approach is historical in orientation and the focus is on the emergence of a separation of ownership and control, characterised by widely dispersed share ownership and strong managers, in the United Kingdom. The experience in Britain is instructive because, with respect to corporate governance, no other major industrial nation has more in common with the United States. Developments in the UK suggest that a highly specific set of laws governing companies and financial markets do not have to be in place to ensure that a separation of ownership and control becomes a central feature of a country's corporate governance system. Instead, alternative institutional structures can perform the function "law matters" advocates say the legal system needs to play. It is an open question, however, whether such alternatives are likely to emerge in countries where a transition to the American pattern of corporate governance could be in progress. ownership, corporate governance, <b>legal</b> regulation, <b>convergence...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{moral and}} {{normative}} authority of nature varied considerably {{depending on the}} specific context and intentions of medieval authors who referred to its power, order, or law. Nature often validated social, religious, moral, and <b>legal</b> norms. This <b>convergence</b> {{may have contributed to}} the legitimation of science at a time when its validity was far from self-evident. However, nature's power was also disruptive. Appealing to its authority could be a way to reveal the weaknesses, limits, and contradictions of the medieval moral, religious, social, and legal system. In order to clarify and illustrate this fundamental ambiguity, this article isolates and analyses a number of central themes and issues: the social and moral implications of the distinction between man and animals as well as between male and female; nature's relative importance as a universal law with respect to history, providence, lawgiving, and the diversity of customs; the interpretation of natural phenomena and human behaviours perceived as running counter to nature's order; the legitimation of art and the artificial as imitations of nature; and the extent and limits of natural determinism in medicine, physiognomy, and astrology. Medieval texts proposed two opposing anthropological models. One portrayed civilization and education as a thin veneer, while the other bridged the gap between nature and culture through the metaphor of "habit as a second nature", emphasizing the ability of organisms to adapt to their physical and cultural environment. This article compares medieval debates and developments in contemporary science, in particular the rise of sociobiology in the 1970 s and evolutionary psychology in the 1990 s and the subsequent controversies it provoked in North America...|$|R

40|$|E-public {{procurement}} is {{an emerging}} {{feature of the}} EU trading system, with electronic purchase procedures increasingly being implemented through Web based buying tools and public records being held digitally in complex and dynamic systems. The multifaceted and fluid information ecology, which includes the cloud, mobile computing, social media and big data, requires efficient management of the digital assets. Growing e-procurement activity associated with new and evolving business models for storage, access and dissemination has increased the need for effective information governance and assurance. This information and knowledge aspect of the broader procurement architecture makes it imperative to enhance confidence in the soundness of the information governance and assurance processes. Procurement activity, at the multilateral level, is governed by the WTO (World Trade Organization) GPA (Government Procurement Agreement), which is a plurilateral agreement, i. e. applies only to signatories. In its present form, the Agreement contains very limited provisions concerning e-procurement and merely foresees that parties shall consult regularly on developments in this area (WTO 2006). The EU has initiated an e-procurement strategy but the uptake of specific initiatives such as the cloud, has been limited. Main factors influencing EU Member States reluctance to adopt e-procurements are first, apprehension with regard to information governance and assurance aspects; and, second, lack of a clear and coherent legal framework to facilitate e-procurements. This paper evaluates the EU?s recent strategy for e-procurement (European Commission 2012) and explores whether an holistic and cross disciplinary framework can support the broader aims of EU policy (2004, 2011). We propose a theoretical framework which offers a strategic and technology neutral structure for managing procurement related information. This employs common standards and a scalable roadmap, resting on four-pillars of procurement: transparency, accountability, competition, and equity. Within the current EU e-procurement agenda our framework suggests that <b>legal</b> and regulatory <b>convergence,</b> harmonisation of technical standards, and wider market access are the critical success factors for a sustainable e-procurement framework. Our model recognises four main external interdisciplinary drivers: strategic direction; alignment and delivery of business values; performance measurement and indicators; and information governance and assurance. We conclude that an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable public procurement is imperative in addressing {{the complexity of the}} current procurement landscape, and that this is a prerequisite for a fully realised internal common market.

Conceptually the twinning exercise is linked to the literature on Europeanisation. The paper argues that much of the debate on Europeanisation has been rather ‘inward looking’, with attention predominantly focusing on the way in which existing member states are being transformed {{as a result of their}} participation in EU structures. Yet the political importance attached to EU membership by the accession applicants, as well as EU’s determination to ensure the applicants ’ compliance with the acquis communautaire prior to their entry into the club, points to the fact that Europeanisation is not only a process confined to existing EU member states, but one that can also be exported outside the geographical borders of the EU, particularly to those who wish to join it. Against this background the paper argues that extending the scope of the Europeanisation thesis beyond the existing EU member states can not only help us understand better the process of transformation in Eastern Europe and the ongoing accession negotiations, but can also contribute towards the refinement of the term’s rather blurred conceptual content...|$|E
40|$|Unification {{of legal}} rules in Europe in {{not a new}} phenomenon. How-ever, nowadays, Europe is still an area with many {{different}} jurisdictions. This paper studies the process of unification of legal rules in the European Union within a non-cooperative game-theoretical framework. This paper contributes {{to the understanding of}} the process by concentrating on the role of the European Commission. In the law-and-economics literature, it is argued that national legal rules will converge more or less spontaneously through the works of legislators and judges. But <b>legal</b> <b>convergence</b> in the European Union is not necessary: preferences toward legal rules differ across nation-states; substituting a legal sytem for another is costly; a coordination problem may arise. We first study the interactions of two nation-states who chose non-coope-ratively their legal rules. We shall argue that the action of the Commission is, at first sight, likely to eliminate the coordination problem (under cer-tain conditions). Two factors are at work. First, the Commission has a certain expertise which enables it to propose new and perhaps more ef-ficient rules (so that the choice of unification does not reduce to select a particular nation-state legal system). Second, the Commission may use a system of fines that induce nation-states to abide by its rules (once these rules are adopted by nation-states Next, we refine our first model: the process of legal unification is viewed as a game where nation-states choose the game that they will play. They choose if they will try to reach an agreement without resorting to the ac-tions of the Commission, or if theywill play the game implicitely proposed by the Commission. This captures more precisely the action of the Com-mission, its ”right of initiative”, the publication of proposals in ”green ” or ”white papers”. In this second model, a coordination problem may arise...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} deepen the current {{understanding of the}} European Union’s (EU) transgovernmental (TG) cooperation with its Eastern neighbours under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Scholars of Europeanization and EU external governance have already pointed out the potential of EU TG cooperation to advance EU democracy promotion goals and regulatory standards to the ENP countries under the absence of EU membership perspective. The major instrument of such cooperation is Twinning, which fosters peer-to-peer, cross-border networks between civil servants and experts from EU member states (MS) and their ENP counterparts. Nevertheless, the existing literature overlooks several important aspects of EU TG cooperation, which pertain to the democratic substance, the role of MS, {{and the effectiveness of}} Twinning projects under the ENP. By drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship from EU studies and public administration, this dissertation addresses those gaps in four thematic articles. The first article provides the context for this study by presenting TG cooperation as a promising but little studied instrument, which may help the EU advance its democracy promotion agenda under the ENP. The second article introduces the concept of democratic governance substance and explores the presence and variation of democratic governance norms in Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood. The third article discusses the added value that Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and the older MS bring for Twinning cooperation in Azerbaijan and Ukraine. The fourth and last article explores to what extent Twinning projects in Ukraine have been effective and what conditions explain their (in) effectiveness. The overall geographical focus of this work are the countries of the EU’s Eastern neighbourhood, which are covered by the ENP framework. In such a way, this dissertation proposes a new concept of democratic governance substance, conceptualises the comparative advantages of EU MS for Twinning cooperation, and suggests an original way of understanding the effectiveness of Twinning projects. In contrast to the predominantly qualitative studies of EU TG cooperation under the ENP, it also seeks to make a methodological contribution by embracing mixed-method approaches to data analysis. Finally, it provides policy-relevant recommendations regarding Twinning implementation in the future. In doing so, it relies on an original analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews, conducted with Twinning participants and experts from the Eastern neighbourhood countries, EU member states, and the European Commission between November 2014 and May 2016. Additionally, it uses a wealth of supplementary data from official Twinning documents, sectoral watchdogs, international organizations, government sources in the EU and the Eastern neighbourhood, and existing policy research. The findings reveal that, through its Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood, the EU promotes democratic governance substance, which varies by configuration and magnitude across policy sectors and countries. This variation is best explained by domestic variables, such as the country’s political liberalisation, sector politicization, and sector technical complexity. In addition, the dissertation demonstrates that, during Twinning cooperation, CEECs manifest mostly country-specific comparative advantages, such as their recent transition and accession experience, socio-linguistic proximity, and shared historical legacies with the Eastern neighbourhood countries. In contrast, the older MS typically offer sector-specific comparative advantages, owing to their institutional experience, sectoral fit, existing sectoral networks with the Eastern neighbourhood countries, and prior Twinning participation. Both types of comparative advantages are found to be complementary. Finally, a configurational analysis of the effectiveness of Twinning projects in Ukraine indicates that a policy fit is the only necessary condition behind the legal and institutional convergence of the country with the EU’s policy recommendations. Thereby, institutional convergence occurs in parallel to or exceeds <b>legal</b> <b>convergence</b> in effective Twinning projects. This undermines the mainstream scholarly expectations of the wide gap between EU norm adoption and implementation (application) in EU TG cooperation under the ENP...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} incentives for {{and consequences of}} management earnings forecasts released by foreign firms opting into the U. S. markets. It also attempts to measure how country-level governance mechanisms (e. g., legal institutions and the SEC enforcement) and firm-level governance mechanisms (e. g., ownership and auditor) interact to influence the answers. It is the earliest study to link management earnings forecasts, corporate governance and firm valuation in an international setting. Additionally, by investigating issues on voluntary information that cross-listed firms sequentially provide, this dissertation extends the Investor Recognition Hypothesis by Merton (1987), and adds to our understanding about reputational bonding mechanisms (Coffee, 1999; Siegel, 2005). Essay I provides a primer on the institutional background of cross-listed firms, and demonstrates that these firms are unique in regulatory, economic and legal schemes. Specifically, foreign firms listing in the U. S. are characterized by various home-country legal institutional environments, different listing statuses (ADR Level I, II, III, and direct listing), active global product market interactions and different firm-level concentrated ownerships. These distinctive aspects of cross-listed firms make my study relevant to the literature on management earnings forecasts as well as firm valuation. Essay 2 focuses on the incentives to provide management earnings forecasts released by foreign firms listing in the U. S. I document that legal institutions, as measured by legal origin, investor protection and judicial efficiency, are positively associated with the likelihood of forecast occurrence. In addition, cross-listed firms {{are more apt to}} release forecast disclosures when they list on major U. S. stock exchanges, and have a higher proportion of foreign sales. Further, I indicate that the likelihood of forecasts is positively associated with institutional ownership, but negatively associated with the proportion of cash flow rights controlled by the largest shareholders. Essay 3 explores how management earnings forecasts, other firm attributes, and country institutional factors interact with each other to affect firm values. I find that forecasting cross-listed firms enjoy higher valuation premiums relative to non-forecasting firms. I also provide evidence that cross-listed firms from weaker legal institutions benefit more from disclosing management earnings forecasts. Moreover, I demonstrate that forecast precision and forecast frequency are favorably associated with firm valuation. Overall, this essay suggests that cross-listed firms are rewarded for their voluntary bonding to transparent financial reporting practices. Key words.

40|$|What is this book? This is an article-based dissertation. It explores {{issues which}} are {{foundational}} for {{the theory of}} comparative law. Ideas drawn from neighbouring disciplines (philosophy, social sciences epistemology, anthropology) are made to interact with law: the conception of otherness, the understanding of pluralism {{and the meaning of}} context are basic – in this sense underground – theoretical issues that determine the subsequent methodological choices of the comparatist. What is theory of comparative law? The comparative study of laws brings forth various compelling theoretical issues. For example, these concern questions about what is the conception of law in foreign cultures: through comparison domestic notions are put into question, as the comparatist faces the fact that in other places things are organized differently. Moreover, comparison brings about issues on the very possibility to understand the other, in addition to questions about the comparatist’s own ideas and tacit prejudices. Can the other be understood on its own terms? How does the comparatist relate new knowledge to what she already knows? Her pre-understanding is something she cannot completely get rid of, so she needs to acknowledge its influence on the process of acquisition of knowledge. Furthermore, the comparatist exits the normative legal sphere she was trained in and faces other normative spheres. She has to reconsider what normativity means; being “out” of the normative domestic legal system does not mean to be entirely freed from normativity. Are other scholars concerned about those issues? Indeed. Recently, comparative law has been described as the Cinderella that became the Queen. This has happened for various reasons. Classical comparative law drew much on legal material produced by nation states, while nowadays the law is created at multiple levels; its general structure appears more like a net rather than a pyramid. To face the challenges of globalisation, the study of comparative law (and of law in general) has to transform itself by assuming the transnational dimension of the legal and including in the analysis normative phenomena existing on a smaller scale too. Legal theorists and comparatists are needed in order to develop analytic tools which can make sense of the new normative structures studied. Furthermore, the last 30 years have also witnessed a deeply unravelling internal debate concerning the very fundaments of the discipline, its directions and purposes. Sharp disagreements have been manifested concerning the nature of the legal comparative scholarly endeavour and its aims and reasons: is it a method or a discipline? Does it further knowledge or use in practice? Other debated issues are: micro- and macrocomparison (which one to favour in different circumstances); functionality (whether it is a meaningful starting point); structuralism (whether to adopt it as a background theory); differences vs. similarities (what to focus on); tertium comparationis (what it is and is it necessary to have one for comparing); and translation (practical and ethical issues). Moreover, debates have considered the possibility and desirability of legal transplants and of <b>legal</b> <b>convergence.</b> The unrest is due to influences coming from among others the following: post-modern philosophy; critical schools of thought such as critical legal studies, post-colonial studies, discourse theory and orientalism; economic analysis of law, behavioural economics and neo-institutional economics; and the debate on objectivity carried out in philosophy of science. What to learn from this internal debate? According to the author, this debate resulted in a double complexification. On the one side, the understanding of the compared laws is complexified. This entails perceiving the laws as radically other and therefore not fully comprehensible. Laws have to be analysed without assuming their internal coherence but rather giving voice to the silenced disagreements and placing them within their context, without thereby crystallising it in an unmovable monolith. On the other side, the position of the comparatist has been complexified as well. This leads to the acknowledgment of her responsibility in choosing the appropriate analytical tools for her cognitive interests and stresses the ethical dimension connected to comparative legal research. These two complexifications when combined create the methodological basis against which the articles included in this dissertation have to be read. Are these two complexifications accepted in the literature? Overall, while the complexification of the concept of law has now reached a relatively higher level of acceptance (at least most comparatists would agree that good comparison has to look further then black-letter, legislated rules), the same cannot be said for the complexification of the position of the comparatist. Indeed the more easily spottable political implications of legal comparison have been unveiled, as have the parochialism and ethnocentrism of certain scholarship. Still, not many are willing to stop pondering on the epistemological position of the comparatist as a knower. The methodological debate within comparison seems to have really digested only the first complexification. This is the historical conjuncture where this dissertation can be located. It contributes to this debate by claiming that the two complexfications actually travel together. A broadened understanding of law requires a rethinking {{of the role of the}} comparatist as well: the field of study gets so broadened that the comparatist herself is included in it. What is the overall aim of this dissertation? Although each article stands on its own, the overall aim of this dissertation is to advance a certain attitude toward comparativism as an academic endeavour. It aims at raising awareness of the risks connected to reductionism and simplification and argues for a conception of legal comparative knowledge that embraces complexity theory and that reflects on its own epistemological status. Both the understanding of the compared laws and the ethical position of the comparatist need to be reflected upon, which is what these contributions purport to do...|$|E
