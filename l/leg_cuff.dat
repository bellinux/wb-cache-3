5000|$|A {{separate}} {{piece of}} elastic fabric was added {{at the top}} of the <b>leg</b> <b>cuff,</b> sealing it around the leg and preventing snow from entering on the top. Separate pieces of neoprene could be inserted between the cuff and foot in order to adjust the forward flex pattern of the boot, and the hinges could be adjusted to modify the [...] "cant", the lateral angle between the foot and leg.|$|E
50|$|Of all of these, {{only the}} mid-entry design {{would be at}} all {{successful}} the market. This design combines a traditional lower boot with a split upper cuff {{like that of a}} rear-entry design. The lower portion buckled down to provide strong support, whereas conventional rear-entry boots were sometimes noted for the lack of support for the forward foot and general softness in the <b>leg</b> <b>cuff.</b> Lange no longer produces a mid-entry design, and examples from other companies are also becoming rare.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Bob Lange started {{work on a}} new ski boot design using {{plastics}} in place of leather. It took several years of development before he had a suitable design, and widespread sales started {{in the winter of}} 1965-66. These early designs were very stiff and offered a tremendous improvement in control, but they became even more uncomfortable than the leather designs they replaced when the inner liner lost its elasticity around pressure points. The area around the <b>leg</b> <b>cuff</b> and especially the ankle would wear out quickly and could draw blood.|$|E

5000|$|Frequently used {{alternative}} {{terms are}} <b>leg</b> <b>cuffs,</b> (leg/ankle) shackles, footcuffs, fetters or leg irons.The term [...] "fetter" [...] shares a root {{with the word}} [...] "foot".|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} front-entry boot design, forward flex is resisted by the friction {{of the lower}} section of the <b>leg</b> <b>cuff</b> moving over the vertically extended top of the foot section, which rises above the ankle. This sliding movement can occur until the upper cuff reaches the flat part of the foot area, where further flex requires the plastic to press down on the skier's foot. Shaping the two parts offers some control over the flex pattern. Some designs have a lip moulded into the foot section that controls this stopping point.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of the design, largely a side-effect as opposed to design feature, is {{the location of the}} buckles. In a conventional front-entry design, there are two independent sections of the boot that need to be closed. Normally each section has two buckles, producing the classic four-buckle boot with two buckles over the foot and two on the <b>leg</b> <b>cuff.</b> The Flexon provides one buckle each on the foot and lower leg, and a third over the ankle. When tightened, this third buckle pulls the flex tongue and foot rearward, helping to stabilize the heel in the rear pocket of the boot.|$|E
50|$|Rosemount's {{solution}} was to build the boot in two halves, one covering {{the majority of the}} foot and leg, and a smaller section that hinged along the footbed, rotating out to the side. To put the boot on, the moving section was rotated out, allowing the skier's foot to be inserted through the opened side of the boot. The moving section was then rotated up, back into place, and held there by two buckles, one on the foot and one on the <b>leg</b> <b>cuff.</b> The seam was then sealed from the snow with an elastic material that was stretched over the front of the boot.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the bloomer leg in {{relation}} to the seat of the bloomers varied according to the woman’s height. The snugness of the fit depended on the how correct these measurements were. The bloomer legs, which were often made from a plain fabric for reasons of thrift, were gathered below the knee. The bloomer <b>leg</b> <b>cuffs</b> had eyelets through which crocheted cordons called “vrakothilies” were passed, thus ensuring the pleated material fit snugly around the ankles.|$|R
5000|$|In the rear-entry design, {{the entire}} foot area and sole are a single unit {{similar to a}} slipper. The <b>leg</b> <b>cuff</b> is split in two, with front and rear {{sections}} that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a cable locks the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable [...] "slop", and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside {{of this approach is}} that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was twofold: 1) Develop a controlled-release ergometer for the measurement of musculo-tendinous stiffness of the knee flexors and 2) Compare results of the measurement of musculo-tendinous stiffness obtained via controlled-release method and oscillation method. Each purpose was addressed in a separate research paper. Research paper one describes the successful modification of a Cybex NORM isokinetic ergometer for use in controlled-release experiments. The modifications include not only the ones to the Cybex, but also the design of an instrumented <b>leg</b> <b>cuff</b> and software to collect and analyze the data from the experiment. The stiffness values obtained from this technique compared favorably, when considering morphological differences, to those obtained from controlled-release experiments of the ankle joint. The main difficulty encountered in this experiment was the lack of information obtained from low end of the stiffness-moment curve. In research paper two, both techniques were successfully used to measure stiffness of the knee-flexors and no significant difference was found between the two methods, (p = 0. 157). However, it was clear that each technique has its advantages and disadvantages in regard to what part of the stiffness-moment curve they are able to measure. Due to the inability of participants to perform the oscillation technique with high loads, this technique is best suited to measure stiffness of lightly loaded systems. On the other hand, the controlled-release technique provided a good representation of the high, linear end of the stiffness-moment curve, but was unable to provide good information about the toe-region of the stiffness-moment curve.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{influence}} of the work history of the inspiratory muscles upon the fatigue characteristics of the plantar flexors (PF). We hypothesized that under conditions where the inspiratory muscle metaboreflex has been elicited, PF fatigue would be hastened due to peripheral vasoconstriction. Eight volunteers undertook seven test conditions, two of which followed 4 week of inspiratory muscle training (IMT). The inspiratory metaboreflex was induced by inspiring against a calibrated flow resistor. We measured torque and EMG during isometric PF exercise at 85 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque. Supramaximal twitches were superimposed upon MVC efforts at 1 min intervals (MVC(TI)); twitch interpolation assessed the level of central activation. PF was terminated (T(lim)) when MVC(TI) was < 50 % of baseline MVC. PF T(lim) was significantly shorter than control (9. 93 +/- 1. 95 min) in the presence of a <b>leg</b> <b>cuff</b> inflated to 140 mmHg (4. 89 +/- 1. 78 min; P = 0. 006), as well as when PF was preceded immediately by fatiguing inspiratory muscle work (6. 28 +/- 2. 24 min; P = 0. 009). Resting the inspiratory muscles for 30 min restored the PF T(lim) to control. After 4 weeks, IMT, inspiratory muscle work at the same absolute intensity did not influence PF T(lim), but T(lim) was significantly shorter at the same relative intensity.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} acute hypoxia (AH) on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) using two independent assessment techniques to clarify previous, conflicting reports. Twelve healthy volunteers (6 men, 6 women) performed six classic <b>leg</b> <b>cuff</b> tests, three breathing normoxic (Fi(O 2) = 0. 21) and three breathing hypoxic (Fi(O 2) = 0. 12) gas, using a single blinded, Latin squares design with 5 -min washout between trials. Continuous measurements of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CBFv; DWL MultiDop X 2) and radial artery blood pressure (ABP; Colin 7000) were recorded in the supine position during a single experimental session. Autoregulation index (ARI) scores were calculated using the model of Tiecks et al. (Tiecks FP, Lam AM, Aaslid R, Newell DW. Stroke 26 : 1014 - 1019, 1995) from ABP and CBFv changes following rapid cuff deflation (cuff ARI) and from ABP to CBFv transfer function, impulse, and step responses (TFA ARI) obtained during a 4 -min period prior to cuff inflation. A new measure of %CBFv recovery 4 s after peak impulse was also derived from TFA. AH reduced cuff ARI (5. 65 +/- 0. 70 to 5. 01 +/- 0. 96, P = 0. 04), TFA ARI (4. 37 +/- 0. 76 to 3. 73 +/- 0. 71, P = 0. 04), and %Recovery (62. 2 +/- 10. 9 % to 50. 8 +/- 9. 9 %, P = 0. 03). Slight differences between TFA and cuff ARI values {{may be attributed to}} heightened sympathetic activity during cuff tests as well as differential sensitivity to low- and high-frequency components of CA.

In addition, these findings demonstrate the potential utility of TFA ARI and %Recovery scores for future CA investigations. 2022...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:: Carotid-femoral {{pulse wave}} velocity, a {{predictor}} of cardiovascular outcome, is conventionally measured using a tonometer sequentially placed upon the carotid and femoral arteries, gated using an electrocardiogram. <b>Leg</b> <b>cuff</b> detection of the femoral pulse removes the need for signal gating, reduces the time required for a single measurement, but gives different pulse wave velocity values to tonometric analysis. A novel algorithm to correct for the transit time and distance related to the additional femoral segment {{was applied to the}} cuff-based approach in this study. METHOD:: Eighty-eight individuals were recruited across four centres and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measured in triplicate using two operators with both a tonometer-based device and a device using an inflated thigh cuff with and without the use of the novel algorithm. Comparison was made by Bland-Altman and regression analysis. RESULTS:: The unadjusted cuff-based approach gave lower pulse wave velocity values than the tonometer-based approach (6. 11  ± 1. 27 and 7. 02 ±  1. 88   m/s, P <  0. 001). With application of the algorithm, the cuff-based device gave similar pulse wave velocity values (7. 04  ± 1. 72   m/s) as the tonometer-based approach (P =  0. 86). Analysis of covariance with age showed a difference between the tonometer and cuff-based methods (P < 0. 001), with a dependence upon age (P = 0. 004). The adjusted cuff-based method gave similar results to the tonometer-based method (P = 0. 94), with no dependence upon age (P =  0. 46). CONCLUSION:: This study provided validation of a cuff-based assessment of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity against the universally accepted tonometric method. Adjusting the cuff-based method for the additional femoral segment measured gives results comparable to the tonometer-based method, for which the majority of population data exist to date. 7 page(s...|$|E

At best, captives were fed beans, corn, yams, rice, and palm oil. Slaves were fed one meal a day with water, if at all. When food was scarce, slaveholders would get priority over the slaves. Sometimes captives were allowed to move around during the day, but many ships kept the shackles on throughout the arduous journey. Aboard certain French ships, slaves were brought on deck to periodically receive fresh air. While female slaves were typically permitted to be on deck more frequently, male slaves would be watched closely to prevent revolt when above deck.|$|R

LeVar Burton, on the first two seasons' uniforms In the show's early seasons, the uniforms were one-piece jumpsuits made of Spandex, and sized slightly too small so that they would be stretched when worn and provide a smooth appearance. But the cast members hated the uniforms's painfully tight fit and lack of pockets, and after Patrick Stewart's chiropractor warned that they risked permanent injury, the actors persuaded the costumers to gradually replace them with wool uniforms.

40|$|Purpose: To {{reduce the}} chance of injury due to {{pneumatic}} tourniquet use, the minimum cuff pressure required to maintain a bloodless field should be used. The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out if Limb Occlusion Pressure (LOP-the cuff pressure required to occlude arterial flow) is lower with a wide can· toured cuff than with a standard width cylindrical cuff at the calf, if cuff pres-sun~s based on measured LOP will be lower than the typical 250 mmHg used in lower <b>leg</b> <b>cuffs,</b> and if a new automatic LOP measurement method gives the same results as the standard Doppler stethoscope method. Sam ple: 16 adult volunteers were tested in a controlll [...] "d laboratory setti ng, and S 3 clin ical cases were reviewed at two centers. Design: Repeated measures comparison of LOP on volunteers with the two different cuffs and measurement methods, and review of clinical cases. Resulb: LOP was lower with the wide cuff on all volunteers (mean reduction 20 mmHg, SO 8. 6, range 5 - 35, p < 0. (01). The average difference of 1. 2 mmHg between Doppler and automatic LOP readings was not significant (p " " 0. 43). Based on the voluntet'f results, using LOP plus a safety margin of 40, 60, or 80 mmHg (for LOP < 130, nl- l 90, or 190 + respectively) with a standard width cylindrical cuff will lead to an average cuff pressure of 223 mmHg (range 170 - 299, SO 36), 11 % lower than typical practice and up to 80 mmHg (32 %) lower on some patients. Using a wide, contoured cuff should further reduce cuff pressures to an average of 195 mOlHg (range 160 - 280, SO:B), 22 % lower than typical practice and a reduction of up to 90 mmBg (36 %). At tvw clinics, the wide cuff maintained a bloodless field in 48 out of 53 cases (91 %) when used at 200 mmHg. Conclusions; Using a wide, contoured cuff at the calf should reduce required cuff pressures com pared to a standard cuff. Setting cuff pressure based on LOP should fu rther reduce cuff pressures for most patients compared to typically used pressures. With continued development, the new automatic method may become a viable alternative to the Doppler method and may make LOP meas-urement more practical in the c 1 inkal setting...|$|R
