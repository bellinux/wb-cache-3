40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{equation of}} self-thinning, which was {{proposed in the}} logistic theory of plant growth for describing the density effect in self-thinning populations, {{is based on the}} following two fundamental assumptions: one is that the growth of mean phytomass w follows a general logistic equation; the other is that the final yield Y(t), which is pre scribed as the product of the asymptote of mean phytomass W(t) and density P, becomes constant irrespective of P, i. e. the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> constant final <b>yield</b> is assumed. In the light of the basic principle of self-thinning that the relative growth rate of mean phytomass (l/u>) (dw/dt) is given by the sum of the relative growth rate <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> (1 /y) (dy/dt) and the relative mortality (- 1 /P) (dP/dt), the first assumption brings {{to the conclusion that the}} final yield Y(t) is not prescribed by W{t) P, but is prescribed by(l-tn/A (t)) W(t) P (ro, relative mortality; A (f), coefficient of growth), whose value depends on density P except for the special case where both Wit) P and m are independent of P. This inevitable consequence is in conflict with the prescription referring to the final yield Y(t) in the second assumption of the logistic theory of plant growth.

Although ozone fluctuations are anti-correlated with those in temperature, minima in ozone do not coincide exactly in longitude with temperature maxima. The percentage variation in ozone increases upward and is always larger than that in temperature at the same pressure.

The developed vertical yield stresses vary within the range of 1. 2 to 1. 8 times the specifically assigned vertical effective stress under which ageing is allowed for 15 to 105 days. But the corresponding ageing volumetric strains are small, varying within the range of 0. 6 % to 3. 4 % with most being less than 2 %.

The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of conceptual change teaching strategies on the conceptual development of grade 11 learners on Newton’s second <b>law</b> <b>of</b> motion. The two strategies employed were the cognitive conflict strategy and the development of ideas strategy. A sequential explanatory mixed-method research design was used during this study. The qualitative data were used to elucidate the quantitative findings. The quantitative research consisted of a quasi-experimental design consisting of a single-group pre-test–post-test method. During the qualitative part of the research a phenomenological research approach was utilised to gain a better understanding of participants’ learning experiences during the intervention. The quantitative research made use of an adapted version of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The data collected from the pre-test were used to inform the intervention. The intervention was videotaped and the video analysis or qualitative data analysis was done. After the intervention the post-test was written by the learners. Hake’s average normalised learning gain from pre- to post-scores was analysed to establish the effectiveness of the intervention. The two sets of results (quantitative and qualitative) were integrated. Information from the qualitative data analysis was used to support and explain the quantitative data. The quantitative results indicate that there was an improvement in the students’ force conception from their initial alternative conceptions, such as that of an internal force.

The qualitative data revealed that the understanding <b>of</b> Newton’s second <b>law</b> <b>of</b> motion by the learners who partook in this study did improve, since the learners immediately recognised the mistakes made when confronted with the anchor concept.

40|$|A Zenonian supertask {{involving}} {{an infinite number}} of identical colliding balls is generalized to include balls with different masses. Under the restriction that the total mass of all the balls is finite, classical mechanics leads to velocities that have no upper limit. Relativistic mechanics results in velocities bounded by that of light, but energy and momentum are not conserved, implying indeterminism. By entertaining the possibility that the missing energy and momentum are carried away by a photon, however, one can restore the conservation laws and determinism. 1 Classical Zeno process It is a commonplace that, in the mechanics of a system composed of massive, elastically colliding particles, the conservation <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> momentum and energy may be applied, either individually to each pair of particles as they collide, or to the whole system. In the former case, momentum and energy are conserved at each collision, and in the latter the total momentum (the vector sum of all the individual momenta) and the total energy (the scalar sum of all the energies) are constant in time. However, consider the infinite set of points on a straight line, xn = 2 −n, where n = 0, 1, 2, [...] ., which we shall call ‘Zeno points’. Suppose that there are equal point masses, ‘Zeno balls’, at each of these Zeno points. If all the balls are at rest except the zeroth one, which has a negative velocity, it will collide after a finite time with the first ball, transferring all its momentum to that ball (the collision is presumed to be perfectly elastic). This first ball then collides with its neighbour to the left, which will subsequently collide with its left neighbour, and so on ad infinitum until, after a finite time has elapsed, all the balls have been briefly in motion, but all have been brought to rest. Since {{there is no longer any}} motion, the momentum and kinetic energy of the original ball have been lost. Momentum and energy conservation have been violated! Such is the scenario described by Pérez Laraudogoitia (1995); and, invoking the time-reversal invariance of Newtonian mechanics, this author proclaimed the demise of classical determinism.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of cementation on the mechanical properties of cement-treated soil, a series of isotropic consolidation and undrained triaxial compression shear tests were performed for cement-treated specimens of Ariake clay, Akita sand, Rokko Masado and Toyoura sand. This paper evaluates factors affecting the shear strength of these cement-treated soils. The following conclusions are obtained: 1) Cement-treated soil has a normally consolidated line in e-ln p 2 ̆ 7 space which depends on the mixing cement content. The consolidation yield stress, p 2 ̆ 7 _y, of cement-treated soil increases with increasing cement content and initial specimen density. 2) Changes in cohesive strength due to cement-treatment can be represented by a tensile effective stress, p 2 ̆ 7 _r. Strength properties can then be normalized by the augmented consolidation stress, (p 2 ̆ 7 _c+p 2 ̆ 7 _r). 3) The shear strength properties of quasi-overconsolidated clay can be represented by the yield stress ratio, R=(p 2 ̆ 7 _y+p 2 ̆ 7 _r) /(p 2 ̆ 7 _c+p 2 ̆ 7 _r). 4) The undrained shear strength of cement-treated soils can be represented as a power <b>law</b> relation <b>of</b> the <b>yield</b> stress ratio, R, and the augmented consolidation stress...|$|R
