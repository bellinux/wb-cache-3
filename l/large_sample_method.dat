40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} statistical tests for inter-subject and total variabilities between treatments under crossover designs. Since estimators of variance components for inter-subject variability and total variability in crossover design are not independent, the usual F-test cannot be applied. Alternatively, we propose a test {{based on the}} concept of the extension of the modified <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>method</b> to compare inter-subject variability and total variability between treatments under a 2 £ 2 m replicated crossover design. An asymptotic power of the proposed test is derived. A sensitivity analysis is performed based on the asymptotic power to determine how the power changes with respect to various parameters such as inter-subject correlation and intra-class correlation. Also the two methods for sample size calculation for testing total variability under 2 £ 4 crossover design are discussed. The method based on the Fisher–Cornish inversion shows better performance than the method based on the normal approximation. Several simulation studies were conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed test. Our simulation results show that the proposed test can control type I error satisfactorily...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Incomplete data often {{arise in}} various {{clinical}} trials such as crossover trials, equivalence trials, and pre and post-test comparative studies. Various {{methods have been}} developed to construct confidence interval (CI) of risk difference or risk ratio for incomplete paired binary data. But, there is little works done on incomplete continuous correlated data. To this end, this manuscript aims to develop several approaches to construct CI of the difference of two means for incomplete continuous correlated data. Methods <b>Large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>method,</b> hybrid method, simple Bootstrap-resampling method based on the maximum likelihood estimates (B 1) and Ekbohm’s unbiased estimator (B 2), and percentile Bootstrap-resampling method based on the maximum likelihood estimates (B 3) and Ekbohm’s unbiased estimator (B 4) are presented to construct CI of the difference of two means for incomplete continuous correlated data. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed CIs in terms of empirical coverage probability, expected interval width, and mesial and distal non-coverage probabilities. Results Empirical results show that the Bootstrap-resampling-based CIs B 1, B 2, B 4 behave satisfactorily for small to moderate sample sizes in the sense that their coverage probabilities could be well controlled around the pre-specified nominal confidence level and the ratio of their mesial non-coverage probabilities to the non-coverage probabilities could be well controlled in the interval [0. 4, 0. 6].

40|$|Abstract Background In meta-regression, as {{the number}} of trials in the {{analyses}} decreases, the risk of false positives or false negatives increases. This is partly due to the assumption of normality that may not hold in small samples. Creation of a distribution from the observed trials using permutation methods to calculate P values may allow for less spurious findings. Permutation has not been empirically tested in meta-regression. The objective {{of this study was to}} perform an empirical investigation to explore the differences in results for meta-analyses on a small number of trials using standard <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> approaches verses permutation-based methods for meta-regression. Methods We isolated a sample of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) for interventions that have a small number of trials (herbal medicine trials). Trials were then grouped by herbal species and condition and assessed for methodological quality using the Jadad scale, and data were extracted for each outcome. Finally, we performed meta-analyses on the primary outcome of each group of trials and meta-regression for methodological quality subgroups within each meta-analysis. We used <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>methods</b> and permutation methods in our meta-regression modeling. We then compared final models and final P values between methods. Results We collected 110 trials across 5 intervention/outcome pairings and 5 to 10 trials per covariate. When applying <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>methods</b> and permutation-based methods in our backwards stepwise regression the covariates in the final models were identical in all cases. The P values for the covariates in the final model were larger in 78 % (7 / 9) of the cases for permutation and identical for 22 % (2 / 9) of the cases. Conclusions We present empirical evidence that permutation-based resampling may not change final models when using backwards stepwise regression, but may increase P values in meta-regression of multiple covariates for relatively small amount of trials. </p...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Stable isotope {{sourcing}} is used {{to estimate}} proportional contributions of sources to a mixture, {{such as in the}} analysis of animal diets and plant nutrient use.

In addition, by cross-referencing the quantitative and qualitative data, a number of insights were gained into potential problems. Conclusion.

We have recently demonstrated nominally significant associations between SAP 97 gene and schizophrenia among Japanese males. The present study aimed to replicate these findings using {{an independent and}} <b>larger</b> <b>sample.</b> <b>Methods</b> We investigated seven SAP 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that displayed a significant association with schizophrenia in our preceding study in an independent Japanese population consisting {{of a total of}} 393 unrelated patients with schizophrenia (232 males and 161 females) and 393 unrelated control subjects (211 males and 182 females). Results The SNP rs 9843659 showed a significant genotypic association with male patients in a recessive model (p = 0. 037). The analysis of the combined data from the current and prior studies also demonstrated a significant association of this SNP (p = 0. 0039). The meta-analysis for the allele frequency covering the two studies yielded an odds ratio of 1. 38. Conclusions The present study replicated the previously reported male-selective genetic association between the SAP 97 polymorphism and schizophrenia. These findings further support the possible involvement of the SAP 97 gene variation in the susceptibility to schizophrenia in males and in the genetic basis for sex differences in the disorder. </p...|$|R

Results The prevalence of problem gambling was 2. 7 % among the 15 - to 17 -year-olds, and rose to 3. 6 % among the 18 - and 19 -year-olds. Multiple CA revealed that, even when it does not reach risk-related or problem levels, gambling is associated with the use of alcohol and tobacco. In particular, the analysis showed that non-problem gambling levels were associated with alcohol and tobacco use at least once in the previous month, and that higher-risk gambling levels related to the use of cannabis and episodes of drunkenness at least once in the previous month.

Around 250 species of aphids {{out of the}} identified 4000 aphid species are considered as serious pests. The experiments were performed with pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) that were feeding on bean plants (Vivia fabe). Pea aphids feed on plant phloem sap by probing their stylet into the sieve elements of the plant and secreting saliva for external digestion. In order to collect aphid salivary proteins from the secreted saliva, small scale and <b>large</b> scale <b>sample</b> collection <b>methods</b> were carried out. The small scale <b>sample</b> <b>method</b> was performed in microfluidic devices using 10 - 25 aphids. Aphids were able to feed on the artificial diet by probing through a stretched ParafilmTM and survived for 2 - 3 days in the microfluidic devices.
