The production and trade of Inuit art, i.e. of artistic and crafted objects, mainly sculptures made from serpentine, soapstone and marble, and soon afterwards also of graphics (drawings, <b>lithotomies,</b> lithographs, erasures) and tapestry (for example hangings), yielded excellent economic and cultural successes.|$|R
25|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{written in}} the 5th century BC {{provides}} the earliest protocol for professional conduct and ethical behavior a young physician needed to abide by in life and in treating and managing the health and privacy of his patients. The multiple volumes of the Hippocratic corpus and the Hippocratic Oath elevated and separated the standards of proper Hippocratic medical conduct and its fundamental medical and surgical principles from other practitioners of folk medicine often laden with superstitious constructs, and/or of specialists of sorts some of whom would endeavor to carry out invasive body procedures with dubious consequences, such as <b>lithotomy.</b> Works from the Hippocartic corpus include; On the Articulations or On Joints, On Fractures, On the Instruments of Reduction, The Physician's Establishment or Surgery, On Injuries of the Head, On Ulcers, On Fistulae, and On Hemorrhoids.|$|E

Six years ago, she was diagnosed as having vesico-vaginal fitula, vesico-vaginallithiasis and vaginal atresia by urologic examination and received <b>lithotomies</b> several times.

The patient is placed in a special position in a <b>lithotomy</b> operating table, called the <b>lithotomy</b> position (which, curiously, retains this name until the present day, when the same position is used for other unrelated medical procedures).|$|E
50|$|A Cochrane Review {{found that}} the <b>lithotomy</b> {{position}} {{may not be the}} ideal position for child birth, noting that while it makes care easier for physicians by placing the patient in an easily accessible position, it is often harder on birthing mothers as use of the <b>lithotomy</b> position can narrow the birth canal by up to a third. In lieu of the <b>lithotomy</b> position, the Cochrane Review recommended birthing mothers make informed choices about birthing positions and find the position that is most comfortable for them.|$|E
50|$|Lithoclastic cystotomy is {{attributed}} to Ammonius Lithotomos (stone-cutter), from which arose the term <b>lithotomy,</b> now having the arbitrary signification of cutting for the stone.

The latter invented a technique for lateral vesical stone <b>lithotomy</b> in 1727, whereupon he {{was said to}} perform the operation in about one minute (an important feat before anesthesia).

Medical texts from ancient Mesopotamia, India, China, Persia, Greece, and Rome all mentioned calculous disease. Part of the Hippocratic Oath suggests there were practicing surgeons in ancient Greece to whom physicians were to defer for lithotomies. The Roman medical treatise De Medicina by Aulus Cornelius Celsus contained a description of <b>lithotomy,</b> and this work served as the basis for this procedure until the 18th century.|$|E
