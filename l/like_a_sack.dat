500|$|Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World {{believed}} {{the game to}} be the first simulator to recreate [...] "the real feeling of civilian flying", particularly because of its graphics and ATC system. He considered its flight physics to be [...] "much better than Pro Pilot, although not up to the level of Flight Simulator 98". He finished by calling Flight Unlimited II [...] "a must-have for any general-aviation enthusiast." [...] John Nolan of Computer Games Magazine found that the new flight physics were [...] "more than adequate for the task at hand", despite certain [...] "questionable areas". He praised the graphics and ATC, but noted AI glitches with the latter. He summarized, [...] "Overall, this simulation is somewhat above average". Dean Evans of PC Gamer UK called it [...] "the best civilian flight sim we've ever seen", which makes [...] "Flight Simulator look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of old spam". He found the game to be [...] "immensely realistic" [...] and praised its terrain and simulated airspace. Similarly, Edge praised the believable and highly detailed environment, noting that Looking Glass Studios managed to cleverly soften the contrast between photo-captured textures and polygon objects [...] "using haze as a real effect rather than a distance-clipping cheat". The magazine consluded that dismissing the game simply because of its lack of weapons [...] "would be a mistake", and explained that the interaction with the world [...] "is everything—it's reward enough simply to explore rather than to destroy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The project coordinators (including book {{publisher}} and publicist George P. Putnam) interviewed Earhart {{and asked her}} to accompany pilot Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed from Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at Pwll near Burry Port, South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later. There is a commemorative blue plaque at the site. Since most of the flight was on instruments and Earhart had no training for this type of flying, she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, [...] "Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of potatoes." [...] She added, [...] "... maybe someday I'll try it alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|Far below, and {{travelling}} rapidly {{down the}} gorge, whirled something <b>like</b> <b>a</b> huge empty <b>sack.</b> For him it meant--what did it not mean?--the German air-fleet, Kurt, the Prince, Europe, all things stable and familiar, {{the forces that}} had brought him, the forces that had seemed indisputably victorious. And it went down the rapids <b>like</b> <b>an</b> empty <b>sack</b> and left the visible world to Asia, to yellow people beyond Christendom, to all that was terrible and strange! ...|$|R

50|$|A {{supported}} VisualWorks product parcel {{is represented}} by an icon that looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> parcel. Parcels from other vendors look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shopping <b>sack.</b> Because of the convoluted history of Smalltalk class development this can be very useful. For instance, a parcel icon indicates that the Arbor hypertext system is now VisualWorks supported.|$|R

60|$|This time, lowered quickly, he {{sank into}} the chair <b>like</b> <b>a</b> half-empty <b>sack</b> of meal, and {{continued}} so to sink, until, crumpling at the middle, his great tawny head falling forward, {{he lay on the}} floor unconscious. His tongue, black and swollen, lolled out of his mouth. As buckets of water were poured on him he groaned and moaned. And here ended the first lesson.|$|R
60|$|Sight of {{that dropped}} gun broke Lucy's spell of horror, which {{had kept her}} silent but for one scream. Suddenly her blood leaped like fire in her veins. She {{measured}} the distance to Sage King. Joel was turning. Then Lucy darted at the King, reached him, and, leaping, was half up on him when he snorted and jumped, not breaking her hold, but keeping her from getting up. Then iron hands clutched her and threw her, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> empty <b>sack,</b> to the grass.|$|R
60|$|They saw, they shouted, they massed {{themselves}} {{together and}} held up the oars to meet them. But Wulf spurred fiercely, and, short as was the way, the heavy horses, trained to tourney, gathered their speed. Now they were on them. The oars were swept aside like reeds; all round them flashed the swords, and Wulf {{felt that he was}} hurt, he knew not where. But his sword flashed also, one blow--there was no time for more--yet the man beneath it sank <b>like</b> <b>an</b> empty <b>sack.</b>|$|R
60|$|The borderman sprang {{over the}} table like a huge catamount, and with {{movement}} equally quick, knocked Case with a crash against the wall; closed on him before he could move a hand, and flung him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of meal over the bluff.|$|E
60|$|As {{the women}} made no objection, {{those who had}} carried them from the house again raised them in their arms--Mrs Scholtz insisting, however, on being treated a little less <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of old clothes--and the march along the hill-side was begun.|$|E

50|$|Saccate is a {{term used}} in botany to {{describe}} plant parts that are shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pouch or <b>sack.</b> Sometimes, when all members of a taxon share a property of having some part being saccate, this is {{referred to in the}} name of the taxon, such as the algae family Phaeosaccionaceae.|$|R
50|$|With 1:07 left in {{the game}} and the Roughriders 1st-and-15 at their own 25-yard line, Darian Durant broke out of what looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sure <b>sack</b> by Diamond Ferri at the Roughriders' 18-yard line. Durant ran left along the Roughriders' 19-yard line, escaped a diving tackle (by Alouettes' {{defensive}} end Jermaine McElveen), and then Durant then threw the ball downfield toward the left sideline, but was intercepted by Alouettes' defensive back Billy Parker at the Roughriders' 38-yard line with 56 seconds {{left in the}} game. The Alouettes kept the ball on offence {{for the remainder of the}} game to win 21-18.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{his horse}} being athirst, Sir Ector drove {{him into the}} ford that he might drink, and whilst he was there he was {{suddenly}} aware where, {{on the other side}} of the stream, was a singular party coming along the roadway. For first of all there rode a knight entirely clad in black, riding upon a black horse, and all the harness and furniture of that horse entirely of black. Behind him, that knight led four horses as though they were pack-horses, and across each one of those four horses was a knight in full armor, bound fast to the saddle <b>like</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of grain, whereat Sir Ector was very greatly astonished.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had just}} {{time to see}} Corporal Flynn, who had slipped and fallen, come rolling towards him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of flour. Next moment he was swept off his legs, {{and went into the}} lee {{scuppers}} with his comrade in a bath of pea-soup and salt-water! ...|$|E
60|$|The /charco/, {{or water}} hole, was twelve yards away. Ranse {{took one of}} Curly's ankles and dragged him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of {{potatoes}} to the brink. Then with the strength and sleight of a hammer-throw he hurled the offending member of society far into the lake.|$|E
60|$|Poor little Retty, {{though by}} far the lightest weight, was the most {{troublesome}} of Clare's burdens. Marian had been <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> of meal, a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered. Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty {{was a bunch of}} hysterics.|$|E
60|$|But {{the elderly}} woman brought another interruption. She dropped her iron on the shirtwaist, {{clutched}} at the board, fumbled it, caved {{in at the}} knees and hips, and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> half-empty <b>sack</b> collapsed on the floor, her long shriek rising in the pent room to the acrid smell of scorching cloth. The women at the boards near to her scrambled, first, to the hot iron to save the cloth, and then to her, while the forewoman hurried belligerently down the aisle. The women farther away continued unsteadily at their work, losing movements {{to the extent of}} a minute's set-back to the totality of the efficiency of the fancy-starch room.|$|R
6000|$|... 111 still sat upright {{upon the}} horse's back; but the pumpkin head was gone, {{and only the}} {{sharpened}} stick that served for a neck was visible. As for the Scarecrow, the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and {{the lower part of}} his body--which appeared very plump and round while his upper half seemed <b>like</b> <b>an</b> empty <b>sack.</b> Upon his head the Scarecrow still wore the heavy crown, which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it; but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Japanese pug dog.|$|R
50|$|People here mainly worship Lord Shiva, Lord Krishna, Goddess Durga, Sai baba, and Lord Rama and Hanuman. Few of them follow Jai gurdev baba {{who wear}} dresses similar <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brown color <b>sacks.</b> People also worship Pehalwan Vir baba and budia mai at their temples. There is a hanuman and shiva temple also inside the village. Gram Devi is {{the goddess of}} this village {{situated}} next to navranga tara(pond). Most {{of the people are}} spiritually inclined and they host a month-long satsang program every year.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maximus gave a loud chuckle, {{and before}} I could assist him he seized his comrade in his {{powerful}} arms, heaved him {{over his shoulder}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack,</b> and ran towards the shore as lightly as if his burden were a child instead of a big over-fed Esquimau! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it does. The bone and the hank of hair stuff is played out. The dairy-maid style is coming in.

What are you doing here by yourself?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Dalmahoy flung a hand upwards. Night lay <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> {{around and}} below us: but right aloft, at the zenith, day was trembling.

60|$|Elijah {{proved a}} bigger task {{than he had}} anticipated. A few inches at a time, resting in between, he dragged him over the ground and up a broken rubble of ice {{to the side of}} the boat. But into the boat he could not get him. Elijah's limp body was far more {{difficult}} to lift and handle than an equal weight of like dimensions but rigid. Daylight failed to hoist him, for the body collapsed at the middle <b>like</b> <b>a</b> part-empty <b>sack</b> of corn. Getting into the boat, Daylight tried vainly to drag his comrade in after him. The best he could do was to get Elijah's head and shoulders on top the gunwale. When he released his hold, to heave from farther down the body, Elijah promptly gave at the middle and came down on the ice.|$|R
5000|$|I cried alone, {{putting my}} head in my hands. I can no longer bear the sight of people full of hatred, applauding {{the killing of a}} poor farm worker. I no longer see them, but I still hear them, the crowd who gave the judge a {{standing}} ovation, saying: [...] "Kill her, kill her! Allahu Akbar!" [...] The court house is invaded by a euphoric horde who break down the doors, chanting: [...] "Vengeance for the holy prophet. Allah is great!" [...] I was then thrown <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old rubbish <b>sack</b> into the van... I had lost all humanity in their eyes.|$|R
5000|$|The Shanhaijing {{collection}} of early myths and legends uses hundun 渾敦 describing a shen 神 [...] "spirit; god" [...] on Tian Shan 天山 [...] "Heaven Mountain".There {{is a god}} here who looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> yellow <b>sack.</b> He is scarlet like cinnabar fire. He has six feet and four wings. He is Muddle Thick. He has no face and no eyes. He knows how to sing and dance. He is in truth the great god Long River. (2, tr. Birrell 2000:226) This [...] "great god Long River" [...] translates Di Jiang 帝江 [...] "Emperor Yangtze River", which is identified with Huang Di 黄帝 [...] "Yellow Emperor". Toshihiko Izutsu (1967 2:19, cited by Girardot 1983:82) suggests that singing and dancing here and in Zhuangzi refers to shamanic trance-inducing ceremonies, [...] "the monster {{is said to be}} a bird, which is most probably an indication that the shamanistic dancing here in question was some kind of feather dance in which the shaman was ritually ornamented with a feathered headdress." ...|$|R
