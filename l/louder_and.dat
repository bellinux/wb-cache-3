5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious.

5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E

25|$|At dawn of {{the third}} day, there was thunder, lightning, a dense cloud upon the {{mountain}}, and a very loud blast of the horn. Moses led the people {{to the foot of}} the mountain. Mount Sinai was all in smoke, the mountain trembled violently, the blare of the horn grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> God answered Moses in thunder.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{complaints}} from union members about the no-strike pledge became <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more bitter, the CIO did not abandon it. The Mine Workers, by contrast, {{who did not}} belong to either the AFL or the CIO for much of the war, threatened numerous strikes including a successful twelve-day strike in 1943. The strikes and threats made mine leader John L. Lewis a much hated man and led to legislation hostile to unions.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{there have}} been {{attempts}} to standardize and improve the Erhu, {{with the aim of}} producing a <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> better sounding instrument. One major change was the use of steel strings instead of silk. The move to steel strings was made gradually. By 1950 the thinner A-string had been replaced by a violin E-string with the thicker D-string remaining silk. By 1958 professional players were using purpose made D and A steel Erhu strings as standard.|$|E

25|$|A sound {{reinforcement}} {{system is}} the combination of microphones, signal processors, amplifiers, and loudspeakers in enclosures all controlled by a mixing console that makes live or pre-recorded sounds <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> may also distribute those sounds to a larger or more distant audience. In many situations, a sound reinforcement system {{is also used to}} enhance or alter the sound of the sources on the stage, typically by using electronic effects, such as reverb, as opposed to simply amplifying the sources unaltered.|$|E
25|$|Higher wind {{pressures}} {{increased the}} speaking volume of theatre organ pipes, {{and they were}} placed in chambers, usually high in the auditorium. The fronts of these chambers were covered {{with a set of}} swell shades which opened and closed like venetian blinds. When closed, the sound of the organ was reduced to a whisper. With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open the shutters to produce <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> louder sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E
25|$|Labor {{unrest in}} the {{industrial}} and mining sections of the Northeast and Midwest led to demands for a stronger military force within the states. After the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, calls for military suppression of labor strikes grew <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> National Guard units proliferated. In many states, large and elaborate armories, often built to resemble medieval castles, were constructed to house militia units. Businessmen and business associations donated monies {{for the construction of}} armories and to supplement funds of the local National Guard units. National Guard officers also came from the middle and upper classes.|$|E

25|$|While {{the hazards}} of x-rays are now well-controlled in most medical contexts, MRI still {{may be seen as}} {{superior}} to CT in this regard. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging of disease and follow-up without exposing the body to ionizing radiation. MRI often may yield different diagnostic information compared with CT. There may be risks and discomfort associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT, MRI scans typically take greater time, are <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> usually require that the subject go into a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
25|$|A sequel was {{considered}} in January 1997 {{after the first}} film proceeded to gross more than $50 million in its first month. Scream 2 (1998) was greenlit in January 1998 with a budget of $24 million, and was released before the first film's anniversary. The production of the film suffered a significant setback when the script was leaked revealing plot details including {{the identity of the}} killers, resulting in the script being modified to change many details. In an interview, Craven commented on the rushed schedule for the film, starting in July 1997 with a December release date, with many scenes in the script provided with only a loose outline forcing him to develop scenes on set. Various titles were considered for the sequel at different points in the film's production, including Scream Again, Scream <b>Louder</b> <b>and</b> Scream: The Sequel before the studio decided to simply use Scream 2.|$|E

25|$|The {{march is}} {{repeated}} twelve times, <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more accented each time, somewhat {{in the manner}} of Maurice Ravel's Boléro. Other instruments accompany with undertones that forebode increasing action and excitement. At the end of the twelfth repetition, the brass (particularly the trumpets) interject very loudly with a new, more frantic theme, announcing the arrival of the invaders. The passage has rising and falling scales, one after the other. This snare drum beats at an increased rate, and several exchanges between the brass occur, resembling danger sirens. This climaxes in a somewhat slower, but loud and chaotic passage driven by competing blaring brass and frantic strings. A slower, two-part section follows: a very prominent bassoon solo (introduced by a solo clarinet), then a soft, moving recapitulation of the first theme played by the strings. The short coda presents the invasion theme one last time, played by a solo trumpet and percussion.|$|E
25|$|Extended cadential trills were by far most {{frequent}} in Mozart's music, {{and although they}} were also found in early Romantic music, their use was restricted chiefly to piano concerti (and to a lesser extent, violin concerti) because they were most easily played and most effective on the piano and violin; the cadential trill and resolution would be generally followed by an orchestral coda. Beethoven was {{a good example of}} this, limiting it almost entirely to his concerti, and most other Romantic composers including Chopin and Schumann followed suit; Schubert, who never wrote concerti, hardly used it at all (the Adagio and Rondo Concertante D. 487, a chamber work, being one prominent exception). At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, even Mozart rarely used the trill in symphonies. Because the music generally became <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more dramatic leading up to it, a cadence was used for climactic effect, and was often embellished by Romantic composers. Later on in the Romantic era, however, other dramatic virtuosic movements were often used to close sections instead.|$|E
25|$|That night, Matamoros {{was flooded}} with 15,000 spring {{tourists}} from the U.S. on the city's main tourist street, Álvaro Obregón. The sidewalks, street, and night clubs were packed with foreign tourists looking to enjoy cheap alcohol and enjoy Mexico's lax drinking laws. When they got to Matamoros, Kilroy and his friends {{decided to go to}} the bar with the shortest waiting line. They ended up at Los Sombreros, a bar with rock music and bright neon. After a few drinks, Kilroy and his friends left Los Sombreros and wandered to London Pub, which rebranded itself as Hardrock Café for spring break. This bar was <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> wilder than Los Sombreros, and Kilroy and his friends stood at the bar while other tourists threw beer from the balcony. Kilroy met with a few girls at the bar and was not seen by his friends for a while. Around 2:00a.m. CT, Bill suggested the group head back to South Padre Island. As his friends stepped out of London Pub, they saw Kilroy leaning against a car and talking to a girl from Miss Tanline. Across Álvaro Obregón street, thousands of tourists were leaving the bars and heading to Brownsville, but others moved in different directions. The large crowd of people made it difficult for Kilroy and his friends to walk across the border uninterrupted and in a group.|$|E
