25|$|The longest-acting {{barbiturates}} have half-lives {{of a day}} or more, {{and subsequently}} result in bioaccumulation of the drug in the system. The therapeutic and recreational effects of <b>long-acting</b> <b>barbiturates</b> wear off significantly faster than the drug can be eliminated, allowing the drug to reach toxic concentrations in the blood following repeated administration (even when taken at the therapeutic/prescribed dose) despite the user feeling little or no effects from the plasma-bound concentrations of the drug. Users who consume alcohol or other sedatives after the drugs effects have worn but before it has cleared the system may experience a greatly exaggerated effect from the other sedatives which can be incapacitating or even fatal.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method for}} measuring pentobarbital in samples that also contain phenobarbital. The phenobar-bital is destroyed by adding sodium hydroxide and then heating at 95 #{ 176 }Cfor 60 mm. Pentobarbital is not affected by this pretreatment and can then be measured with an Abbott TDx barbiturates kit. Using this method, we ob-tained an average analytical recovery of 98 % of added pentobarbital and a correlation of y = O. 953 x + 3. 4 vs HPLC. The intra-assay CV was 3. 7 % at 25. 8 mg/L; the interassay CV was 6. 2 % at 16. 1 mg/L Other <b>long-acting</b> <b>barbiturates,</b> e. g., hexobarbital, are also effectively de-stroyed by this alkali pretreatment.

5000|$|Barbiturate {{dependence}} develops {{with regular}} use of barbiturates. This in turn {{may lead to}} a need for increasing doses of the drug to get the original desired pharmacological or therapeutic effect. Barbiturate use can lead to both addiction and physical dependence, and as such they have a high potential for abuse. Management of barbiturate dependence involves considering the affected person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of barbiturates. Psychological addiction to barbiturates can develop quickly. The GABAA receptor, one of barbiturates' main sites of action, is thought to play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} tolerance to and dependence on barbiturates, as well as the euphoric [...] "high" [...] that results from their abuse. The mechanism by which barbiturate tolerance develops is believed to be different from that of ethanol or benzodiazepines, even though these drugs have been shown to exhibit cross-tolerance with each other. The management of a physical dependence on barbiturates is stabilisation on the <b>long-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> phenobarbital followed by a gradual titration down of dose. The slowly eliminated phenobarbital lessens the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and reduces the chances of serious barbiturate withdrawal effects such as seizures. Antipsychotics are not recommended for barbiturate withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E

40|$|Moderate {{or severe}} {{depression}} {{is now one}} of the most common diseases of our time with a prevalence of nearly 3 %. It seems likely that this prevalence has increased as a result of the wider use of drugs which have an effect on the neurotransmitters. Changes in the levels of these neurotransmitters in the central nervous system are thought to he the biochemical basis for the development of at least some depressive illnesses. Drug-induced depressions are more likely to occur in those individuals who are genetically predisposed to depression or who have had a previous depressive illness. Other groups who are particularly susceptible to these effects are the elderly. Many groups of drugs have a primary or secondary action on the central nervous system neurotransmitter function. Some 200 drugs have been claimed to cause depression in certain patients, but only a relatively small number precipitate depressive symptoms with any frequency. Those most commonly implicated are the <b>long-acting</b> antipsychotics, <b>barbiturates,</b> ethanol, oral contraceptives and antihypertensive agents. It is important to remember that some drugs, such as reserpine, cause depression as a side-effect during their therapeutic use whereas others, such as fenfluramine, cause depression mainly when they are withdrawn too rapidly. In those patients presenting with depression, it is important to review the current drug therapy in order to assess the part played by these drugs in the development of the depression. Following this assessment, drug therapy should be adjusted appropriately. However, a distinction must be made between the symptoms of depression, those physiological changes which occur during treatment with a variety of drugs, and the patientâ€™s reaction to the disease for which they are being treated...|$|R
40|$|The {{complications}} {{encountered in}} caring for 185 patients intoxicated with barbiturates were reviewed. The population consisted of 142 patients with <b>long-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> concentrations of 8 mg per 100 ml or greater, 20 patients with short-acting barbiturate concentrations of 3 mg per 100 ml or greater and 23 consecutive patients with short-acting barbiturate intoxication referred for monitoring. Pneumonia was the major cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} and correlated best with the initial depth of coma and the use of an endotracheal tube in treatment. Cardiovascular instability manifested by pulmonary edema was the next leading cause of morbidity and mortality and correlated best with the initial depth of coma and the quantity of intravenous fluid administered. In retrospect, use of eliminative measures such as dialysis would probably not have altered the outcome in most of the patients who died and attempts at forced diuresis may have contributed to several deaths. Particular emphasis should be placed on the problems of sepsis and fluid therapy in the management of these patients...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{experiments}} {{in this report}} were designed to evaluate the effect of superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis on the course of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion by emboli while avoiding a vessel clipping technique {{as well as the}} use of <b>long-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> anesthesia. Dogs were divided into 3 general groups: A) embolus placement 1 b following anastomosis; B) embolus placement 5 h prior to anastomosis; C) control group without anastomosis. Anastomosis prior to MCA occlusion has a favorable clinical effect and reduces the size of an infarction. Anastomosis 5 h after embolus placement is deleterious unless other therapeutic modalities can be shown to delay the course of infarction. Stroke Vol 10, No 4, 1979 SINCE the superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery anastomosis (STA-MCA) was first described a decade ago, 21 - 22 the indications for the procedure have remained controversial. The effect of a superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery by-pass on the course of acute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery is of considerable importance in the prevention an...|$|E
40|$|Background: For {{treatment}} of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, high dose benzodiazepines (BZDs) may cause delirium and over-sedation. Phenobarbital (PBT) is a <b>long-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> effective for the {{treatment of}} alcohol withdrawal. Given the potential benefits of PBT, we sought to investigate the effectiveness of PBT as adjunctive treatment for alcohol withdrawal. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study on patients with a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal who had a CIWA-Ar score > 10 treated with either BZDs alone (BZD alone group) or BZDs with adjunctive PBT (PBT-adjunct group). The patients received at least one dose of PBT in addition to BZDs (variable doses) in the PBT-adjunct group, and three doses of 20 mg diazepam equivalents within 6 hours in the BZD alone group. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a CIWA-Ar score < 10 at 24 hours after initial treatment. Duration of withdrawal and cumulative dose of BZDs were also assessed. Results: Seven subjects in the adjunctive phenobarbital and 21 in the benzodiazepine group were included in the final analysis. Two patients (28. 6 %) in the PBT-adjunct group and 5 patients (23. 8 %) in the BZD only group achieved the primary endpoint, though {{the difference between the two}} groups was not statistically significant (P = 0. 588). The median (IQR) duration of withdrawal symptoms was 44 (12 - 62) hours in the PBT-adjunct group compared to 53 (37 - 87) hours in the BZD only group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = 0. 249). The median (IQR) cumulative BZD dose requirement (diazepam equivalent) in the PBT-adjunct group was significantly lower than BZD alone group (25 (20 - 226) vs. 326 (160 - 550) mg, P = 0. 02). Conclusion: PBT appears to be a safe and effective alternative to BZDs {{for the treatment}} of alcohol withdrawal in non-critically ill patients and may be BZD sparing...|$|E
40|$|Drugs {{are known}} to induce {{depressive}} states. Chloroquine, an antimalarial, in therapeutic doses administered for malaria therapy, may produce symptoms rather indistinguishable from endogenous depression. The possible mechanisms of production of depression related to chloroquine use are hypothesised. One {{of the most common}} diseases of our time is depression with a prevalence of nearly 3 per cent. It may be speculated that drugs having effect on the neurotransmitters may have increased the prevalence of depression. Drugs commonly implicated in inducing depression are <b>long-acting</b> antipsychotics, <b>barbiturates,</b> ethanol, oral contraceptives and antihypertensive agents (Whitlock & Evans, 1978). The present communication describes two cases of depression related to the administration of chloroquine as an antimalarial agent. Case reports: 1. A 40 years old female reported to the psychiatric clinic with complaints of sleeplessness, loss of interest in doing any work and feeling sad, all these started on the fourth day after ingestion of a total dose of 1. 5 gm of chloroquine for malaria. She was premorbidly sound with no previous history of mental illness or any family loading of mental illness. Mental status examination revealed features of moderate to severe depression with suicidal ideas and weeping spells. Insight was impaired. No evidence of any organic deficit was detected. She was started on antidepressant (amitryptyline) 100 mg per day, but she improved after 4 days. 2. 32 years old female after administration of 1. 8 gm of chloroquine for malaria five days prior to attendance in psychiatric clinic was found to have a depressive mood, psychomotor retardation, suicidal and paranoid ideas. Though she was put on tricyclic antidepressant, dramatic improvement was noted on the fifth day. She also did not have any previous or family history of mental illness.
