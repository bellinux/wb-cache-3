25|$|The <b>left</b> <b>button</b> usually {{controls}} primary fire. If {{the game}} supports multiple fire modes, the right button often provides secondary {{fire from the}} selected weapon. Games with only a single fire mode will generally map secondary fire to ironsights. In some games, the right button may also invoke accessories for a particular weapon, such as allowing access to the scope of a sniper rifle or allowing the mounting of a bayonet or silencer.|$|E
500|$|The regions active during {{engagement}} of cognitive flexibility {{depend on the}} task and various factors involved in flexibility {{that are used to}} assess the behavior, as flexible thinking requires aspects of inhibition, attention, working memory, response selection, and goal maintenance. Several studies using task switching paradigms have demonstrated the complexities of the network involved in cognitive flexibility. [...] Activation of the dorsolateral PFC has been shown during resolution of interference of irrelevant task sets. [...] Another study further extended these results by demonstrating that the level of abstractness of the switch type influenced recruitment of differing regions in the PFC depending on whether the participant was asked to make a cognitive set switch, a response switch, or a stimulus or perceptual switch. [...] A set switch would require switching between task rules, as with the WCST, and is considered to be the most abstract. [...] A response switch would require different response mapping, such as circle right button and square <b>left</b> <b>button</b> and vice versa. [...] Lastly, a stimulus or perceptual set switch would require a simple switch between a circle and a square. [...] Activation is mediated by the level of abstractness of the set switch in an anterior to posterior fashion within the PFC, with the most anterior activations elicited by set switches and the most posterior activations resulting from stimulus or perceptual switches. [...] The basal ganglia is active during response selection and the PPC, along with the inferior frontal junction are active during representation and updating of task sets called domain general switching.|$|E

2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements.

50|$|Mouse chording {{allows a}} user {{to use a}} two-button mouse, trackball, or {{touchpad}} as if it where a three-button device. For example, in the Unix graphical user interface (X11), the middle button is used to paste text. Since Microsoft-type mice traditionally only had two buttons, users of Unix-type systems such as Linux and BSD chord the right and <b>left</b> <b>buttons</b> to paste text.|$|R
50|$|The time or date is {{adjusted}} {{by pressing}} the lower <b>left</b> <b>button</b> {{three times to}} bring the watch to time adjustment mode. The top <b>left</b> <b>button</b> is used to cycle through seconds, hours, minutes, month, date, day, and normal mode. The right button is used to adjust the flashing value displayed. Unlike any other value, the seconds can only be zeroed. Should this happen before :30 seconds, the watch will zero in {{at the beginning of}} the current minute. After 30 seconds it will start the next minute as displayed. When the adjustments are finished, the bottom <b>left</b> <b>button</b> can be pressed once to return the watch to normal mode.|$|E
