5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by <b>low</b> <b>current,</b> contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
25|$|In general, high voltage, {{high current}} and low {{switching}} frequencies favor the IGBT while low voltage, <b>low</b> <b>current</b> and high switching frequencies are {{the domain of}} the MOSFET.|$|E

25|$|Nd:YAG absorbs {{mostly in}} the bands between 730–760nm and 790–820nm. At <b>low</b> <b>current</b> densities krypton flashlamps have higher output in those bands than do the more common xenon lamps, which produce more light at around 900nm. The former are {{therefore}} more efficient for pumping Nd:YAG lasers.|$|E
25|$|Quiescent {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit {{is the current}} drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very <b>low</b> <b>current</b> loads than switch-mode designs because of this).|$|E
40|$|As a {{superconductor}} {{goes from}} the normal state into the superconducting state, the voltage vs. <b>current</b> characteristics at <b>low</b> <b>currents</b> change from linear to non-linear. We show theoretically and experimentally that the addition of current noise to non-linear voltage vs. current curves will create ohmic behavior. Ohmic response at <b>low</b> <b>currents</b> for temperatures below the critical temperature T_c mimics the phase transition and leads to incorrect values for T_c and the critical exponents ν and z. The ohmic response occurs at <b>low</b> <b>currents,</b> when the applied current I_ 0 is smaller than {{the width of the}} probability distribution σ_I, and will occur in both the zero-field transition and the vortex-glass transition. Our results indicate that the transition temperature and critical exponents extracted from the conventional scaling analysis are inaccurate if current noise is not filtered out. This is a possible explanation for the wide range of critical exponents found in the literature. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

25|$|When {{solid-state}} dimmers {{came into}} use, analog {{remote control systems}} (such as 0-10 V lighting control systems) became feasible. The wire for the control systems was much smaller (with <b>low</b> <b>current</b> and lower danger) than the heavy power cables of previous lighting systems. Each dimmer had its own control wires, resulting in many wires leaving the lighting control location.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{plan called for}} an extension to Johanneskirchen station (where easy transfer to the S8 S-Bahn line would be possible) via Fideliopark, but was never built, due to <b>low</b> <b>current</b> ridership in the area north of Max-Weber-Platz. The extension of the tram line {{in the area in}} 2011 made the plan even more unlikely to materialise. A possible extension in the west to Blumenau is even more improbable.|$|E
25|$|A locomotive's {{control system}} is {{designed}} so that the main generator electrical power output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, {{as well as the}} way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to <b>low</b> <b>current</b> and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (see power curve graph for notch 8).|$|E

50|$|Other {{types of}} SMPSs use a capacitor-diode voltage {{multiplier}} instead of inductors and transformers. These are mostly used for generating high voltages at <b>low</b> <b>currents</b> (Cockcroft-Walton generator). The low voltage variant is called charge pump.|$|R
50|$|A Widlar {{current source}} is a {{modification}} of the basic two-transistor current mirror that incorporates an emitter degeneration resistor for only the output transistor, enabling the current source to generate <b>low</b> <b>currents</b> using only moderate resistor values.|$|R
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a <b>low</b> <b>current</b> {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|Primary batteries, or primary cells, {{can produce}} current {{immediately}} on assembly. These are {{most commonly used}} in portable devices that have <b>low</b> <b>current</b> drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E
25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively <b>low</b> <b>current</b> output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage.|$|E

40|$|Insulated gate bipolar {{transistors}} (IGBTs) {{are used in}} high-power voltage-source converters rated up to hundreds of kilowatts or even a few megawatts. Knowledge of device switching characteristics is required for reliable design and operation of the converters. Switching characteristics are studied widely at high current levels, and corresponding data are available in datasheets. But the devices in a converter also switch <b>low</b> <b>currents</b> close to the zero crossings of the line currents. Further, the switching behaviour under these conditions could significantly influence the output waveform quality including zero crossover distortion. Hence, the switching characteristics of high-current IGBTs (300 -A and 75 -A IGBT modules) at <b>low</b> load <b>current</b> magnitudes are investigated experimentally in this paper. The collector current, gate-emitter voltage and collector-emitter voltage are measured at various <b>low</b> values of <b>current</b> (less than 10 % of the device rated current). A specially designed in-house constructed coaxial current transformer (CCT) is used for device current measurement without increasing the loop inductance in the power circuit. Experimental {{results show that the}} device voltage rise time increases significantly during turn-off transitions at <b>low</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R
30|$|Since, {{bandwidth}} of {{the lowest}} class (i.e., DF) is not consumed by higher classes (i.e., EF, AF); thus, it is not taken into consideration while calculating the CD of a link. Traffic is passed on the link having <b>lowest</b> <b>current</b> CD.|$|R
25|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{draw power}} from a stationary source via an overhead wire or third rail. Some also or instead use a battery. In locomotives that are powered by high voltage alternating current, a transformer in the locomotive converts the high voltage, <b>low</b> <b>current</b> power to low voltage, high current {{used in the}} traction motors that power the wheels. Modern locomotives may use three-phase AC induction motors or direct current motors. Under certain conditions, electric locomotives are the most powerful traction. They are also the cheapest to run and provide less noise and no local air pollution. However, they require high capital investments both for the overhead lines and the supporting infrastructure, {{as well as the}} generating station that is needed to produce electricity. Accordingly, electric traction is used on urban systems, lines with high traffic and for high-speed rail.|$|E

500|$|It {{was already}} {{clear from the}} work of Michael Faraday that {{electricity}} and galvanism were essentially the same. [...] Bird realised this, but continued to divide his apparatus into electrical machines, which (according to him) delivered a high voltage at <b>low</b> <b>current,</b> and galvanic apparatus, which delivered a high current at low voltage. [...] The galvanic equipment available to Bird included electrochemical cells such as the voltaic pile and the Daniell cell, a variant of which Bird devised himself. [...] Also part of the standard equipment were induction coils which, together with an interrupter circuit, were used with one of the electrochemical cells to deliver an electric shock. [...] The electrical (as opposed to galvanic) machines then available were friction-operated electrostatic generators consisting of a rotating glass disc or cylinder on which silk flaps were allowed to drag as the glass rotated. [...] These machines had to be hand-turned during treatment, but it was possible to store small amounts of static electricity in Leyden jars for later use.Payne and McConnellSimpson, pp. 7–8Morus, pp. 179 ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In this work, an {{accurate}} analysis of <b>low</b> frequency <b>current</b> ripple in residential fuel cell power generation systems is performed {{based on the}} proposed residential load model and its unique operation algorithm. Rather than using a constant dc voltage source, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) model is implemented in this research so that a system-level analysis considering the fuel cell stack, power conditioning system (PCS), and the actual load is possible. Using the attained re-sults, a comparative study regarding the discrepancies of <b>low</b> frequency <b>current</b> ripple between a sim-ple resistor load and a realistic residential load is performed. The data indicate that the <b>low</b> frequency <b>current</b> ripple of the proposed residential load model is {{increased by more than}} a factor of two when compared to the <b>low</b> frequency <b>current</b> ripple of a simple resistor load under identical conditions. Theoretical analysis, simulation data, and experimental results are provided, along with a model of the load usage pattern of <b>low</b> frequency <b>current</b> ripples...|$|R

2500|$|In {{cases where}} ripple voltage is insignificant, like battery chargers, the input filter {{may be a}} single series {{resistor}} to adjust the output voltage to that required by the circuit.
