5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to <b>let</b> <b>my</b> remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not <b>let</b> <b>my</b> dog stay in this hotel vs I would not <b>let</b> <b>my</b> dog stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E
25|$|I am here {{ready to}} die. I am {{not allowed to}} vindicate my character; no man shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am {{prevented}} from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. <b>Let</b> <b>my</b> character and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall my character be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written.|$|E

25|$|They {{are trying}} to persuade me to <b>let</b> <b>my</b> boy be inoculated with smallpox. But as I have {{expressed}} sufficiently clearly my aversion to this impertinence they are leaving me in peace. Here inoculation is the general fashion. But for my part I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or {{to take it to}} Himself.|$|E
25|$|Let no man {{write my}} epitaph; for as no {{man who knows}} my motives dare now vindicate them, let not {{prejudice}} or ignorance, asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country takes her place among {{the nations of the}} earth, then and not till then, <b>let</b> <b>my</b> epitaph be written. I have done.|$|E

500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, <b>let</b> <b>my</b> right hand wither; <b>Let</b> <b>my</b> tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} half-verse, {{following}} a brief instrumental passage, Harrison personalises the second line of Crisp's text to [...] "You know my faults, now <b>let</b> <b>my</b> foibles pass". Rodriguez remarks {{that the subject}} of reserving judgement would have resonated with Harrison at this time, given the [...] "shellacking" [...] he had recently received in music publications such as Rolling Stone.

While her sister was on trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and David lived.

Maureen feared for her children: [...] "I couldn't <b>let</b> <b>my</b> children out of my sight when they were little.

500|$|The {{following}} bass aria, [...] "" [...] (<b>Let</b> <b>my</b> heart be the coin), has {{an unusual}} and unique accompaniment of two obbligato cellos with continuo. The cellos present an imitative motif {{to introduce the}} bass. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, comments that Bach [...] "conjures up an irresistible picture of two coin-polishers at work, a sort of eighteenth-century sorcerer goading his apprentice", observing that [...] "two cellos polish away in contrary motion with wide intervalic leaps". [...] Bach was interested in coins and precious metals. The conductor Craig Smith compares the dark texture to the [...] "descent into the earth in Wagner's Das Rheingold". The aria is in three thematic sections: [...] "enjoining", [...] "melodramatically rhetoric", and [...] "imprecatory".|$|E

Hood engaged Prinz Eugen, which the British thought to be Bismarck, while Prince of Wales fired on Bismarck. Adalbert Schneider, the first gunnery officer aboard Bismarck, twice requested permission to return fire, but Lütjens hesitated. Lindemann intervened, muttering [...] "I will not <b>let</b> <b>my</b> ship be shot out from under my ass."

500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time.

So if I <b>let</b> <b>my</b> ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E

[...] In January 1698, Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship. He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, {{in order to be able}} to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with [...] "much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed". Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it [...] "entirely ruined". Benbow lost [...] "twenty fine paintings" [...] and [...] "several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea" [...] from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £350 9s. 6d. in compensation.|$|E
