6000|$|After {{a little}} pause <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> in a subdued voice, 'Claude, I {{hope you do}} not believe that I was {{thinking}} of what really happened when I said that.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> no word further. She {{knew that}} the man was expressing the wishes of all around her. She said no word further, and then Bell {{returned}} to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "How nice {{he looks}} in them," [...] <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> to her sister afterwards, knowing nothing of the {{thoughts}} which had troubled her lover's mind while he was adorning his legs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very {{free from}} {{affectation}} and nonsense,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> 'as William <b>said</b> of him last Christmas. You {{were in a}} fine fright about his speech, Claude.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Tulisa: Amelia <b>Lily</b> - <b>said</b> that Colton sang {{better in}} the sing off ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Lily</b> had <b>said</b> all she could. Her heart ached with unspeakable {{pity and}} {{a sort of}} terror.|$|R
6000|$|Over Snap's {{place was}} the name [...] "Newmarch;" [...] and <b>Lily</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Why, that's where mamma gets her hard gingerbread, and Weber's is where we go for ice-cream. Do you make cake for them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then Aunt <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> {{all manner}} of cross things about giving notes between us. I was so glad I could say I didn't, for you know I didn't give it to you, and it wasn't between us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know Mrs. Burns," [...] <b>Lily</b> <b>said,</b> after a pause; [...] "she sends several {{children}} to my school. Poor, pathetic little things, half-clad and wistful-eyed. They make my heart ache; {{they are so}} hungry for love, and so quick to learn." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{paused and}} gazed at her earnestly, but she hung {{her head like a}} <b>lily,</b> and <b>said</b> never a word.|$|R
6000|$|... 'All for {{the sake}} of punctuality, nothing else,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily.</b> 'I rather like to {{disappoint}} fidgety people--don't you, Emily?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You will {{certainly}} bewilder yourself into something dreadful with that horrid science,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily.</b> 'What {{is the matter}} with Phyl?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{church bell}} began to ring, and they quickened their steps in silence. Presently <b>Lily</b> <b>said,</b> 'Tell me of {{something}} to do, Robert, something {{that may be a}} pledge that my sorrow is not a passing shower, something unnecessary, but disagreeable, which may keep me in remembrance that my Lent was not one of self-denial.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Phyllis, 'only I had {{not done}} it by one o'clock to-day, and <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> I must finish after {{learning}} my lessons for to-morrow, but I do not think I shall ever have done, it is so hard. Oh!' (another stretch and a yawn, verging on a howl), 'and Jane and Ada are sowing the flower-seeds. Oh dear! Oh dear!' and Phyllis's face contracted, in readiness to cry.|$|E
60|$|<b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> {{nothing at}} the moment, either about the long-legged {{creature}} or the walk. That which must be, must be. She knew well why John Eames had come there. She {{knew that the}} visits {{to his mother and}} to Lady Julia would never have been made, but that he might have this interview. And he had a right to demand, at any rate, as much as that. That which must be, must be. And therefore when both Mrs. Dale and Grace stoutly maintained their purpose of going up to the squire, Lily neither attempted to persuade John to accompany them, nor said that she would do so herself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Robert looks anxious,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> as she parted {{with him}} after the evening service; 'I am afraid {{something}} is going wrong.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rotherwood is only eager about {{shooting}} {{in common with}} everything else,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> 'but Redgie, I fear, will care for nothing else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am sure I {{should not}} mind {{travelling}} twice {{over the world}} to see Cologne Cathedral, or the field of Waterloo,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily.</b>|$|R
6000|$|To Mrs. Thorne <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> {{hardly a}} word about John Eames, and when her cousin Bernard {{questioned}} her about him she was dumb. And in these days she could assume a manner, and express herself with her eyes {{as well as with}} her voice, after a fashion, which was apt to silence unwelcome questioners, even though they were as intimate with her as was her cousin Bernard. She had described her feelings more plainly to her lover than she had ever done to any one,--even to her mother; and having done so she meant to be silent on that subject for evermore. But of her settled purpose she did say some word to Emily Dunstable that night. [...] "I do feel," [...] she said, [...] "that I have got the thing settled at last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll play sides, of course," [...] said Lily. [...] "Bernard and I'll play together." [...] But {{this was}} not allowed. Lily was well known to be {{the queen of the}} croquet ground; and as Bernard was {{supposed}} to be more efficient than his friend, Lily had to take Mr Crosbie as her partner. [...] "Apollo can't get through the hoops," [...] <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> afterwards to her sister; [...] "but then how gracefully he fails to do it!" [...] Lily, however, had been beaten, and may therefore be excused for a little spite against her partner. But it so turned out that before Mr Crosbie took his final departure from Allington he could get through the hoops; and Lily, though she was still queen of the croquet ground, had to acknowledge a male sovereign in that dominion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hopkins {{would not}} allow it," [...] said Lily. [...] "He calls that a mixing of things. Hopkins doesn't like mixings." [...] And then when the game was over, they sauntered about, out of the small garden into the larger one, and through the shrubberies, and out upon the fields, where they found the still {{lingering}} remnants of the haymaking. And Lily took a rake, and raked for two minutes; and Mr Crosbie, making an attempt to pitch the hay into the cart, had to pay half-a-crown for his footing to the hay-makers; and Bell sat quiet under a tree, mindful of her complexion; whereupon Mr Crosbie, finding the hay-pitching not much to his taste, threw himself under the same tree also, quite after the manner of Apollo, as <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> to her mother late in the evening. Then Bernard covered Lily with hay, which was a great feat in the jocose way for him; and Lily in returning the compliment, almost smothered Mr Crosbie,--by accident.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think he}} would have a better career in London?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> {{speaking}} under the influence of her superior presence of mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{has that}} to do with it?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> sharply. [...] "If she were married to an archduke, what {{difference}} would that make?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell her I {{will come}} presently,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> who had one hand pressed on Jane's burning temples, {{while the other}} was {{sprinkling}} her with ether.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will stand}} in nobody's way. Mr. Eames {{has a right}} to give his hand to any one that he pleases. I, at any rate, can have no cause of offence against him. The only thing is that I do wish that my name could be left alone." [...] Lily, when she was in her own room again, did destroy the letter; but before she did so she read it again, and it became so indelibly {{impressed}} on her memory that she could not forget even the words of it. The lady who wrote had pledged herself, under certain conditions, [...] "not to interfere with Miss L. D." [...] "Interfere with me!" [...] <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> to herself; [...] "nobody can interfere with me; nobody has power to do so." [...] As she turned it over in her mind, her heart became hard against John Eames. No woman would have troubled herself to write such a letter without some cause for the writing. That the writer was vulgar, false, and unfeminine, Lily thought that she could perceive from the letter itself; but no doubt the woman knew John Eames, had some interest in the question of his marriage, and was entitled to some answer to her question;--only was not entitled to such answer from Lily Dale.|$|E
60|$|On {{this sad}} day of which I write I knew that Lily, whom I loved, would be walking alone beneath the great pollard oaks {{in the park}} of Ditchingham Hall. Here, in Grubswell as the spot is called, grew, and indeed still grow, certain {{hawthorn}} trees that are the earliest to blow of any in these parts, and when we had met at the church door on the Sunday, <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> {{that there would be}} bloom upon them by the Wednesday, and on that afternoon she should go to cut it. It may well be that she spoke thus with design, for love will breed cunning {{in the heart of the}} most guileless and truthful maid. Moreover, I noticed that though she said it before her father and the rest of us, yet she waited to speak till my brother Geoffrey was out of hearing, for she did not wish to go maying with him, and also that as she spoke she shot a glance of her grey eyes at me. Then and there I vowed to myself that I also would be gathering hawthorn bloom in this same place and on that Wednesday afternoon, yes, even if I must play truant and leave all the sick of Bungay to Nature's nursing. Moreover, I was determined on one thing, that if I could find Lily alone I would delay no longer, but tell her all that was in my heart; no great secret indeed, for though no word of love had ever passed between us as yet, each knew the other's hidden thoughts. Not that I was in the way to become affianced to a maid, who had my path to cut in the world, but I feared that if I delayed to make sure of her affection my brother would be before me with her father, and Lily might yield to that to which she would not yield if once we had plighted troth.|$|E
6000|$|On one of {{the first}} days of the new year Jane brought in the letters as usual, and handed them to Mrs. Dale. Lily was at the time {{occupied}} with the teapot, but still she saw the letters, and had not her hands so full as to be debarred from the expression of her usual anxiety. [...] "Mamma, I'm sure I see two there for me," [...] she said. [...] "Only one for you, Lily," [...] said Mrs. Dale. Lily instantly knew from the t{{one of the}} voice that some letter had come, which by the very aspect of the handwriting had disturbed her mother. [...] "There is one for you, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Dale, throwing a letter across the table to Grace. [...] "And one for you, Lily, from Bell. The others are for me." [...] "And whom are yours from, mamma?" [...] asked Lily. [...] "One is from Mrs. Jones; the other, I think, is a letter on business." [...] Then <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> nothing further, but she observed that her mother only opened one of her letters at the breakfast-table. Lily was very patient;--not by nature, I think, but by exercise and practice. She had, once in her life, been too much in a hurry; and having then burned herself grievously, she now feared the fire. She did not therefore follow her mother after breakfast, but sat with Grace over the fire, hemming diligently at certain articles of clothing which were intended for use in the Hogglestock parsonage. The two girls were making a set of new shirts for Mr. Crawley. [...] "But I know he will ask where they come from," [...] said Grace; [...] "and then mamma will be scolded." [...] "But I hope he'll wear them," [...] said Lily. [...] "Sooner or later he will," [...] said Grace; [...] "because mamma manages generally to have her way at last." [...] Then they went on for an hour or so, talking about the home affairs at Hogglestock. But during the whole time Lily's mind was intent upon her mother's letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have some}} one," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> {{thinking}} of her mother, but not caring to descend again to the mawkish weakness of talking about her.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{cousin of}} yours," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> [...] "is simply the dearest, warmest-hearted, finest {{creature}} that ever {{was seen in}} the shape of a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think Jane has {{his share}} of curiosity,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> 'I am sure I {{had no idea that}} {{anything}} belonging to us could be so stupid.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "You!" [...] <b>Lily</b> <b>said,</b> {{in a tone}} to cut my throat. I was out of {{my chair}} in half a second flat ...|$|E
50|$|Tom Hartigan - {{boyfriend of}} Lily Marbury, whose mother rents {{a room to}} Cust. He saw Cust in Euston station with a ticket to Doncaster, and got {{suspicious}} when <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> Cust reported {{he was going to}} Cheltenham, reached from Paddington station.|$|E
50|$|Marshall had {{no health}} {{insurance}} during that time because of his unemployment. He was seeing death everywhere and refused to go alone anywhere without Lily because {{he thought he would}} be attacked by a bear. Lily had complained that he was not giving her enough alone time and that all she wanted to do is sit in the bath and read a book. That night, Marshall ran Lily a bath and told her to have a little alone time. <b>Lily</b> <b>said</b> she wanted Marshall to stay and they ended up conceiving their baby boy in Barney's bathroom.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{the most}} {{delightful}} plan ever thought of,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily,</b> 'so easily done, and just bringing within his compass all he ever wished to see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'William, I believe,' <b>said</b> <b>Lily.</b> 'Claude goes earlier, so {{he rides}} the gray. Then {{there is the}} chariot for you and Frank, and papa and Phyllis.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{we shall}} have to walk out with Mary Eames, instead of Susan Boyce," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lily.</b> [...] "It won't make so much {{difference}} after all." ...|$|R
