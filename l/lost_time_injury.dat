40|$|The mining {{industry}} in South Africa faces real challenges {{with regard to}} the reduction of safety-related incidents. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the need for alternative interventions in addition to other safety improvement strategies already employed on mines. It furthermore supports an existing paradigm: incident investigations. An investigation into fatalities in the South African {{mining industry}} shows that although great progress has been achieved through the reduction in fatalities in all sectors of the industry over the last few years, more can and should be done to achieve status of ‘zero harm’. Fatalities and <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> <b>injuries</b> on mines result not only in large financial losses, but also in disruptions of mining operations in general through Section 54 stoppages to resolve the situation. The approach of the paper is therefore not to try and prove whether there is high fatality rate and/or <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> <b>injuries,</b> but in what way incident reconstruction simulations (IRS) can have an impact in the future prevention of such incidents. The challenge therefore lies in the utilization of pro-active systems that would show employees the possible outcomes of being exposed to certain hazards. In real life, these incidents cannot be re-enacted and in most cases we can only learn through the previous mistakes of others. A virtual reality (VR) education and training system will enable employees to be ‘exposed’ to different hazards in a safe environment, and simulation, in a ‘forgiving’ environment, of the possible consequences of unsafe acts. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), unsafe acts and unsafe conditions are indirect causes of safety-related incidents, but there are also direct causes; for example, unplanned release of energy and/or hazardous material, and basic causes, for example, management safety policies, personal factors, and environmental factors. The administrative workload associated with any incident investigation places a large burden on the investigation team, and in most cases other employees are informed through vague administrative processes what the ’real cause’ for the incident/accident was. New preventative strategies are often put in place without showing the employees what the real causes of the incident/accident was. This can be mitigated through the use of interactive VR simulations/animations of the hazards that they are exposed to and how to deal with them. If VR interventions are not used as proposed by this paper, the real causes and consequences of almost all fatalities and <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> <b>injuries</b> may never be fully understood. This paper also emphasizes what potential impact IRS could have on the prevention of future mine incidents as part and parcel of a pro-active risk prevention strategy. The intention is therefore not to replace any other risk prevention strategies, but to visually enhance the reality of the incident. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The current {{application}} of Positive Performance Indicators (PPIs) {{in the construction}} industry largely measures numbers of disparate safety activities. Generally, PPIs are seen by industry stakeholders as not providing generalizable indicators of safety effectiveness. Further, they do not provide consistent data useable by industry to target areas of focus and improvement in safety performance. Notwithstanding efforts by NOHSC since 1994 to encourage the uptake of PPIs, industry at large has rejected these attempts. Yet, currently PPIs are the only ‘lead ’ indicators measuring success as opposed to ‘lag ’ indicators which, increasingly, since the mid 90 s have been criticized as largely measuring failure eg, the raw number of injuries sustained in an organization per year or their frequency obtained by dividing the number of injuries by (a notional) one million hours worked per annum (<b>Lost</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Injury</b> Frequency Rates) (LTIFRs). Another issue that militates against the uptake of PPIs is that for legislative purposes, such as recording and reporting injuries, only LTIs and the like are required under the nine Australian OHS jurisdictions.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{measure of}} <b>Lost</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Injury</b> Frequency Rate (LTIFR) {{as a measure}} of improvement in safety performance is recognised as inadequate and misleading, lulling managers into believing that safety is improving. It is a reactive measure, and steadily declining LTIFRs around the world have failed to be accompanied by a similar reduction in the fatality rate. This paper confronts the industry with the attitudes of some mining managers, such as one that allowed fatalities to occur {{in the case of a}} gold mining company at a rate of one death per 150 000 ounces of gold produced while claiming their safety record has improved, as shown by a falling LTIFR, and viewing fatality reductions as a long-term goal instead of an immediate priority. A quantum shift in management attitudes is required to focus on proactive measurements to detect the indicators of an impending disaster, and to predict conditions conducive to fatalities. Corporate CEOs are challenged to attend the funerals of all workers killed in the workplace. CEOs who fail to attend such funerals send a message to employees that the CEO’s priorities lie elsewhere, and that profits take priority over workers ’ lives. The dichotomy of whether mining companies are run for the benefit of shareholders or whether companies owe social responsibility to the community is examined. The role of individual responsibility for personal safety is examined, together with the psychology of employees in the mining industry...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} examine a {{hierarchical}} measurement model for {{occupational health and safety}} (OHS) performance developed for use in the Australian construction industry and tested over the life of one case study construction project. The model was intended to provide a more sensitive and informative measure of project OHS performance than traditional injury frequency rates. Design/methodology/approach - Two measurement tools were tested. The tools, a monthly weighted safety index and a quarterly safety climate survey, were used to measure OHS performance and performance data are presented. Findings - The data suggest convergent validity, indicated by consistent results between the two measures. Results also indicated that a combination of measurement techniques provides more comprehensive data pertaining to project OHS performance and enables the diagnosis of OHS issues that would be undetected with reliance exclusively on traditional measures, such as <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> <b>injury</b> frequency rates. Research limitations/implications - The implications for future research lie in the demonstrated need to carefully evaluate the validity of the safety index and safety climate survey in future construction projects, and in the broader construction context. The results were limited to an evaluation of the measurement model in a single case study construction project and future testing is needed to determine the generalisability of the model. Practical implications - The implications for practice are that multiple measures of OHS performance, including leading indicators and surveys of workers&# 039; attitudes and perceptions of project OHS, provide a more useful basis for the development of targeted OHS improvement strategies...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{concerns}} {{the occupational safety}} environment at Outokompu Stainless, Avesta Work. The study is of a sociotechnical approach where humans are involved and interconnected in the same system with technology and organisation. In order to reach the corporation’s goal of zero accidents with <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> <b>injury,</b> the work of improving and maintain {{occupational safety and health}} has to regard behaviour and cultural aspects. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the safety culture at a specific production unit and research what work which has to be done in order to change and improve the safety culture at Avesta Work. There are several opportunities for improvement pointed out in this paper and here are some main results presented. First and foremost, the concern of safety among blue-collar is often secondary due to production. The explanation to this is for instance that safety equipment, routines and deviation reporting are regarded as diffuse or circumstantial when there at the same time exists vocational pride in being efficient and foolhardy. The city of Avesta was founded, and has developed, alongside Avesta Work for centuries, and their status, role models and traditions are strongly influenced by that relationship. In order to change the safety culture, the company has to decide what culture they want, what laboured people at Avesta Work should be associated with and finally, how to deal with people who does not fit in with that safety behavioural and cultural model. Furthermore, to change a safety culture, knowledge and awareness about these issues are needed from both blue-collar as well as from white-collar employees. In conclusion, a way to constantly improve the safety culture over time is to adapt a recruiting strategy where dissidence and different experiences is promoted to continuously improve and broaden the risk perception of the company...|$|E
