50|$|Ireland {{first began}} to operate a Torrens Title system in 1892. So-called {{registered}} land (i.e. land held under a Torrens title) is recorded in the Republic of Ireland using a system of numbered county-level folios. The land registry is operated by the Property Registration Authority, a government agency, and records both freehold and <b>leasehold</b> <b>titles,</b> along with easements/profits-a-prendre, mortgages, and any other charges over land. It is compulsory to create a folio in the land registry if land is sold/transferred/subdivided, multi-storey buildings are erected, or a new lease (over five years) is created. The vast majority of land in Ireland (by acreage) is held under Torrens title as compulsory registration in the land registry upon sale has been a requirement in rural areas for many years. Compulsory registration was extended to the (more urban) counties of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford in the last decade, thus extending mandatory Torrens title to {{every part of the}} Republic of Ireland.|$|R

5000|$|Although Johnston {{accepted}} {{that the land}} belonged to its African communities, so their chiefs {{had no right to}} alienate it to anyone, he put forward the legal fiction that each chief's people had tacitly accepted he could assume such a right. Under this interpretation chiefs could cede land to the Crown or sell or grant land not currently being used by the community to Europeans. Johnston also claimed that the Crown had two rights as the Protecting Power. Firstly, that any [...] "waste" [...] land (if not currently in use or occupied) was Crown Land and freehold or <b>leasehold</b> <b>titles</b> over it could be granted to Europeans. Secondly, that the Crown was entitled to investigate whether any earlier sales or transfers were valid and, if they were, to issue a Certificate of Claim (in effect a registration of freehold title) in the land to the new owners. The land comprised in the Certificates of Claim amounted to some 1.4 million Hectares, including a claim in North Nyasa district of just over 1 million Hectares; the rest was mainly in the Shire Highlands. Johnston had no legal training and the protectorate had no law officers until 1896. However, when the legality of the Certificates of Claim system was challenged in 1903 on the basis that the agreements made by the chiefs breached the rights of their community members, the Appeals Court upheld the validity of the certificates, ruling that that title arose from a grant by the Crown's representative, not from any agreements made by the chiefs. The court did however judge that many aspects of the agreements were unfair and one-sided.|$|R

In April 1948 the Land Commissioner reported against the idea of any improvement of the land, believing that there was every chance of further breakthroughs from the ocean to the Broadwater during cyclonic weather. There was however, already some private activity occurring on crown land in the area, with John Humphreys operating several ex-wartime landing barges from moorings in the Basin. The wartime and post-war boom in mineral sands production meant a ready demand for barges carrying dredged sand from South Stradbroke Island to the rutile works in Southport, and Humphreys {{was one of the}} first to capitalise on the need for appropriate transport craft.|$|E

40|$|Many {{people in}} South Sudan and {{northern}} Uganda—like {{others around the}} world—see boundaries and borders as a potential source of clarity, security and conflict prevention. Political and economic ambitions, along with fears of discrimination or exclusion from land lead to the promotion of more rigid boundaries, both {{on the ground and}} between groups of people. The prevalence of such discourse reflects a picture first imagined by colonial officials, in which the peoples of this region live in discrete ethnic territories, organized into patrilineal descent groups and governed by their own decentralized administrations. In such a picture, it might indeed seem that demarcating clear boundaries and borders between various territories would resolve the tensions and conflicts that surround them. A different picture emerges, however, from a detailed exploration of the intricate histories and present realities of demography, ecology, liveli­hoods, social relations and land governance in South Sudan and northern Uganda. Historically, there {{is said to have been}} popular unease here with the moral and spiritual implications of trying to demarcate fixed boundaries in the soil. Moreover, transhumant pastoralism depends on negotiating access to land controlled by others, rendering the delimita­tion of clear and fixed borders impractical. Drawing boundaries between clans and tribal sections is also impossible because settlements are widely interspersed with other clans and sections. Although clans and sections are defined in a language of patrilineal kinship, they have always absorbed outsiders into their lineages and co-residential communities. Oral histories reveal the extent of migration and shifting identities. Practices of assimilation and intermarriage have worked to overcome boundaries rather than to create them. After all, being able to cross borders during recurrent wars and violent conflicts has been vital for survival. There is, however, a paradox. Greater peace in some parts of this region seems to have brought new conflict over land and boundariesThere is, however, a paradox. Greater peace in some parts of this region seems to have brought new conflict over land and boundaries in the past decade. Multiple factors are at work here, including urban­ization and uneven population densities driven by processes of return and patterns of service delivery and economic activity. Many people in South Sudan and northern Uganda are well aware of the wider context in Sudan and eastern Africa, where conflict over land and land grabbing are prevalent concerns. In their own countries, anticipated development and commercial exploitation drive perceptions of the changing value of land. The processes of government decentralization, begun in the 1990 s, also play a key role in growing conflict over land. Local govern­ment officials and politicians may have an interest in promoting the idea of ethnic territorial units to garner popular support and increase their control of land and natural resources. Local land governance institu­tions—whether state-related, customary or the more common hybrid arrangements—derive revenue and power from both land transactions and disputes over land. It would be mistaken, however, to see increasing land disputes as simply the result of top-down control and manipulation. In an atmosphere of growing uncertainty and insecurity over land rights, there is also bottom-up demand for greater security and dispute resolution. Many people in South Sudan and northern Uganda are seeking to secure their own land rights through various mechanisms, whether through written documen­tation, the purchase of <b>leasehold</b> <b>titles</b> or by asserting customary rights to land through historical narratives and genealogical claims. Unsurpris­ingly, their efforts can easily become attempts at exclusion on the same basis, creating yet more disputes and conflicts over land and boundaries. Attempts to privatize land rights or assert more exclusionary defini­tions of customary land rights have been aided by national land reforms, which promote legal clarity and simultaneously impose simplified defini­tions of customary rights. External interventions in land governance have tended to support legal and policy processes, failing to adequately consider the implementation of statutory approaches on the ground. At the local level, it is evident that national laws and policies are being interpreted with varying degrees of accuracy, as well as being selectively adopted and adapted in combination with customary principles. These processes both rely on the cooperation of customary authorities and local governments and create competitions between them. This demonstrates a hybrid approach to land governance that is not amenable to being reduced to a legal or statutory form...|$|R
40|$|Medium-scale farms {{have become}} {{a major force in}} Malawi’s {{agricultural}} sector. Malawi’s most recent official agricultural survey indicates that these account for over a quarter of all land under cultivation in Malawi. This study explores the causes and multifaceted consequences of the rising importance of medium-scale farms in Malawi. We identify the characteristics and pathways of entry into farming based on surveys of 300 medium-scale farmers undertaken in 2014 in the districts of Mchinji, Kasungu and Lilongwe. The area of land acquired by medium-scale farmers in these three districts is found to have almost doubled between 2000 and 2015. Just over half of the medium-scale farmers represent cases of successful expansion out of small-scale farming status; the other significant proportion of medium-scale farmers are found to be urban-based professionals, entrepreneurs and/or civil servants who acquired land, some very recently, and started farming in mid-life. We also find that {{a significant portion of the}} land acquired by medium-scale farmers was utilized by others prior to acquisition, that most of the acquired land was under customary tenure, and that the current owners were often successful in transferring the ownership structure of the acquired land to a long-term <b>leaseholding</b> with a <b>title</b> deed. The study finds that, instead of just strong endogenous growth of small-scale famers as a route for the emergence of medium-scale farms, significant farm consolidation is occurring through land acquisitions, often by urban-based people. The effects of farmland acquisitions by domestic investors on the country’s primary development goals, such as food security, poverty reduction and employment, are not yet clear, though some trends appear to be emerging. We consider future research questions that may more fully shed light on the implications of policies that would continue to promote land acquisitions by medium-scale farms...|$|R

Two new office buildings were constructed on the site in the 1980s. Designed by Sheppard Robson, they were subsequently known as Murray House and Dexter House. This brought the site's total office space to 460,000 square feet.

40|$|The Wik {{people of}} north eastern Australia have {{successfully}} argued for {{recognition of their}} customary ownership claims over land under state <b>leasehold</b> <b>title.</b> Their success initiated a reaction from the tenants that was grounded more on the fear of losing extra-legal benefits customarily attached to state <b>leasehold</b> <b>title</b> than concern over the rights of indigenous people. To untangle Western extra-legal customs regarding property rights {{and the question of}} indigenous rights, a strategy for amortizing the Western extra-legal interests is suggested. Amortizing the Western extra-legal interest is {{in the interests of the}} Western community regardless of indigenous customary ownership claims. The methodology adopted is grounded on deductions from the implications of the notion of ownership and a respect for natural justice. Valuation of the interests to the tenants, indigenous owners, and the Western community is considered conceptually along with some practical issues in resolution. Each of these may be inferred from their natures. If the occupier is subject to market rentals, then the market will price the tenant’s contribution, regardless of the land ownership. It is suggested that the net indigenous customary interest can be related to the traditional value of the land as a source of material support. This would account for only part of the current market rental. The remainder can be explained as largely flowing from the contribution of the Western community and infrastructure. To recoup this for the community that created it, a special land tax over indigenous customary titled land is suggested. This would leave indigenous customary owners with the difference between rental income and land tax. Such an arrangement could eliminate indigenous people from welfare dependency and return to them a degree of self-determination. Control of land use is an important aspect of ownership and one sorely missed by indigenous customary owners. The inclusion of indigenous peoples in the planning process with a right of veto, either formally or through their position as leasers, has the capacity to overcome this problem, without the need for them to become the occupiers on the land in the Western sense...|$|E
40|$|Rural land {{holdings}} {{in a number}} of states in Australia can be freehold or leasehold. The actual type and tenure of the leasehold varies according to each state, but the underlying principles of ownership, transferability and farming and grazing rights are reasonably similar. There are rural areas that are all <b>leasehold</b> <b>title</b> such as the western lands in NSW, while rural land in some states and areas can be a mix of both freehold and lease hold rural property. Over the years many rural farming areas that were originally developed or granted as leasehold land have been converted to freehold title. In many instances the cost of purchasing perpetual leasehold property is similar to the equivalent freehold property despite the fact that an additional rental charge is applied to this form of ownership. Many of the current leasehold rural holdings are located in the more arid regions of the state and the prevailing agricultural farming system is either cattle or sheep grazing...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that land {{is perhaps the most}} {{essential}} resource and an important pillar of national development. In Uganda, the management of land is regulated by the 1995 constitution and the Land Act of 1998, which recognise four tenure systems, namely; Customary, Mailo, Freehold and Leasehold tenure systems, each of which possess unique features and associated ownership rights. This study analysed important dimensions largely of a locational and regional nature, on tenure system and the value of agricultural land. The general objective was to investigate the determinants of the value of agricultural land in Uganda. The study hypothesized that institutional factors such as land titles were important determinants of agricultural land prices in Uganda; that there was a significant premium for agricultural land with title/certificate relative to that without, and that the premium for agricultural land with a freehold title was significantly higher than that for other titles/certificates. Data was obtained from the third round of the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) conducted by Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) during the 2004 / 2005 crop year. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression techniques using 9, 045 parcel level observations were used to answer the study objectives. Results showed that region, location in the peri-urban and institutional factors such as <b>leasehold</b> <b>title</b> were the major determinants of the value of agricultural land in Uganda. Compared to the Central region, agricultural land in the Eastern and Northern regions had significantly lower prices suggesting a high demand for land in the urbanising Central. Results from the characterisation of agricultural land ownership systems revealed that mailo tenure was dominant in the Central region, whereas customary tenure was dominant in the other regions of Uganda. However, current agricultural use, soil quality, trees/perennials, as well as proximity of agricultural land which were associated with higher land values in developed countries were not generally capitalised into the price of agricultural land. The study recommended that the current land policy should promote the leasehold system in upcoming cities/ or urbanising areas, since it opens land {{to a wide range of}} users and use-options to encourage allocation of land to the best alternative uses. The land policy should also address the double ownership structure under mailo tenure which constrains its marketability and transferability, and probably services to discount its price. This can be done possibly by facilitating arrangements for single ownership of land such that either the landlord willingly sells off his ownership rights to the tenant; or the tenant accepts compensation to leave the land; or alternatively the two parties could agree to share the land. Further research was recommended to explore the benefits of freehold title since it is viewed as the tenure system of the future. More research is also needed on the impact of converting one form of land tenure to another, for instance, on the conversion of customary land to freehold, since it is the dominant tenure system in Uganda.
