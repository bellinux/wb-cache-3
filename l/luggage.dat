5|$|Lost <b>Luggage</b> is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} and released in 1982 for the Atari 2600 by Texas-based studio Games by Apollo. The player controls skycaps working {{at an airport}} and tries to collect pieces of <b>luggage</b> that fall overhead from a frantic <b>luggage</b> carousel. A two-player mode, in which the second player controls the direction the <b>luggage</b> falls, is also available.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{connecting}} to domestic flights from an international flight generally must take their checked <b>luggage</b> through customs and re-check their <b>luggage</b> at the domestic airline counter, requiring extra {{time in the}} process. In some cases in Europe, <b>luggage</b> can {{be transferred to the}} final destination even if it is a domestic connection.|$|E
5|$|Programmer Ed Salvo was {{inspired}} to make Lost <b>Luggage</b> when {{he was waiting for}} his <b>luggage</b> at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and the game took around four weeks to produce. Reviewers criticized the game's similarity to Activision's Kaboom!which itself is based on Avalanchebelieving Lost <b>Luggage</b> to be an inferior clone.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, when Rincewind {{spotted the}} <b>Luggage</b> in the film, {{it was after}} he had {{attempted}} {{to jump into the}} River Ankh, whereas in the book he spotted the <b>Luggage</b> when he was sitting in the Broken Drum.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 1920, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with the}} buffers. Two people were injured. The following year, {{a passenger}} train was being shunted into a platform and collided with three <b>luggage</b> vans already occupying the line. A carriage was derailed and a <b>luggage</b> van was wrecked.|$|E
5|$|Richard Da Costa as The <b>Luggage.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{check-in}} {{a dedicated}} bellhop staff will retrieve a customer's <b>luggage</b> from their prior hotel, airport, etc. {{so that the}} customer is not left waiting for <b>luggage</b> arrival. A complimentary Japanese tea service greets each guest upon check-in, featuring green tea and special rice crackers. As a security feature, the elevators must be operated from the outside with a room key. There are no buttons inside the elevators themselves. Other services include 24-hour in-room dining {{and access to the}} spa. WiFi access and shoeshine services are available for an additional charge.|$|E
5|$|Lost <b>Luggage</b> is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling <b>luggage</b> from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 2013, {{suspicious}} <b>luggage</b> {{items were}} found inside the North bound train No. 616 toilet {{when it was}} heading towards THSR Hsinchu Station. The train was stopped at THSR Taoyuan Station {{and all of the}} passengers were evacuated. Later, it was determined the <b>luggage</b> contained an unidentified liquid in cans, alarm clock and white particulate matter. The items were dismantled by the bomb squad and taken for further investigation. Two KMT legislators, Hsu Hsin-ying and Lu Shiow-yen, were on board.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1874, {{collision}} {{a passenger}} train overran signals {{and ran into}} the rear of a <b>luggage</b> train. Seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him {{think that he}} is a thief by asking him where he keeps {{important}} things (like money) in his <b>luggage.</b> Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his <b>luggage.</b> Suraj admits this to Sameer the next morning at the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} not given {{boarding}} passes for Flight11 in Portland, Atta and Omari checked in and went through security in Boston. In the rushed check-in after the flight from Portland, airline officials did not load Atta's bags on Flight11. Suqami, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri also checked in for the flight in Boston. Wail al-Shehri and Suqami each checked one bag; Waleed al-Shehri did not check any bags. CAPPS selected all three for a detailed <b>luggage</b> check. As the CAPPS' screening was only for <b>luggage,</b> the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|The four hijackers {{checked in}} for the flight between 07:03 and 07:39Eastern Time. At 07:03, Ghamdi checked in without any <b>luggage</b> while Nami checked in two bags. At 07:24, Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07:39, Jarrah checked in without any <b>luggage.</b> Haznawi was the only hijacker {{selected}} for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint. None of the security checkpoint personnel reported anything unusual about the hijackers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>luggage</b> space {{consists}} of a small boot directly behind and above the rear portion of the engine, also trimmed in leather.|$|E
5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's <b>luggage,</b> in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his <b>luggage</b> or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to Lundy is {{free for}} anyone {{arriving}} by scheduled transport. Visitors arriving by non-scheduled transport are charged an entrance fee, currently (May 2016) £6.00, {{and there is}} an additional charge payable by those using light aircraft. Anyone arriving on Lundy by non-scheduled transport is also charged an additional fee for transporting <b>luggage</b> {{to the top of the}} island.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to carrying passengers and their <b>luggage,</b> Greyhound buses also carry packages. Through Greyhound Package Express customers can book expedited cargo shipping door-to-door or station-to-station. The company says that shipping by bus offers a cost-effective alternative to other ground or air carriers for same-day delivery.|$|E
5|$|Natalie applies {{for a job}} in San Francisco, {{where she}} was offered a job before {{following}} her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her. The film concludes with Ryan {{standing in front of a}} vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his <b>luggage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without <b>luggage.</b> The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their <b>luggage</b> in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|No {{rolling stock}} has been {{completely}} scrapped since service began, with the oldest C151 trains operating since the inauguration of the MRT System in 1987. Older trains have been renewed over the years under refurbishment schemes to enhance their lifespan {{as well as to}} adhere to updated safety and usability codes. Refurbished and new trains sport sleeker designs, improved passenger information systems, more grab poles, wider seats, more space near the doors, spaces for wheelchairs and CCTV cameras. As a trial run, <b>luggage</b> racks were installed on the C751B trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line. The scheme was withdrawn in June 2002 and the <b>luggage</b> racks removed.|$|E
5|$|A Blu-ray release {{with new}} special {{features}} {{came out on}} December 2, 2008; it is also available on DVD. The Blu-ray was initially only released as an expensive gift set with a booklet, a <b>luggage</b> tag and other assorted gift-type items. It was eventually released as a stand-alone Blu-ray in September 2009. On March 27, 2012, Warner released a new 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo set. It includes a brand-new 4K restoration and new bonus material.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{settlement}} during the relocation of the London terminus, two new hearse vans {{were given to the}} LNC by the LSWR in 1899. These new hearse vans were longer, and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each, for a total of 24 coffins per van. These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway. One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950. The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of <b>luggage</b> space, and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the hearse vans were not used and the coffins carried in the <b>luggage</b> space.|$|E
5|$|Charing Cross {{railway station}} {{was built on}} the Strand in 1864, {{providing}} a boat train service to Europe, which stimulated the growth of hotels in the area to cater for travellers. These included the Charing Cross Hotel, attached to the station itself. Today, there are several <b>luggage</b> outlets and tourist agents on the Strand, as well as old postage stamp dealers. The philatelist Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No.435 in 1891. It moved to No.391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No.399.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's first {{fight of}} 2004, was a fourth-round {{knockout}} {{victory over the}} former world title contender Victoriano Sosa. This was after an eventful week prior to the fight, which included Cotto having to wait four hours for his <b>luggage</b> to arrive (after a 2 a.m. local time arrival) at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and almost being removed from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the fight was held, by a security guard {{who thought he was}} an unaccompanied minor.|$|E
5|$|Führer Begleitbattalion ("Führer Escort Battalion"; FBB) was a {{military}} protection unit set up just before war began. It had the task of protecting Hitler's military headquarters and accompanying him when visiting battlefronts. It also was responsible for all <b>luggage</b> that travelled with Hitler and his staff. It was originally commanded by then infantry colonel Erwin Rommel. Otto Ernst Remer went on to command an expanded FBB, which {{played a key role}} in putting down the attempted military coup against Hitler of 20 July 1944 in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Australian author Thomas Keneally {{by chance}} visited Pfefferberg's <b>luggage</b> store in Beverly Hills while en route {{home from a}} film festival in Europe. Pfefferberg took the {{opportunity}} to tell Keneally the story of Oskar Schindler. He gave him copies of some materials he had on file, and Keneally soon decided to make a fictionalised treatment of the story. After extensive research and interviews with surviving Schindlerjuden, his 1982 historical novel Schindler's Ark (published in the United States as Schindler's List) was the result.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. Airbus says it offers better <b>luggage</b> storage and a quieter cabin, packaged with a more modern look and feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food hygiene, and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the <b>luggage</b> allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelers}} and the aircraft can clear customs and immigration at the departure airport. As {{one example of}} this, are airports in Canada with United States border preclearance facilities. This allows flights from those airports to fly into US airports {{that do not have}} customs and immigration facilities. <b>Luggage</b> from such flights can also be transferred to a final destination in the U.S. through the airport of entry.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of <b>luggage</b> and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|The next day, many {{survivors}} in the island's camp are stressed, including Sullivan (Scott Paulin), who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{and his new}} hunting companion, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), give some newly found <b>luggage</b> to Hurley; he looks through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including Kate and Sawyer, arrive to participate.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the National Waymarked Trails in Ireland by the National Trails Office in 2010 {{acknowledged}} these shortcomings and recommended that the Wicklow Way be selected as one of fourteen trails to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail. This is a proposed new standard of trail in Ireland, intended to meet international standards for outstanding trails. It would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10% of the total trail and for appropriate support services – accommodation, meals, transport, <b>luggage</b> transfer etc. – to be available. The review also recommended the development of shorter looped walks off the Wicklow Way and improving parking facilities.|$|E
5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased <b>luggage</b> capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage handling capacity will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Abdulmutallab left Lagos on Christmas Eve at 23:00 aboard KLM Flight 588, a Boeing 777 {{bound for}} Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, on Christmas Day, Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry-on <b>luggage.</b> On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket {{there was the}} least expensive of tickets to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston. Initially, some media rumored that Abdulmutallab tried to fly to Detroit {{because it was a}} major hub of the U.S. automotive industry.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{contact in}} the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is too close to the victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's <b>luggage</b> after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat <b>luggage</b> storage. There are two restrooms {{at one end of}} the car. There is a baggage rack at the end of the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E
