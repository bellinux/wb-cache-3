50|$|The lever frame {{contains}} interlocking {{designed to}} ensure that the levers cannot be operated to create a conflicting train movement. Each interlocking installation is individual and unique to the location controlled. The interlocking may be achieved mechanically <b>or</b> by electric <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> <b>or</b> (more usually) a combination of both.|$|R
5000|$|In U.S. English, [...] "skeleton key" [...] {{can often}} refer to any <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> key <b>or</b> antique key.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} styles of beadlocks. For 4-wheel drive vehicles, a ring {{with a number}} of bolts around the {{circumference}} is used to clamp the tire to the wheel. For motorcycles, a rim <b>lock</b> <b>or</b> bead <b>stopper</b> is a curved plate tightened by a single bolt. For both 4-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles, a different style of beadlock can be used that is similar to an inner tube which is inflated to press the tire against the wheel.|$|R
50|$|In railway {{signalling}}, an Annett’s key or Annett key {{is a large}} {{key that}} <b>locks</b> <b>levers</b> <b>or</b> other items of signalling apparatus, thereby serving as a portable form of interlocking. When not in use, the key is normally held in an Annett's <b>lock</b> (<b>or</b> Annett <b>lock)</b> that is fixed to the lever or concerned apparatus.|$|R
50|$|By its nature, a {{freewheel}} mechanism acts as {{an automatic}} clutch, {{making it possible to}} change gears in a manual gearbox, either up- or downshifting, without depressing the clutch pedal, limiting the use of the manual clutch to starting from standstill or stopping. The Saab freewheel can be engaged or disengaged by the driver by respectively pushing or pulling a <b>lever.</b> This will <b>lock</b> <b>or</b> unlock the main shaft with the freewheel hub.|$|R
50|$|Secret {{passages}} {{are used}} as a plot element {{or as part of}} the setting in mythological stories, fiction, and in television programs or films. Secret passages in old buildings, castles, haunted houses, and the lairs of villains or superheroes enable characters to secretly enter or exit the building, access a hidden part of the structure, or enter a supernatural realm. These passageways are often opened by pulling a disguised <b>lever</b> <b>or</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism. In some cases, a certain book on a bookshelf serves as the hidden trigger for the mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Motorcycle tires use a {{different}} style of beadlock, {{also known as a}} rim <b>lock</b> <b>or</b> bead <b>stopper.</b> Motorcycle tire rim locks clamp both beads at once because the tire is narrow enough do this conveniently with one device, and also {{there is no such thing}} as an [...] "inside bead" [...] and [...] "outside bead" [...] on a motorcycle tire. A curved metal plate inside the tire presses both beads outward against the inside of the wheel rim to clamp both beads at once in one localized area. A threaded stem attached to the plate is placed through a hole in the [...] "well" [...] of the rim, with the plate inside the tire and the threaded stem on the outside. The rim lock is tightened using either a standard bolt that leaves the threads visible, or a special bolt that covers the threads. The threaded stem or special bolt is visible on the inner surface of the wheel and points towards the axle, just like the valve stem.|$|R
50|$|Smith & Wesson {{restraints}} are, {{depending on}} the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock {{as well as a}} push pin <b>lock</b> <b>or</b> their newly patented M&P <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> system.|$|R
50|$|A 3 <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a common}} type of <b>lever</b> <b>lock,</b> but is {{generally}} used for low security applications such as internal doors as their tolerances are much lower (there are fewer combinations of key available, so {{they are likely to}} unlock doors they shouldn't).|$|R
50|$|A <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{is made up}} of a set of 'levers' (typically {{between two}} and five) which are raised to {{different}} heights by the key when it is turned. Once all the levers have been moved to the correct height, the locking bolt is free to slide across and secure the door. The teeth or bittings of the key have flat tops rather than being pointed. <b>Lever</b> <b>lock</b> keys tend to be bigger and less convenient for carrying, although <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> are considered to be harder to pick and so are recommended by most insurance companies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> {{are more}} {{commonly}} found in Argentina, the United Kingdom and parts around Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|Interviews from Merpati {{officials}} {{revealed that}} the first two aircraft had several problems on the Power <b>Lever</b> <b>Lock</b> System, whereas the automatic power <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> system sometimes failed to open after landing. In May 2008, the board of instructors had agreed to revise the Normal Checklist that the Power Lock system selects to “OPEN” before landing. However, further analysis {{revealed that the}}re were no faults in the engines.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lever</b> tumbler <b>lock</b> uses {{a set of}} levers {{to prevent}} the bolt from moving in the lock. In its {{simplest}} form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. <b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> are commonly recessed inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.|$|R
50|$|In US English usage, 'skeleton key' is also {{occasionally}} used to mean {{a standard}} <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> key. It is sometimes misapplied to refer to any antique key.|$|R

50|$|A Lens board (commonly spelled as lensboard) is a {{photographic}} part used for securing a lens {{to the front}} standard of a large format view camera. The lens board itself is usually flat, square, and made of metal (most commonly Aluminum) or wood and sometimes plastic. The lens board will have a hole of various diameters drilled dead center on the board. A lens board typically varies between 1 and 4 millimeters in thickness. The overall {{size and shape of}} the lens board depends on the brand of camera and film format used. Some cameras will use 2 to 4 screws to secure the lens board to the front standard of the view camera, most commonly however, the lens board will be secured by one <b>or</b> more <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> <b>or</b> tabs to allow tool-less removal of the lens board. The rear surface of a lens board is usually painted matte black to keep light entering the camera through the lens during exposure from reflecting off the surface and interfering with the projected image.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lever</b> tumbler <b>lock,</b> {{which uses}} a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{required}} the <b>lever</b> to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R
50|$|Higher {{security}} <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> (such as the 5 lever) {{usually have}} notches {{cut into the}} levers. These catch the locking bolt and prevent it from moving if picking is attempted (similar to the security pins in a pin tumbler lock).|$|R
50|$|<b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> can be drilled, {{but usually}} a {{template}} or stencil {{is required to}} mark the drilling point, as the lock mechanism is commonly mortised into the door {{and so it is}} harder to determine the point at which to drill.|$|R
5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> cylinder <b>locks,</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} levers may vary, but is usually an odd number for a lock {{that can be}} opened from {{each side of the}} door in order to provide symmetry. A minimum number of levers may be {{specified}} to provide an anticipated level of security (see 5 <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> section).|$|R
50|$|The lever frame {{principle}} of operation was perpetuated {{in the earliest}} power signalling installations. Since the signals and points worked electrically, no mechanical effort was needed to move the levers, which could therefore be miniaturised. In some cases, the interlocking was still done mechanically, but in others, electric <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> were used.|$|R
5000|$|For 2011, Proto {{ended the}} Proto Matrix Rail series {{and made the}} Reflex Rail and the Rail to take over. The Reflex Rail is the higher quality of the two and {{functions}} similar to the other PMRs, but had a minor overhauling changing the milling, adding a rubber [...] "contact" [...] pad {{in front of the}} gun, simplifying the bolt system, adding a <b>lever</b> <b>locking</b> feedneck, and replacing the eye covers with an eye pipe. The Rail is the cheaper of the two and is similar to a Smart Parts Ion in terms of operation, but has an almost identical bolt to the Reflex Rail. The Rail also has an eye pipe, but does not have a <b>lever</b> <b>locking</b> feedneck, on off airport, and has a composite ultralite frame as opposed to the aluminum ultralite frame on the Reflex.|$|R

50|$|A Chubb {{detector}} lock {{is a type}} of <b>lever</b> tumbler <b>lock</b> with {{an integral}} security feature, a form of relocker, which frustrates unauthorised access attempts and indicates to the lock's owner that it has been interfered with. When someone tries to pick the <b>lock</b> <b>or</b> to open it using the wrong key, the lock is designed to jam in a locked state until (depending on the lock) either a special regulator key or the original key is inserted and turned in a different direction. This alerts the owner {{to the fact that the}} lock has been tampered with.|$|R

50|$|When {{the correct}} key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a lever, {{activating}} a latch or sliding bolt, {{or it may}} itself push against the latch or bolt. In a double acting <b>lever</b> <b>lock,</b> the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.|$|R
50|$|Noticed by the {{abnormal}} {{situation on}} the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of Electric Magnetic Lock Systems and Mechanical Power Lever Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} electric magnetic <b>lock</b> system (Power <b>Lever</b> <b>lock)</b> was on open position. With power <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> on open position, the solenoid of the electric magnetic lock system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|R
