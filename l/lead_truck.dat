25|$|Campbell's {{solution}} to the problem of weight distribution and tractive effort was to develop two coupled drivers, one in front of the boiler and one at the rear with a two axle <b>lead</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tender {{boosters}} were {{equipped with}} side-rods connecting axles on the <b>lead</b> <b>truck.</b> Such small side-rods restricted speed and thus confined to switching locomotives, {{often used in}} transfer service between yards. Such boosters were far rarer than engine boosters.|$|E
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in {{this approach}} was that it had limited traction because of the single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by both axles, powered or unpowered, being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the leading axle was unpowered and not a <b>lead</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was tractive force which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of <b>lead</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Tesla Semi is an all-electric Class 8 {{semi-trailer}} truck first {{mentioned in}} the 2016 Master plan. According to Tesla they have a working prototype that uses ‘a bunch' of Model 3 electric motors. Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Programs, Jerome Guillen <b>leads</b> the <b>truck</b> program. He was once in charge of Freightliner's Cascadia Diesel Class 8 semi.|$|R
25|$|Each power car had a 1,200hp V16 Winton 201-A engine, generator, {{and a pair}} of two-axle powered trucks. The {{rear truck}} of the first power car and the <b>lead</b> <b>truck</b> of the second power car carried a span bolster to which both power cars were articulated, so they made one unified {{locomotive}} of B-B+B-B configuration and a total of 2,400hp (1,800kW).|$|E
25|$|A {{booster engine}} for steam {{locomotives}} {{is a small}} two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or, if none, the <b>lead</b> <b>truck</b> on the tender. A rocking idler gear permits it {{to be put into}} operation by the engineer. It would drive one axle only and could be non-reversible with one idler gear or reversible with two idler gears.|$|E
500|$|Due to poorer quality track {{than was}} the norm in its native England, the {{locomotive}} had much trouble with derailment; the C's engineers added a leading truck (an assembly consisting of an unpowered axle with smaller diameter wheels that {{was connected to the}} frame and pushed in front of the locomotive) to help guide the engine into curves. [...] The leading truck's mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the John Bull became a 4-2-0 (a locomotive with two unpowered axles, one powered main axle, and no trailing axles). Later, the C also added a pilot ("cowcatcher") to the <b>lead</b> <b>truck.</b> [...] The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive's crew from the weather, the C also added walls and a roof (a cab) {{to the rear of the}} locomotive where the controls were located. C workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight.|$|E

5000|$|After new EMC E1s {{replaced}} the proof-of-concept #1 in 1937, the Santa Fe began to further modify the two locomotive units. The two units were rebuilt as single-ended locomotives in 1938 with a [...] "bulldog" [...] front end — a very high, raised cab above a rounded snub nose. The locomotives were {{painted in the}} Warbonnet paint scheme similar to the E1s. The <b>lead</b> <b>trucks</b> were replaced with a three axle drop-equalizer truck of unusual 1B configuration; the lead axle was unpowered, while the two rear axles were powered. Some time later, the trailing trucks were replaced in similar fashion. The three-axle trucks were more stable at speed and lighter on the track with a lower axle loading. Roller bearings on the new trucks alleviated the overheating problem. Unit A retained road number 1 and Unit B was renumbered number 10, since it was now regarded as a separate locomotive. [...] The revamped locomotives pulled the new Chicagoan and Kansas Cityan named trainsets between Chicago and Wichita, KS, with the run soon extended to Oklahoma City.|$|R
5000|$|The NSWGR {{wanted to}} {{extensively}} test the first locomotive, {{so the next}} member did not appear for a further two years. Meanwhile, the contract {{had been reduced to}} just 120 locomotives. All were in service by March 1925 and were fitted with large capacity [...] "Wampu" [...] tenders. The last 30 were fitted with self-cleaning smokeboxes and outside bearings on the <b>lead</b> pony <b>trucks.</b> [...] During W.W.II, the 55 Class were seriously considered for use as War Department Locomotives in Iran and Iraq.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{production}} {{was to be}} American, the locomotive was designed by Russian engineers. This called for 10 drive wheels, a low axle loading, a large firebox to burn low-grade coal, and an overall similar design to the class Э class 0-10-0. Because {{the weight of the}} boiler, particularly the firebox, caused the axle load on some axles to exceed 16 tonnes, it was decided to add a <b>lead</b> pony <b>truck,</b> thus turning it into a 2-10-0. This also allowed a slightly bigger boiler whilst keeping the axle loadings within acceptable limits.|$|R

40|$|Truck turn {{times in}} FMCG supply chain are unreliable. The Dutch ‘Speed Docking’ project in 2011 and 2012 gave clear {{evidence}} to this. This <b>leads</b> to additional <b>trucks</b> and drivers in transport networks. Improving reliability of truck turn time will <b>lead</b> to less <b>trucks</b> and drivers in the transport network and improved productivity at distribution centres. The research {{is focused on}} Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) transport networks. A reduction of transport is high on the agenda’s of FMCG companies. The objectives in the FMCG industry are: less CO 2, increased reliability, secure transport capacity and ultimately a better service to consumers. The FMCG industry, together with logistics service providers, can realise improvements {{with the use of}} mobile communication, on board computers, connected navigation and intelligent transport systems, process mining based on big data to benefit better tactical and operational planning, geo-fencing, agent based dynamic planning and time slot allocation and the use of community platforms were data is shared with all chain partners in FMCG...|$|R

40|$|Haul trucks {{have the}} {{potential}} to generate large amounts of respirable dust. This respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} a health hazard to personnel, especially if it has a high silica content. Lack of dust sampling data from haul trucks prompted the completion of a study to quantify respirable dust concentrations. These field studies were conducted measuring instantaneous respirable dust at stationary locations from passing haul trucks at a stone quarry and at a coal mine site. Fugitive dust levels from haul trucks were analyzed to characterize dust dispersion. This analysis indicates safe following distances for haul trucks and other heavy equipment to avoid overexposure of respirable dust from the <b>lead</b> haul <b>truck...</b>|$|R

50|$|Like the Victorian Railways cars, {{the cars}} were fitted with the more rounded nose and with buffers; however, the typical McKeen dropped center door was {{retained}} to permit easy passenger access without a raised platform. The cars, unlike most, had the same size of wheels on both axles of the <b>lead</b> <b>truck</b> and a chain drive linking them, making all 4 wheels driven.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lead</b> <b>truck</b> {{of the car}} was the powered truck; {{the engine}} was rigidly mounted atop this truck and moved with it when it turned. Only the front axle was powered (via a chain drive) a design {{decision}} which contributed to the car's poor adhesion characteristics. The front wheelset had a 42-inch diameter, while the three other wheelsets were 33-inch diameter.|$|E
5000|$|Roads {{from the}} site of Noonday Camp go to the Noonday and War Eagle mines. The large white open pit of the talc mine is on Western Talc Road.

The <b>lead</b> ore was <b>trucked</b> to the UP siding at Dunn and shipped to smelters in Utah.|$|R
50|$|The design flaws of the S1 {{related to}} curve {{compatibility}} and wheel slip led {{to only one}} example being produced. A revised, shorter design that used four wheel <b>lead</b> and trailing <b>trucks</b> to place more weight on the drivers was developed for Baldwin's next iteration, the 4-4-4-4 T1. Unlike the S1, the T1 was actually used for long distance express service with such trains as the Broadway Limited and the Manhattan Limited, but the T1 was also plagued by wheel slip and related mechanical failures.|$|R
