40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{symmetric}} {{distribution of}} pulmonary vascular congestion and edema caused by <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> associated with severe mitral regurgitation as seen on chest radiographs is well known. To our knowledge, only eight {{cases have been}} reported in which congestion and edema were confined to one lung or a portion of one lung. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of asymmetric findings in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three radiologists retrospectively and independently reviewed the plain chest radiographs of 131 patients with severe mitral regurgitation admitted to our institution during a 3 -year period.

Radiographic signs of vascular congestion and edema were present in 117 (89 %) of the 131 patients. In 12 (9 %) of 131 patients, these findings were localized or predominant in the upper lobe of the right lung. None of the patients had predominantly left-sided involvement. CONCLUSION.

40|$|Introduction Dyspnea {{refers to}} {{difficulty}} in breathing, and short and shallow breaths. This sign {{is seen in}} numerous diseases due to pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic and neurological causes. Among cardiac causes, heart failure is considered {{the main cause of}} dyspnea. Cardiac failure is a clinical syndrome associated with a set of symptoms (dyspnea, and fatigue) and signs (edema and rales). Common causes of cardiac failure include: myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart diseases, and cardiomyopathy. Among uncommon causes of heart failure, endocrine disorders such as Cushing’s syndrome can be cited. Cushing’s syndrome can present itself in less common forms such as dyspnea due to heart failure. Cushing’s syndrome’s cardiovascular complications usually occur due to hypertension, end organ damage such as <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> diastolic and ischemic myocardial heart failure, which are rather seen in chronic cases of the disease and are often irreversible. Transient heart failure in patients with Cushing’s syndrome, due to adrenal adenoma, has been reported in a number of patients.

Eighteen client-owned dogs with advanced congestive heart failure due to either degenerative valve disease (n= 11) or dilated cardiomyopathy (n= 7) were included in this prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical study. After initial stabilization including furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, pimobendan and digoxin, spironolactone at a median dose of 0. 52 mg/kg (range 0. 49 - 0. 8 mg/kg) once daily (n= 9) or placebo (n= 9) was added to the treatment, and the dogs were reassessed 3 and 6 months later. Clinical scoring, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, systolic blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aldosterone and aminoterminal atrial natriuretic propeptide were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Survival times were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Spironolactone was well tolerated when combined with conventional heart failure treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk {{of sudden}} death from cardiac causes is {{increased}} among survivors of {{acute myocardial infarction}} with reduced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic function. We assessed the risk and time course of sudden death in high-risk patients after myocardial infarction. METHODS: We studied 14, 609 patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> dysfunction, <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> or both after myocardial infarction to assess the incidence and timing of sudden unexpected death or cardiac arrest with resuscitation {{in relation to the}} <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction. RESULTS: Of 14, 609 patients, 1067 (7 percent) had an event a median of 180 days after myocardial infarction: 903 died suddenly, and 164 were resuscitated after cardiac arrest. The risk was highest in the first 30 days after myocardial infarction [...] 1. 4 percent per month (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 2 to 1. 6 percent) [...] and decreased to 0. 14 percent per month (95 percent confidence interval, 0. 11 to 0. 18 percent) after 2 years. Patients with a <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction of 30 percent or less were at highest risk in this early period (rate, 2. 3 percent per month; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 8 to 2. 8 percent). Nineteen percent of all sudden deaths or episodes of cardiac arrest with resuscitation occurred within the first 30 days after myocardial infarction, and 83 percent of all patients who died suddenly did so in the first 30 days after hospital discharge. Each decrease of 5 percentage points in the <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction was associated with a 21 percent adjusted increase in the risk of sudden death or cardiac arrest with resuscitation in the first 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sudden death is highest in the first 30 days after myocardial infarction among patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> dysfunction, <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> or both.

We tested the hypothesis that mild stenosis of the coronary artery in combination with mild ventricular pacing induces an acute heart failure condition, whereas the separate phenomena themselves do not lead to impaired heart function. Mean aortic pressure (AoP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), stroke volume (SV) and myocardial systolic shortening (MSS) were compared 30 minutes after a pacemaker (PM) induced tachycardia in anaesthetized sheep (n= 3) without and with +/- 50 % stenosis of the proximal LCx. All parameters measured restored to basic levels when stenosis was absent When the LCx was partially occluded, mild PM-induced tachycardia resulted in decreased AoP (P= 0. 045) as well as in decreased SV (P= 0. 048); the LVEDP remained high (P= 0. 002). Also the recovery of MSS was impaired when stenosis was present (P= 0. 002). These values indicate that acute heart failure conditions were present. The technique used proved to be safe and allowed fine-tuning of the demand ischemia by adapting heart frequency to the required heart failure conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Since only {{little is}} known on stem cell therapy in non-ischemic heart failure {{we wanted to know}} whether a {{long-term}} improvement of cardiac function in non-ischemic heart failure can be achieved by stem cell transplantation. Methods White male New Zealand rabbits were treated with doxorubicine (3 mg/kg/week; 6 weeks) to induce dilative non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Thereafter, we obtained autologous bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) and injected 1. 5 – 2. 0 Mio cells in 1 ml medium by infiltrating the myocardium via a left anterolateral thoracotomy in comparison to sham-operated rabbits. 4 weeks later intracardiac contractility was determined in-vivo using a Millar catheter. Thereafter, the heart was excised and processed for radioligand binding assays to detect β 1 - and β 2 -adrenoceptor density. In addition, catecholamine plasma levels were determined via HPLC. In a subgroup we investigated cardiac electrophysiology by use of 256 channel mapping. Results In doxorubicine-treated animals β-adrenoceptor density was significantly down-regulated in left ventricle and septum, but not in right ventricle, thereby indicating a typical <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Sham-operated rabbits exhibited the same down-regulation. In contrast, BMSC transplantation led to significantly less β-adrenoceptor down-regulation in septum and left ventricle. Cardiac contractility was significantly decreased in heart failure and sham-operated rabbits, but was significantly higher in BMSC-transplanted hearts. Norepinephrine and epinephrine plasma levels were enhanced in heart failure and sham-operated animals, while these were not different from normal in BMSC-transplanted animals. Electrophysiological mapping revealed unaltered electrophysiology and did not show signs of arrhythmogeneity.
