40|$|The {{detection}} of adulteration of fuels {{and its use}} in criminal scenes like arson has a high interest in forensic investigations. In this work, a method based on gas chromatography (GC) and neural networks (NN) has been developed and applied to the identification and discrimination of brands of fuels such as gasoline and diesel without the necessity to determine {{the composition of the}} samples. The study included five main brands of fuels from Spain, collected from fifteen different <b>local</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> The methodology allowed the identification of the gasoline and diesel brands with a high accuracy close to 100 %, without any false positives or false negatives. A success rate of three blind samples was obtained as 73. 3 %, 80 %, and 100 %, respectively. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of this methodology to help in resolving criminal situations...|$|R

40|$|Oil and Gas {{companies}} have the inevitable need {{to operate in}} a global environment and therefore have a global reach. This thesis seeks {{to understand the nature}} and degree of localisation of the websites in this industry. This thesis introduces two notions of ‘global’, and seeks {{to examine the relationship between}} them: the first of which is the Global reach or operations of companies and the second is where a company’s communication is localised in language and cultural terms. A company can be seen to be ‘global’ in one of these two notions and it is this relationship that this thesis seeks to explore. The contribution of this thesis firstly, is that it adds to previous studies of website localisation, which have focused primarily on consumer goods and the retail industry, by examining a different kind of industry. Secondly, it takes into account the important semiotic and symbolic dimensions of language and culture when looking at localisation practices. The thesis thus contributes to the growing literature on website localisation and practices in Multinational companies. This study was carried out on 387 corporate and country specific websites of 16 Oil and Gas Companies to understand the extent and nature of their localisation practises particularly the way that language and culture are presented. The websites were studied using a qualitative and quantitative research design which involved carrying out a linguistic/semiotic analysis and a cultural analysis to give a balanced perspective of localisation practices. The conclusions of the study were that the companies operated a ‘glocal’ strategy, a combination of both a localised and a globalised (standardised) strategy. The companies had a combination of globally standardised features such as the website layouts, images, colour schemes, logos and the use of global celebrities on their websites and a limited degree of localisation where the ‘local’ is signified by local country websites, local news stories, local languages, local celebrities, images of local sights, images of company’s local office buildings and <b>local</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
50|$|Brockholes is a semi-rural area, mostly {{consisting}} of farms {{with a large}} housing area, some {{of which has been}} built on the former premises of Rock Mills, which was only one of several large textile mills. There was also a spinning works, shoddy mill, and a textile machinery engineering works, though now only the latter still exists. A number of larger businesses were established in the industrial units of the old Rock Mill site, including a tyre fitting and repair company, an electrical wholesalers, a steel fabrication company, and a car registration plate business. More recently the <b>local</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> was bought out by a national chain and refurbished to include a mini supermarket.|$|E
50|$|Today, Alvington {{has little}} in the way of shops and villagers have to travel to the nearby town of Lydney for most {{services}} beyond those served by the <b>local</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>station,</b> which acts as the village shop. There are three public houses in Alvington: The Blacksmith’s Arms; The Globe Inn (which reopened in November 2014); and The Swan Inn (currently closed but having renovations). The Globe Inn dates back to around 1805. The Blacksmith’s Arms dates back the late nineteenth-century in a building that was formerly a smithy (hence the pub’s current name). The Swan Inn lies on the border of Alvington and neighbouring Woolaston (also classed as Colne Valley), and once contained a mill in its early days.|$|E

At around the same time, Rikkert breaks up with Manuela, his girlfriend, and Barrie's house (which is also an illegal {{cannabis}} farm) catches fire. Subsequently all three take refuge {{in the home of}} Richard and Robbie. The group go shopping and rely on Richard to pay, however his bank card is declined following the refuelling of Rikkerts Opel Manta. The group travel together to the local employment and benefits office and demand more benefits from the official, who politely refuses. Richard climbs over the desk and thrusts the official against the wall, telling him to [...] "Give us more money, 'kut'". The following morning, Richard reads a letter sent from the benefits office and informs the group that as a whole their benefits have ceased entirely. The result of which is that the group decides that they simply will no longer pay for anything and go on a spree of petty robbery, most notably from their <b>local</b> <b>petrol</b> filling <b>station,</b> as the group run from the forecourt each carrying two large capacity containers full of fuel, chased by the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendant, similarly the group flee the local supermarket [...] "Lupus" [...] each carrying large quantities of lager. Gerrie steals deep-fried croquette snacks from the local takeaway whilst Barrie acts as a diversion. Richard, Robbie and Rikkert phone a delivering Chinese takeaway, but explain they have no money to pay the delivery rider when he comes to deliver.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} travelling {{of today}} makes nodes along travelling routes {{more and more}} important. This {{is very much the}} case of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> They constitute important nodes in the road network, filling up thirsty fuel tanks and hungry stomachs, guiding road users and providing vehicle-services. In this thesis the role of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> for road users was investigated in order {{to find out if the}} <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> was a potential hot spot. We performed an ethnographic field study at a <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> and found that a great number of visitor activities took place at the <b>petrol</b> <b>station.</b> These indicated the significance of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> for road users. There were much more taking place than traditional car maintenance. We found that the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> prerequisites for becoming a digital hotspot were favourable. Aspects of interest to consider for IT implementation were also identified. The ability of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> to provide timely information about e. g. the vicinity of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> and road related information are examples of such aspects. The possibility to support people that travel a lot in their work and people having a journey break are further aspects of interest for a <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> hot spot. Desig...|$|R

Later at Sonny's house, they arm themselves and search the place, expecting Richard to be there. They do not find him, although he is hiding in the kitchen pantry. While they are upstairs Richard laces their kettle with a cocktail of the drugs he took from the gang earlier in the film. The three men become completely intoxicated {{a few hours later}} and Richard reappears to kill them one by one. He toys with them, dancing and joking. He shoots Sonny in the head, and kills Soz with an upward palm strike. He then sits down Herbie and brings out a suitcase, which has Tuff's corpse inside. Richard then tells him he is a good man and will let him live if he tells him where the final gang member is as he left the gang years before. He tells him without hesitation and Richard hugs him. But he finds Herbie's knife and asks him if it was to be used on him. Herbie lies at first then tells the truth, but Richard stabs him regardless. Richard leaves right after.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Proliferation of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Maiduguri and Jere has now {{reached a}} level of unimaginable {{nightmare}} with perceived consequences on both {{human health and the}} environment. It is against this the paper evaluates the environmental effects of the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in their neighbourhoods in Maiduguri and Jere. Specifically, it examined the presence of those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> vis-a-vis residential houses within 100 m radius of location in the township; hazards associated with their activities/operation; and the perception of residents/petrol stations workers on the effects pose by those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> Only purposed-built <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> both functional and non-functional as at 2010 were considered in the study. Out of the 138 <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in the study area, 122 (88. 41 %) were functional and 16 (11. 59 %) were non-functional. These <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are spatially located unevenly across the major road network in the township. Data for the study were therefore obtained through field survey where the functional statuses of those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were recorded and GPS (Garmin 76 CSX) devise was equally used to determine their co-ordinates. Three household heads around each of the 35 sampled <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were randomly sampled to provide information on the activities of the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> that are either improving on the well-being of the residents or detrimental to their lives.

40|$|Abstract: A general {{consensus}} generated from various news articles is that {{violence in the}} workplace {{is on the rise}} and that the workplace is no longer considered safe for many employees. Although some employees such as police officers and prison guards might encounter violence at work to some degree, more and more employees are experiencing the effects of public-initiated violence at work. They include petrol attendants working on the forecourts of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> Recently, Kole (2010) conducted research on the security measures to reduce workplace violence at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Gauteng and highlighted issues and challenges that <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> face on a daily basis regarding workplace violence. Kole recommended several prevention strategies to reduce violent crimes at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} add knowledge on this phenomenon by focusing on selected <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Johannesburg, to understand whether they experience similar issues and challenges regarding workplace violence and what strategies they use to prevent these issues and challenges. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five managers and fifteen petrol attendants working at these selected <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Johannesburg in 2015. These interviews focused on violent Type I and non-violent Type II workplace violence that occur at their <b>petrol</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{an urban}} {{environment}} the typical anthropogenic sources of benzene are mainly the road traffic. Other important sources are <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> and small- scale industries using benzene as a solvent, {{such as the}} printing industry, etc. <b>Petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are the most significant of these additional sources. Evaporative emissions from <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> operations include contributions due to the filling underground tank operations, due to the underground tank breathing and emptying, due to vehicle refuelling operations and lastly due to spillage. The <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are frequently located in populated urban areas consequently exposing the population {{to this kind of}} pollution. The present study assesses the contribution of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> to the ambient benzene concentrations in a mid- sized city. The scientific toolbox adopted to develop the studies includes an air quality simulation model and a GIS platform.
