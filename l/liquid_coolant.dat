25|$|Coherent {{microwave}} amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like {{travelling wave}} tubes and klystrons, require <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant.</b> The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times {{more power than}} the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma {{into the path of}} the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and deionized water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} (also {{commonly}} spelled heatsink) is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant,</b> {{where it is}} dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at optimal levels. In computers, heat sinks are used to cool central processing units or graphics processors. Heat sinks are used with high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} sort of condenser {{consists of}} a single tube wherein {{the heat of the}} vapour is conducted to the glass wall, which is only cooled by air; such air condensers are often used for condensation of high boiling liquids (i.e., for distillations at high temperatures, well above 100 Â°C), where columns can be used with or without packing (see below). Historically, the retort appearing in illustrations of the practice of alchemists is an apparatus that is essentially an unpacked air condenser. Liebig condensers are often used as air condensers, with air circulated rather than a <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> (see next section).|$|E

25|$|A heat {{exchanger}} is a device used to transfer heat between a solid object and a fluid, or between {{two or more}} fluids. The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing {{or they may be}} in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries, natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a {{heat exchanger}} is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Metal cutting [...] generates heat due to {{friction}} and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it {{is a poor}} coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce {{friction and}} tool wear.|$|E

50|$|Since air {{has a lower}} heat {{capacity}} and density than <b>liquid</b> <b>coolants,</b> a fairly large volume flow rate (relative to the coolant's) must be blown through the radiator core to capture {{the heat from the}} coolant. Radiators often have one or more fans that blow air through the radiator. To save fan power consumption in vehicles, radiators are often behind the grille at the front end of a vehicle. Ram air can give a portion or all of the necessary cooling air flow when the coolant temperature remains below the system's designed maximum temperature, and the fan remains disengaged.|$|R
2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E

These can cause various forms of surface damage in the most sensitive finishing phase of the manufacturing cycle. Traditional cooling methods based on large amounts of water-oil emulsions can be both ineffective and environmentally unacceptable. A new approach to this problem has been devised utilizing the high penetrative power of fast air jets combined with a water/soap mist to greatly improve convective cooling and lubrication along the arc of cut. The results obtained offer striking improvements compared to traditional <b>liquid</b> <b>coolants</b> especially if the relative simplicity of the method is considered...|$|R

5000|$|One is {{providing}} {{a place to}} monitor water level in the reactor coolant system. Since the reactor coolant system is completely flooded during normal operations, {{there is no point}} in monitoring coolant level in any of the other vessels. But early awareness of a reduction of coolant level (or a loss of coolant) is important to the safety of the reactor core. The pressurizer is deliberately located high in the reactor containment building such that, if the pressurizer has sufficient coolant in it, one can be reasonably certain that all the other vessels of the reactor coolant system (which are below it) are fully flooded with coolant. There is therefore, a coolant level monitoring system on the pressurizer and it is the one reactor coolant system vessel that is normally not full of coolant. The other secondary function is to provide a [...] "cushion" [...] for sudden pressure changes in the reactor coolant system. The upper portion of the pressurizer is specifically designed to NOT contain <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> and a reading of full on the level instrumentation allows for that upper portion to not contain <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant.</b> Because the coolant in the pressurizer is quite hot during normal operations, the space above the <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> is vaporized coolant (steam). This steam bubble provides a cushion for pressure changes in the reactor coolant system and the operators ensure that the pressurizer maintains this steam bubble at all times during operations. Allowing this steam bubble to disappear by filling the pressurizer to the top with <b>liquid</b> <b>coolant</b> is called letting the pressurizer [...] "go hard" [...] meaning there is no cushion and any sudden pressure change can provide a hammer effect to the entire reactor coolant system. Some facilities also call this letting the pressurizer [...] "go solid," [...] although solid simply refers to being completely full of liquid and without a [...] "steam bubble." ...|$|E
