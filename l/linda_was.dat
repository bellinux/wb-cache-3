5|$|When <b>Linda</b> <b>was</b> {{predicted}} to turn towards the northeast, it was forecast to move ashore in southern California as a weak tropical storm, {{which would have}} made Linda the first to do so since a tropical storm in 1939. The Oxnard, California National Weather Service office issued public information and special weather statements that discussed the possible impact of Linda on southern California. The advisories mentioned forecasting uncertainty, and advised the media not to exaggerate the storm. The office noted a threat for significant rainfall—possibly causing flash flooding—as well as high surf. To prepare for possible flooding, workers cleaned storm drains and prepared sandbags for coastal properties.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Linda</b> <b>was</b> {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone in September2015 {{that resulted in}} heavy rains across portions of Mexico and the Southwestern United States. The seventeenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the season, Linda developed southwest of Mexico from a low pressure area on September5. Under warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind shear, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Linda by September6 and a hurricane by the next day. A well-defined eye soon formed within the storm's central dense overcast and Linda reached its peak intensity as a 125mph (205km/h) Category3 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September8. Thereafter, the storm moved into a stable environment and an area of lower sea surface temperatures, causing rapid weakening. Convective activity dissipated and Linda degenerated into a remnant low on September10. The lingering system persisted southwest of Baja California, ultimately opening up into a trough on September14.|$|E
