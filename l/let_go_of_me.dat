The man that had a-holt <b>of</b> <b>me</b> was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. It didn't seem no good for ME to stay--I couldn't do nothing, and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't." ...|$|R

60|$|Then she <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> She {{had given}} up. I {{thought she was}} going to drop, and drew her toward the stone. I cursed the day I ever saw Neal and the service.

60|$|Then I {{looked about}} me, and, {{although}} the dawn was only just breaking, began to recognise my surroundings. Surely {{this was the}} Prinsloos' house to my right, and that, faintly seen through the mist about a hundred paces away, was Marie's and my own. There seemed to be something going on yonder which excited my awakening curiosity. I could see figures moving in an unusual manner, and desired {{to know what they}} were doing. I began to walk towards them, and Hans, for his part, began to try to drag me in an opposite direction, uttering all sorts of gibberish as to the necessity of my running away. But I would not be dragged; indeed, I struck at him, until at last, with an exclamation of despair, he <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and vanished.|$|E
60|$|I am not {{a nervous}} man in a general way, and very little troubled with superstitions, of which I have lived to see the folly; but I am free to own that this sight quite upset me, and {{had it not been}} that Sir Henry caught me by the collar and held me, I do {{honestly}} believe that in another five minutes I should have been outside the stalactite cave, and that a promise of all the diamonds in Kimberley would not have induced me to enter it again. But he held me tight, so I stopped because I could not help myself. Next second, however, his eyes became accustomed to the light, and he <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and began to mop the perspiration off his forehead. As for Good, he swore feebly, while Foulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked.|$|E
60|$|But I did not heed their impudence, and {{was walking}} {{straight}} toward the cabin-door on the quarter-deck, when the chief mate met me. I touched my hat, and was passing him, when, after {{staring at me}} till I thought his eyes would burst out, he all at once caught me by the collar, and with a voice of thunder, {{wanted to know what}} I meant by playing such tricks aboard a ship that he was mate of? I told him to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> or I would complain to my friend the captain, whom I intended to visit that evening. Upon this he gave me such a whirl round, that I thought the Gulf Stream was in my head; and then shoved me forward, roaring out I know not what. Meanwhile the sailors were all standing round the windlass looking aft, mightily tickled.|$|E
500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode.

[...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue."

6000|$|Still another figure arises {{out of the}} old life--Jackson's lawyer. Least of {{all would}} I have {{expected}} again to meet this man, Joseph Hurd. It was a strange meeting. Late at night, two years after the Chicago Commune, Ernest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge. This was in Michigan, across the lake from Chicago. We arrived just {{at the conclusion of the}} trial of a spy. Sentence of death had been passed, and he was being led away. Such was the scene as we came upon it. The next moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung himself at my feet, his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy. As he turned his agonized face up to me, I recognized him as Joseph Hurd. Of all the terrible things I have witnessed, never have I been so unnerved as by this frantic creature's pleading for life. He was mad for life. It was pitiable. He refused to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> despite the hands of a dozen comrades. And when at last he was dragged shrieking away, I sank down fainting upon the floor. It is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg for life.* ...|$|E

40|$|A summary, as if {{the reader}} mattered "La {{condition}} primordiale d une étymologie rigoureuse : l établissement du sens initial" Emile Benveniste (1938), Les Mages dans l Ancien Iran 					 There is this tendency to if ever challenged to refer to some original sense in a phrase. 	This sense may then be broken down to its main, undivided atomic building block; the word (and surely to even smaller elements). But the word is not logos, it is nomos; it is a name. It becomes logos. It becomes law. 	Now enters this tiny voice, so insistent what if that original sense has been wrongly perceived ? Worse, what {{if it is not}} ? Worst, what if it is less existant than a dream ? A lot of buildings may then be seen to be castles in the air; wonderful, till they fall. They do so every day, all those disasters brought to us by the rumours, mishaps we prefer to treat from a distance. They re so many, they will exhaust any serious listing. 	But what if I am wrong, and that the word actually carries that initial sense (Benveniste) ? In that case, my rather new-kindled interest in the history of vir virtú, vertu, aretē & dygd finds its easy justification (but my project was not from the outset one of taxonomy.) 	One {{does not have to be}} Socrate, Cratylus, Plato or Buddha to work with these questions. One cannot be, one has to do it by oneself. It may be tough in the start, but it becomes not just a necessity it is that serious it may also, curiously, become an art, and a beautiful, joyful one. 	This mémoire treats basic experience. It departs from an uneasiness : How come some works of arts just won t <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> ? Could their tenacity be explained, not just by their being sublime (Longinus), but by their virtuosity ? What, then, is virtuosity ? 	I would have to do a re-reading : a reading of my readings. Three experiences decided, unanimously, inconsiderate, to be re-read by me : those with Madame de La Fayette (1678), Miles Davis (1958), and Georges Perec (1975). These re-readings of mine turned out to be readings of me; I followed some counsel, and looked into the dusty chamber of an hidden art, etymology. From there, I was sent to the very border of the Indo-European, into truly pre-historic mythos, a primordial sea of knowledge beyond the nostratic (a presumed substratum of language). I was, literally, sent back to Memory. (A mother of mine. Her name is Mnemosyne). What I found shook me, no, that s way too weak, and unprecise. I was clawed. ( [...] .) 	 	What I came close to, is what I am. Ever grateful to great readers and writers Kertesz, Balzac, Felman, Barthes, Bourdieu to mention just a handful I have to say that it is beyond paragate male dominance. Beyond Vir mensura and beyond model thinking, it is parasamgate even beyond that. It is virtuosity itself; the aesthetic, sensual legitimation of dominance. It is of Eros, so poorly understood (I speak for myself, of course). It is violent. 	I spoke of joyful. I will not take from the reader any pleasure, or throe, of reading this mémoire. Therefore I speak of other things, other ways to just about the same core. Like any writing, it beats about the bush : ça tourne autour du pot, as one extraordinarily astute reader told me dryly, over that table (merci). Now and then, I hope, the reader will nevertheless become aware of a strange thing; the pot is right here (right here, write now, cf. Calder 1982, on Burroughs). The reading is that pot, and the reading is magic (which means wonderful, and not understood). This is the writing of my reading. 	So, to resume. There are three main strata of perspective in this work. These angles treat basic experience. The first level is my wonderment towards the effect of art. I ask again, and again, how come (my rendez-vous with) certain fragments stay with me, stay in me and thus seem to have provoked a change of me ? The second level rises from such questioning : could the effect of art be adequately accounted for by my use of a word such as virtuosité ? I would then have to examine that word, thing and notion more closely, and that work takes up about forty percent of this mémoire, rooting up the *wir, vr, etc. The third level is hardly governed by will alone. It is the discovery of my lecture. 	I have come to look upon lecture as far more, and older, than reading. It is something I am born with, but haven t cultivated; I no longer can assume that any litterate person can do a lecture, nor that analphabetism per definition means a life deprived of possibilities. On the contrary, I am on the verge of discovering all the things that can be experienced through a stripping-down of conventional readings. For a great keyword it is, conventional. And what is reading (fr. lecture) ? The etymologist will remind us that the root-sense of that word has to do with collecting and gathering, so there is from the outset this element of choice to it. 	It s most interesting. 	This reading that I m writing, has brought me to Paris for a short semester (2005) and for a few days visit to Poland. In Oświęcim as in Paris I was so privileged, I could walk and walk around, taking pictures and notes fram dawn to dusk and let the History of Europe, and of the IndoEuropean seep into me. In that way I was allowed to combine a pélérinage, with the falcon of Robert Burton as a faithful travelmate, with the study of Georges Perecs W ou le souvenir d enfance. This drawn-out exercice has enabled me to do interpretations of my chosen art-objects in a scope, and to a degree that I could not have imagined from the outset. 	I bring no grand conclusions today. The reader will be able to surmise that this work has a strong flavor of exploration. In that sense it has just barely started. Let me then hasten to say that anyone really can take similar approaches, and explore those mythical limits between subject and object with their own heart as guide. 	I end this with what may be seen as the start. In this work, I have made a lecture. This is the name of that lecture: Madame de La Fayette, Miles Davis, Georges Perec : Virtuosité Lecture de l art, appropriation de la langue I do find it necessary to challenge the idea that reading is well taken care of and I do so, {{as if the}} reader mattered.
