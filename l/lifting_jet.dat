40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of propulsion-induced aerodynamics are reviewed. Experimental and analytical {{studies of the}} fundamental properties of <b>lifting</b> <b>jet</b> wakes and wind-tunnel {{investigations of}} VTOL configuration variables are discussed. The jet-wake flow studies will provide the data base for evaluating theoretical performance prediction methods; while the configuration studies will provide guidance for optimizing airframe/propulsion system integration. The influence of results to date on high-performance VTOL designs emphasizing minimum jet-induced losses and improved thrust vectoring in forward flight (VIFF) capability is illustrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} reported {{is related}} to studies of the noise generated by a <b>lifting</b> <b>jet</b> in forward motion {{such as in the}} case of a V/STOL aircraft. The investigation involved experiments in a subsonic wind tunnel. The two-microphone cross-correlation method used for measuring the acoustic intensity provides data concerning the noise directly radiated from the source, practically free from any reflection effects. The theoretical basis of the two-microphone method is discussed along with the experimental apparatus, the characteristics of the flow inside the jet, and the features of the acoustic field...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{treatment is}} presented for a flowfield {{generated by a}} pair of interacting, two-dimensional parallel jets, representative of the two exhaust streams issuing from the thrust augmentor nozzles of dual <b>lifting</b> <b>jet</b> VTOL aircraft propulsion systems. Predictions of the analysis for the ratio of primary to secondary velocity are in close agreement with experimentally observed values, if the spreading rate parameter is allowed to assume a value greater than that which applies to a free jet. Theoretical results are combined with existing experimental data for unventilated jets, in order to arrive at an estimate of the thrust augmentation produced by a jet pair with an arbitrary degree of ventilation...|$|E
5000|$|The first option, for an {{aircraft}} fitted with <b>lift</b> <b>jets,</b> {{resulted in the}} [...] "23-01", {{also known as the}} MiG-23PD ( [...] - <b>lift</b> <b>jet),</b> was a tailed delta of similar layout to the smaller MiG-21 but with two <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> in the fuselage. This first flew on 3 April 1967, but it soon became apparent that this configuration was unsatisfactory, as the <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> became useless dead weight once airborne. Work on the second strand of development was carried out in parallel by a team led by A.A Andreyev, with MiG directed to build a variable-geometry prototype, the [...] "23-11" [...] in 1965.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Lift</b> <b>jet</b> is a {{lightweight}} jet engine {{used to provide}} vertical thrust for VTOL operation, and is then shut down in forward flight. Some VTOL designs have used both vectored thrust from the main engine together with auxiliary <b>lift</b> <b>jets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lift</b> <b>jets</b> {{were first}} {{designed}} by German engineers during World War II, but none saw operational service. Many nations had experimental programs involving such engines {{by the early}} 1950s: one typical example was Rolls-Royce's Thrust Measuring Rig (TMR), nicknamed the [...] "Flying Bedstead," [...] which took its lift solely from engine thrust. An early dedicated <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> was the Rolls-Royce RB108, first run in 1955.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests on}} a finite, knee-blowing-flapped wing {{and on a}} direct jet lift {{configuration}} were performed in a 30 x 42 inch wind tunnel. The objectives of these tests were, in experimental order:(1) to obtain definitive fixed-versus-moving ground comparisons on a powered, high-lift finite wing and on a <b>lifting</b> <b>jet</b> configuration {{as a function of}} model height and lift, (2) to understand the flow mechanism which lead to observed differences between moving and fixed-ground results, (3) to discover whether the above effects of a moving ground plane can be simulated by tangential-blowing boundary layer control at the wind tunnel floor, and (4) to check the form and the numerical constants for the wall jet blowing equation derived theoretically in Part I of this report. This relates wall jet blowing quantities to model lift coefficient...|$|E
40|$|An ejector design {{concept for}} V/STOL aircraft, {{featuring}} a double-delta configuration with two large chordwise ejector slots {{adjacent to the}} fuselage side and a tailplane or canard for longitudinal control is examined. Large scale model tests of the concept have shown that ejector systems are capable of significant thrust augmentation at realistic supply pressures and temperatures, so that power plant size and weight can be reduced accordingly. A thrust augmentation of at least 1. 75 can be achieved for the isolated ejector, not making allowance for duct and nozzle losses. Substantial reductions in velocity, temperature and noise of the <b>lifting</b> <b>jet</b> are assured due to mixing within the ejector - this lessens the severity of ground erosion and the thrust loss associated with reingestion. Consideration is also given {{to the effect of}} ground proximity, longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics, transition performance, and lateral stability...|$|E
50|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> is a {{jet engine}} angled {{to provide an}} {{aircraft}} with aerostatic (i.e. not requiring the movement of air over an airfoil) lift like a humming bird, instead of (or in addition to) thrust. On a fixed-wing aircraft, <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> may be installed as auxiliary engines, with a separate engine to provide forward thrust, or, as in the Harrier jump jet, may be vectored in flight to provide both.|$|R
25|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> is an {{auxiliary}} jet engine {{used to provide}} lift for VTOL operation, but may be shut down for normal wing-borne flight.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is {{turbulent}} <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> fires. The main objective is to present a <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> fire methodology using the boundary-layer equations as a basis. The advantages of this are that finite-volume, mesh-independent predictions of the mean flow fields can be calculated on readily available computer resources, which leads to rigorous model calibration. A number of lift-off models are evaluated. The model of choice is one based on the laminar flamelet quenching concept combined with a model for the large-scale strain rate...|$|R
50|$|The Mirage IIIV was a VTOL {{derivative}} {{of an existing}} conventional fighter, the Dassault Mirage III; the principal {{difference between the two}} types was the addition of eight small vertical <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> which straddling the main engine. These <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> would have been used during vertical takeoffs and landings, but would have been inactive during horizontal flight. The Mirage IIIV had come about {{as a response to the}} issuing of a NATO specification, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3), which sought a supersonic-capable VTOL strike fighter.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of turbulent <b>lifted</b> non-premixed <b>jet</b> flames under various coflow conditions have widely been investigated {{due to their}} relevance to practical applications such as diesel engines, gas turbine combustors, and commercial boilers.

40|$|An {{engineering}} methodology {{based on}} an empirical data base and analytical fluid dynamic models was developed for the prediction of propulsive lift system induced aerodynamic effects for multiple <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> VTOL aircraft operating in the hover mode {{in and out of}} ground effect. The effects of aircraft geometry, aircraft orientation (pitch, roll) as well as height above ground are considered. <b>Lift</b> <b>jet</b> vector and splay directions fit the airframe, <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> exit flow conditions, and both axisymmetric and rectangular nozzle exit geometry are also accommodated. The induced suckdown flows are computed from the potential flowfield induced by the turbulent entrainment of both the free jets and wall jets in ground effect and from the free jets alone out of ground effect. The methodology emphasized geometric considerations, computation of stagnation lines and fountain upwash inclination, fountain upwash formation and development, and fountain impingement on the airframe...|$|R
50|$|A similar <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> was {{designed}} by Bristol Siddeley, the BS.59, with a thrust of 8,000 lb the engine was intended for the projected Focke-Wulf Fw 260.|$|R
50|$|The new {{aircraft}} types required advanced <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> engines with high thrust-to-weight ratios, development programmes for new powerplants employing vectored thrust or vertically mounted pure lift engines ran concurrently with the aircraft designs.|$|R
50|$|None of {{the early}} American V/STOL designs {{would result in a}} {{production}} aircraft. The British Hawker Siddeley Harrier used vectoring nozzles, while the Russian Yakovlev Yak-38 Forger attack <b>jet</b> used <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> in conjunction with rotating rear nozzles.|$|R
50|$|Ivan {{was placed}} in charge of two OKB Mikoyan {{projects}} studying STOL fighter designs. One group studied of the swing-wing design (like the MiG-23) and the other delta wings (like the MiG-21) and <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> instead of the swing wing.|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} {{flight performance}} of a representative Short Take-Off or Vertical Landing (STOVL) model is investigated using side-by-side experimental and numerical simulations. The model consists of a 60 deg cropped delta wing planform; a simple fuselage shape blended to the wing; and tandem, circular, high-pressure-air <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> that exit perpendicular to the flat lower surface. The configuration was chosen to minimize the geometric modeling complexity while retaining the important flow physics of the lift-jet/aerodynamic surface interaction. Three-dimensional, turbulent Navier-Stokes computations are made using a multiple, overset grid scheme. Results are presented and compared with the measured forces and pressures for the model at a freestream Mach number of 0. 14 and a 10 deg angle-of-attack without <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> operating. Computed surface flow patterns and particle traces show that the simulation predicts primary and secondary wing leading edge vortices for these conditions...|$|R

The two Pratt & Whitney JT12 engines were replaced with six General Electric J85 turbojets {{four of these}} units acting as <b>lift</b> <b>jets.</b> This aircraft crashed in Georgia on 14 March 1969, the pilot, Harlan J. Quamme, escaping uninjured by use of the ejection seat.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the VTOL Harrier {{motivated}} the USSR to introduce a counterpart {{using a combination of}} exhaust thrust vectoring and additional forward <b>lift</b> <b>jets,</b> the Yakovlev Yak-36 flew in 1971, later evolving into the operational Yakovlev Yak-38. Entering service in 1978, the Yak-38 was limited in both payload capability and hot-and-high performance, and saw only limited deployment.|$|R
50|$|Yakovlev studied both {{turboprop}} and jet-powered {{designs to}} meet the requirement, including Vertical Take-Off and Landing designs with <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> in the fuselage or in wing-mounted pods, but eventually they settled on a straight-winged tri-jet carrying 20 to 25 passengers.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe XFV- 12 A {{is a high}} performance, VTOL, fighter/attack aircraft which incorporates ejectors in the wings and canards for thrust augmentation. During transition from VTOL to normal flight, the interaction between downflow of the <b>lifting</b> <b>jets</b> and relative flow from forward flight generates vortices distinct from airfoil circulation. These vortices {{are associated with the}} bending of the <b>lifting</b> <b>jets</b> resulting in induced velocities at the aircraft; the magnitude and influence of the vortices are unknown. The object of this thesis was to prepare a suitable one-tenth scale semi-span model of the XFV- 12 A for a smoke tunnel flow visualization study to explore vortex development. Performance testing was conducted on the canard augmentor, which resulted in a gross augmentation ratio of 1. 34 and mass flow ratio of 6. 84.

40|$|Abstract—The authors examine three {{different}} types of plasma discharges {{in their ability to}} stabilize a <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> diffusion flame in coflow. The three discharges include a single-electrode corona discharge, an asymmetric dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD), and a repetitive ultrashort-pulsed discharge. The degree of nonequi-librium of this pulsed discharge is found to be higher than that for the DBD. Furthermore, this pulsed discharge causes the most significant improvement in the flame stability. The optimal place-ment of the discharge electrodes is investigated, and it is found that there is a close relation between this placement and the emis-sion spectra, suggesting use of the emission spectra as a possible indicator of fuel/air mixture fraction. The optimal placement is mapped into mixture-fraction space by use of a fully premixed flame experiment of known mixture fraction. The result shows that the mixture fraction, which corresponds to the optimal placement, is much leaner than that of a conventional <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> flame. Index Terms—Diffusion, discharge, flame stabilization, lifted, nonequilibrium. I...|$|R
50|$|To use <b>jet</b> {{power for}} <b>lift,</b> the impracticality of tail-sitting meant it was {{necessary}} for the aircraft to take off and land vertically while still in a horizontal attitude. Solutions tried included lifting fans (typically buried in the wings), swivelling engine pods similar in concept to the convertiplane, dedicated lightweight <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> or turbofans, thrust-vectoring by deflecting the jet exhaust as needed, and various combinations of these.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{take-off}} lift {{was obtained}} by exhausting the engine flow downward through multiple nozzles. The nozzle thrust was augmented by a secondary flow of cold air. Unfortunately, its performance was far below the estimates, with only 1.04 thrust-to-weight ratio in practice; while the prototype crashed on 10 June 1964, killing the pilot. The second aircraft was converted to <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> instead, also crashing after several tests.|$|R
50|$|Of a squat {{and compact}} design for {{mounting}} vertically, the RB.108 differed from conventional turbojet engines in having its bearings and oil system designed for prolonged {{operation in the}} vertical attitude. First bench-tested in 1955 by Alan A. Griffith, who had conceived {{the idea of a}} specialised <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> in 1941, thrust was 2,130 lbf (966.15 kg) from a weight of 269 lb (122 kg), giving a thrust/weight ratio of 8:1.|$|R
50|$|Like the Yak-141, the Yak-43 {{would have}} had only a single main engine, {{as well as two}} {{dedicated}} vertical-lift engines. The main engine would have been based on the Samara NK-321 three-shaft augmented turbofan with a takeoff rating of 24,980 kg (55,077 lb). This same engine is used to power the Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack bomber. The engine {{would have had}} a large air bleed leading to an auxiliary combustion chamber located in the nose, though a separate <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> would have been retained.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the British MoD and the US DoD both {{conducted}} studies into <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> solutions. The US studies {{eventually led}} to the F-35 Lightning II. In 1988 the Tornado-sized P.125 design was intended to meet the requirements for a supersonic stealthy STOVL interdictor. There were to be non-STOVL and STOVL variants of the P.125. Both had a single reheated (afterburning) turbofan with a vectorable rear nozzle. The STOVL variant would have maintained vertical flight using three <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> nozzles. The pilot of the P.125 would have sat highly reclined and would not have had direct sight of the outside world. In the 1990s the UK government decided to join the JSF (now F-35) programme rather than continue the P.125.|$|R

The A.W.171 design was a very slender delta flying wing powered by two Bristol Orpheus turbojets mounted at the wingtips, with 10 Rolls-Royce RB.108 <b>lift</b> <b>jets.</b> The pilot was to lie in a prone position to minimise drag.
