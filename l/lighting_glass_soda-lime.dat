The charge-free zone (CFZ) model proposed by Zhang et al. {{for the failure of}} conductive cracks in dielectrics, which was well verified by Wang’s experimental results of depoled piezoelectric ceramics PZT 4 and extended by Liu’s experimental results predicting the failure behavior of conductive cracks in piezoelectric ceramics, was applied as a failure criterion to the dielectric breakdown study of <b>Soda-Lime</b> <b>Glass</b> and PMMA. Experiments can use the failure criterion (CFZ model) to study the failure behavior of electrically conductive cracks (deep notches) in <b>Soda-Lime</b> <b>Glass,</b> but it is not suitable for PMMA from recent test results.

40|$|AbstractA {{comparative}} Vickers indentation {{study is}} made of two <b>glasses,</b> <b>soda-lime</b> and borosilicate. Indentations in the two glasses reveal substantially shorter radial cracks in the borosilicate, even though toughness values measured by conventional (double-cantilever beam) methods are similar in the two glasses. Here, indentation toughness is measured in two ways: by optical measurement of the indentation crack lengths (ICL) and by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement of crack-opening displacements (COD) in the near-crack-tip regions. The ICL measurements indicate artificially high values for the borosilicate relative to the soda-lime, consistent with previously documented indentation results. The COD measurements indicate similar values for the two glasses, in line with expectations from the independent determinations. In the case of <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass,</b> the COD and ICL values are mutually consistent. In the case of borosilicate, the COD and ICL values differ widely, indicating “anomalous” indentation behavior, typical of glasses with open, network-former structures. It is concluded that the COD route provides more reliable evaluations of intrinsic toughness, albeit at some expense in experimental simplicity. Residual elastic–plastic contact stresses responsible for driving the radial cracks, deconvoluted from COD measurements over the entire radial crack lengths, are shown to be significantly smaller in the borosilicate relative to soda-lime, indicative of a compaction rather than volume-conserving contact deformation mode...|$|R
