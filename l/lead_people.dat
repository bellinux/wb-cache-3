25|$|Only {{the third}} {{approach}} promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become {{upset about the}} disruptive state and thus change their current pattern {{to cope with the}} issue. The first and second approaches <b>lead</b> <b>people</b> to adopt the victim role by blaming others and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.|$|E

The book {{explains how}} the human unconscious interprets events or cues and how past experiences can <b>lead</b> <b>people</b> {{to make informed}} decisions very rapidly, using examples like the Getty kouros and psychologist John Gottman's research on the likelihood of divorce in married couples. Gladwell's hair was the inspiration for Blink. He stated that he started to get speeding tickets all the time, an oddity considering that he had never gotten one before, and that he started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention. In a particular incident, he was accosted by three police officers while walking in downtown Manhattan, because his curly hair matched the profile of a rapist, {{despite the fact that the}} suspect looked nothing like him otherwise.|$|E

25|$|According {{to modern}} Feminists, {{women and girls}} {{are more prone to}} {{trafficking}} also because of social norms that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also <b>lead</b> <b>people</b> to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma, further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.|$|E

500|$|In 1997 American poet Frank Bidart wrote Desire, {{which was}} another retelling {{of the myth}} of Myrrha as it was {{presented}} in the Metamorphoses by Ovid. The case of Myrrha, critic Langdon Hammer notes, is the worst possible made against desire, because the story of Myrrha shows how sex can <b>lead</b> <b>people</b> to destroy others as well as themselves. He comments that [...] "the [...] "precious bitter resin" [...] into which Myrrha's tears are changed tastes bitter and sweet, like Desire as a whole". He further writes: [...] "The inescapability of desire makes Bidart's long story of submission to it a kind of affirmation. Rather than aberrant, the Ovidian characters come to feel exemplary".|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Zacharias {{was invited}} to speak in Amsterdam at the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's annual evangelists' conference. It was here that he first noticed a lack of {{ministry}} {{in the area of}} Christian apologetics. After Amsterdam, Zacharias spent the summer evangelizing in India, where he continued to see the need for apologetics ministry, both to <b>lead</b> <b>people</b> to Christ and to train Christian leaders. In August 1984 Ravi Zacharias International Ministries was founded in Toronto, Canada to pursue his calling as a [...] "classical evangelist in the arena of the intellectually resistant." [...] Today its headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia, and has offices in Canada, India, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Hong Kong, Romania, Turkey, Austria, Spain, and South Africa. He was later ordained by the Christian and Missionary Alliance and commissioned as an international evangelist.|$|E
500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can <b>lead</b> <b>people</b> to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E

If more challenging tasks provide more accurate information about ability, people who care about and who are risk averse over their perception of their ability will choose tasks that are not sufficiently challenging.
