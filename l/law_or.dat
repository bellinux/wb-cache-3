5|$|Before a {{bill passed}} by the {{legislative}} Houses can become law, the royal assent (the monarch's approval) is required. In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill <b>law)</b> <b>or</b> withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.|$|E
5|$|Legal studies {{advanced}} {{during the}} 12th century. Both secular law and canon <b>law,</b> <b>or</b> ecclesiastical law, were {{studied in the}} High Middle Ages. Secular <b>law,</b> <b>or</b> Roman law, was advanced greatly by {{the discovery of the}} Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at Bologna. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law—the Decretum.|$|E

5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based his decisions on the advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as <b>law</b> <b>or</b> be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E
