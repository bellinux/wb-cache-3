5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and <b>legal</b> <b>section</b> in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, {{wanted to have a}} strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 made it hard to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E

40|$|Teorija prava Marijana Pavčnika može biti poticaj za uočavanje i ispravljanje jednostranosti hrvatske teorije prava jer je monistična po tome što je sinteza ranijih teorija, pretpostavlja normativnu metodu kao temeljnu metodu spoznaje prava i drži da sve pravo pripada jednome jedinome pravnom poretku. Marijan Pavčnik’s Legal Theory is an {{outstanding}} work on the foundations of law written by an internationally renowned author. It is of special relevance to Croatian readers as an incentive to recognize and rectify the one-sidedness of Croatian legal theory. The function of history as theory in Croatian <b>legal</b> thought (<b>section</b> 1. 1) explains why the Croatian mainstream legal theory has adopted an integral conception of law but leaned towards sociologization and even fully fledged naturalization of <b>legal</b> science (<b>section</b> 1. 2) with consequences for both <b>legal</b> education (<b>section</b> 1. 3) and <b>legal</b> practice (<b>section</b> 1. 4). Analytical legal theory, which is preoccupied with the objective meaning of law-creating acts {{is typical of the}} Slovenian tradition (section 2. 1), within which Pavčnik has written his <b>Legal</b> Theory (<b>section</b> 2. 2). The following tenets of Pavčnik’s Legal Theory, which are typically analytical and – {{in one way or another}} – monistic, are instructive for Croatian legal theory: a sound legal theory is monistic in that it is a historical synthesis rather than an original creation that ignores or bypasses earlier theories (section 2. 2. 1); law is a meaning of social action that can be recognized by the normative method, which is monistic in so far as other methods can change and amend but not replace it (section 2. 2. 2); law is monistic in that there can be only one single <b>legal</b> order (<b>section</b> 2. 2. 4). Despite the differences, Croatian and Slovenian legal theory may have more in common by both being rooted, Croatian via general legal history and Slovenian via Kelsen’s pure theory, in Hegel’s philosophy...|$|R
