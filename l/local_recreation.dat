25|$|William Henry Copson {{was born}} in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, and became a miner. Like his fellow bowler, Thomas Mitchell, he was a cricketing product of the 1926 General Strike. He took no {{interest}} in cricket until the Strike, when some fellow miners persuaded him to join in cricket on the <b>local</b> <b>recreation</b> ground while they were absent from work. His ability as a bowler of considerable pace and exceptional straightness, who made the batsmen play every ball was clearly revealed. In the next season {{he was given a}} place in the Morton Colliery team and, from there, he progressed to Clay Cross club in the Derbyshire League, and his success was such that Derbyshire engaged him in 1932.|$|E
25|$|Geauga Lake is an {{abandoned}} theme park in Bainbridge Township and Aurora, Ohio, United States. Established in 1887 {{in what had}} been a <b>local</b> <b>recreation</b> area adjacent to a lake of the same name, the first amusement ride was added in 1889, and the park's first roller coaster later known as the Big Dipper was built in 1925. In 1969, the park was sold to Funtime, Inc., and was expanded over the years with additional rides and amenities. Further expansion occurred in the mid and late 1990s after Funtime's acquisition by Premier Parks in 1995. Prior to the 2000 season, soon after Premier Parks acquired Six Flags, the park was re-branded as Six Flags Ohio and four new roller coasters were added. A year later, Six Flags bought the adjacent SeaWorld Ohio and combined the two parks under the name Six Flags Worlds of Adventure.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} leisure is {{subjective}} and contradictory, therefore attempts to organise, manage and measure leisure experiences may {{be described as}} paradoxical. The evaluation of recreation and leisure services {{has been focused on}} performance indicators associated with specific programmes and facilities. At a macro level, evaluation from the broader perspectives of organisational effectiveness and leisure theory is a neglected area of research. This study examines a model of organisational effectiveness criteria as a way of exploring the "leisure management paradox" in <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services. The focus of the research was <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services in Western Australia. This study had two major purposes. The first purpose was to identify a range of criteria that are appropriate for evaluating organisational effectiveness in <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services. Secondly, the study investigated the perceptions of these criteria held by recreation staff in different <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services in Western Australia. The specific research objectives focused on the issues of effectiveness in <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services, namely: 1. To identify criteria for organisational effectiveness relevant to <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services in Westem Australia. 2. To develop a conceptual model of organisational effectiveness criteria. 3. To test the developed model to confirm the appropriateness of the selected criteria for assessing <b>local</b> government <b>recreation</b> services. 4. To determine if there are differences in the perceptions of organisational effectiveness held by different groups of recreation workers in different types of local government settings. The findings revealed that perceptions of the importance of organisational effectiveness criteria held by <b>recreation</b> workers in <b>local</b> government in Western Australia are relatively homogeneous. ++Differences appeared to be associated with geographic location, availability of resources, and the perceived organisational culture of the local government authority. These findings offer a practical framework for managers of recreation services and provide a benchmark for further research in <b>local</b> government and <b>recreation</b> services generally...|$|R

500|$|The {{original}} designation in {{the area}} of Netcong along Route183's alignment is State Highway Route 31, which consisted much of the alignment of current-day U.S. Route 206. The route was first assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering as a co-designation to US 206. This alignment remained in place for about two and half decades, when in the 1953 state highway renumbering, the State Highway Route 31 designation was dropped in favor of using U.S. Route 206. The route in Netcong stayed the same for several years after the decommissioning until the Regional Plan Association proposed a freeway realignment of US 206 in 1962. [...] The highway was to serve <b>local</b> <b>recreation</b> areas and relieve traffic on Interstate 287 to the east. The route was advocated through 1972, and after the fiscal year budgets went sour, the proposal was dropped.|$|E

2500|$|Women {{also took}} on new roles {{in sport and}} entertainment, which opened to them {{as more and more}} men were drafted. The All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League [...] was the {{creation}} of Chicago Cubs owner Philip Wrigley, who sought alternative ways to expand his baseball franchise as top male players left for military service. In 1943, he created an eight team League in small industrial cities around the Great Lakes; team names included the Kenosha Comets, the Rockford Peaches, and the Fort Wayne Daisies. Night games offered affordable, patriotic entertainment to working Americans who had flocked to wartime jobs in the Midwest hubs of Chicago and Detroit (although better paid than in the prewar Depression, most industrial war workers were on gas and tire rationing, limiting them to <b>local</b> <b>recreation</b> options.) The League provided a novelty entertainment of girls who played hardball as well as men, executing traditional baseball skills of sliding and double-plays while wearing short, feminine uniform skirts. Players as young as fifteen were recruited from farm families and urban industrial teams, chaperoned on the road and subject to strict rules of behavior that included mandatory makeup and feminine hair styling, no drinking or smoking, no swearing, no fraternization with men, and no wearing pants in public; moreover, the League only recruited white players. Fans supported the League {{to the extent that it}} continued well past the conclusion of the war, lasting through 1953. During the 1980s, the League was formally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, and became the subject of a popular mainstream film directed by Penny Marshall, A League of their Own.|$|E

2500|$|Ian Botham {{was born}} on 24 November 1955 in Heswall, on the Wirral, to Herbert Leslie ("Les") Botham and Violet Marie, [...] Collett. Ian's father {{had been in the}} Fleet Air Arm for twenty years {{spanning}} the Second World War; his mother was a nurse. The family moved to Yeovil before Ian's third birthday after his father got a job as a test engineer at Westland Helicopters. Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at Sherborne. Ian developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb through the fence of the Yeovil Boys' Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket. At the age of around four, he came home with a cricket ball and asked his mother [...] "Do you know how to hold a ball when you're going to bowl a daisy-cutter?" [...] He subsequently demonstrated the grip and went away to practise bowling it. He attended Milford Junior School in the town and it was there that his [...] "love affair" [...] with sport began. He played both cricket and football for the school's teams at the age of nine; two years earlier than most of his contemporaries. Playing against the older boys forced Botham to learn to hit the ball hard, and improve to their standard. At the same age he went to matches with his father, who played for Westland Sports Club, and if one of the teams was short, he would try to get a match. His father recalled that though he never got to bowl, and rarely got to bat, he received praise for the standard of his fielding. He joined the Boys' Brigade where more sporting opportunities were available. By the time he was nine, he had begun to [...] "haunt" [...] <b>local</b> <b>recreation</b> grounds with his kit always ready, looking to play for any team that was short of players. By the age of twelve he was playing occasional matches for Yeovil Cricket Club's second team.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{the liberal}} {{fulfilment}} of their promise {{in the new}} house in the suburbs blinded the young girls' eyes to their shortcomings in the town. Their own remoteness and elevation above its feverish life kept them from the knowledge of much that was strange, and perhaps disturbing to their equanimity. As they did not mix with the immigrant women--Miss Jessie's good-natured intrusion into one of their half-nomadic camps one day having been met with rudeness and suspicion--they gradually fell into the way of trusting the responsibility of new acquaintances to {{the hands of their}} original hosts, and of consulting them in the matter of <b>local</b> <b>recreation.</b> It thus occurred that one day the two girls, {{on their way to the}} main street for an hour's shopping at the Villa de Paris and Variety Store, were stopped by Dick Mattingly a few yards from their house, with the remark that, as the county election was then in progress, it would be advisable for them to defer their intention for a few hours. As he did not deem it necessary to add that two citizens, in the exercise of a freeman's franchise, had been supplementing their ballots with bullets, in front of an admiring crowd, they knew nothing of that accident that removed from Devil's Ford an entertaining stranger, who had only the night before partaken of their hospitality.|$|E
