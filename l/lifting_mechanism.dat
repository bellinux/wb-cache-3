5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} change in {{deploying}} time of an active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a passenger vehicle activated by a gunpowder actuator. Especially, in this work, the deploying time is investigated by changing the principal design parameters of the hinge part of the hood mechanism. After briefly introducing the working principle of the active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> operated by the gunpowder actuator, the governing dynamic equations of the active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> are formulated for deploying motion. Subsequently, using the governing equations of motion, the response time for deploying the hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is investigated by changing several geometric locations such as the location of actuator. Then, a comparison is made of the total response time to completely deploy the hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> with the existing conventional hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the proposed active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In addition, the workable driving speed of the proposed active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is compared with the conventional one by changing the powder volume of the actuator...|$|R

25|$|The {{management}} of Kent International Airport (formerly RAF Manston) donated a Pickett-Hamilton fort to Lashenden Air Warfare Museum. Although {{most of the}} surviving forts are flooded, the fort at Manston was dry and in superb condition. The fort was excavated and restored to working order by museum members {{over a period of}} 18 months. Although the fort was originally intended to be buried on an airfield there was concern that putting it in the ground might, over time, degrade the concrete. Therefore, the fort has been placed at ground level and surrounded with a cone of earth and sandbags. The <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is in working order and can be activated by visitors putting a coin into a slot. This is the only fully restored Pickett-Hamilton fort.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, the <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{consisted}} of a standard 8-ton aeroplane jack that took three minutes to raise the fort.

A hand pump was also provided to raise the fort for daily maintenance or as a backup method.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original continuously variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{designed for the}} automotive spark ignition engines. The paper first presents the analytical kinematic synthesis of the variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which consists in finding out the required intake cam profile starting from an imposed intake valve lift law. Then, by using the obtained cam profile, a computer-aided kinematic analysis of the variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is performed using commercial CAD software. The accuracy of the motion conversion performed with CAD software is validated by checking the degree of correlation between the resulted intake valve lift law and the imposed law used when performing the analytical synthesis. The goals of the kinematic analysis are first to find the partial laws of the intake valve lift, corresponding to the engine part loads and second, to find the transfer functions of the elements used to command the mechanism, i. e. the dependency between these elements and the intake valve lift law. The designed variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is successfully operated on an engine prototype and proved its energetic improvement potential...|$|R

The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|E
2500|$|Searchlights {{were first}} used at Viapori during the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, {{and they were}} {{originally}} intended for guarding the controlled mine barriers. During the First World War fortified searchlight positions {{were part of the}} coastal forts. The main line of defence had larger two [...] searchlights at Rysäkari and Kuivasaari and an additional six smaller [...] searchlights beside them and on the other islands. Miessaari 150cm searchlight position was not completed during the war. In the second line 150cm searchlights were used on Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari, while other forts had [...] or [...] searchlights. Diesel generators provided the necessary electrical power to operate the searchlights. Searchlights were used in disappearing positions, where the searchlight was normally in a shelter and only exposed when needed for illumination. The disappearing positions had two types: either the searchlight was raised from the shelter by a <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> or it was moved by rails from the shelter to position.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} other major road {{developments}} {{proposed by the}} Strategic Transport Study. Emersons Green, a rapidly expanding business and industrial suburb with a £300 million [...] "science park" [...] currently in development, could {{be connected to the}} M4, with a new junction where the motorway crosses the dismantled Midlands railway (ST689779) and a new road following the route of the railway to the A4174 roundabout (ST675771). [...] When St Philip's Causeway was built by Bristol Development Corporation in the 1980s, connecting the M32 in St Pauls to the A4 at Arno's Vale, it was originally intended {{to be part of a}} larger road scheme. A proposed Callington Road Link would extend the road along the route of the dismantled Radstock railway line to the A4174, with a junction on the A4. Bristol Airport has also been attracting increasing levels of transport to roads south of Bristol, and an Airport link has been discussed for several years. [...] Two schemes are suggested in the STS, both entirely new roads. [...] One route connects Junction 20 of the M5 at Clevedon to the west end of the Long Ashton bypass as a new [...] "Nailsea Bypass", coupled with an [...] "Orange Route" [...] link from the Long Ashton bypass, approximately one kilometre from its west end, to the A38 at the B3130 junction. [...] The other route would run from the A38 just south of the airport, north of Wrington and south of Congresbury to the M5 at Weston-super-Mare. [...] The final major project proposal is a second Avonmouth Bridge. [...] This would be a lower level to the M5 bridge, with a swing or <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> to the West of the existing bridge, and would relieve the motorway of the local traffic it carries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is testing the force of green energy <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> and {{analyzes}} its result to get the key technology for green energy (saving force and energy). At first, the green energy <b>lift</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the market are surveyed, then the mechanism are analyzed in this study. The force balance system of the mechanism is used to save force and energy. The position limitation of saving force and energy for the force balance system will be investigated. Universal testing machine is used to test the driving force by the different loads during the <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> moving downward. The tested results of the driving force will be estimated. The study results show that the loads influence significantly the driving force. The angle between pulley and wire is the key factor of the driving force...|$|R

But such load lifting platforms are very dangerous and might overturn since equipments’ stiffness is low. Also these load lifting platforms are very heavy. The main reason is when mechanism is in the built-up condition its state is close to singularity, that is why it is very big on reactions of kinematical chains, the value of balancing force is very high.
