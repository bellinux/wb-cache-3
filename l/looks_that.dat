5|$|The Marble Index is {{the second}} solo album and third studio album by German {{musician}} Nico, which was released in November 1968 on Elektra Records. The avant-garde sound introduced in the album—a stark contrast with her folk pop debut, Chelsea Girl—was {{the result of the}} combination of Nico's droning harmonium and somber vocals, and producer John Cale's musical arrangements, which were inspired by modern European classical music. Nico envisioned the release as an attempt to get artistic legitimacy, thus also drastically changing the <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> had initially made her famous as a fashion model.|$|E

25|$|A temple (aedes) of Juno Lucina {{was built}} in 375 BC in the grove sacred to the goddess from early times.

25|$|The arrow is an {{ambivalent}} symbol; it {{was used}} in the ritual of the devotio (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow). It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with Robigus and Averruncus. The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the asylum of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and May 21, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the arx.

The answer is no one, because she’s Kim Poss-ib-le." [...] The same website also included the character in its article [...] "Disney Redheads: An Appreciation Post". Kim is also regarded as a fashion trendsetter, with Charmaine Simmons of Bustle crediting the character with popularizing [...] "all of the stylish <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> we never knew we'd {{be in love with}} over 10 years later", including crop tops, cargo pants and bodysuits.

[...] Freymiller concluded, [...] "In the early 2000s, as Limited Too dominated the tween fashion scene, it was refreshing to see a girl decked out in functional black and army green attire." [...] The character's Kimmunicator ringtone is commonly associated with the series, and is also frequently imitated by fans. The Kimmunicator's inception preceded the creation of smartphones by several years. Upon Apple's release of the Apple Watch, several critics drew similarities between the real-life device and the Kimmunicator, especially when Kim's device was downsized to a wristwatch during the final season.|$|E
500|$|Elaborating on the series' costumes, Carol Case, {{who also}} served as costume {{designer}} on Fargo, explained that she [...] "didn’t want anyone to be too locked into that 60s feel, because we were ultimately going for a ‘no period’ look." [...] Case took the series' color palette from [...] "60s rock bands—the golds and yellows and oranges and greens ... Noah said {{he wanted it to}} look like David was rescued by The Kinks". She then assigned colors from that palette to each lead character: Barrett wears orange and black; Carry and Kerry Loudermilk wear mostly navy and tan; Melanie Bird wear beige and pastel colors to [...] "convey her role as a caretaker"; and Haller wears different blues and greys, though his palette was [...] "more open than others’, given that his character {{is a bit of a}} work in progress." [...] Case sourced clothing from various vintage stores, but created other pieces from scratch, including all of the costumes worn by Katie Aselton which [...] "are more deeply rooted in the Swinging Sixties aesthetic than others." [...] The pink beanies worn by members of Division 3 were knitted by Case's sister and her friends for the series. Case deliberately avoided referencing any costumes from the comics [...] "to take this story out of where people think it sits". For the patients of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, Case initially used [...] "a bunch of space-age-y <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> didn’t feel right", before settling on tracksuits with exaggerated collars to give them a [...] "futuristic feel". The orange tracksuits include colored stripes to indicate the seriousness of each patient's diagnosis, ranging from white stripes for Barrett ("which puts her in the ‘least crazy’ category"), to yellow stripes for [...] "moderate" [...] Haller, and red stripes for Busker which [...] "basically means she’s never getting out of there." [...] Busker's costumes evolve throughout the series to reflect her changing role, going from the orange and red focus to black and [...] "businessy" [...] clothes to show that [...] "She’s got a job to do, and she’s determined to do it." [...] Her design then become [...] "unhinged"; eventually she wears a twizzler as a collar bar, after being seen eating them throughout the season.|$|E

Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E

GameSpy's Chau wrote that in DOA3, [...] "Kasumi's got some very good long-range attacks; combined with her speed and she's able to hit opponents from a good distance away," [...] especially since many of her attacks can stun with one hit, allowing her [...] "to deliver her great punch and kick combinations, regarded by some as being the best in the game," [...] that are exceptionally dangerous since many of them end in a powerful launching attack. In addition, [...] "to balance her great speed and superb punch-kick combination game, Kasumi also can throw with the best of them." [...] Chau opined Kasumi is a good tag team partner for any fighter, but in particular for Ryu, Bass, Helena and Ayane. GamesRadar US recommended that DOA3 [...] "beginners should start with Kasumi because she's got some nice combos". According to Bryan Dawson in Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive 4, this game's Kasumi is [...] "faster than ever" [...] and her techniques have been modified considerably; she was ranked overall 8/10, while her clone Alpha-152 was ranked 10/10.

[...] Dean James from Attack of the Fanboy recommended her especially [...] "for those who haven’t played the series in the past and are just starting with Dead or Alive 5 Last Round" [...] for her [...] "probably the most balanced setup in the series." ...|$|E
