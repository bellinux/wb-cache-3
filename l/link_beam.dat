The paper {{presents}} the nonlinear {{finite element analysis}} for K-shape eccentrically braced steel frames on <b>link</b> <b>beam.</b> The analysis indicates that the strength, rigidity, ductility and energy-dissipation performance of K shape eccentrically braced steel frames deteriorate differently with the length increase of <b>link</b> <b>beam.</b> The shorter the <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> is, the larger plastic deformation of it, which will make plastic collapse easily while long <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> has poor cyclic behavior.

40|$|Eccentrically {{braced frame}} (EBF) {{is a highly}} {{effective}} seismic-resistant structural system when properly designed. However, permanent drift of EBFs after design basis earthquakes may affect the structure’s continuous occupancy and seismic retrofit can be very costly. To address the resilience issues such as uninterrupted use even after strong earthquakes, self-centering behavior is incorporated into EBF through post-tensioning to develop the self-centering eccentrically braced frame (SC-EBF) system. Post-tensioned connections are formed at the interfaces between rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> and EBF beams using post-tensioned (PT) tendons. Gaps are allowed to open at these post-tensioned connections in strong earthquakes; and can be firmly closed under the re-centering force of the PT tendons. The columns, beams, braces, and the rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> are designed to behave elastic under the design basis earthquake. Therefore, no residual drift is expected {{to occur in the}} SC-EBF system and damage is concentrated to replaceable fuse members under the design basis earthquake. The proposed SC-EBF system provides a competitive design option in high seismic hazard regions with its self-centering behavior, stiffness and strength comparable to conventional EBF structural systems, and tunable energy dissipation capacity provided by conveniently replaceable fuse devices. The <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> which is welded or bolted to the beams of the conventional EBF system is replaced by the rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam.</b> Self-centering behavior is observed in all the investigated SC-EBF structures in this study. A nonlinear finite element analysis based parametric study is conducted on the SC-EBF systems with K-type or D-type EBF configurations. Effects of two key design parameters are evaluated: PT tendon area and the rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> length. To cope with the large link rotation demand, replaceable fuse devices in the SC-EBF systems are made of highly ductile AISI 316 L stainless steel and are designed to utilize the large deformation in the SC-EBF systems for energy dissipation during strong earthquakes. It is observed that the ductility of the SC-EBF with short rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> is generally lower than that of the SC-EBF with longer rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> if the same PT tendon length is used for both cases. To take advantage of the findings from both the SC-EBF system with short rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> and the SC-EBF with long rocking <b>link</b> <b>beam,</b> a modified design of the SC-EBF with two parallel short rocking link beams is proposed. Nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted on this modified SC-EBF system under cyclic loading, showing that this type of SC-EBF system exhibits improved self-centering performance, strength, ductility, and energy dissipation behaviors. The fuse members used for this type of SC-EBF system is redesigned and shows simple configuration, ease of fabrication and installation...|$|E

Then it has been substituted by a steel <b>link</b> <b>beam,</b> and the analyses have been repeated {{to find out the}} differences between the hysteretic behavior of the concrete <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> with that of the steel <b>link</b> <b>beam,</b> designed with the same loading. In the verified FEM 8 -node elastoplastic solid elements have been used. For the concrete link beams the material has been of ‘concrete damage plasticity’ type, and for the steel link beams the multi-linear elastoplastic material model has been used. The steel reinforcement bars in concrete elements have been modeled as ‘truss’ element. The steel link beams have been considered once without stiffeners and once with them to see how they improve its behavior. The embedded length of the steel link beams in the concrete walls has been considered long {{enough to be able to}} assume that no sliding occurs between the steel beam and its surrounding concrete. Numerical results show that in case of steel link beams the hysteretic loops does not show any pinching effect, and therefore these link beams are better in seismic energy absorption. The amount of energy absorption can be more than 3 times in comparison with the concrete link beams. Using stiffeners in the steel link beams does not have much effect on their hysteretic behavior, and add their energy absorption capacity only around 10 percent...|$|E

Bu amaçla tipik 10 katlı bir çelik binanın deprem kuvveti taşıyıcı sistemini oluşturan 5 tip dışmerkez çaprazlı çelik çerçeve farklı bağ kirişi teşkilleri için tasarlanmıştır. 3 boyutlu modellemesi SAP 2000 bilgisayar programında yapılan sistemlerin ASCE 7 - 10, AISC 360 - 10 ve AISC 341 - 10 'a göre analiz ve tasarımları gerçekleştirilmiştir. Daha sonrasında ise OpenSEES programı ile yapılan doğrusal olmayan statik itme (pushover) analizi sonucunda taban kesme ve tepe göreli kat öteleme değerleri kullanılarak grafikleri çizdirilen sistemlerin davranışları, kapasiteleri ve dayanım fazlalığı katsayıları (overstrength factor) karşılaştırılmıştır. Literatür araştırmasına (Bölüm 2) bakıldığında bugüne kadar yapılmış akademik çalışmalarda ele alınan sistemler belirli tipteki dışmerkez çelik çaprazlı çerçevelerle sınırlı kalmıştır. Bu sebepten bu tezde farklı sistemler üzerine çalışılması akademik açıdan önem arz etmektedir. Dışmerkez çaprazlı çelik çerçeve modellerini belirlerken AISC 341 - 10 'da yapılan dışmerkez tanımı etkili olmuştur. Dışmerkez çaprazlı çelik çerçevelerde bağ kirişinin akma sınır durumuna ulaşması; kayma etkisiyle, eğilme ve kesme kuvvetinin ortak etkisiyle, eğilme momentinin etkisiyle olmak üzere üç şekilde gerçekleşir. Bu çalışmada plastik şekildeğiştirmelerin kayma etkisinde meydana gelmesi durumuna göre modelleme yapılıp, sistemler tasarlanmıştır. Ayrıca eleman boyutlandırılmasına ikinci mertebe etkilerin dikkate alınması gerektiği AISC 360 - 10 'da ifade edilmektedir. İkinci mertebe etkiler büyütme katsayıları ile hesaba katılmış ve yönetmelikte belirtilen üç yöntemden biri olan etkili uzunluk yöntemi (burkulma katsayıları metodueffective length) kullanılmıştır. Kullanılan yükler düşey ve yatay yükler olarak ikiye ayrılmıştır. Düşey yük tanımının içinde sabit ve hareketli yükler bulunmaktadır. Bu yüklerden sabit yükler herhangi bir yönetmeliğe ihtiyaç duyulmaksızın tasarımda kullanılacak malzemelere göre belirlenebilirken hareketli yüklerin alt limitleri ASCE 7 - 10 tarafından belirlenmiştir. Yatay yük kapsamında ele alınan rüzgar ve deprem yükleri de ASCE 7 - 10 'a göre belirlenmiştir. Analiz sonucunda yapı düzensizliklerinden, stabilite faktörüne kadar yönetmelikte belirtilen ilgili tüm kontroller yapılmıştır. Dışmerkez çaprazlı çelik çerçevelerin boyutlandırılmasında bağ kiriş plastikleştiğinde bağ kirişi dışında kalan kiriş, kolon ve çaprazların elastik bölgede kalması beklenmektedir. Bu durumun sağlanabilmesi için bağ kirişi dışındaki elemanların üzerinde deprem etkisiyle oluşan kuvvetler, bağ kirişinin beklenen kesme kuvveti kapasitesinin deprem yükleri dolayısıyla bağ kirişi üzerinde oluşan kesme kuvvetine oranı nispetinde artırılmıştır. Kesitleri belirlenen sistemler OpenSEES programında modellenirken SAP 2000 'de kurulan modellere uygunluğu periyotların karşılaştırılması ile kontrol edilmiştir. Modellemenin ardından doğrusal olmayan statik itme analizi ile tüm sistemler için taban kesme kuvveti ve tepe noktasının göreli kat ötelemesi grafikleri ile sistem elemanları için istem/kapasite oranları elde edilmiştir. Kapasite, yerdeğiştirme, bağ kirişi plastik dönme açıları belirlenip karşılaştırmaları yapılmıştır. Five {{different}} {{samples of}} eccentrically braced frames by a vertical plane with {{a height of}} 30. 5 m and a length of 35 m at each direction in the horizontal plane were modeled using SAP 2000 computer program and analyzed and designed based on ASCE 7 - 10, AISC 360 - 10, and AISC 341 - 10. In determining the models, the same link length and all the loads, with no period effect were used to rule out potential effects of circumstances excluding the configuration. Then, based on the nonlinear pushover analysis via OpenSEES program, and using base shear- roof drift curves, the behaviors, capacity, and overstrength factors of these systems were compared. In {{the light of the}} literature review provided in Part 2, the systems defined in earlier studies have been limited to typical eccentrically braced frames. Thus, this study may provide important information on different systems. In describing the models of eccentrically braced frames, the definition of eccentricity in AISC 341 - 10 has been influential, and all the models have been based on this definition. Yielding of the <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> in eccentrically braced frame occurs in three forms due to variations in the elements; shear yielding, flexural yielding and combination of shear and flexural yielding. In this study, modeling was made according to shear yielding state and hence, the systems were designed. Length of the <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> is smaller than 1. 6 Mp/Vp, it is contained that the strain hardening effects of moment and shear capacity of the beam. Furthermore, AISC 360 - 10 advocates involvement of second order effects in element sizing. There are three types of design methods in AISC 360 - 10 : direct analysis method, effective length method and first-order analysis method. Second order effects were considered within amplification factors and one of the three methods, effective length method, has been used as described in the regulations. To be able to use this method, it was proven that the ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first order drift is less than 1. 5 for all type of eccentrically braced frame structures. Morover, all deformations (axial member, flexural member and shear member), uncertainity in stiffness and strength, stiffness reductions (residual stress and plasticity) and geometric imperfections were considered. According to AISC 360 - 10 the effective length factor,K, was taken as 1. 0 because of braced frames system. Initial imperfections were taken into account by applying notional loads as mentioned in the regulation (AISC 360 - 10). It is considered 0. 2 % of the total gravity load (LRFD) at each level. Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) and Allowable Stress Design (ASD) are the two methods which are presented by AISC. Load and resistance factor design approach was used. Load combinations were determined based on LRFD in ASCE 7 - 10. All connections of columns and braceds to their foundations are pinned. Braced to <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> connections are rigid (fixed). ASTM A 992 was used as a material. Secondary beams have pinned connections. Floor diaphragms are assumed and modeled as a rigid diaphragm without any discontinuities. The loads used have been categorized as horizontal and vertical. The definition of vertical load involves loads of dead and live. While the dead loads can be used based on the materials {{to be used in the}} design without a requirement for regulations, the lower limits of live loads are defined by ASCE 7 - 10. The calculations of earthquake and wind loads considered horizontal loads are also defined in the relevant sections of ASCE 7 - 10. All structures were thought in the same seismic and wind region, so all of the parameters related to wind and seismic calculation were assumed the same. 5 % additional eccentricity at each story was taken into account in 3 D analysis. Seismic design category was determined as E for the models. The earthquake loads contain 100 % of forces for one direction (x or y) plus 30 % of forces for another direction (y or x). Directional procedure was used for wind loads. Basic wind speed was determined from a given map in ASCE 7 - 10 and taken into account as a 100 mph. It was checked that displacements and second order effects are within the limits of the regulations based on the results of analyses. The definition of irregularities contains vertical and horizontal structural irregularities. Also, all irregularities which is defined in ASCE 7 - 10 were checked. Lateral load resisting systems have different energy dissipation mechanisms. In eccentrically braced frame which is one of the lateral load resisting systems, ductility and energy dissipation capacity depends on link beams. Inelastic deformation of <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> will be expected during an earthquake occurs, therefore plastic link rotation capacity is an important property of eccentrically braced frame structures. In sizing of the eccentrically braced frames, when the plasticity of <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> parts occur, the beam that remains outside the <b>link</b> <b>beam,</b> column, and braced are expected to remain in the elastic area. To ensure this, the forces that occur on the elements except <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> have been increased at ratio of expected shear capacity over shear force that develops on the <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> due to earthquake effects. Because of this, B 2 was equal to 1. Since all sections used as a column and braced have to ensure highly ductile section property, these sections were controlled in according to AISC 341 - 10. According to AISC 341 - 10 links whose length are smaller than 1. 6 Mp/Vp are permitted to meet moderately ductile members' section requirement. The <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> had been designed and its section had been determined. Then the expected shear capacity of the link was determined using with Ry, the ratio of expected yield strength to minimum specified yield strength, and ratio of expected shear capacity over shear force that develops on the <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> due to earthquake effects were determined. At the same time, columns' axial forces were estimated based on the failure mode of the structures. To built up nonlinear model in 3 D (6 degree of freedom); coordinate system was defined, and node coordinates of models were determined in this system. Material and section properties were defined. After determining which elements should be used, elements with convenient sections were defined by connecting the relevant nodes. Before the pushover loads had been defined, static vertical loads and mass were assigned. As the systems, the sections of which were determined, were modeled by OpenSEES computer program, their conformity to the model set by SAP 2000 computer program was checked by comparison of the periods. After model development, using nonlinear static pushover analysis, base shear- roof displacement curves for all the systems and demand/capacity ratios for system elements were obtained. Demand/capacity ratio of column and braced were determined under compression force and moment interaction. As a results, it occurred that some of link rotations are larger than 0. 08 rad which is determined by AISC 341 - 10. It had been observed in different academic studies before. As it has been assumed before, inelastic behavior of <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> was controlled by shear yielding and all parts of structures were remain elastic. Overstregth factors of these eccentrically braced frames were determined and compared to each other. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

30|$|A {{relatively}} new seismic structural system that combines BRBs, LBs and RRWs with GBRMFs has been introduced. The seismic {{behavior of the}} proposed RWMF can be characterized by the combined responses of the ductile MF and the supplementary devices. In addition to BRBs, both vertical as well as horizontal gap opening devices have been provided to ensure collapse prevention and active re-centering. PT provides restoring forces {{at the ends of}} the LBs and the RRW that tend to prevent catastrophic collapse and force the frame and the wall to return to their pre-earthquake positions. The proposed mathematical model lends itself well to SDOF treatment. Several theoretically exact formulae for the preliminary design of regular RWMFs have been presented. The proposed concepts lead to minimum weight solutions. A new gap opening LB that does not induce unwanted moments in the columns and causes no damage to the diaphragms has also been introduced. It has been shown that the magnitude of the LB gap opening {{is a function of the}} <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> offsets from the centerlines of its supporting walls or columns. In the interim two new classes of moment frames, MFUR and MFUS have also been introduced. It has been argued that the use of RRWs in conjunction with MFUR is counterproductive; in contrast the MFUS–RRW combination can lead to highly efficient earthquake-resisting buildings. While the accuracy of the proposed formulae has been verified by independent computer analysis, results may differ due to shear and axial strains, shrinkage and tendon relaxation, etc. The proposed structural scheme is still in its infancy and needs the test of time before being recognized as a viable earthquake-resisting system.|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly W. KramerDual Lateral Force Resisting Systems are {{currently}} required by code {{to include a}} Moment Resisting Frame capable of resisting at least 25 % of the lateral loads. This thesis evaluates the seismic performance of {{a specific type of}} dual system: a Special Moment Resisting Frame-Special Concentric Brace Frame System (SMRF-SCBF) under three different force distributions. The three distributions were 80 % - 20 %, 75 % - 25 %, and 70 % - 30 % with the lesser force being allotted to the Special Moment Resisting Frame (SMRF) portion of the system. In order to evaluate the system, a parametric study was performed. The parametric study consisted of three SMRF-SCBF systems designed with different seismic force distributions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine accuracy of the three different seismic force distributions. The accuracy was measured by comparing individual system models’ data and combined system models’ data. The data used for comparison included joint deflections (both horizontal and vertical), induced moments at moment connections, brace axial loads, column shears, and column base reactions. Two-dimensional models using the structural software RISA 3 D were used to assist in designing the independent Seismic Force Resisting Systems. The designs of the frames were not finely tuned (smallest member size for strength), but were designed for drift (horizontal deflection) requirements and constructability issues. Connection designs were outside the scope of the study, except for constructability considerations – the SMRF and the SCBF did not have a common column; the frames were a bay apart connected with a <b>link</b> <b>beam.</b> The results indicated that a seismic force distribution of 75 % to the SCBF and 25 % to the SMRF most accurately predicts that frame’s behavior. A force distribution of 80 % to the SCBF and 20 % to the SMRF resulted in moderately accurate results as well. A vast opportunity for further research into this area of study exists. Alterations to the design process, consideration of wind loads, or additional force distributions are all recommended changes for further research into this topic...|$|E

These systems, Directed InfraRed CounterMeasures (DIRCM), detect the incoming missile and direct modulated infrared energy, {{in the form of a}} laser beam, on to the missile sensor to disrupt the missile’s guidance. The defence system works well in laboratory settings, and through normal atmosphere, but effects of a highly aberrant propagation path on the laser beam’s temporal and spatial quality need to be considered. In particular, scenarios may arise where the laser beam must pass through the hot, turbulent gases of the engine exhaust, the plume. Some initial system studies highlight the problem but have not reported on the individual effects of the various laser and flow parameters in this high temperature, high turbulence environment. Furthermore, laser beam propagation has traditionally been studied at atmospheric temperatures and often in the visible spectrum to support geodesy. The thesis incorporates a system level study in collaboration with the Defence Science Technology Organisation, Australia, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories, UK. The study showed general properties of the propagation but did not allow detailed analysis of the effect of the various flow and beam parameters on the laser beam propagation. To further contribute to the knowledge in this field, the thesis took a novel approach to the study of laser beam propagation by using an experimental apparatus to produce high temperature, high turbulent flows in the laboratory for the purpose of studying the laser beam degradation while controlling flow and beam parameters. This approach allowed the individual effects of flow and beam parameters; such as turbulence intensity, eddy scales, species concentration, wavelength, beam diameter and temperature, to be isolated analysed. High temperature turbulent flows were generated by combusting a lean mixture of hydrogen and air, while applying perforated plates of various hole diameters and blockage ratios to the jet nozzle to condition the flow. The resulting flow was traversed by 632. 8 nm and 4. 67 μm wavelength laser beams of varying beam diameter. The resultant laser beam was recorded using visible and infrared detecting focal plane array cameras. The temporal and spatial properties of the propagated beams were analysed and linked to the flow conditions. The flow was characterised in terms of integral length scale and turbulence intensity using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) as the diagnostic tool. The study found temperature, eddy size, beam diameter and wavelength to be parameters that significantly affected the laser beam propagation. For example, the beam displacement, for both wavelengths, was found to increase as the beam diameter was decreased, closely following the inverse third root of the beam diameter. Further, there was a difference in beam displacement related to wavelength. It was found that the 632. 8 nm beam would need to be 8 / 7 ths times greater in diameter than the 4. 67 μm beam to produce the same beam displacement variance. The experiment has extended the data range used to develop existing models and has allowed correlations to be observed at the higher temperatures found typically in jet engine plumes. These results show existing models that <b>link</b> <b>beam</b> diameter and wavelength to beam displacement at these higher temperatures are still valid. The role of path length, although seen to be significant, was not able to be quantified using the experimental set-up, while the presence of carbon dioxide was found through theory and measurement to not be significant at the wavelengths studied. A significant finding of the work has been the quantifying of the effects of high temperature on laser beam propagation. New data has provided correlations between beam displacement and temperature. The change in the increase in beam displacement variance with high temperature was found to be related to the inverse square of temperature. Beam displacement variance tended towards an asymptote at around 600 °C for both wavelengths studied. However it was notable that the beam displacement variance was found to be related to wavelength, with the visible beam exhibiting a notably greater variance than the infrared beam at temperatures above 400 °C. The new correlations have shown beam displacement models need to represent the effects of wavelength. This is required for the displacement variance to be correctly modelled as the temperatures increase to levels found in a jet engine plume. Measurements also showed that as temperature increased, mean and variance of the spot size and the irradiance variance all increased. This data is reported in the thesis and can be used to estimate the energy being directed onto the sensor of an incoming missile under various flow conditions. The findings and approach presented in this thesis has meant the impact of hot turbulent exhaust flows on the propagation of the DIRCM laser beam can be confidently predicted under a range of conditions. These results provide certainty for those designing DIRCM systems. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Mechanical Engineering, 201...|$|E

The remarkable hysteresis behavior of shear links in EBFs is so appealing to seismic design that they have also been used in other types of structure applications such as fuse members that provides required ductility and energy dissipation. Therefore, using shear links {{is becoming more and}} more popular not only in buildings but also in bridges. In order to assure that shear links provide required strength and ductility of the structure, studying the effect of key parameters on hysteretic behavior of shear links is of interest. High axial load is one of the key parameters which affect hysteretic behavior of shear links because premature flange local buckling might occur and results in deterioration in shear capacity, ductility, and energy dissipation of the links. The effect of high axial load ratio on shear capacity and ductility of shear links is studied by numerical simulation in this research.

During the operation, these DCMs interact with surrounding anatomy actively or passively. The interaction force will inevitably affect the tip position and shape of DCMs, leading to potentially inaccurate control near critical anatomy. In this paper, we demonstrated a 2 D mechanical model for a tendon actuated, notched DCM with compliant joints. The model predicted deformation of the DCM accurately {{in the presence of}} tendon force, friction force, and external force. A partition approach was proposed to describe the DCM as a series of interconnected rigid and flexible <b>links.</b> <b>Beam</b> mechanics, taking into consideration tendon interaction and external force on the tip and the body, was applied to obtain the deformation of each flexible link of the DCM. The model results were compared with experiments for free bending as well as bending in the presence of external forces acting at either the tip or body of the DCM. The overall mean error of tip position between model predictions and all of the experimental results was 0. 62 ± 0. 41 mm.
