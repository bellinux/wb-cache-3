40|$|For amputees {{to perform}} an {{everyday}} task, or to participate in physical exercise, {{it is crucial that}} they have an appropriately designed and functional prosthesis. Past studies of transfemoral amputee gait have identified several limitations in the performance of amputees and in their prosthesis when compared with able-bodied walking, such as asymmetrical gait, slower walking speed, and higher energy demands. In particular the different <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the prosthesis relative to the sound limb results in a longer swing time for the prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether this longer swing time could be addressed by modifying the alignment of the prosthesis. The following hypothesis was tested: Can the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the prosthesis be improved by lowering the prosthetic knee joint, thereby producing a faster swing time? To test this hypothesis, a simple 2 -D mathematical model was developed to simulate the swing-phase motion of the prosthetic leg. The model applies forward dynamics to the measured hip moment of the amputee in conjunction with the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of prosthetic components to predict the swing-phase motion. To evaluate the model and measure any change in prosthetic function, we conducted a kinematic analysis on four Paralympic runners as they ran. When evaluated, there was no significant difference between predicted and measured swing time. Of particular interest was how swing time was affected by changes in the position of the prosthetic knee axis. The model suggested that lowering the axis of the prosthetic knee could reduce the longer swing time. This hypothesis was confirmed when tested on the amputee runners...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Inspection using {{machine vision}} offers the {{potential}} for improved food safety and quality. However, effectiveness of fruit inspection has been limited by the difficulty of appropriately orienting fruit for imaging. Commercial orientation systems have had limited impact due to mechanical complexity, cost, error, or some combination thereof. Preliminary tests demonstrated that apples could be oriented by rolling them down a track consisting of two parallel rails. After achieving sufficient angular velocity, the apples moved to an orientation where the stem/calyx axis was perpendicular to the direction of travel and parallel to {{the plane of the}} track. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether this orientation phenomenon could be explained in terms of the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of axially symmetric objects. Rotation of a free body around an axis of axial symmetry was found to be stable, while rotation around an axis perpendicular to this symmetric axis was not. Furthermore, comparisons of action values for two different mathematical models of apples indicate that <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be used to orient apples. The critical assumption for this analysis was that for the same object traveling the same path with different initial orientations, lower action values represent preferred motions. This study introduces the novel use of action integrals to examine stability, and the results provide testable predictions that round apples as compared to elongated or squat apples and larger elongated apples will need to travel farther before orientation is favored...|$|R
