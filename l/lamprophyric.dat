During normal subduction, however, the diamond stability window lies below the source regions of typical shoshonites. Particle-in-cell finite-element modeling of normal and flat subduction indicates that shallow subduction angles optimise the conditions required for a diamond-lamprophyre association.

40|$|Journal of the Geological Society (2015), [URL] Copyright © Geological Society of London 2015 The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} association of post-collisional granites and lamprophyre dykes is a common but enigmatic relationship in many orogenic belts, including the Variscan orogenic belt of SW England. The geology of SW England has long been interpreted to reflect orogenic processes associated with {{the closure of the}} Rheic Ocean and the formation of Pangaea. The SW England peninsula is composed largely of Early Devonian to Carboniferous volcano-sedimentary successions deposited in synrift and subsequent syncollisional basins that underwent deformation and low-grade regional metamorphism during the Variscan orogeny. Voluminous Early Permian granitic magmatism (Cornubian Batholith) is considered to be broadly coeval with the emplacement of <b>lamprophyric</b> dykes and <b>lamprophyric</b> and basaltic lava flows, largely on the basis of geochronological data from <b>lamprophyric</b> lavas in Devon. Although published geochronological data for Cornish lamprophyre dykes are consistent with this interpretation, these data are limited largely to imprecise K–Ar whole-rock and biotite analyses, hindering the understanding of the processes responsible for their genesis and their relationship to granitic magmatism and regional Variscan tectonics. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronological data for four previously undated lamprophyre dykes from Cornwall, combined with published data, suggest that lamprophyre magmatism occurred between c. 293. 6 and c. 285. 4 Ma, supporting previous inferences that their emplacement was coeval with the Cornubian Batholith. These data provide insights into (1) the relative timing between the lamprophyres and basalts, the Cornubian batholith and post-collisional magmatism elsewhere in the European Variscides, and (2) the post-collisional processes responsible for the generation and emplacement of lamprophyres, basalts and granitoids.

40|$|Introduction Lamprophyres are mesocratic to melanocratic igneous rocks, usually hypabyssal, with a panidiomorphic {{texture and}} {{abundant}} mafic phenocrysts of dark mica or amphibole (or both) {{with or without}} pyroxene, with or without olivine, set in a matrix of the same minerals, and with alkali-feldspar restricted to the groundmass (Woolley et al., 1996). Lamprophyres are frequently associated with orogenic settings and a mantle modified by dehydration of subducted slab (Gibson et al., 1995). Small outcrops of lamprophyres with Paleozoic to Oligocene age are reported from the central parts of Iran (Torabi 2009 and 2010). The primary magmas of these lamprophyres were derived from decompression melting of the mantle induced by a tensional regime of continental crust (Torabi, 2010). Bayat and Torabi (2011) called {{the western part of}} the CEIM (Central-East Iranian Microcontinent) (Anarak to Bayazeh) a “Paleozoic <b>lamprophyric</b> province” and suggested that the lamprophyre magmas were formed by subduction of Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust from the Early to late Paleozoic which resulted in the mantle metasomatism and enrichment. <b>Lamprophyric</b> dykes and stocks of the Kal-e-kafi area (Central Iran, Northern part of Yazd Block) cross-cut the Eocene volcanic rocks and other older rock units such as Cretaceous limestone. These lamprophyres are mainly composed of hornblende (magnesio-hastingsite), clinopyroxene (diopside) and plagioclase (labradorite to bytownite) as phenocryst, in a matrix of fine to medium grained of the same minerals and orthoclase, apatite, magnetite, chlorite and epidote. In this paper that is a report on the first study on the calc-alkaline lamprophyres of Central Iran, the petrography and mineral chemistry of calc-alkaline <b>lamprophyric</b> dykes of the Kal-e-kafi area are discussed. Materials and methods Chemical composition of minerals were conducted at Kanazawa University (Kanazawa, Japan) using the wavelength-dispersive electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) (JEOL JXA- 8800 R), with 20 kV accelerating potential, 20 nA beam current and a counting time of 40 seconds. Natural minerals and synthetic materials were used as standards. The ZAF program was used for data correction. The Fe 3 + content of minerals was estimated by stoichiometry. The Mg# and Fe# were calculated as [Mg/(Mg+Fe 2 +) ], and [Fe 2 +/(Fe 2 ++Mg) ] atomic ratio of minerals, respectively. Trace element values of phenocrystic clinopyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) using an ArF 193 nm Excimer Laser coupled to an Agilent 7500 S at the Earth Science Department of the Kanazawa University (Japan). The diameter of the analyzed points was 60 micrometers for clinopyroxene and 120 micrometers for amphibole and plagioclase. Mineral abbreviations are adopted from Whitney and Evans (2010). Results and Discussion Lamprophyres of the Kal-e-kafi area (Central Iran, West of Yazd Block) are exposed as dykes and stocks which cross-cut the Eocene volcanic rocks and other older rock units such as Cretaceous limestone. Field studies indicate that calc-alkaline <b>lamprophyric</b> dykes of the Kal-e-kafi (east of Anarak) are younger than the other igneous rocks. According to the results of petrography and mineral chemistry, the mesocratic lamprophyres of Kal-e-kafi area are calc-alkaline spessartite. Unique values of Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 associated with oscillatory zoning of clinopyroxenes reveal the crystallization of clinopyroxenes during ascending of magma. Plagioclase phenocrysts are labradorite to bytownite in composition and the plagioclases of matrix are labradorite. Chemical composition diversity of plagioclase indicates the fractional crystallization of these lamprophyres. Amphibole thermometry estimate average temperature of 860 °C and barometry by Anderson and Smith (1995) shows 1. 5 to 3 kbars pressure. Clinopyroxene thermobarometry calculate 1150 °C temperature and pressure between 2 to 5 kbars. The geochemical features and thermobarometry of the Kal-e-kafi spessartite minerals suggest that the primary <b>lamprophyric</b> magma was derived from partial melting of a lithospheric mantle spinel lherzolite. Changes in values of pressure, water content, and Oxygen fugacity during magma ascending lead to oscillatory zoning minerals. Based on the mineral chemistry, it can be concluded that the Kal-e-kafi lamprophyres were formed in a subduction-related environment by a calc-alkaline magmatism. References Anderson, J.

40|$|The Piquiri Syenite Massif, southernmost Brazil, {{is part of}} the post-collisional {{magmatism}} {{related to}} the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano-Pan-African Orogenic Cycle. The massif is about 12 km in diameter and is composed of syenites, granites, monzonitic rocks and lamprophyres. Diopside-phlogopite, diopside-biotite-augite-calcic-amphibole, are the main ferro-magnesian paragenesis in the syenitic rocks. Syenitic and granitic rocks are co-magmatic and related to an ultrapotassic, silica-saturated magmatism. Their trace element patterns indicate a probable mantle source modified by previous, subduction-related metasomatism. The ultrapotassic granites of this massif were produced by fractional crystallization of syenitic magmas, and may be considered as a particular group of hypersolvus and subsolvus A-type granites. Based upon textural, structural and geochemical data most of the syenitic rocks, particularly the fine-grained types, are considered as crystallized liquids, in spite of the abundance of cumulatic layers, schlieren, and compositional banding. Most of the studied samples are metaluminous, with K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios higher than 2. The ultrapotassic syenitic and <b>lamprophyric</b> rocks in the Piquiri massif are interpreted to have been produced from enriched mantle sources, OIB-type, like most of the post-collisional shoshonitic, sodic alkaline and high-K tholeiitic magmatism in southernmost Brazil.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Alkali basalts and lamprophyres commonly occur as sheet intrusions along the flanks of continental rifts. The Raton Basin, on the eastern shoulder of the Rio Grande rift, is host to numerous basaltic and <b>lamprophyric</b> dikes and sills. Structural analysis of petrofabrics indicates a dominantly westward flow of magma in the basaltic and <b>lamprophyric</b> E-W trending dikes. Elevated light rare earth element concentrations (LREE) suggests that both of these magmas were sourced from an enriched portion of the mantle, most likely the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages show significant overlap in the emplacement of basalts and lamprophyres between 2 ̃ 7 - 20 Ma. These observations are interpreted to reflect a similar source and storage history in a crustal level magma chamber to the east of the basin.

40|$|Abstract Magmatic {{enclaves}} {{from the}} Rudolfov quarry near Liberec (Czech Republic) are interpreted to represent remnants of <b>lamprophyric</b> melt that intruded the Karkonosze granite at a stage {{at which the}} granite was not fully solidified. Based on the observation that larger enclaves are generally more circular than the smaller ones, we conclude that bigger blobs of mafic magma became more spherical during flow in the gravity field (sink or float). This flow is also interpreted {{to be responsible for}} the incorporation of mineral grains into the enclaves and may have facilitated the assimilation of granitic melt. Linear mixing trends on Harker diagrams for most network-forming and mainly slow-diffusing or fluid-immobile elements indicate such an assimilation process between granite and lamprophyre. In contrast, all fast-diffusing or fluid-mobile elements display scattered element distributions, implying that chemical diffusion also played a role. Pressure and temperature for this late magmatic stage are estimated at around 1 kbar and 500 °C. These results suggest that two processes modified the composition of the enclaves in the Karkonosze granite: (1) assimilation (mechanical mixing) of granitic melt during the injection of the <b>lamprophyric</b> melt and the subsequent flow of the forming enclaves in the gravity field (responsible for the linear mixing trends) and (2) diffusion-controlled redistribution of elements between both solidifying rock types at the magmatic stage and/or due to late-stage magmatic fluids (responsible for the scattering and deviation from the linear mixing trends) ...|$|E
40|$|Predazzo Magmatic Complex {{represents}} the main intrusive boby of the magmatic activity which affected the South Alpine domain during the Triassic age (238 - 232 My). Field observations and petrological data allow to distinguish four main intrusive sequences characterised by a clear subduction-related signature: a shoshonitic SiO 2 -saturated series (M 1); a shoshonitic SiO 2 -oversaturated series (M 2); a K-alkaline SiO 2 -undersaturated series (M 3) and a Granitic Unit (G). As concerns the subvolcanics products three main series have been distinguished: 1) shoshonitic dikes, characterised by incompatible element distribution {{analogous to the}} corresponding M 1 and M 2 intrusive lithologies; 2) K-basanitic dikes, cutting the granitic and monzonitic M 2 intrusions, genetically linked to M 3 lithologies; 3) <b>lamprophyric</b> dikes, cutting both the granitic and monzonitic intrusions. Lamprophyres, Middle Triassic in age, are characterised {{by the presence of}} ultramafic xenoliths and carbonatite ocelli, {{as well as by the}} absence of Nb and Ti negative anomalies. Initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios of M 1 and M 2 Units range between 0. 70385 and 0. 70649 with initial 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotopic ratios between 0. 512227 and 0. 51216. On the other hand the K-basanitic dikes and M 3 Unit rocks show higher initial 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotopic ratios (0. 512281 - 0. 512386) for quite similar initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios (0. 70404 - 0. 70533). As expected <b>lamprophyric</b> dikes show a completely different isotopic signature, with higher 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 512483 - 0. 512595) and lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 70362 - 0. 70429) isotopic ratios. A mass-balance closed system fractionation model was developed for M 1, M 2 and M 3 Units. According to field relationships, petrography, mineral chemistry and isotopic data, model suggests that the Predazzo plutonic complex was predominantly generated by fractional crystallisation processes, with different magma pulses injected in multiple adjacent magma chambers in a short time span. A possible sequence of the magmatic events can be summarised as follows: a first intrusion of M 1 Unit (almost contemporaneous to the volcanic products), followed by the emplacement of M 2 Unit.

The xenoliths are found in the Granatifera Tuff, which is a small tuff cone or tuff ring exposure. The Mercaderes-Rio Mayo xenolith suite contains heterogeneous assemblages of mantle-derived, crustal and igneous rocks, which attest to the heterogeneity of the crust and mantle in the area.;The mantle at Mercaderes comprises mainly garnet peridotite at deeper levels, and shows a transition to websterites and pyroxenites towards the crust-mantle boundary. These are probably a product of intrusions of melts originated within a mantle modified by fluids released from a subducting slab.;The lower crust comprises a variety of hydrated (Hbl + Bio) (e. g. hornblendites and pyribolites) and dehydrated (Cpx) (e. g. pyroxenites and granulites) rocks. These rocks represent the transition from amphibolite facies to granulite facies. Petrographical, geothermobarometric and geochemical evidence indicates that this involves the dehydration and probable melting of the hydrated rocks to produce the dehydrated rocks (restites). The protoliths for the lower crustal rocks include rocks that were tectonically accreted (lateral accretion) and rocks that were intruded into the crust (vertical accretion).;The igneous rocks in Mercaderes are volcanic <b>lamprophyric</b> rocks and andesites, and diorites. The <b>lamprophyric</b> rocks are possibly the host for the mantle xenoliths, suggesting that their source lies within the mantle. The andesites show similarities with adakites, and it is likely that their magma formed with considerable crustal contribution, possibly from the dehydration of lower custal rocks. The magma sources in Mercaderes lie, therefore, within the mantle and the crust, and are possibly the result of mixing between these two.;From the xenoliths from Mercaderes-Rio Mayo three processes involved in the crust and mantle formation beneath Mercaderes can be identified: Lateral tectonic accretion; intrusion of magmas into the upper mantle and lower crust and possible melting from restites. The model presented here suggests that the latter two are predominant in the deeper levels of the crust in the area...|$|E
40|$|Sarcya 1 dive {{explored}} {{a previously}} unknown 12 My old submerged volcano, labelled Cornacya. A well developed fracturation is characterised {{by the following}} directions: N 170 to N-S, N 20 to N 40, N 90 to N 120, N 50 to N 70, which corresponds to the fracturation pattern of the Sardinian margin. The sampled lavas exhibit features of shoshonitic suites of intermediate composition and include amphibole-and mica-bearing <b>lamprophyric</b> xenoliths which are geochemically similar to Ti-poor lamproites. Mica compositions reflect chemical exchanges between the lamprophyre and its shoshonitic host rock suggesting their simultaneous emplacement. Nd compositions of the Cornacya K-rich suite indicate that continental crust was largely involved in the genesis of these rocks. The spatial association of the lamprophyre with the shoshonitic rocks is geochemically similar to K-rich and TiO 2 -poor igneous suites, emplaced in post-collisional settings. Among shoshonitic rocks, sample SAR 1 - 01 has been dated at 12. 6 ± 0. 3 My using the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method with a laser microprobe on single grains. The age of the Cornacya shoshonitic suite {{is similar to that}} of the Sisco lamprophyre from Corsica, which similarly is located on the western margin of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Thus, the Cornacya shoshonitic rocks and their <b>lamprophyric</b> xenolith and the Sisco lamprophyre could represent post-collisional suites emplaced during the lithospheric extension of the Corsica-Sardinia block, just after its rotation and before the Tyrrhenian sea opening. Drilling on the Sardinia margin (ODP Leg 107) shows that the upper levels of the present day margin (Hole 654) suffered tectonic subsidence before the lower part (Hole 652). The structure of this lower part is interpreted as the result of an eastward migration of the extension during Late Miocene and Early Pliocene times. Data of Cornacya volcano are in good agreement with this model and provide good chronological constraints for the beginning of the phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Basic and {{intermediate}} meta-igneous xenoliths are very scarce within the granulite population transported by the Permian alkaline <b>lamprophyric</b> dyke swarmof the Spanish Central System(SCS). These xenoliths aremetaluminous pyroxene-bearing charnockites (sensu lato). They show LREE-poor plagioclase and orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene. Crystallization conditions were estimated at about 850 to 1000 ◦C and 9 to 11 kbar, {{a slightly higher}} range than that estimated for the associated peraluminous granulites, but indicating derivation from the lowermost crust. Whole-rock geochemistry suggests that the charnockite samples are not a cogenetic suite. The more basic varieties have affinities with cumulates from previous calc-alkaline underplated protoliths, whereas intermediate charnockites have a restitic origin. The similarity in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic signatures between these restitic charnockites and some SCS I-type granites suggests a genetic relationship. This study, including Pb isotopic data from the whole granulite xenolith suite, reinforces the lower-crustal derivation of the SCS Hercynian granitic batholith...|$|E
40|$|The {{alkaline}} mafic (<b>lamprophyric)</b> Gusinoozerskaya dyke in West Transbaikalia {{is composed}} of partially melted granite xenoliths. Among the xenoliths, two melted substrates are observed: (1) plagioclase and quartz, and (2) alkaline feldspar and quartz. Few millimeters thick microfelsite and microgranophiric rims are the products of melting around the granite xenoliths. Ultra‐acid glass is observed in the inner parts of the xenoliths at the boundary of quartz and feldspars. A distinctive feature of the fresh melts (regardless of {{the composition of the}} protolithic sub‐ strate) is an increased content of potassium with K 2 O/Na 2 O≥ 2. Having compared the compositions of the products of contact melting with the experimental data, we conclude that melting took place in the presence of alkaline‐chloride and/or alkaline‐carbonic fluid released from the crystallizing host alkaline‐basic magma. The probable geotectonic conditions for the occurrence of ultrapotassic acid magmas are estimated...|$|E
40|$|Summary The central Victoria Land crustal {{sector of}} the early Paleozoic Ross Orogen is {{characterized}} by the widespread occurrence of pink granite plutons and dikes (Irizar unit) and <b>lamprophyric</b> dikes (Vegetation unit). Structural evidence indicates these intrusions were emplaced in a tensional regime during late stages of the Ross Orogeny. Geochronological U-Pb and 40 Ar- 39 Ar data indicate emplacement age for both units within a restricted time interval around 490 Ma. This, coupled with emplacement style, imply a fast, block-like exhumation during this postcollisional stage. The Irizar granites-dikes and the Vegetation lamprophyres are both potassic, with overlapping initial Sr-Nd isotope ratios. The Vegetation melts derived from enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle further metasomatised by a Ross subduction component, while the Irizar melts derived from remelting of Vegetation-like underplated material. Comparison with coeval postcollisional igneous activity in Australia-Tasmania suggests similar scenarios with slab roll-back in the Antarctic sector evolving to slab break-up in Australia-Tasmania...|$|E
40|$|Zarrin granite {{intrusion}} {{is located}} in the Central Iran, to west of Chapedoni and Posht-e-Badam faults. It consists of three separate outcrops situated at the northern end of a long mountain range, which is comprised of Mesozoic rocks. Lithologically the intrusion contains granites as well as, gneisses (?) and aplites. Petrographic and geochemical evidence strongly suggest that they are cogenetic. High aluminum contents and other characteristics of these rocks, as well as petrographic evidence, indicate that the granite is ″S-type″. Moreover, on the basis of geochemical evidence it is suggested that this granite intrusion may be classified as a Post-Orogenic Granite (POG) and Within Plate Granite (WPG). It is also suggested that the intrusion occurred in a relatively quiet period of the final stage of an orogeny. <b>Lamprophyric</b> dykes cutting Zarrin granite have similar orientations and are parallel to the major faults zone. It appears that their genesis is related to the deep faults, which extend down to the upper mantle.

40|$|Mantle xenoliths in {{alkaline}} lavas of the Kerguelen Islands consist of: (1) protogranular, Cr-diopside-bearing harzburgite; (2) poikilitic, Mg-augite-bearing harzburgite and cpx-poor lherzolite; (3) dunite {{that contains}} clinopyroxene, spinel phlogopite, and rarely amphibole. Trace element data for rocks and minerals identify distinctive signatures {{for the different}} rock types and record upper-mantle processes. The harzburgites reflect an initial partial melting event followed by metasomatism by mafic alkaline to carbonatitic melts. The dunites were first formed by reaction of a harzburgite protolith with tholeiitic to transitional basaltic melts, and subsequently developed metasomatic assemblages of clinopyroxene + phlogopite ± amphibole by reaction with <b>lamprophyric</b> or carbonatitic melts. We measured two-mineral partition coefficients and calculated mineral-melt partition coefficients for 27 trace elements. In most samples, calculated budgets indicate that trace elements reside in the constituent minerals.

40|$|We present here {{results of}} a {{petrographic}} examination of Neolithic pottery found at the archaeological site of Stonehall, Orkney Islands, Scotland. The petrographic characterisation of two pottery classes, Round-based ware and Grooved ware, belonging to the early and late Neolithic periods respectively, is set against the archaeological background that calls {{for a review of}} the culture-history framework that has traditionally supported this pottery classification. On the basis of the typology of fragmentary rock inclusions observed in the pottery, three groups have been identified, the largest of which is characterised by the presence of sedimentary rock inclusions, the other two by the presence of camptonite fragments. The main finding is that the same materials seem to have been used for pottery making throughout the Neolithic at Stonehall. As regards the sources of the pottery’s raw materials, whereas the sedimentary inclusions were not diagnostic of origin, the camptonite was more informative. With the aid of the British Geological Survey’s reference collection of thin sections of <b>lamprophyric</b> dykes on Orkney, it was possible to isolate potential sources of camptonite, two of which were close to Stonehall.

40|$|Gameleira lamprophyres are dykes and mafic microgranular {{enclaves}} {{associated with}} the shoshonitic Gameleira monzonite. This association belongs to the Paleoproterozoic alkaline magmatism from Serrinha nucleus, northeast Brazil. The liquidus paragenesis is diopside, pargasite, apatite and mica. Reverse zoning was identified in the groundmass alkali feldspar and {{was related to the}} undercooling of <b>lamprophyric</b> magma during the emplacement, with high growth rate of pargasite/edenite inducing disequilibrium between feldspars and liquid. Chemical data indicate that the lamprophyres are basic rocks (SiO 2 3 wt%) and potassic signature (K 2 O/Na 2 O &# 8776; 2). High contents of MgO and Cr are consistent with a signature of a primary liquid, and such concentrations, as well as Al, K, P, Ba, Ni- and light rare earth elements, are consistent with an olivine-free metasomatic mantle source enriched in amphibole, clinopyroxene and apatite. By contrast, the ultrapotassic lamprophyres from Morro do Afonso, contemporaneous alkaline ultrapotassic magmatism in Serrinha nucleus, were probably produced by melting of a clinopyroxene-phlogopite-apatite enriched-source. The identification of different mineral paragenesis in the source of potassic and ultrapotassic lamprophyres from Serrinha nucleus can contribute {{to the understanding of the}} mantle heterogeneities and tectonic evolution of this region...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reservedMiddle Miocene to Quaternary {{magmatism}} in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) is characterised by radiogenic Sr and Pb isotopic signatures, and unradiogenic Nd isotopic ratios. Although the geochemistry of {{the samples}} is heterogeneous, all samples show a distinct subduction signature (negative anomalies for Nb and Ti, positive for K and Pb) in their trace element patterns. Mafic magmatism is represented by <b>lamprophyric</b> magmas, and a suite of ‘gabbros' (ranging from gabbro to clinopyroxenite). The isotopic signature of the lamprophyres {{could be explained by}} simple mixing between a mantle source, similar to that for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), and sediments, as is typical for subduction-related volcanics, but the Pb–Sr isotopic systematics of the gabbros preclude this interpretation. They are interpreted as containing an important contribution from an old sub-continental lithospheric source, located within a sliver of Australian continent that has been thrust underneath Central Sulawesi. Felsic magmatism is likely to reflect high degrees of crustal contamination or intracrustal melting.

40|$|The {{research}} area {{is located in}} the Ruhla-Brotterode crystalline complex {{in the western part of}} the Thuringian Forest (Germany), about 20 km southsouthwest of Eisenach. The investigated outcrops occur at the eastern and western flanks of the valleys north of the villages Trusetal and Hohleborn. Deformed magmatic veins only occur in the Hohleborn area. Both areas have relative fresh outcropping rocks, due to the steep relief, former quarries and fresh road cuts. According to Obst & Katzung (2000) several periods with the formation of magmatic veins with different chemical composition occur in the Ruhla-Brotterode crystalline complex. Presumably older <b>lamprophyric</b> veins and younger doleritic, syenitporphyric and granitporphyric veins have been identified (Obst & Katzung 2000). Benek & Schust (1988) already pointed out that some of these magmatic veins have experienced ductile deformation. The subject of this work is the occurrence of deformed magmatic veins in the Hohleborn area. The contact to their host rocks, their petrography and their microfabrics have been investigated and related to deformation processes, which led to a better understanding of their deformation conditions within the late-to post-variscan development of the area...|$|E

Drill-core and field sampling have indicated the occurrence of glimmerites, with subordinate shonkinites (mela-syenites), clinopyroxene-bearing glimmerites, diorites and syenites. The glimmerites are cross-cut by <b>lamprophyric</b> dykes and calciocarbonatites. Fenitization has deeply affected the country rocks, originating dioritic and syenitic rocks. The Ipanema rocks show a distinct potassic affinity. The initial Sr-Nd- isotopic composition of the Ipanema rocks ((87) Sr/(86) Sr = 0. 70661 - 0. 70754 and (143) Nd/(144) Nd = 0. 51169 - 0. 51181) {{is similar to that of}} tholeiitic and potassium-rich-alkaline rocks of the Eastern Paraguay. Stable isotope data for the Ipanema calciocarbonatite suggest interaction with fluids at temperatures typical of hydrothermal stages, as hypothesized for other carbonatite complexes from southeastern Brazil.

40|$|Abstract – Illite {{crystallinity}} {{data from}} the Silurian slate belts of England andWales indicate anchizone to low epizone metamorphism during the Acadian deformation in late Early Devonian time. This metamorphic grade implies a substantial overburden, now eroded, of Lower Devonian non-marine sediments of the Old Red Sandstone (ORS) magnafacies. A minimum 3. 5 km pre-tectonic thickness of ‘lost ’ ORS is estimated in the southern Lake District and comparable thicknesses in North Wales and East Anglia. Tectonically driven subsidence of the underlying Avalonian crust is required to accommodate such thicknesses of non-marine sediment. One proposed mechanism is flexure of the Avalonian footwall during convergence that continued from Iapetus closure in the Silurian untilAcadian cleavage formation in the Emsian. The evidence for this model in the critical area of northwest England is reviewed and found to be unconvincing. An alternative model is developed following a recent suggestion that the Early Devonian was a period not of continued convergence but of orogen-wide sinistral transtension. Transtensional accommodation of the lost ORS is evidenced by Early Devonian extensional faults, by synchronous <b>lamprophyric</b> magmatism, and by compatibility with previously diagnosed sediment provenance patterns.

40|$|Abstrpct: In {{order to}} create a {{sustainable}} classification of igneous rocks which all geologists might use, an international body was set up by the IUGS: the IUGS Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks. In the course of creating the classification, the Subcommission has established ten principles for its construction and for defining an appropriate nomenclature. The principles are: (1) use descriptive attributes; (2) use actual properties; (3) ensure suitability for all geologists; (4) use current terminology; (5) define boundaries of rock species; (6) keep it simple to apply; (7) follow natural relations; (8) use modal mineralogy; (9) if mode not feasible, use chemistry; (10) follow terminology of other IUGS advisory bodies. These principles and their rationale have not previously been enunciated. The classification separates and individually classifies the pyroclastic, carbonatitic, melititic, <b>lamprophyric</b> and charnockitic rocks before entering the main QAPF classification for plutonic and volcanic rocks which is based on the modal mineral proportions of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A) and plagioclase (P) or of alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P) and feldspathoids (F).
