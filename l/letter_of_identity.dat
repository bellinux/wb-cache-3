Also included are school certificates, work certificates and <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> recommendation, <b>identity</b> cards, passports, birth certificates, marriage 				certificates, and photographs. Trude Lowenthal (née Rattner) was born in Vienna in 1913. She was the oldest of Hersh Ber and Ryfcia Rattner's four children. She left Austria for England in 				 1938 without her first husband, engineer Erwin Basch. Her sister Lily Buchwald had already been in England for several months when she arrived. She emigrated from England to the United 				States in 1949, where she later married Carl Lowenthal, who was originally from Germany. She worked as an accountant until her retirement in 1988.

40|$|Three eye {{movement}} experiments {{were conducted to}} examine the role <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>identity</b> and letter position during reading. Before fixating on a target word within each sentence, readers were provided with a parafoveal preview that differed in the amount <b>of</b> useful <b>letter</b> <b>identity</b> and letter position information it provided. In Experiments 1 and 2, previews fell into 1 of 5 conditions: (a) identical to the target word, (b) a transposition <b>of</b> 2 internal <b>letters,</b> (c) a substitution <b>of</b> 2 internal <b>letters,</b> (d) a transposition of the 2 final letters, or (e) a substitution of the 2 final letters. In Experiment 3, the authors used a further set of conditions to explore the importance <b>of</b> external <b>letter</b> positions. The findings extend previous work and demonstrate that transposed-letter effects exist in silent reading. These experiments also indicate that letter identity information can be extracted from the parafovea outside <b>of</b> absolute <b>letter</b> position from the first 5 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> the word {{to the right of}} fixation. Finally, the results support the notion that exterior letters play important roles in visual word recognition...|$|R

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} perceptual priming (word {{identification}} and word fragment completion), {{as well as}} preference priming (that may rely on special affective mechanisms) were examined after participants either read or named the colors of words and nonwords at study. Participants named the colors of words more slowly than the colors of nonwords, indicating that lexical processing of the words occurred at study. Nonetheless, priming on all three tests was lower after color naming than after reading, despite evidence of lexical processing during color naming shown by slower responses to words than to nonwords. These results indicate that selective attention to (rather than the mere processing <b>of)</b> <b>letter</b> string <b>identity</b> at study is important for subsequent repetition priming...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHow {{does the}} human motor system encode our {{incredibly}} diverse motor repertoire in an efficient manner? One possible way of encoding movements efficiently is {{to represent them}} according to their shape/trajectory without regard to their size, by using neural populations that are invariant across scale. To examine this hypothesis, we recorded movement kinematics and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) while subjects wrote three letters in two different scales. A classification algorithm was trained to identify each letter according to its associated voxel-by-voxel response pattern in each of several motor areas. Accurate decoding <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>identity</b> was possible in primary motor cortex (M 1) and anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) regardless of the letter’s scale. These results reveal that large, distributed neural populations in human M 1 and aIPS encode complex handwriting movements regardless of their particular dynamics and kinematics, in a scale-invariant manner...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>letter</b> and <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> Ioannes Pannonius, who had a {{philosophical}} theological dispute with Marsilio Ficino. The main question is, was he a work of Ficino’s fiction or a real person? After the presentation of three hypotheses which have tried to identify the unknown Hungarian correspondent, the paper argues against them and tries to outline a fragmentary biography of a real person based on the little information we have. Considering his Florentine studies, {{he might have been}} born around 1440. His identification as János Váradi is false, and although Pajorin’s hypothesis of János Vitéz Jr. is much more plausible, there are at least as many arguments against it as there are for it. Nevertheless, that he was an invention of Ficino is the least likely...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{recognition}} {{memory for}} shape-colour associations is superior when the colours were originally perceived {{to belong to}} the shapes, rather than to the backgrounds against which the shapes appeared. Recognition is at chance in the latter case. In two experiments, the nature of the shape representations supporting visual memory for shape-colour conjunctions is examined. Letters are used as to-be-remembered shapes and the impact of two types of change in their appearance as recognition probes is assessed. When letters reappear in the same case, recognition performance is unaffected by a change in font (Experiment 1). However, when letters reappear in the same font, recognition performance drops to chance if letter case is changed (Experiment 2). The contrast between these two types of change was not confounded with differences in the visual similarity of the memory and probe letters. It seems that colour is linked to structural descriptions <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> shape in visual memory. The relationship between these descriptions and other forms of representation, including abstract representations <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>identity,</b> is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract (150 words) We {{intuitively}} {{believe that}} when we become consciously aware of a visual stimulus, {{we will be able}} to remember it for immediate report. The present study provides a series of striking demonstrations that are inconsistent with such an intuition. Four experiments showed that in certain conditions, participants cannot report an attribute (e. g. <b>letter</b> <b>identity)</b> <b>of</b> a stimulus, even when that attribute had been attended and reached a full state of conscious awareness just prior to the question. We term this effect attribute amnesia and it occurs when participants locate a target using one attribute for several repetitions and are then surprisingly asked to report that attribute. This discovery suggests that attention to a stimulus attribute and being aware of it are insufficient to ensure its reportability immediately afterwards. Furthermore, our results strongly imply that cognitive processes have separate designations of what information will be attended and what will be remembered...|$|R

40|$|Early {{on during}} word recognition, letter {{positions}} are not accurately coded. Evidence for {{this comes from}} transposed-letter (TL) priming effects, in which letter strings generated by transposing two adjacent letters (e. g., jugde) produce large priming effects, more than primes with the letters replaced in the corresponding position (e. g., junpe). Dominant accounts of TL priming effect such as the Open Bigrams model ([Grainger and van Heuven, 2003] and [Whitney and Cornelissen, 2008]) and the SOLAR model (Davis & Bowers, 2006) explain this effect by proposing {{a higher level of}} representation than individual letter identities in which letter position is not coded accurately. An alternative to this is to assume that position coding is noisy (e. g., Gomez, Ratcliff, & Perea, 2008). We propose an extension to the Bayesian Reader (Norris, 2006) that incorporates letter position noise during sampling from perceptual input. This model predicts “leakage” <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>identity</b> to nearby positions, which is not expected from models incorporating alternative position coding schemes. We report three masked priming experiments testing predictions from this model. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Masked transposed-letter (TL) priming {{effects have}} been used to index letter {{position}} processing over the course of reading development. Whereas some studies have reported an increase in TL priming over development, others have reported a decrease. These findings have {{led to the development of}} 2 somewhat contradictory accounts <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> position development: the lexical tuning hypothesis and the multiple-route model. One factor that may be contributing to these discrepancies is the use of baseline primes that substitute letters in the target word, which may confound the effect <b>of</b> changes in <b>letter</b> position processing over development with those <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>identity.</b> The present study included an identity prime (e. g., listen—LISTEN), in addition to the standard two-substituted-letter (2 SL; e. g., lidfen—LISTEN) and all-letter-different (ALD; e. g., rodfup—LISTEN) baselines, to remove the potential confound between letter position and letter identity information in determining the effect of the TL prime. Priming effects were measured in a lexical decision task administered to children aged 7 – 12 and a group of university students. Using inverse transformed response times, targets preceded by a TL prime were responded to significantly faster than those preceded by 2 SL and ALD primes, and priming remained stable across development. In contrast, targets preceded by a TL prime were responded to significantly slower than those preceded by an ID prime, and this reaction-time cost increased significantly over development, with adults showing the largest cost. These findings are consistent with a lexical tuning account <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> position development, and are inconsistent with the multiple-route model. 9 page(s...|$|R
