25|$|On 12 September 2007, Northern Rock {{asked the}} Bank of England, as lender {{of last resort}} in the United Kingdom, for a {{liquidity}} support facility due to problems in raising funds in the money market to replace maturing money market borrowings. The problems arose from difficulties banks faced over the summer of 2007 in raising funds in the money market. The bank's assets were always sufficient to cover its liabilities in the long run, {{but it had a}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>problem</b> because institutional lenders became nervous about lending to mortgage banks following the US sub-prime crisis.

This latter is due to both the liquidity mismatch between assets and liabilities and the redemption risk due to the possible outflows from clients. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of contagion looking at common market <b>liquidity</b> <b>problems</b> to detect funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>problems.</b> Using the CDS Bond Spread basis as a liquidity indicator and a state space model with time-varying volatility specification, we show that during the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis, there exist pure contagion effects both in terms of price and liquidity on the emerging sovereign debt market. This result has strong implication since the main risk for an asset manager is to get stuck with an unwanted position due to a dry-up of market liquidity...|$|R

5000|$|The heavy {{borrowing}} abroad by Irish banks reflected the enormous {{increase in their}} lending into the Irish property market, a lending area which since 1996 seemed {{to be able to}} provide an endless flow of profitable lending opportunities as the Irish public relentlessly bought and sold property. [...] The total stock of mortgage loans in Ireland exploded from €16 billion {{in the first quarter of}} 2003 to a peak of €106 billion by the third quarter of 2008, about 60 percent of Ireland's GDP for that year. [...] This, in turn, led to a massive increase in the price of Irish property assets. The freezing-up of the world's interbank market during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 caused two problems for Irish banks. Firstly, with no new money available to borrow, withdrawal of deposits caused a <b>liquidity</b> <b>problem.</b> In other words, there was no cash available to honour withdrawal requests. A <b>liquidity</b> <b>problem</b> on its own is usually manageable through Central Bank funding. However, the second problem was solvency and this was much more serious. The lack of new money meant no new loans which meant no new property deals. No new property purchases both exposed the fragile cash-flows of developers and highlighted the stratospheric valuations of property. With the value of most of their assets (loans) declining in line with the property market, the liabilities (deposits) of the six Irish domestic banks were now considerably greater than their assets. Insolvency loomed and Irish banks would need major cash injections (recapitalisation) to stay open.|$|E

Universal Bank decreased this limit to 50,000 kyat per week by February 21. In response to the limits, large crowds began gathering in front banks demanding withdrawals. After a bank in Yangon’s Thingangyun area was stoned by account holders, riot police was called upon to guard banks, while the traffic police tried to disperse the huge crowds outside of the Olympic Tower branch of Asia Wealth Bank. Soon, Asia Wealth Bank posted signs saying their branches are working in normal conditions, even though the restrictions were still in place.|$|E

Alex Mascioli and SAAB Chairman & CEO Victor Muller came to a deal in which North Street would aqcuire the supercar maker Spyker from Swedish Automobile, which began to struggle financially with SAAB, for $43.5 million in cash, and the proceeds would be used to pay off company debt.

50|$|National bank {{currency}} {{was considered}} inelastic {{because it was}} based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds rather than the growing desire for easy credit. If Treasury bond prices declined, a national bank had {{to reduce the amount of}} currency it had in circulation by either refusing to make new loans or by calling in loans it had made already. The related <b>liquidity</b> <b>problem</b> was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans. As there was little in the way of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which lent more than their assets could cover, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics.|$|E

50|$|Beginning with {{bankruptcy}} of Lehman Brothers on September 14, 2008, {{the financial crisis}} entered an acute phase marked by failures of prominent American and European banks and efforts by the American and European governments to rescue distressed financial institutions, in the United States by passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and in European countries by infusion of capital into major banks. Afterwards, Iceland almost claimed to go bankrupt as the country's three largest banks, and in effect financial system, collapsed. Many financial institutions in Europe also faced the <b>liquidity</b> <b>problem</b> {{that they needed to}} raise their capital adequacy ratio. As the crisis developed, stock markets fell worldwide, and global financial regulators attempted to coordinate efforts to contain the crisis. The US government composed a $700 billion plan to purchase unperforming collaterals and assets. However, the plan failed to pass because some members of the US Congress rejected the idea of using taxpayers' money to bail out Wall Street investment bankers. After the stock market plunged, Congress amended the $700 billion bail out plan and passed the legislation. The market sentiment continued to deteriorate, however, and the global financial system almost collapsed. While the market turned extremely pessimistic, the British government launched a 500 billion pound bail out plan aimed at injecting capital into the financial system. The British government nationalized most of the financial institutions in trouble. Many European governments followed suit, as well as the US government. Stock markets appeared to have stabilized as October ended. In addition, the falling prices due to reduced demand for oil, coupled with projections of a global recession, brought the 2000s energy crisis to temporary resolution. In the Eastern European economies of Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine the economic crisis was characterized by difficulties with loans made in hard currencies such as the Swiss franc. As local currencies in those countries lost value, making payment on such loans became progressively more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Morris was Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas The Hon. Fred A. Mitchell, MP in 2002-2003. In 2003, he was {{commissioned}} by StarCapital/CITIC and the Vice Premier of China - Madam Wu - to conduct the largest Study of The Economics and Logistics of Multi-modal Shipping and Distribution Centres between China and the Caribbean Basin. Morris said of the study {{in an interview with}} Jones Communications: [...] "It remains confidential, however, I can say that we confirmed the principle that small nations must triangulate on a cost, tax and financing basis to develop an effective trade platform. Second, it revealed nearly $200 billion in 'pent-up' opportunities for trade in the region". As an Economist, Morris, who uses a [...] "forensic historical approach", has had a series of firsts. In 2000 he wrote: [...] "The West Indies scholar, no matter his capacity to forecast global phenomena, will do so largely in obscurity; unheard by the larger world, and regarded by his countrymen with genteel amusement; if not befuddlement". However, in 2001, at a public meeting in Nassau, (and repeated in 2005) Professor Morris forecasted that [...] "In the next 5 years, I put it to you that Oil Prices will rise to $80 and above $150 per barrel." [...] Then in 2003, Morris, again in a public lecture for the Rotary Club said the following: [...] "I suggest that the US government will continue its 'weak dollar policy', and therefore, it is prudent that all governments of the region using dollars either directly or through an exchange rate, should now convert 10% of their reserves to gold and all of their special drawing rights (SDRs) at the IMF. This would offset the coming losses in value in their reserve positions." [...] At the time gold was $319 an ounce. In late 2008, {{in the heat of the}} financial meltdown, Morris wrote an article: [...] "Obamanomics" [...] in which he warned that the new administration should neither bail out the banks or the motor car companies. He said: [...] "The car companies should go into bankruptcy and there reposition themselves. And there should be no rescue of the banks. There are over 8,000 banks in the US, and 4,000 must die. They do not have a <b>liquidity</b> <b>problem.</b> They have a balance sheet problem. They are worthless and bailing them out will hide that fact and prolong the pain." ...|$|E
