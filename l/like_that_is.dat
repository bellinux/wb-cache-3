25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words.

[...] Also {{reviewing}} the twelfth season, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson was less positive, commenting: [...] "I’d love to report that 'Menace' disrupts the string of mediocre episodes , but I can’t. Like its predecessors, it offers a moderately enjoyable experience, but that’s the best it can do. Expect a few chuckles and little else." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
500|$|John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, {{also spoke}} about the scene, saying [...] "And what I like about that, and seeing her <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> you know then that her {{sexuality}} {{over the course of}} the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E

500|$|New York {{magazine}} {{wrote of}} the character: [...] "There's probably no woman on TV right now more single-mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established {{that she would have}} an abortion in this circumstance." [...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous. [...] made sense for the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing Izzie's {{relationship}} with Alex in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that [...] "Even when Alex {{was a complete}} dirtbag to her , she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over. [...] To go for a guy <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to say I want to be damaged.'" [...] Writer Stacy McKee deemed Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with [...] "the undeniably handsome - and totally charming" [...] Denny. Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? [...] She cut the LVAD wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the climactic}} battle, 150 extras stood {{in for the}} Narnians, while 300 extras {{were used for the}} Telmarines. These were {{digitally}} duplicated until there were 1,000 Narnians and 5,000 Telmarines onscreen. The animators found it easier to create entirely digital centaurs and fauns, rather than mix digital legs with real actors. The dryads were entirely computer-generated, whereas in the first film digital petals had been composited over actors. However, Adamson had chosen to make the centaurs not wear armour, meaning the animators had to make the human–horse join behave more cohesively. Combining digital characters with actors, such as when Lucy hugs Aslan, had become easier since the first film, as lighting had improved. To achieve Lucy hugging Aslan, Framestore even replaced Georgie Henley's arm with a digital version. For the gryphons, a motion control rig was created for the actors to ride on. The rig could simulate subtle movements such as wing beats for realism. Adamson cited the river-god as the character he was most proud of. [...] "It was a really masterful effect: to control water <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> incredibly difficult", he said. [...] "The [...] told us they'd been waiting to do a shot like that for ten years." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the eleven}} years {{up to and}} {{including}} Traviata, Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to Aida), he wrote only six new works for the stage. [...] Verdi was happy to return to Sant'Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a [...] "total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that's all". A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: [...] "I'm not doing anything. I don't read. I don't write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble caused me by I vespri siciliani. Cursed operas!" [...] An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: [...] "His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything you <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> exaggerated. [...] He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E

[...] She also further criticized Obama's {{proposal}} in 2007 to meet with Ahmadinejad without preconditions, stating that such an action [...] "is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad, who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe {{off the face of}} the Earth an ally like we have in Israel, should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, 2009, in an {{exclusive}} interview between The Bachelor season 13 contestant Megan Parris, and Steve Carbone, Megan commented that the producers edit the footage to create a fictional storyline.
