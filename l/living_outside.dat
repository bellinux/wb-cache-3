5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, and because of {{political}} and economical centralisation, a large number of Macedonians <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> of Skopje work in the capital city.

5|$|For much of {{the socialist}} period, the United States was a haven for many Serbian anti-communists <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> Yugoslavia. On 20 June 1979, a Serbian {{nationalist}} named Nikola Kavaja hijacked American Airlines Flight 293 from New York City {{with the intention of}} crashing the Boeing 707 into League of Communists of Yugoslavia headquarters in Belgrade. The aircraft, however, landed in Shannon, Ireland, where Kavaja were arrested.|$|E

5|$|The {{province}} had 12 county municipalities {{for over}} a century until the mid-1990s when 3 became regional municipalities.

5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|In 1875 no one <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> of two {{or three}} back streets of Lynn had heard of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> the empire's borders). Although there is little evidence of it before the 3rd century, the consensus is that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E

Uchtdorf as his first and second counselors, respectively. When Monson was born, there were fewer than 650,000 church members in the world, most of them living in the western United States. At the time he became the church's president, there were over 13 million members worldwide, with the majority <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> the United States and Canada. As of October 2012, 31 temples announced by Monson were either under construction or in planning.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of elected rural local government in Nova Scotia, 6 of the 18 historical counties were divided into districts for court sessional purposes. On April 17, 1879, these 6 historical counties were established as 12 district municipalities, rather than county municipalities, based on their previous district divisions. The district municipalities provide local government to the residents of the 6 historical counties <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> of incorporated towns. Nova Scotia's 12 district municipalities continue administratively as district municipalities under the authority of the Municipal Government Act of 1998.|$|E

5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E

5|$|During the Achaemenid period (550–330 BC), the Sogdians {{lived as}} a nomadic people {{much like the}} {{neighboring}} Yuezhi, who spoke Bactrian, an Indo-Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, and were already engaging in overland trade. Some of them had also gradually settled the land to engage in agriculture. Similar to how the Yuezhi offered tributary gifts of jade to the emperors of China, the Sogdians are recorded in Persian records as submitting precious gifts of lapis lazuli and carnelian to Darius I, the Persian king of kings. Although the Sogdians were at times independent and <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> the boundaries of large empires, they never formed a great empire of their own like the Yuezhi, who established the Kushan Empire (30–375 AD) of Central and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lusa is a pampered {{black bear}} {{living in the}} Bear Bowl, a zoo in Canada. Despite knowing that the {{wilderness}} is harsh, Lusa has dreams about one day escaping and <b>living</b> <b>outside.</b> Her father, King, once lived in the wild and is strongly against Lusa's idea. One day, Toklo's mom is brought into the Bear Bowl. She talks with Lusa about how much she regretted abandoning her cubs, {{but that it was}} too late and that she couldn't find them. Hearing this, Lusa decides to bring a message to Toklo about how sorry his mother is. Although Lusa succeeds in escaping, she realizes the dangers of the wild. At the end of the story, Ujurak and Toklo meet up with Lusa.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{stories to}} Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and Si Pitung; these stage plays centred on {{extraordinary}} men (referred to as jago) who, though <b>living</b> <b>outside</b> the law, generally {{fought for the}} common populace. Adaptations of the genre, manifested as bandit films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of Si Tjonat by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release {{was followed by the}} Wong brothers' Rampok Preanger (also 1929), and an adaptation of the Si Pitung stories in 1931. Not all films in this genre, which consisted of a quarter of all domestic releases for 1929–1931, maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of Si Pitung, for instance, portrayed him as a simple bandit and not the Robin Hood figure of stage.|$|E
