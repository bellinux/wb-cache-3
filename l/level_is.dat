On the bottom <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the second assistant keeper residence, some distance to the south, and a fuel store to the north.|$|E
5|$|Altimeter {{setting is}} a term and {{quantity}} used in aviation. The regional or local air pressure at mean sea <b>level</b> <b>is</b> called the altimeter setting, and the pressure which will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given QNH airfield.|$|E
50|$|Follicle-stimulating hormone and {{luteinizing hormone}} <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{considerably}} elevated (30-33 mIU/mL and 34-37 mIU/mL, respectively) and estradiol and estrone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> markedly elevated (145 pg/mL and 119-272 pg/mL, respectively), while testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> normal (445 ng/dL). Sex hormone-binding globulin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (6.0-10.0 nmol/L), while thyroxine-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> all normal. Osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> both substantially elevated (18.7-21.6 ng/mL and 33.3-35.9 ng/mL, respectively).|$|R

5|$|Between caves 5 and 6, {{on higher}} <b>level,</b> <b>is</b> an {{excavation}} originally intended either for a dwelling {{or for a}} seat, but converted into a cistern following discovery of a rock-fault. On its left side is a bench.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each <b>level</b> <b>is</b> to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the <b>level</b> <b>is</b> opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E
30|$|A polygon {{for each}} house was {{produced}} {{based on a}} field experiment, and the damage <b>level</b> information <b>was</b> attached to each polygon. The polygons with same damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated and were converted to raster data with 10 -m resolution, which matched the PALSAR- 2 processed data. The raster images for each damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated. There were several pixels in which different damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> assigned in the same pixel. In that case, the damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> averaged. The range, 3.5 ≤damaged level < 4.5 <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 4; 4.5 ≤damaged <b>level</b> <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 5.|$|R
50|$|Points are tallied {{up at the}} end of each level, {{successful}} completion of which will unlock additional <b>levels.</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> rated in difficulty using a star system; one star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> relatively easy, while five star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> the most difficult.|$|R
50|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{dramatically}} and persistently elevated (estradiol <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 2340 pg/mL, regarded as being about 10 times the normal level, and ranged from 750-3500 pg/mL), gonadotropin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 6.7-19.1 mIU/mL and 5.8-13.2 mIU/mL, respectively), and testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> slightly elevated (33-88 ng/dL). Inhibin A <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also markedly elevated. Sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin, and triglycerides, which {{are known to}} be elevated by estrogen, were all within normal ranges in spite of the extremely high levels of estrogen, and inhibin B <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also normal. Her relatively mildly elevated <b>levels</b> of gonadotropins <b>were</b> attributed to retained negative feedback by progesterone as well as by her elevated levels of testosterone and inhibin A, although it was acknowledged that possible effects of estrogen mediated by other receptors such as ERβ could not be excluded.|$|R
5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the <b>level</b> <b>is</b> completed and the next <b>level</b> <b>is</b> unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the <b>level</b> <b>is</b> incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|Keto{{acidosis}} is {{not always}} the result of diabetes. It may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation; in both states the glucose <b>level</b> <b>is</b> normal or low. Metabolic acidosis may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or paraldehyde.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers go {{to great}} lengths to protect custom moulds due to their high average costs. The perfect {{temperature}} and humidity <b>level</b> <b>is</b> maintained to ensure the longest possible lifespan for each custom mould. Custom moulds, such as those used for rubber injection moulding, are stored in temperature and humidity controlled environments to prevent warping.|$|E
5000|$|Estradiol and LH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{dramatically}} elevated due to loss {{of negative}} feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. FSH <b>levels,</b> in contrast, <b>are</b> normal. Testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> also substantially elevated. Prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> decreased by 5-fold, which {{is due to}} a loss of its estradiol-induced secretion from the anterior pituitary.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 2009, the {{basement}} <b>level</b> <b>was</b> flooded when Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) battered the capital. The appliance center, supermarket, food court and other retail stores located at {{the basement}} <b>level</b> <b>were</b> heavily damaged. The basement <b>level</b> <b>was</b> temporarily closed for several days.|$|R

5|$|Selenium deficiency, {{defined by}} low (<60% of normal) {{selenoenzyme}} activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues, occurs {{only when a}} low selenium <b>level</b> <b>is</b> linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or increased oxidant stress from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some {{guidelines}} {{recommend a}} bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered {{immediately after the}} potassium <b>level</b> <b>is</b> known {{to be higher than}} 3.3mmol/l; if the <b>level</b> <b>is</b> any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections under the skin for mild or moderate cases.|$|E

Goalkeeper Victor is the player with the most appearances in international competitions for the club, with 41; forwards Guilherme and Jô are Atlético's top goalscorers with 11 goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of neurological symptoms, Kayser–Fleischer rings {{and a low}} ceruloplasmin <b>level</b> <b>is</b> considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.|$|E
5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin <b>level</b> <b>is</b> less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|Based on Béla Bánáthy's {{original}} work, {{the program}} is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and more advanced levels of instruction. Each <b>level</b> <b>is</b> tailored {{to the needs of}} youth at specific ages and maturity levels.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper <b>level</b> <b>is</b> currently in service; the lower <b>level</b> <b>is</b> neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The {{difference is}} that the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, offers more puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a <b>level</b> <b>is</b> recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
