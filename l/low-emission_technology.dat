40|$|Abstract – Gas fueled {{power plants}} have been exten-sively built {{all around the world}} while they are a high efficiency, <b>low-emission</b> <b>technology</b> with short {{building}} time. During some years they were also very interesting from an economic point of view. Nevertheless, prices are currently increasing and besides gas {{is becoming more and more}} a strategic element, what may suggest the need to constraint the dependence on this fuel. This paper presents a method for analyzing the impact of the measures that the system regulator could use in order to constraint the number of gas-fueled plants to be built. This may include mandatory reference planning, taxes on gas, or the promotion of substitutive technologies. The analysis uses a system-dynamics-based model that represents in detail the process of generation expansion. It consists of four major modules: market representation, price forecasting, investment decision and plant building. The results in a particular system show that subsidizing renewable technologies, is a very interesting alternative, both from the cost point of view, and because it requires less additional measures to maintain reserve margin and reasonable prices...|$|E
40|$|Though {{the trend}} of {{greenhouse}} gas emission is declining, the equivalent of 6, 870 million metric tons of CO 2 was emitted in the United States in 2014. [1] About one quarter of this pollution is emitted by the transportation sector. [2] Instead {{of waiting for the}} next technological development in transportation to provide us with clean vehicles, what if we could adopt past transportation systems to reduce our emissions and increase future sustainability? This study explores the idea of adopting intra- and inter-urban electric rail and a people’s car to reduce the annual U. S. transportation emissions using historical examples, the most recent studies published on emissions, and articles discussing the sociological impacts of transportation. Recently, the U. S. has seen the biggest railroad investments in the last 100 years, giving the country a huge opportunity to reintroduce electric rail. Since it is not feasible to reach everyone with public transit, private vehicles also need to shift towards sustainability as well by using <b>low-emission</b> <b>technology</b> currently available in a flexible manner so it is possible to upgrade the vehicle when newer technology is released. The major limitation of this study is the scope of this issue, and due to this the cultural feasibility of adopting these systems, the financial cost, detailed estimates on the actual amounts of emissions prevented, and alternative transportation systems were not heavily addressed...|$|E

40|$|Coke plants, {{which produce}} {{various types of}} coke (metallurgical, foundry or heating), at {{temperatures}} between 600 and 1200 °C, with limited access to oxygen, are major emitters of particulates and gaseous pollutants to air, water and soils. Primarily, the process of wet quenching should be mentioned, {{as one of the}} most cumbersome. Atmospheric pollutants include particulates, tar substances, organic pollutants including B(a) P and many others. Pollutants are also formed from the decomposition of water used to quench coke (CO, phenol, HCN, H 2 S, NH 3, cresol) and decomposition of hot coke in the first phase of quenching (CO, H 2 S, SO 2) [1]. The development of the coke oven technology has resulted in the changes made to different types of technological installations, such as the use of baffles in quench towers, the removal of nitrogen oxides by selective NOx reduction, and the introduction of fabric filters for particulates removal. The BAT conclusions for coke plants [2] provide a methodology for the measurement of particulate emission from a wet, <b>low-emission</b> <b>technology</b> using Mohrhauer probes. The conclusions define the emission level for wet quenching process as 25 g/Mgcoke. The conducted research was aimed at verification of the presented method. For two of three quench towers (A and C) the requirements included in the BAT conclusions are not met and emissions amount to 87. 34 and 61. 35 g/Mgcoke respectively.

40|$|There {{are many}} factors that {{influence}} the day-ahead market bidding strategies of a generation company (GenCo) in the current energy market framework. Environmental policy issues have {{become more and more}} important for fossil-fuelled power plants {{and they have to be}} considered in their management, giving rise to emission limitations. This work allows investigating the influence of the emission reduction plan, and the incorporation of the derivatives medium-term commitments in the optimal generation bidding strategy to the day-ahead electricity market. Two different technologies have been considered: the coal thermal units, high-emission technology, and the combined cycle gas turbine units, <b>low-emission</b> <b>technology.</b> The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) and the Spanish National Emission Reduction Plan (NERP) defines the environmental framework to deal with by the day-ahead market bidding strategies. To address emission limitations, some of the standard risk management methodologies developed for financial markets, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Valueat- Risk (CVaR), have been extended giving rise to the new concept of Conditional Emission at Risk (CEaR). This study offers to electricity generation utilities a mathematical model to determinate the individual optimal generation bid to the wholesale electricity market, for each one of their generation units that maximizes the long-run profits of the utility abiding by the Iberian Electricity Market rules, as well as the environmental restrictions set by the Spanish National Emissions Reduction Plan. The economic implications for a GenCo of including the environmental restrictions of this National Plan are analyzed, and the effect of the NERP in the expected profits and optimal generation bid are analyzed.

40|$|The {{question}} of how different climate policies will influence carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions in the energy-intensive industry is complex. It is not obvious that increased costs for emitting CO 2 will lead to investments in new, low-emission technologies, since the energy-intensive industry is very capital intensive, and reduced CO 2 emissions beyond a certain point require large investments and possibly also radical process changes. Traditionally, either top-down or bottom-up models {{have been used to}} analyze the influence of specific policies on energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions in industry. Bottom-up models describe technologies in detail, but are not realistic in their characterization of corporate decision-making, e. g., how businesses select technologies and make investments, and fail to depict macro-economic equilibrium feedbacks. Top-down models, in contrast, address these deficiencies by representing macro-economic feedbacks and by estimating parameters of technological change from observations of aggregate market responsiveness to cost changes. However, since top-down models lack technological detail, they are weak in assessing the use of new, <b>low-emission</b> <b>technology.</b> Because of these methodological differences, top-down and bottom-up models often make divergent cost predictions, and consequently suggest different policies, for meeting climate targets. This methodological divide has stimulated exploration of hybrid approaches that integrate the technological explicitness of bottom-up models with the micro-economic realism and macro-economic feedbacks of top-down models. To better understand the dynamics and policy responses of industry, such methods and models need to be further developed and applied. In this paper we analyse and compare top-down, bottom-up, and integrated (hybrid) approaches that have been used for evaluating potentials for CO 2 emissions reductions and CO 2 policy analysis in energy-intensive industry. We also evaluate the usefulness of these approaches and models to policy and decision makers...|$|E

40|$|Australia’s year-old {{energy policy}} is {{already out of}} date, argue Allan Fels and Fred Brenchley IF AUSTRALIA were thrown back on its own oil {{resources}} tomorrow it would have enough supplies for just nine years and four months. Some time in 2014 the heavily transport-dependent economy would literally grind to a halt. The bare nine-and-a-bit years of self-sufficiency is the new figure from GeoScience Australia, based on known reserves. The previous figure was 11. 1 years, but reserves are dwindling. In the post- 9 / 11 world, such a sobering calculation should inject a note of urgency into energy policies. To be fair, {{the federal government is}} reviewing fuel emergency procedures, examining ideas to encourage dual-fuel conversion petrol with LPG of essential services such as police, ambulances and fire brigades, as well as part of the food-distribution system. But this is a sidelight. The main energy game - Australia’s reliance on imported oil, its petrol and diesel economy, and its failure to develop alternative and perhaps renewable fuels - remains largely ignored. Indeed, government policies are actually accentuating the problem. Take the idea now being refined by Treasury for a new fuel excise regime that will make all off-road diesel excise free, and hence very attractive to farmers, as opposed to local LPG. The farmers are happy, but it is poor public policy. Diesel is refined from imported oil. It is also a pollutant. The result {{is that we have a}} policy that disadvantages the local alternative fuel industry, accentuates environmental pollution and adds to the nation’s current account deficit. European governments are actively using excise as a lever to get users off diesel. Australia, in its wisdom, is going the other way. How such a triple whammy got past cabinet, and has since escaped the attention of the opposition, speaks volumes for the lack of concern about a serious energy policy. Only last June, Canberra produced an energy white paper, long on trumpeting the importance of the sector, $ 50 billion in consumption and $ 24 billion in exports, but short on fundamental reforms. The ‘major new actions’ included, unbelievably, the fuel excise reforms, some encouragement for cleaner and alternative energy via a ‘Solar City’ trial and a fund for private investment in <b>low-emission</b> <b>technology,</b> more regulation on business to manage energy use, and enhancing exploration incentives. Events of the past ten months have shot the ground out from under the white paper. It was premised on oil at $US 35 a barrel. Since then oil has plateaued at about $US 50 a barrel, and many expect it go higher. Rereading the white paper’s dismissal of alternative fuels in the light of the oil price super-spike, one cannot help but be struck at the head-in-the-sand attitude. ‘Australia is in the position of having access to potentially large reserves of alternative fuels, such as biofuels, or conventional fuels from new sources such as shale or natural gas,’ it said, at least acknowledging the vast national potential. ‘However, these fuels are more expensive than oil-derived petrol and diesel, and technical impediments exist to widespread use of some alternative fuels. ‘Pursuing these fuels now as a large-scale replacement for oil-derived petrol and diesel, even given currently high oil prices, would weaken Australia’s competitiveness and potentially weaken its energy security position. ’ Pardon? How an alternative fuels industry would weaken energy security against the background of the war on terrorism, skyrocketing oil prices and dire warnings of our vulnerability beggars belief. It reads more like an extract from a Big Oil handbook than a government report. The white paper, however, achieved some saving grace when it noted: ‘The existence of these resources and of investors seeking to develop them gives substantial comfort that Australia will be well-placed to respond should world oil prices increase substantially in the longer term. ’ Well, they have. But investors don’t wait around for new industry mirages. Australia should urgently revisit the white paper. US President George Bush wants Americans to kick their dependence on foreign oil and is heavily promoting new exploration as well as hydrogen energy and biofuels. Australia needs a more competitive energy market. That means not just supply-side development incentives for biofuels but actively encouraging a demand-side take-up by consumers as well as blending by oil companies. The International Energy Agency says that biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel not only cut harmful emissions but require time to develop and need government encouragement. That means white-hot action, not an outdated white paper. Allan Fels is dean of the Australia and New Zealand School of Government.

40|$|Key points The cost of {{effective}} global and Australian mitigation will be materially lower if opportunities for innovation in <b>low-emissions</b> <b>technologies</b> are fully utilised. There is too little private investment in innovation generally {{in the absence}} of public fiscal support. The urgency of the adjustment task and the large change in incentives derived from carbon pricing justify a large transitional increase in public support for innovation related to <b>low-emissions</b> <b>technology.</b> Global public expenditure on research, development, demonstration and commercialisation of <b>low-emissions</b> <b>technologies</b> increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Crash of 2008, reversing several decades of decline in investment in innovation in alternative energy and energy saving technologies. The increased global effort has accelerated progress in cost reductions in low emissions energy across several technologies. Substantial increases in investment in innovation are still warranted. A new feature of the global innovation effort is a substantial contribution from China and then India. Australia should do its proportionate part as a developed country in the global innovation effort: in basic research focusing on areas where we have comparative advantage in research capacity and strong national interest in application; in commercialisation, following business priorities backed by investment commitments; and reducing other costs of innovation by expanding relevant high-level education and removing regulatory and legal barriers to new activities. Australian policy on research, development, demonstration and commercialisation has evolved in productive ways since the Review. New general mechanisms for supporting commercial research and development can play a productive role in delivering additional support for low-emissions innovation at the commercialisation end of the chain. To ensure the optimal level of innovation in Australia in the transition to a low-emissions economy, I propose a package of measures including: increasing support for public and private basic research; market-led support for private demonstration and commercialisation; the <b>Low-Emissions</b> <b>Technology</b> Commitment on total funding, leading to roughly a doubling of research, development and commercialisation expenditure to $ 2 - 3 billion per annum; and strong and independent governance arrangements.

40|$|We {{propose that}} an {{international}} ‘Low-Emissions Technology Commitment’ should {{be incorporated into}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiation process in order to promote innovation that will enable deep decarbonization. The goal is to accelerate research, development, and demonstration of safe, scalable, and affordable <b>low-emissions</b> energy <b>technologies.</b> Such a commitment should be based on three elements. First, it should operate within existing UNFCCC negotiations so as to encourage developed states to offer directed funding for energy research as part of their national contributions. Second, pledges should be binding, verifiable, and coordinated within an international energy-research plan. Third, expert scientific networks and participating governments should collaborate to design a coordinated global research and technology-demonstration strategy and oversee national research efforts. To this end an Intergovernmental Panel on <b>Low-Emissions</b> <b>Technology</b> Research might be established. This proposal offers some insurance against the risk that the political impasse in international negotiations cannot be overcome. The higher costs associated with low-emissions alternatives to fossil fuels currently creates significant economic and political resistance to their widespread adoption. To breach this impasse, a mechanism supporting accelerated energy research is needed that seeks to reduce future abatement costs, share experience and ‘learning-by-doing’ in first-of-a-kind demonstrations, and thus facilitate future widespread deployments. These actions will also assist in addressing inequalities in energy access. Barry W. Brook, Kingsley Edney, Rafaela Hillerbrand, Rasmus Karlsson & Jonathan Symon...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the possibilities for}} interfuel substitution in Australia {{in view of the}} need to shift towards a cleaner mix of fuels and technologies to meet future energy demand and environmental goals. The translog cost function is estimated for the aggregate economy, the manufacturing sector and its subsectors, and the electricity generation subsector. The advantages of this work over previous literature relating to the Australian case are that it uses relatively recent data, focuses on energy-intensive subsectors and estimates the Morishima elasticities of substitution. The empirical evidence shown herein indicates weak-form substitutability between different energy types, and higher possibilities for substitution at lower levels of aggregation, compared with the aggregate economy. For the electricity generation subsector, which is at the centre of the CO 2 emissions problem in Australia, significant but weak substitutability exists between coal and gas when the price of coal changes. A higher substitution possibility exists between coal and oil in this subsector. The evidence for the own- and cross-price elasticities, together with the results for fuel efficiencies, indicates that a large increase in relative prices could be justified to further stimulate the market for <b>low-emission</b> <b>technologies.</b> ...|$|R

If “green” preferences are exogenously given, to what extent can or should they be regarded as a substitute for other policies? Even with green preferences, production and consumption of polluting goods continues to impose social costs not borne in the market. Moreover, if green preferences are regarded as a policy instrument, the “no policy” baseline would require a problematic specification of counterfactual “non-green” preferences. Viewing green preferences as a regulatory policy instrument is conceptually sensible if the benchmark for optimal emissions is based on value judgments apart from preferences consumers happen to have. If so, optimal environmental protection would be defined by reference to ethical theory or, even less favorably, by prescriptions from policy advocates who give their own preferences great weight while giving those of the public at large (and the costs they bear) very little consideration.

Since commercial and military aircraft are the only important direct source of NOx emissions at high altitudes, there is a growing consensus that considerably more stringent limits on NOx emissions will be required in the future for all aircraft. In fact, the regulatory communities have recently agreed to reduce NOx limits by 20 percent from current requirements effective in 1996. Further reductions at low altitude, together with introduction of limits on NOx at altitude, are virtual certainties. In addition, the U. S. Government recently conducted hearings on the introduction of federal fees on the local emission of pollutants from all sources, including aircraft. While no action was taken regarding aircraft in this instance, the threat of future action clearly remains. In these times of intense and growing international competition, the U. S. le-ad in aerospace can only be maintained through a clear technological dominance that leads to a product line of maximum value to the global airline customer. Development of a very low NOx combustor will be essential to meet the future needs of both the commercial and military transport markets, if additional economic burdens and/or operational restrictions are to be avoided. In this report, Pratt & Whitney (P&W) presents the study results with the following specific objectives: Development of <b>low-emissions</b> combustor <b>technologies</b> for advances engines that will enter into service circa 2005, while producing a goal of 70 percent lower NOx emissions, compared to 1996 regulatory levels. Identification of solution approaches to barriers to the productization and economic viability of the <b>low-emissions</b> <b>technologies.</b> Preparation of these technologies to facilitate an annular rig high-pressure demonstration...|$|R

In contrast,the increase of population in the world has an effect to the need ofbiological resources for food, industry, medicine, etc. Human activitiesin several sectors, such as energy, forestry, agriculture, husbandry,and waste create a greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effects are due to arise of greenhouse gases, such as CO 2 (carbon dioxide), CH 4 (methane),N 2 O (nitrogen dioxide), PFCS (perfluorocarbon), HFCS (hydrofluoro-carbon), SF 6 (sulfurhexafluoride), and H 2 O (water vapor). Studiessuggest that climate change may also cause the melting of polar ice-caps, rising sea levels, and a shift of season. Global climate changewiil also have a wide range of effects on human health, including a riskof infectious disease epidemics. Therefore, climate change is a seriouslythreat for the world and it is necessary to have a global agreement tocombat the threat. In 2005, Kyoto Protocol was agreed and The CleanDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) is a the Kyoto Protocol 2 ̆ 7 s mechanismaimed at helping industrialized countries meet their greenhouse gasreduction targets. The CDM is also meant to help developing countriesachieve sustainable development, including facilitating the transfer and/or development of <b>low-emission</b> <b>technologies.</b> Long term collectiveefforts are needed to combat and adapt with adverse effects of globalwarming, especially for the extinction of biological diversity...|$|R
