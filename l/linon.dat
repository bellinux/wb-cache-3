The Anglo-Arabian <b>Linon</b> was ridden to an Olympic silver medal for France in Dressage in 1928 and 1932, {{as well as}} a team gold in 1932, and another French Anglo-Arabian, Harpagon, was ridden to a team gold medal and an individual silver in dressage at the 1948 Olympics. At the 1952 Olympics, the French rider Pierre d'Oriola won the Gold individual medal in show jumping on the Anglo-Arabian Ali Baba. Another Anglo-Arabian, Tamarillo, ridden by William Fox-Pitt, represents the United Kingdom in FEI and Olympic competition, winning many awards, including first place at the 2004 Badminton Horse Trials. More recently a gelding named Theodore O'Connor, nicknamed [...] "Teddy", a 14.1 (or 14.2, sources vary) hand pony of Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Shetland pony breeding, won two gold medals at the 2007 Pan American Games and was finished in the top six at the 2007 and 2008 Rolex Kentucky Three Day CCI competition.|$|E

50|$|The word linen is of West Germanic {{origin and}} cognate to the Latin {{name for the}} flax plant, linum, and the earlier Greek λινόν (<b>linón).</b> This word history {{has given rise to}} a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to {{determine}} a straight line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{records of}} an established linen industry are 4,000 years old, from Egypt. The earliest written documentation of a linen industry {{comes from the}} Linear B tablets of Pylos, Greece, where linen is depicted as an ideogram and also written as [...] "li-no" [...] (Greek: λίνον, <b>linon),</b> and the female linen workers are cataloged as [...] "li-ne-ya" [...] (λίνεια, lineia).|$|E
50|$|With {{the help}} of Zoticus, Gisel is able to escape {{attempts}} on her life and journeys to Sarantium. Zoticus, upon learning that the pagan god had not forgotten nor relinquished his right to {{the souls of the}} human sacrifices given to him, journeyed to the forested area where <b>Linon</b> had sacrificed herself to the zubir. There he allows the remaining souls in his mechanical birds to be released back to the god and accepts his death from the zubir, a punishment from taking the souls of the sacrificed woman in the first place.|$|E
50|$|In Sarantium, Crispin {{has further}} settled into his work of {{creating}} the mosaic in the sanctuary. He plans to immortalize his wife and daughters, as well as <b>Linon</b> and {{an image of the}} zubir, alongside Jad. Carullus has proposed to Kasia and their wedding draws together most of the influential people of the city through the help of their friends. Upon arriving, Rustem's servant (who is secretly his guard and protector) is murdered by an aristocrat's son, and through the events of fleeing for his life, he arrives at the wedding as a guest of Crispin. There he approaches the father of his servant's murderer and secures himself with a home and protection in the city as compensation. Rustem quickly established himself but is disturbed when he receives an order from the King of Kings to assassinate a woman.|$|E

50|$|Crispin {{starts his}} journey under the assumed {{identity}} of Martinian, hiring Vargos as his man servant. The {{night before the}} Day of the Dead, during which Zoticus warned him not to travel, Crispin arrives at an inn where a slave girl, Kisia, begs him to save her, having figured out she is to be given as a human sacrifice to the pagan god on the Day of the Dead. Despite devising an ingenious plan that forces the innkeeper to give him ownership of Kisia, the group are still pursued as they leave the inn, deeming it necessary to travel on the Day of the Dead despite all warnings. They are saved by a zubir, a corporeal representation of the pagan god, which then brings them to the forested area where the human sacrifices are performed. <b>Linon</b> realizes the god wants only her, revealing {{that she was a}} girl to be sacrificed to the god long ago but her soul was saved and placed in the bird by Zoticus. She sacrifices herself, releasing her soul from the bird, and allowing the others to leave unharmed.|$|E
50|$|Fifteen years later, Petrus {{has succeeded}} his uncle, naming himself Valerius II and making Alixana, {{formerly}} Aliana, his empress. Valerius II commissions a great sanctuary for Jad and summons Martinian of Batiara, a renowned mosiacist, to decorate it. The royal request is sent with Pronobius Tilliticus, an Imperial Courier, who delays {{delivery of the}} message while pursuing personal pleasure along the road. Martinian, partially on whim and partially believing himself too old to travel, causes Tilliticus to mistake his friend and colleague Caius Crispus ("Crispin") of Rhodias for him, delivering the message in a public fashion. Crispin is reluctant to accept the prestigious summons, having lost the desire to live when {{his wife and two}} daughters died of the plague the previous year. Having taken too long receive the summons, the season no longer allows Crispin to Sail to Sarantium; he must take the road. Martinian sends Crispin to talk to his old and well-traveled friend Zoticus for advice on his journey. Zoticus reveals himself to have some supernatural powers and gives Crispin a mechanical bird, <b>Linon,</b> that is alive, being able to both talk to him aloud and within his mind. He also gives Crispin the name of his daughter and another person in Sarantium who may be able to help him.|$|E
40|$|Sophy Jenny <b>Linon</b> : Crossing {{the line}} or the sea carnaval : Luillier (1705) and Legat (1707). In the early 18 th century, travel {{accounts}} often went beyond simple, direct facturai descriptions, {{as if they}} were trying, despite their claim to authenticity, {{to go back to the}} tradition of mythical accounts. Thus the 'baptism' ceremony celebrated when crossing the line — which is staged like a carnaval — proposes to restructure the vision of the world. This initiatory account which involves both crossing and diving, festival and exorcism, is marked by several symbolic reversals and indicates, beyond the apparent libertarian Utopia, that one is entering an upside-down world. <b>Linon</b> Sophy-Jenny.
