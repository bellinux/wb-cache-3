Macroscale techniques like mill and <b>lathe</b> <b>machining</b> have been successful used to create features in the range of 25 µm. Meso Machine tools (mMTs), for example miniaturized milling machine, is a expansion of using traditional macroscale techniques to manufacture mesoscale products. With the limitation of self-excited vibration of machine tools and fatigue, microassembly and micro- and mesoscale milling are created to improve the maximum stiffness and dynamic operation of the milling process, which improves the overall performance of manufacturing. The development of mMTs has revealed many challenges that are specific to machining at the small scales. These challenges stem from the large influence of grain size at small scales and the necessity of extremely small tolerances for both the machine tools and the measuring tools.|$|E
