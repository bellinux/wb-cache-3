40|$|Overturning Mammon: The <b>Living</b> <b>Theatre</b> and Symbolic Capital {{focuses on}} the first {{thirteen}} years of the <b>Living</b> <b>Theatre,</b> founded by Judith Malina and Julian Beck. Pierre Bourdieu’s theories of cultural production provide the theoretical tools to approach the company as a cultural producer and not only as <b>theatre</b> artists. The <b>Living</b> <b>Theatre</b> has produced largely unpopular avant-garde and political theatre for seventy years. I argue that the company’s early years demonstrate a growing reserve of symbolic capital that helps explain the company’s longevity. Furthermore, {{the manner in which}} certain events in the company’s history have been mythologized, by company members, critics, and scholars, has led to some historically inaccurate accounts. In particular, accounts of the closing of the company’s production of The Brig in 1963 and the subsequent trial of Beck and Malina in 1964 have often been influenced by an acceptance of company member’s anecdotal, “tall tales” approach to history rather than historical evidence and archival documents. This project redresses this lack of historical inquiry using a variety of primary and archival sources to argue that the material and historical exigencies of the <b>Living</b> <b>Theatre</b> offer theatre scholars an example of how symbolic capital can overturn economic “reality. ...|$|R
