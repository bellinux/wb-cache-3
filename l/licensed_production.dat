5|$|Having in February 1964 {{decided to}} produce its own battle tank, Israel at first {{considered}} licence production of AMX-30 hulls, while importing the turrets from France.

5|$|In 2002, AgustaWestland, Kawasaki and Marubeni {{entered a}} general {{agreement}} for cooperation; Kawasaki began {{the assembly of}} both the CH-101 and the MCH-101 in 2003. Kawasaki also began <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> of the RTM322 engines in 2005. In a separate agreement between Marubeni and AgustaWestland, a supply depot was established in Japan to support the MCH-101 and CH-101 fleets. The first MCH-101 was delivered to the JMSDF on 3 March 2006.|$|E
5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E

25|$|The Americans did {{not pursue}} the {{proposal}} for <b>licensed</b> <b>production,</b> the consensus {{arguing that the}} Lockheed P-38 Lightning could fulfill the same duties. However, Arnold urged the United States Army Air Forces to evaluate the design even if they would not adopt it. Several days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USAAF requested one airframe, on 12 December 1941, indicating their recognition that they had entered the war without a fast dual-purpose reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, China {{acquired}} eight SA 342L combat helicopters; {{these were}} the first dedicated attack helicopters to be operated by the People's Liberation Army. The purchase of further aircraft, including <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> of the aircraft in China, had been under consideration, but this initiative was apparently abandoned {{following the end of}} the Cold War. The small fleet was used to develop anti-armour warfare tactics, Gazelles have also been frequently used to simulate hostile forces during military training exercises.|$|E
25|$|Fuji Heavy Industries was {{established}} in July 1952 as a successor to Nakajima, and undertook <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> of the Beech T-34 trainer aircraft as its first product.

25|$|By December 1918, Holt Thomas {{claimed in}} an {{advertisement}} that Airco {{was the largest}} aircraft {{company in the world}} and was building aeroplanes, engines and propellors in large numbers, as well as airships and flying boats. The engines being built included <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> of Gnome and Le Rhone rotary engines. The company's works at Hendon employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people and had the latest metal-working machinery, a materials testing laboratory, and a wind tunnel. Airco was completing on average a new aircraft every 45 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Vickers {{set up a}} {{partnership}} with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the patented system of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated light alloy skin panels, and made for easy maintenance and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential <b>licensed</b> <b>production.</b> The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing parasol monoplanes.|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle {{proved to}} be a {{commercial}} success, which led Aerospatiale to quickly develop and introduce the SA 342 Gazelle series, which was equipped with uprated powerplants. <b>Licensed</b> <b>production</b> of the type did not just take place in the UK, domestic manufacturing was also conducted by Egyptian firm ABHCO. Yugoslavian production by SOKO reportedly produced a total of 132 Gazelles. As the Gazelle became progressively older, newer combat helicopters were brought into service in the anti-tank role; thus those aircraft previously configured as attack helicopters were often repurposed for other, secondary support duties, such as an Air Observation Post (AOP) for directing artillery fire, airborne forward air controller (ABFAC) to direct ground-attack aircraft, casualty evacuation, liaison, and communications relay missions.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, the United States {{blocked a}} major {{prospective}} sale to India, {{which would have}} involved selling a number of Swedish-built Viggens {{in addition to a}} <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> agreement under which the Viggen would also have been built in India, by not issuing an export license for the RM8/JT8D engine and other American technologies used. India later opted to procure the SEPECAT Jaguar in its place. According to leaked US diplomatic cables, India's interest in the Viggen was reported to be entirely due to Rajiv Gandhi's influence, and had alleged have been without any input from the Indian Air Force. According to author Chris Smith, the Viggen had been the favoured candidate for the Indian Air Force prior to the deal being blocked by the US.|$|E
25|$|Different sources {{claim the}} ARJ21 closely resembles either the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 or the MD-90 which were license-produced in China. Chinese {{factories}} producing parts for the MD-90 {{went on to}} produce the ARJ21 using tooling retained {{after the end of}} the MD-80/MD-90 <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> program.. China claims that the ARJ21 is a completely indigenous design in spite of the fact that production drawings seen for the fuselage during development were simply McDonnell Douglas drawings with the identifying legend overlaid with a Chinese legend. The ARJ21's development did depend heavily on foreign suppliers, including engines and avionics from the United States. The ARJ21 features an all-new supercritical wing having a sweepback of 25degrees and designed by Ukraine’s Antonov Design Bureau. It is fitted with winglets to improve aerodynamic performance. Antonov also assisted the project with geometrical determination and integral analysis of the construction strength of ARJ21. Some of China's supercomputers have been used to design parts for ARJ21.|$|E
25|$|The British were {{concerned}} their production would be inadequate and <b>licensed</b> <b>production</b> of the Hispano to the US. However, the US production never became satisfactory and the British eventually {{gave up on}} the U.S. versions. British production was eventually increased {{to the point where}} this was no longer an issue. The ultimate version of the British wartime Hispanos was the Hispano Mk. V, which had a shorter barrel, and lacked the cocking cylinder thus requiring manual cocking before flight. It was lighter and had a higher rate of fire (desirable in aircraft armament), although at the expense of some muzzle velocity. The shorter barrel meant that the weapon could be housed within the wing of a fighter plane, reducing drag and making them less vulnerable to freezing and mechanical stress. One of the main British fighters to use the Mk. V was the Hawker Tempest Mk. V Series II, which mounted two cannon in each wing. Ammunition types available included Semi-Armour Piercing, Incendiary (SAPI) and High Explosive, Incendiary (HEI). Around 42,500 Hispano cannon of various Marks were manufactured by Birmingham Small Arms (BSA).|$|E
