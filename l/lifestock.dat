5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit <b>lifestock</b> grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{all species}} kept in marine aquaria {{at this time}} {{are caught in the}} wild, {{although}} tank-raised specimens are becoming increasingly common as a viable alternative. Only a few species such as clownfish are captive-bred on a commercial scale. Much collecting is done in Indonesia and the Philippines, where use of cyanide and other destructive collection methods, while discouraged, is unfortunately common. The majority of live rock is also harvested in the wild, and recent restrictions on this harvest in Florida have caused a shift to Fijian and aquacultured rock. Natural rock, because it is created by coral polyps, takes many years if not centuries to form, and is a vital habitat for countless marine species; thus, commercial-scale harvesting of naturally occurring live rock has been criticized by conservationists. Additionally, many animal species sold to hobbyists have very specific dietary and habitat requirements that cannot be met by hobbyists (e.g. Labroides genus wrasses, the moorish idol); these animals almost inevitably die quickly and have markedly reduced lifespans compared to wild specimens. Often these specific environmental requirements cause improperly housed <b>lifestock's</b> color and appearance to be poor. These issues are often downplayed by individuals and organizations with a financial interest in the trade. Hobbyists who support conservation should buy only certified net-caught fish (although ensuring the legitimacy of such claims can be difficult) or captive-raised fish, as well as farmed corals and to support legitimate reef conservation efforts. The majority of corals can be [...] "fragged", whereby a portion of a larger captive coral is separated and can subsequently be raised into an individual specimen, allowing for coral propagation within the domestic aquarium; the trade in frags (i.e. fragments) offers a fantastic opportunity for marine aquarists to obtain new and unique corals while limiting the impact on the natural environment. Rare species and those without a history of being successfully kept in captivity should be avoided.|$|R

25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common eland and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic <b>lifestock,</b> eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, in {{the course}} of the {{communist}} collectivisation of the agriculture started in 1952, Banzendorf's farmers were urged to join the local Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft (LPG, Agricultural Production Comradeship or Community; the East German variants of the kolkhoz). At first it was an LPG of type I which meant the farmers' lands were cultivated under a collective plan, a kind of modern Flurzwang, whereas <b>lifestock</b> and machinery was kept familywise. Until 1960 all farmers of Banzendorf had joined the LPG. In 1968 Banzendorf's LPG became part of the superior planning unit Kooperative Abteilung Pflanzenproduktion (cooperative department of plant production) and as such an LPG of type III, meaning land, machinery, <b>lifestock</b> and agricultural buildings were used according to central prerogatives. Since 1968 Banzendorf's LPG also tilled fields previously used by the LPG in neighbouring Dierberg, whereas the latter's LPG specialised in <b>lifestock</b> taking on Banzendorf's <b>lifestock.</b> So central stables and barns were constructed in Dierberg close to the street to Banzendorf, whereas the stables and barns in private farmsteads were evacuated, except for little stock of small domestic animals allowed for private maintenance.|$|E
