Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish, which creates tension between them. Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her <b>life</b> <b>now,</b> and that they do not even make her dream house in Scranton. She then breaks down and cries in front of the camera.

25|$|Also in 1934, {{scientists}} Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck, {{produced the}} radioactive isotope tritium by hitting deuterium with high energy nuclei. The deuterium {{used in the}} experiment was a generous gift of heavy water from the Berkeley physicist Gilbert N Lewis. Interestingly, bombarding deuterium produced two previously undetected isotopes, helium-3 and hydrogen-3. Rutherford and his colleagues successfully created tritium, but incorrectly assumed that helium-3 was the radioactive component. The work of Luis Walter Alvarez and Robert Cornog first isolated tritium and reversed Rutherford's incorrect notion. Alvarez reasoned that tritium was radioactive, but did not measure the half life, although calculations at the time suggested over ten years. At the end of World War II, the physical chemist Willard Libby detected the residual radioactivity of a tritium sample with a Geiger counter, providing a more accurate understanding of the half <b>life,</b> <b>now</b> accepted at 12.3 years.|$|E
25|$|After {{watching}} his embarrassing birthday party video and being mocked by his friends with gag gifts, Barney finally sees he is a hideous drunk, and he promises to get sober. At first, he finds sustaining sobriety tough, but he finds {{his way to}} an AA meeting with Homer's help. Meanwhile, to get their picture {{on the cover of}} the new phone book, Bart and Lisa decide to enter an amateur photo contest. In the closet, they find an old camera and start to take snapshots. Elsewhere, Barney makes plans to change his <b>life</b> <b>now</b> that he is clean and sober. The Springfield Flight School is his first stop, where he takes helicopter-flying lessons. At Moe's Tavern, Homer is treated as the new Barney and is forced by Moe, Lenny and Carl to perform drunken antics. Barney gives Homer a ride in the helicopter a few lessons later. While in the air, the two men fight about Barney's new sobriety and Homer's unhappiness that they no longer have ridiculous adventures.|$|E
25|$|Hank's {{attempts}} at change through medication and enlistment in the Ultimates does not improve his behavior. As {{a result of}} Hank's humiliating loss against Hulk and simmering jealousy of Janet's friendship with Captain America (Steve Rogers), Hank and Janet fight viciously until Janet resorts to stinging and Hank commands an army of ants against her. Janet is found {{in a state of}} anaphylactic shock, caused by receiving multiple ant stings she has received while at wasp-size. Captain America, upon learning of Hank's violence, tracks down and beats Hank unconscious for Janet. Captain America's visits Janet after the fight left her exasperated and angry, stemming from embarrassment of her personal <b>life</b> <b>now</b> being public. After stopping the Chitauri invasion, Captain America and Wasp reconcile as friends and slowly start dating, despite Hank's {{attempts at}} making amends. On one of their secret meetings, Janet later confesses to Hank, now classified as a security risk by S.H.I.E.L.D., that the generation gap between Captain America and herself, along with the elderly status of Steve's friends, put a large strain on their relationship. She walks out on Rogers and meets up with Hank in a bar.|$|E

500|$|The NOC {{issued a}} report of its own {{analysing}} {{the root causes of}} the 13 May violence, suggesting that even in the civil service, a traditional Malay employer, non-Malays outnumbered the Malays in many areas, with substantial Malay majorities only in the Police and Armed Forces. The report concluded: [...] "Allegations that the non-Malays are excluded are regarded by the Malays as deliberate distortion. The Malays who already felt excluded in the country's economic <b>life,</b> <b>now</b> began to feel a threat to their place in the public services. No mention was ever made by non-Malay politicians of the almost closed-door attitude to the Malays by non-Malays in large sections of the private sector in this country." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1916 Heseltine {{returned}} to London, ostensibly {{to argue for}} exemption from military service. However, {{it became clear that}} there had been a rift with Lawrence; in a letter to his friend Robert Nichols, Heseltine described Lawrence as [...] "a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is". The social centre of Heseltine's <b>life</b> <b>now</b> became the Café Royal in Regent Street, where among others he met Cecil Gray, a young Scottish composer. The two decided to share a Battersea studio, where they planned various unfulfilled schemes, including a new music magazine, and, more ambitiously, a London season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter's English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham's productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in artistic value; in his own venture there would be [...] "no compromise with the mob". Beecham ridiculed the plan; he said it would [...] "be launched and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not age or age very little, and as such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events {{have been linked to}} specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s. In [...] "Simpsorama" [...] (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23. He lived with his parents in the Lower East Side of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that [...] "Bart" [...] was her first word. Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him [...] "you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow {{for the rest of your}} <b>life!</b> <b>Now,</b> what do you say?" [...] In his moment of truth, Bart responded, [...] "eat my shorts". The episode [...] "That '90s Show" [...] (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Asturias employs figurative {{language}} to describe dream imagery and the irrational. Literary critic Hughes Davies {{points out that}} Asturias frequently appeals to the reader's auditory senses. Asturias's often incantatory style employs [...] "unadulterated poetry to reinforce his imagery through sound". This helps readers to understand the physical {{as well as the}} psychological aspects of the novel. According to Knightly, [...] "few of Asturias's characters have much psychological depth; their inner conflicts tend to be externalized and played out at the archetypal level". More significantly, Asturias was the first Latin American novelist to combine stream of consciousness writing and {{figurative language}}. Hughes Davies argues that from the outset of , the gap between words and reality is exemplified through onomatopoeia, simile and repetition of phrases. Knightly notes that [...] "animistic elements surface occasionally in the characters' stream of consciousness". For example, in the chapter [...] "Tohil's Dance", Tohil, the God of Rain in Maya mythology, is imagined by Angel Face as arriving [...] "riding on a river of pigeons' breasts which flowed like milk". In Angel Face's vision, Tohil demands a human sacrifice and is content only so long as he [...] "can prevail over men who are hunters of men". Tohil pronounces: [...] "Henceforth there will be neither true death nor true <b>life.</b> <b>Now</b> dance." [...] As Knightly explains, this scene follows the President's orders for Miguel Angel Face to go on a mission that ends in his death, and is [...] "a sign of the President's evil nature and purposes". Davies contends that these literary techniques, when [...] "combined together with a discontinuous structure, give the text its surrealistic and nightmarish atmosphere".|$|E
