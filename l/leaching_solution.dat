40|$|In this study, the {{interfacial}} crud {{produced during}} {{the extraction of}} vanadium and chromium by primary amine N(1923) was investigated from the <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> containing heavy metals. Effect of pH values of the <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> on {{the percentage of the}} crud produced and the emulsion type of the crud were studied. X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) have been employed for the physiochemical characterizations of the crud. Our results indicate that the percentage of the crud produced is greatly affected by the pH value of the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution,</b> and the crud is more stable in the acidic solution. The crud is an oil-in-water emulsion with many fine solid particles in the water phase. The particles, which are from the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution,</b> have been proved to be the main cause for the crud formation. Particles in the cruds are normally composed {{of a large number of}} the crystals of Na(2) SO(4), a few SiO(2) and oxides or hydroxids of Fe and Al. However. component proportions of the solids are dependent on the pH values. Possible mechanism of the crud formation is put forward. The solids present in the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> exert a stabilizing effect on the emulsion, based on which Na(2) SO(4) crystallizes at the interface of the emulsion. Furthermore, the Na(2) SO(4) crystals strengthen the stability of the emulsion, and thereafter the interfacial crud forms. Three effective methods to prevent the crud formation are proposed, i. e. clearing the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> by membrane filtration, increasing of the amount of the modifier. and applying of hexane as the diluent.

These impurities can adversely affect downstream processes. In this study, removal of iron as ammonium- or sodium-jarosite from <b>leach</b> <b>solutions</b> of WPCBs was investigated. Precipitation tests were carried out using synthetic (30 g/L Cu 2 + and 1 M SO 42 -) and real <b>leach</b> <b>solutions.</b> The effects of initial concentration of iron (1 - 4. 5 g/L Fe 3 +), [Fe 3 +]/[NH 4 +] ratio (1. 5 - 2. 4), pH (1. 4 - 1. 8), temperature (80 - 90 °C) and seeding (23. 3 g/L) were examined. The results showed that precipitation efficiency was high at low iron concentrations and high [NH 4 +]/[Fe 3 +] ratios favoured the iron removal. Seeding and temperature also positively influenced the precipitation process. About 68 - 69 % of iron was found to be removed as sodium-jarosite from sulphate/chloride solutions ([Na+]/[Fe 3 +]: 16. 3 - 40. 8).
