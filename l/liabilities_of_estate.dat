50|$|The {{rule has}} special {{application}} {{in relation to}} partnerships upon {{the death of a}} partner. In most jurisdictions, the death of a partner ordinarily has the legal effect of 1890. The partners' personal representatives have no right to step into the partner's shoes; they cannot take part in its management; they can only claim the deceased partner's share in the assets of the firm. The banker, who provides financial accommodation to the firm, can have no objection in continuing the account; the bank can presume that the surviving partners will account to the representatives of the deceased for his share in the assets. Where the firm has a debit balance, the account should be stopped to fix the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> the deceased partner and to avoid the operation of the rule in Clayton's case.|$|R

Taking into account the actual amount of investments of opportunity funds in European real estate portfolios and companies and the wide discussions {{on real estate}} investment trusts (REITs), the determination of the “fair and true value” is of upmost importance for all – listed and non-listed – real estate companies. In this respect the valuation <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> companies reflects the integration <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> and capital markets. The paper analyses in detail the most important methods to evaluate real estate companies: the multiplemethod, the net asset value approach (NAV) and the discounted cash-flow-method (DCF), where all the methods are explained theoretically and discussed critically. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the different possibilities in evaluating real estate companies with the multiple method will be set out, focussing in detail on the recommendations and approaches of the DVFA/SG (the leading German association of financial analysts) and the NAREIT (the leading US-association on REITs). Evaluating real estate companies with the NAV-method implies a separate appraisal of the different assets and <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> the real <b>estate</b> company, where the precise value strongly depends on the information published or possible different value concepts. Finally the DCFapproach will be presented in detail, focussing on the strengths and weaknesses of different DCF-methods with respect to the real estate sector.

A detailed focus lays in the critical assumptions of the Discounted Cash Flow Method, especially on the detailed information needed, the required discounting rates and the possible value of hidden assets...|$|R
40|$|As {{the length}} and factual {{complexity}} of judgments demonstrate, it is often notoriously difficult to pinpoint liability for misleading or deceptive conduct in the marketing <b>of</b> real <b>estate.</b> The marketing <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> in modern practice {{is much more than}} just the seller and the real estate agent. It is common for a number of parties {{to be involved in the}} marketing process, adding to the complexity of the issue <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> This article explores the issue <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for misleading marketing information communicated to a buyer through the use of brochures commonly prepared and utilised by real estate agents. It identifies circumstances where the direct <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the real <b>estate</b> agent may be sheeted home not only to a seller, but also the advertising agency who prepared the brochure and third parties who, by means of the brochure, endorse the property being sold. This review of the law occurs in the era after the High Court decision of Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592 where the marketing agent escaped liability, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, after the High Court took into account the nature of the transaction, the sophistication of the buyers, the lack of sophistication <b>of</b> the real <b>estate</b> agents and the effect of a disclaimer. An analysis of cases preceding and following Butcher reveals that while the legal principles are consistently stated, the application of these principles is ad hoc and depends largely upon the significance attached to certain aspects of the facts in each case. The inclusion of a disclaimer in a marketing brochure is only one of the factors a court may take into account when considering the misleading nature of a brochure. It is clearly demonstrated by the cases that a disclaimer is not the simple panacea considered by many real estate agents or vendors for avoiding liability for what is otherwise misleading information...|$|R

Thesis grade: Bachelor thesis 15 hp -Business Administration with specialization in organization and leadership Authors: Albulena Rizani and Rrezarta Veliqi Supervisor: Pia Ulvenblad Keywords: <b>Liability</b> <b>of</b> newness, networking, personal branding and communication Background: Only {{a third of}} those who choose to step into a new market can continue working after five years. It has been proved that <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness is a concept where newcomers are especially vulnerable and sensitive to the market. This means that <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness is an obstacle during the early phase <b>of</b> a real <b>estate</b> agents career. Some of the important qualifications to master the barrier <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness are networking, personal branding and communications. Problem: What is the meaning of networks, personal brand and communication of a newly graduated real estate agent in mastering the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness? Purpose: The purpose of the study is to create a conceptual framework of newly graduated real estate brokers to understand how networks, personal brand and communication impact the mastery <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness. This framework is developed to get {{a better understanding of how}} a newly graduated real estate broker can master the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness during the first five years. The theoretical framework: The theoretical framework of our study is about the concept <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness. Where we immerse ourselves in networking, personal branding and communication is one of the success factors during the first five years. Method: We have been using a qualitative and intense study for this essay. Our primary data was conducted by interviews with new and experienced real estate agents Conclusions: We have in our study been able to draw the conclusion that the importance of networking, personal branding and communication occurs in an individual level.

By employing data of ragionality and usage as new proxies <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> asset liquidation value, we empirically derived the following implications. First, J-REITs with high ratios <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> investment assets in a high liquid region, i. e., where the trade frequency per unit area is high, have high debt to equity ratio and long term debt maturity. Second, J-REITs with high concentration ratios <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> assets traded in small units as the use of residential properties also have high debt to equity ratio and long term debt maturity. In addition, the above relationships are enhanced when the REIT ownership structure is concentrated. In summary, the regional characteristics and type of usage <b>of</b> real <b>estate</b> assets are validated as asset liquidation proxies and they are related to the <b>liability</b> structure <b>of</b> J-REITs. The existence of a block shareholder is regarded as a sponsor firm by market participants and this possibly enhances the above relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|In the 1990 s, {{emerging}} economies {{all over}} the world deregulated, privatized and liberalized their domestic markets.

Whereas <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness comes from the differences caused by changing one's geographic place from 'here' to 'there'; <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> localness comes from changing one's point in time from 'then' (pre-exogenous regulatory shock) to 'now' (post-exogenous regulatory shock).

Even {{though there is}} no Czech equivalent for the institution <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> legal entities, and consequently it cannot be part of Czech legal system, there have been many heated debates, conducted both by professionals, politicians and amateurs. Czech criminal law does not contain the term collective responsibility, as it is traditionally based on the individual criminal liability. It has adopted the principle societas delinquere non potest, and for this reason the introduction <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> legal entities would be perceived as massive change, change that could have profound impact on the Czech criminal law as such. The topic is controversial; it is manifested in the way the arguments pro and contra are submitted. The thesis consists of seven chapters.

They assert that the relations among merchants and agents were law-based. This paper refutes this assertion using quantitative and documentary evidence thereby vindicating {{the position that the}} legal system had a marginal role in mitigating agency problems in long-distance trade in this historical era. ** Edwards and Ogilvie constantly present legal actions in non-trade related legal cases as evidence for a reliance on the legal system for matters pertaining to long-distance trade. Their criticism of Greif’s documentary analysis also fails scrutiny. The claim that merchants' relations with their overseas agents were law-based is wrong. This paper is based on quantitative analyses of the corpuses containing the hundreds of documents on which the literature relies and a careful review of the documents and the literature Edwards and Ogilvie cite. Their assertion is shown to be based on unrepresentative and irrelevant examples, an inaccurate description of the literature, and a consistent misreading of the few sources they consulted. In particular, their examples {{for the use of the}} court are mainly taken from mandatory legal procedures associated with sorting out the assets and <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> deceased traders’ <b>estates.</b> Such examples do not support the claim that agency relations were law-based.

40|$|The {{estate tax}} was enacted because of {{concerns}} about the impact of large concentrations of dynastic wealth on the political process. As discussed in this commentary, which reviews the Symposium articles by Paul Caron, David Joulfaian, and Jennifer Bird-Pollan, recent research by political scientists supports the legitimacy of these concerns. In addition, a significant body of studies suggests that inequality has a long-term negative impact on growth. Paul Caron observes in his article that progressivity in our tax system has been decreasing and that the estate tax was 60 % or higher for fifty years (1934 – 1983), a rate much higher than the current 40 %. David Joulfaian notes that the estate tax clearly contributes to the progressivity of our tax system.

In our analysis we break down the complex mechanisms behind knowledge spillovers and identify conceptual links with <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness.

The article presents the data of the types of fund raising for building housing in the cities with the population over 1 million people, the regional differentiation in this parameter is highlighted. The article has explored the implementation of mechanisms ensuring the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> developers for transfering premises to the shareholders. The main factors considered in the article are the form of registration of the relationship between a developer and an individual — an investor, as well as the mechanisms ensuring the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> developers. It is shown that in some regions, the level of protection of the participants of shared construction is low. The mechanisms ensuring the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> developers including the legal requirements for liability insurance and guarantee of credit institution are systematized. In the article, the key term <b>of</b> the <b>liability</b> insurance <b>of</b> builders for default on obligations or improperly performing the obligations on the delivery of residential properties, and also the condition of the guarantee of credit institution on the delivery of residential properties are considered.
