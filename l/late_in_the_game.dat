5|$|Another {{departure}} from the gameplay of Final Fantasy X is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game, transported via the airship Celsius.

50|$|A new {{business}} plan was drafted <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> life which attempted to save <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> This plan included a match limit for free {{players and the}} possibility for skilled players to turn their skill into cash; however, the servers shut down before this plan was ever implemented.|$|R

5|$|Koji Kondo (credited as Konchan) {{composed}} <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> music.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{critically}} acclaimed DC Comics video game Batman: Arkham City, highly trained mercenaries loyal to a rogue private military firm, Tyger Security, have been systematically programmed (through {{a combination of}} psychoactive drugs and posthypnotic manipulation) to blindly hate the protagonist and answer only to their employer, the ruthless Hugo Strange. Following Strange's death <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> storyline these effects {{seem to have been}} broken, as Tyger units promptly cease following current orders and withdraw quietly from the scene.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds {{in a game}} have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in order to recover the rebound; a few have even {{gone so far as}} shooting off their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined not to be a legitimate scoring attempt.|$|E
5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the game was over, began substituting regular players. Warner {{seized the opportunity to}} combine passing with the trick plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E

The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–24–5.|$|E
5|$|Following the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters.
