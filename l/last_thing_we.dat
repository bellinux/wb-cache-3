500|$|As the 1990 season began, McMahon was {{released}} by the team, leaving Tolliver as the starting quarterback at training camp. After training camp and a preseason in which Tolliver started and was relieved by quarterbacks Mark Vlasic and rookie John Friesz, Chargers head coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, {{saying that he was}} [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After a loss against Dallas, Tolliver regained his starting job during the game two against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry.

In March 2016, a controversy arose over Tracer's [...] "Over the Shoulder" [...] victory pose, after a user opined in the game's forums that it was out of character and that its supposed oversexualization [...] "reduces Tracer to just another bland female sex symbol". The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> want to do is make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion.

40|$|The {{works of}} American novelist Paul Auster (1947 -) are uniquely {{concerned}} with the mythology of self, metanarrative and the role gender plays in these transactions. In his earliest works, The New York Trilogy (1985 - 1986) and In the Country of <b>Last</b> <b>Things</b> (1987), Auster uses genre conventions and styles (for the former, detective novels; for the latter, dystopian fiction) to interrogate these preconceptions of self-mythology {{and the role of}} gender within these genres, subverting tropes and traits of these works to comment upon them. In the following, we investigate these works in depth along these themes, conducting a close textual analysis from the framework of Freudian and Lacanian theories of psychoanalysis and poststructuralism. By investigating the roles of women in The New York Trilogy and In the Country of <b>Last</b> <b>Things,</b> <b>we</b> hope to illuminate Auster’s uniquely postmodernist, deconstructive approach to the psychological imperatives women are socialized into within American society, and how they are informed by narrative and mythology. The role of women, from the absent trophies of The New York Trilogy to the central voice of sanity of Anna in In the Country of <b>Last</b> <b>Things,</b> posits women as a societal superego whose goal it is to keep the destructive, nihilistic id-like impulses of men in check...|$|R

This is the unexplained moral paradox in the career of a man of chivalrous honour and strict probity: but the fault did not prevent Scott from writing his novels and poems. Why, then, should the few bare records of Shakspere's monetary transactions make HIS authorship impossible? The objection seems weakly sentimental.|$|R
2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US.

There are always a certain number of long-shore chaps in a man-of-war, who are never satisfied with discipline, and the wholesome restraints of a ship; but as for us old salts, I never heard one give the Delaware a bad name. We had heard an awful report of the commodore, who was called a [...] "burster," [...] and expected sharp times under him; and his manner of taking possession was of a nature to alarm us. All hands had been called to receive him, and the first words he said were [...] "Call all hands to witness punishment." [...] A pin might have been heard falling among us, for this sounded ominous. It was to clear the brig, only, Captain Downes having left three men in it, whom he would not release on quitting the vessel. The offences were serious, and could not be overlooked. These three chaps got it; but there was only one other man brought regularly to the gang-way while I was in the ship, and he was under the sentence of a court, and belonged to the Warren. As soon as the brig was cleared, the commodore told us we should be treated as we treated others, and then turned away among the officers. The next day we found we were to live under a just rule, and that satisfied us. One of the great causes of the contentment that reigned in the ship, was the method, and the regularity of the hours observed. The men knew on what they could calculate, in ordinary times, and this left them their own masters within certain hours. I repeat, she was the happiest ship I ever served in, though I have always found good treatment in the navy.|$|R
