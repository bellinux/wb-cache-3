5|$|Eventually, the MTA {{has plans}} to {{automate}} a much larger portion, using One Person Train Operation (OPTO) in conjunction with CBTC. At the current pace of installation, it would take 175 years for CBTC to be installed {{at a cost of}} $20 billion. The Flushing <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> at almost 30 trains an hour using the signal system installed when the line was built, but after CBTC is installed it is possible that an additional two trains per hour could be operated.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Saw Mill River from Putnam County to central Yonkers, and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River. Various {{parts of the}} <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> until the 1940s and the 1980s. The main line of the {{railroad}} is now devoted to bicycle and pedestrian paths. They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119, and the North County Trailway north of 119.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} two railway stations. Dorchester South {{is on the}} South Western Main Line to Bournemouth, Southampton and London is {{operated}} by South Western Railway; Dorchester West, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is on the Heart of Wessex <b>Line,</b> <b>operated</b> by GWR and connects with Yeovil, Bath and Bristol. As part of the regeneration at the Brewery Site in the town centre, Dorchester South railway station will become the first solar powered railway station in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and {{to make it easier to}} expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Once {{across the}} county line, the M-14 freeway runs through {{residential}} subdivisions {{from the western}} Detroit suburbs. There is an interchange for Beck Road as M-14 {{turns back to the}} east. The freeway crosses a rail <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> by CSX Transportation The freeway passes Ford Motor Company's Sheldon Road Plant near the Sheldon Road interchange. There is a crossing for another CSX rail line near the bridges over the River Rouge by the St. Johns Golf Course. The freeway through this area curves around a bit north of its previous course. As M-14 nears the Livonia city line, it meets an interchange with I-96 and I-275 that marks the eastern terminus of M-14 in Plymouth Township.|$|E
5|$|Paddington is the London {{terminus}} of the Great Western main <b>line,</b> <b>operated</b> {{today by}} Great Western Railway, which provides {{the majority of}} commuter and regional passenger services to west London and the Thames Valley region as well as long-distance intercity services to South West England and South Wales. It is also the terminus for the Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect services to and from Heathrow Airport. It is one of nineteen stations in the United Kingdom managed directly by Network Rail. It is situated in fare zone 1 and has two separate tube stations providing connections to the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would have sent Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue <b>Line</b> <b>operated</b> to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{city had}} granted {{concessions}} to the two private tram companies until 1924, after which the city could expropriate the companies. Both companies were well run and highly profitable, and on 1 May 1924, KSS and KES were merged and {{taken over by the}} city council, which gave the new company the name Kristiania Sporveier ("Kristiania Tramways"). The municipality owned 51 per cent. On 1 January 1925, the city changed its name to Oslo, with the company's name also changing. The light rail lines operated by Holmenkolbanen and Ekebergbanen were not taken over, nor was the Lilleaker <b>Line</b> <b>operated</b> by KES; the city council did not want to take over tram lines in Aker. The Lilleaker Line operations of KES were transferred to the private company Bærumsbanen ("The Bærum Line").|$|E
5|$|The <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> {{successfully}} and settlements {{of people}} {{attracted to the}} area {{by the prospect of}} employment in the mines grew around the Brendon ridge. However changes in the availability of imported ore made the mines a less attractive proposition and by 1883 the mines were closed and mineral traffic on the railway ceased. In 1879 the railway announced that the wages of all staff would be reduced. The passenger service continued until 7 November 1898; a brief resumption took place from 1907 (but not west of Brendon Hill) until final closure to passengers in 1910. The 1895 Bradshaw Railway Guide shows two return trips every day, at 09:15 and 15:10 from Watchet, calling at Washford, Roadwater and Comberow, taking 30 minutes; return trains were at 10:45 and 16:15, also taking 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|There were {{frequent}} {{fires and}} maintenance {{problems on the}} Jamaica Bay viaduct. The most notorious of these problems was a fire in May 1950 between The Raunt and Broad Channel Stations. After this fire, the LIRR abandoned the Jamaica Bay viaduct and the Queens portion of the Rockaway Beach/Far Rockaway route. On June 11, 1952, the city acquired all trackage west of Mott Avenue, incorporating {{it as part of}} the IND Rockaway Line. Service provided by the A train over the line began in June 1956, with the full western spur to Rockaway Park operational. While the remainder of the <b>line</b> <b>operated,</b> with Beach 25th Street–Wavecrest serving as the eastern spur terminal, a new Far Rockaway subway station was constructed, opening on January 16, 1958.|$|E

5|$|South of the four-level stack {{interchange}} with I-69, I-475 crosses over {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. North of this interchange, {{the freeway}} runs more northwesterly as it skirts {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Flint. Near the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint, I-475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing it next to an industrial area. There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M-54 (Dort Highway). I-475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> by CSX Transportation. North of Carpenter Road, the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township. The Interstate turns to the east to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street. There is one more interchange for Clio Road before I-475 terminates at a full interchange with I-75's exit125.|$|E
5|$|The Lilleaker Line, which {{connected}} to the street tramway at Skøyen, had been extended to Kolsås in 1930. The owner Bærumsbanen instead wanted the line to go the faster route via the Common Tunnel to Nationaltheatret. Concession was granted in 1938 for a link from Jar on the Lilleaker Line to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line. The construction was delayed because a bridge needed to be built across Mærradalen, and the company ran out of money, and construction stopped for nine months in 1940. The line was opened on 15 June 1942, and the section from Sørbyhaugen to Kolsås was renamed the Kolsås Line. This resulted in two companies operating from Sørbyhaugen to Nationaltheatret, but an agreement was made where only Holmenkolbanen's tickets were sold on the section, so all revenue went to that company, regardless of the train's operator. The Kolsås <b>Line</b> <b>operated</b> every fifteen minutes along the Røa Line part.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Culver Line {{was opened}} by the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad {{and was named}} after the railroad's builder, Andrew N. Culver. The line ran along the surface of McDonald Avenue (then Gravesend Avenue) from Greenwood Cemetery (where it connected with horse car lines including the Vanderbilt Avenue <b>Line,</b> <b>operated</b> by the PP until 1886) to the Culver Depot in Coney Island, on June 25, 1875. The PP began serving the Union Depot at 36th Street, where transfer {{could be made to}} the Fifth Avenue Elevated, on June 7, 1890, by using the Prospect Park and South Brooklyn Railroad from a junction at Parkville. During a period of Long Island Rail Road control, from 1893 to 1899, a ramp at 36th Street was opened in 1895, allowing Brooklyn Elevated Railroad trains to operate over the Culver Line to Coney Island. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), by then the owner of the Brooklyn Elevated, leased the Culver Line (to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad) on June 18, 1899, and began using it to take not only elevated trains but also trolleys to Coney Island.|$|E
