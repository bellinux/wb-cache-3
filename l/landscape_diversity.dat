25|$|Because of {{its high}} <b>landscape</b> <b>diversity</b> and low latitude, Georgia is home to about 5,601 species of animals, {{including}} 648 species of vertebrates (more than 1% of the species found worldwide) {{and many of these}} species are endemics. A number of large carnivores live in the forests, namely Brown bears, wolves, lynxes and Caucasian Leopards. The common pheasant (also known as the Colchian Pheasant) is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced {{throughout the rest of the}} world as an important game bird. The species number of invertebrates is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications. The spider checklist of Georgia, for example, includes 501 species.|$|E
25|$|Concern about {{biodiversity}} conservation {{remains strong}} within the country. In 1998 the Government of Bulgaria approved the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, which {{was inspired by}} the Pan European Strategy for Biological and <b>Landscape</b> <b>Diversity.</b> Bulgaria has some of the largest Natura 2000 areas in the European Union covering 33.8% of its territory. The national policy for governing and management of the protected areas is implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Water. Bulgaria's biodiversity is conserved in three national parks, 11 nature parks and 54 nature reserves. Of them, Pirin National Park and Srebarna Nature Reserve are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Spanning a territory of 1,161 square kilometres Strandzha Nature Park is the largest protected area in the country. Established in 1936 Vitosha Nature Park is the oldest in Bulgaria and in the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the medium}} of introduction, {{biological}} invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote {{about the benefits of}} biotic and <b>landscape</b> <b>diversity</b> centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{occasion}} of the 10th anniversary of the Dutch dune conservation foundation (Stichting Duinbehoud), the 1st European Dune Conference was organized in September 1987, which brought together ecologists, academics and managers of sand dune coasts from twelve European countries, in Leiden, the Netherlands, to discuss future directions for conservation management. As a result of this conference the European Union for Dune conservation & Coastal management (EUDC) was launched and formally founded in Leiden, the Netherlands, on 6 January 1989, as an association under the Dutch law. Its first undertaking consisted in producing an inventory of coastal dunes throughout Europe. Under the leadership of its Director General Albert Salman, the association evolved towards a broader coastal scope and then changed the name to European Union for Coastal Conservation (EUCC) in 1991 at {{the occasion}} of the 3rd International Conference in Galway (Ireland). Since then, the abbreviation has been kept. Milestones of the first period are the organisation of the 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference in Scheveningen 1991, and a contribution to the preparation of the Pan-European Biological and <b>Landscape</b> <b>Diversity</b> Strategy (PEBLDS), adopted in 1995 by the Environment for Europe Ministers Conference. Later on, under the auspices of UNEP and the Council of Europe, EUCC led the elaboration of the European Coastal & Marine Ecological Network (ECMEN) [...] and the European Code of Conduct for Coastal Zones. The latter was officially adopted by the Council of Europe Ministers in 1999.|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} in biological systems is whether genetic diversity persists {{in the long}} run under evolutionary competition or whether a single dominant genotype emerges. Classic work by Kalmus in 1945 has established that even in simple diploid species (species with two chromosomes) diversity can be guaranteed as long as the heterozygote individuals enjoy a selective advantage. Despite the classic nature of the problem, as we move towards increasingly polymorphic traits (e. g. human blood types) predicting diversity and understanding its implications is still not fully understood. Our key contribution is to establish complexity theoretic hardness results implying that even in the textbook case of single locus diploid models predicting whether diversity survives or not given its fitness landscape is algorithmically intractable. We complement our results by establishing that under randomly chosen fitness <b>landscapes</b> <b>diversity</b> survives with significant probability. Our results are structurally robust along several dimensions (e. g., choice of parameter distribution, different definitions of stability/persistence, restriction to typical subclasses of fitness landscapes). Technically, our results exploit connections between game theory, nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity theory and biology and establish hardness results for predicting the evolution of a deterministic variant of the well known multiplicative weights update algorithm in symmetric coordination games which could be of independent interest.
