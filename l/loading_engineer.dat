40|$|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate {{intercellular}} communication through transfer of RNA and protein between cells. Thus, understanding how cargo molecules are loaded and delivered by EVs is of central importance for elucidating the biological roles of EVs and developing EV-based therapeutics. While some motifs modulating the loading of biomolecular cargo into EVs have been elucidated, the general rules governing cargo loading and delivery remain poorly understood. To investigate how general biophysical properties impact loading {{and delivery of}} RNA by EVs, we developed a platform for actively <b>loading</b> <b>engineered</b> cargo RNAs into EVs. In our system, the MS 2 bacteriophage coat protein was fused to EV-associated proteins, and the cognate MS 2 stem loop was engineered into cargo RNAs. Using this Targeted and Modular EV Loading (TAMEL) approach, we identified a configuration that substantially enhanced cargo RNA loading (up to 6 -fold) into EVs. When applied to vesicles expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) – gesicles – we observed a 40 -fold enrichment in cargo RNA loading. While active loading of mRNA-length (> 1. 5 kb) cargo molecules was possible, active loading was much more efficient for smaller (~ 0. 5 kb) RNA molecules. We next leveraged the TAMEL platform to elucidate the limiting steps in EV-mediated delivery of mRNA and protein to prostate cancer cells, as a model system. Overall, most cargo was rapidly degraded in recipient cells, despite high EV-loading efficiencies and substantial EV uptake by recipient cells. While gesicles were efficiently internalized via a VSVG-mediated mechanism, most cargo molecules were rapidly degraded. Thus, in this model system, inefficient endosomal fusion or escape likely represents a limiting barrier to EV-mediated transfer. Altogether, the TAMEL platform enabled a comparative analysis elucidating a key opportunity for enhancing EV-mediated delivery to prostate cancer cells, and this technology should be of general utility for investigations and applications of EV-mediated transfer in other systems...|$|R

Nozzles designed to operate over specific regions of a trajectory are being replaced in modern launch vehicles by those that {{are designed to}} operate from earth to orbit. This is happening in parallel with modern manufacturing and wall cooling techniques allowing for larger aspect ratio nozzles to be produced. Such nozzles, though operating over a large range of altitudes and ambient pressures, are typically designed for one specific altitude. Above that altitude the nozzle flow is 'underexpanded' and below that altitude, the nozzle flow is 'overexpanded'. In both conditions the nozzle produces less than the maximum possible thrust at that altitude. Usually the nozzle design altitude is well above sea level, leaving the nozzle flow in an overexpanded state for its start up as well as for its ground testing where, if it is a reusable nozzle such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), the nozzle will operate for the majority of its life. Overexpansion in a rocket nozzle presents the critical, and sometimes design driving, problem of flow separation induced side loads.

40|$|International audienceTo {{calculate}} bed <b>load,</b> <b>engineers</b> {{often use}} flow resistance equations that provide estimates of bed shear stress. In these equations, {{on the basis}} of the estimate of the appropriate hydraulic radius associated with the bed only, the bed roughness k s is commonly set as a constant, whatever the bed load intensity. However, several studies have confirmed the existence of feedback mechanisms between flow resistance and bed load, suggesting that a flow-dependent bed roughness should be used. Therefore, using a data set composed of 2282 flume and field experimental values, this study investigated the importance of these feedback effects. New flow resistance equations were proposed for three flow domains: domain 1 corresponds to no bed load and a constant bed roughness k s = D (where D is a representative grain diameter), whereas domain 3 corresponds to a high bed load transport rate over a flat bed with a constant bed roughness k s = 2. 6 D. Between these two domains, a transitional domain 2 was identified, for which the bed roughness evolved from D to 2. 6 D with increasing flow conditions. In this domain, the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient f can be approximated using a constant for a given slope. The results using this new flow resistance equation proved to be more accurate than those using equations obtained from simple fittings of logarithmic laws to mean values. The data set indicates that distinguishing domains 2 and 3 is still relevant for bed load. In particular, the data indicate a slope dependence in domain 2 but not in domain 3. A bed load model, based on the tractive force concept, is proposed. Finally, flow resistance and bed load equations were used together to calculate both shear stress and bed load from the flow discharge, the slope, and the grain diameter for each run of the data set. Efficiency tests indicate that new equations (implicitly taking a feedback mechanism into account) can reduce the error by a factor of 2 when compared to other equations currently in use, showing that feedback between flow resistance and bed load can improve field bed load modeling...|$|R

Although onshore wind is currently the most economically viable source of renewable energy, high failure rates often occurring many years prior to their design life, are increasing the cost through additional maintenance and downtime. The gearbox, and in particular the bearings within the gearbox are the components responsible for the largest proportion of downtime. Field studies have shown damage to the inner race of the planetary support bearings found in the epicyclic stage of the gearbox is restricted to an arc of approximately 40 ° centered on the point of maximum <b>load.</b> <b>Engineers</b> at Ricardo have designed an actuation system to overcome this problem which allows the raceway to be rotated periodically thus distributing damage and increasing bearing life. The monitoring of planetary support bearings typically found in the epicyclic stage of wind turbine gearboxes has been investigated in this thesis using acoustic emission technology due to its reported increase in sensitivity in detecting damage at low speeds compared to vibration analysis in addition to its ability to locate damage. Primarily, accelerated life tests were performed on a rolling element bearing seeded with a defect mounted in a bespoke full scale test rig designed to mimic loading conditions experienced by the planetary support bearings. In addition, data was recorded and analysed from a split bearing test rig and the high speed shaft bearing of a recommissioned 600 kW wind turbine gearbox. Initial experiments considered the influence of the lubrication regime on the measured acoustic emission signal. It was found that as the oil film reduces, asperity contact, typical of mixed or boundary lubrication, manifests itself as high amplitude transient events. Typical measures of bearing health in the time domain, such as peak values or kurtosis, become unreliable and demonstrates a need for a novel approach. Previous investigations into the use of acoustic emission for the purpose of bearing condition monitoring has focused on instances where full separation between bearing components occurred whereas this work considers a mixed lubrication regime. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional measures, this work has investigated a process employing wavelet packet decomposition, autocorrelation and cepstrum to reduce the noise and boost the periodicity of a signal from a defected bearing. Outlier analysis was shown to be able to determine the presence of a seeded defect and indicate which bearing component is defected. Such approach was shown to provide a more robust measure than time domain methods. In contrast, this approach was compared to one employing time domain measures for a fully lubricated split bearing. In this case, a time domain approach was more successful at determining the presence of damage than the approach taken for the partially lubricated bearing. An attempt was made to improve the localisation of defects on a bearing which had, until now, relied on analytical time-of-flight methods. In this work artificial sources, rather than those resulting from a rolling element impinging on a defect, were generated by a standardised pencil lead break and used as training data for two methods namely Delta T mapping and neural networks.

As expected, mechanical loading resulted in a more mature tendon tissue characterized by a firmer tissue texture and densely deposited matrices which formed longitudinally aligned collagen fibers in a highly compact fashion.

Proteins isolated from two groups of tissues exhibited similar distribution of isoeletric point and molecular weight indicating the similarity and comparability of the tissue specimens. Further, proteomic analysis showed that total 758 proteins were identified from both groups with 194 and 177 proteins uniquely presented in loaded and non-loaded tendons, respectively. Comparison of loaded and non-loaded tendons revealed 195 significantly up-regulated proteins and 189 significantly down-regulated proteins.

Among them, significantly up-regulated collagens I and VI, MMP- 14, WNT 5 A, microfilament molecules and some inflammatory factors suggest that the possible mechanism for this particular biological phenomenon may involve increased production of tendon specific matrices, enhanced cross-link of collagens and other matrix molecules, proper matrix remodeling for tissue maturation and mechanotransduction (including non-canonical Writ signal pathway) mediated other biological processes.

40|$|In a {{competitive}} market it has become necessary to deliver products in a fast and efficient way. The mechanical design process needs to be modified {{in a way to}} be able to deliver reliable and fast products. One way of modifying the process is by reducing the amount of manual work by automating the repetitive tasks using scripts built in the computer tools. This thesis work aims to develop a methodology where tedious and repetitive design processes are automated. The design of an industrial robot lower arm will be used as a proof of concept. The modeling is done in the CAD software SolidWorks and is evaluated structurally in the FEM software ANSYS. The FE process in ANSYS is automated by the use of the programming languages Python and JavaScript. Furthermore a user interface is created using Microsoft Excel with Visual Basic. To allow automatic FEM, a parametric CAD model of a Robot lower arm is constructed. To validate its properties, the arm’s mass properties are compared with the real non-parametric model of the Industrial Robot IRB 6640. It is shown that the parametric CAD model can be obtained with high accuracy. It has also been possible to validate the automated framework and the parametric design by comparing the Maximum Von Mises Stress of both arm models. Performing a Design of Experiments it was possible to obtain the functional relation between the Mesh Element Size and the FE results. The validation tests conducted further strengthen the hypothesis that tedious and repetitive design processes can be automated {{in order to reduce the}} work <b>load</b> of <b>engineers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — For {{transportation}} of fluid, steam or air piping system is widely used. For installing the piping system pipes, flanges, piping supports, valves, piping fittings etc. are used, which are piping elements. They are manufactured as per Codes and standards. Equipment and piping layout design as per process requirement and available space. Above layout made {{out by the}} help of General arrangement drawing, plant layout and P & ID. Then after flexibility providing to piping system, for compensate the different <b>loads</b> by the <b>engineer.</b> Stresses in pipe or piping systems are generated due to loads like expansion & contraction due to thermal load, seismic load, wind load, sustained load, reaction load etc. the stress analysis is done by help of software like CAESAR II. In this paper, a Flare pipe line is designed and 3 D modeling is prepared in PDMS software. Attention is focused for stress analysis by Caesar-II software. So that various stress values, forces and deflections are analyzed at each node to make the design at safe operating conditions...|$|R

Usability <b>engineers</b> {{note that a}} response time over 1 second may interrupt a user’s flow of thought [6, 9]. There is a general belief that, all other factors equal, users will abandon a slow search engine {{in favor of a}} faster alternative. This study compares two mock search engines that differ only in branding (generic color scheme) and latency (fast vs. slow). The fast latency was fixed at 250 ms, while 4 different slow latencies were evaluated: 2 s, 3 s, 4 s, and 5 s. When the slower search engine latency is 5 seconds, users state that they perceive the fast engine as faster. When the slower search engine latency is 4 or 5 seconds, users choose to use the fast engine more often. Based on pooling data for 2 s and 3 s, once slow latency exceeds 3 seconds, users are 1. 5 times more likely to choose the fast engine. KEY WORDS: web search, latency, response time 1...|$|R
25|$|On {{the fifth}} day of the enquiry, {{managing}} director of Imperial Airways Colonel Frank Searle gave evidence that Imperial Airways pilots had absolute discretion to refuse to fly any aircraft if, in their opinion, the aircraft was unfit for flight for whatever reason. He stated that the petrol pipe supplied by Petro-Flex to Imperial Airways was of an armoured type, but that unarmoured pipes had been fitted to some aircraft taken over when Imperial Airways had been formed, and that spares from these companies were in stock and being used. Both armoured and unarmoured pipes had been approved {{for use by the}} Air Ministry. A representative from Petro-Flex corroborated Searle's evidence in respect of the type of piping supplied to Imperial Airways. Evidence was given that the flight from Lympne to Croydon was with the aircraft lightly loaded, and that the performance of the engine with a restricted fuel pipe would be different from that with a full <b>load.</b> The Chief <b>Engineer</b> of D.

40|$|In {{conventional}} airtight buildings, {{the architect}} has considerable freedom {{to decide how}} much the external environment will influence the internal heating, cooling, and ventilation <b>loads.</b> The services <b>engineer</b> provides the plant and equipment required {{to deal with these}} loads. This division of labor could lead to undesirable consequences in the case of dynamic insulation, a form of air permeable construction where bulk air flow through the building envelope may be used to either enhance or restrict the conductive heat and mass diffusion fluxes. Small changes in temperature (indoor and out) and wind speed and direction will influence the behavior of a dynamically insulated envelope since the internal and external environments are much more intimately coupled. Buildings employing dynamic insulation thus require good environmental design principles to be applied. The objective {{of this paper is to}} lay down rigorous principles that will form the basis of guidelines to architects and building services engineers on how to take account of the ever changing external environment when designing durable and comfortable buildings employing dynamic insulation.
