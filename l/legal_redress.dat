These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek <b>legal</b> <b>redress.</b> As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} a Persian-language {{documentary}} form called the mahzar-nama that was widely used in India between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries to narrate, represent, and record antecedents, entitlements, and injuries {{with a view to}} securing <b>legal</b> rights and <b>redressing</b> <b>legal</b> wrongs. Mahzars were a known documentary form in Islamic law and used by qazis (Islamic judges) in many other parts of the world, but in India they took a number of distinctive forms. The specific form of Indian mahzar-namas that I focus on here was, broadly speaking, a legal document of testimony, narrated in the first person, in a form standardized by predominantly non-Muslim scribes, endorsed in writing by the author’s fellow community members and/or professional or social contacts, and notarized by a qazi’s seal. This specific legal form was part of a much broader genre of declarative texts that were also known as mahzars in India. I examine the legal mahzar-namas together with the other kinds of mahzars, and situate them in relation to Indo-Islamic jurisprudential texts and Persian-language formularies. What emerges is a distinctive Indo-Islamic legal culture in contact with the wider Islamic and Persianate worlds of jurisprudence and documentary culture, but responsive to the unique socio-political formations of early modern India. I also reflect on the meanings of law, including Islamic law, for South Asians and trace the evolution of that understanding across the historical transition to colonialism.

25|$|The Court's assumptions, some say, {{have made}} the Mackay Radio ruling {{theoretically}} unsupportable {{as a matter of}} equity. Because the Court assumed that employers must hire permanent replacements as a matter of business necessity, the Court did not find it necessary to require the employer to show the need for permanent replacements. This places the burden on either the Board or unions to prove that the employer had an anti-union animus. But the Supreme Court subsequently held that replacement workers cannot be presumed to be anti-union, so their use is not enough to show animus. Indeed, courts have been reluctant to find support for anti-union animus in any except the most extreme cases. As legal scholars point out, under Mackay Radio, employers can now cloak anti-union animus under the guise of using permanent replacements. They note that it is becoming increasingly common for employers to deunionize using permanent replacements, and nearly impossible for unions to obtain <b>legal</b> <b>redress.</b> This has held to a radical shift in American labor policy which Congress did not intend.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the contribution of the}} Peruvian human rights ombudsman towards upholding a stable and enforceable rights framework, an important component of an inclusive democratic political regime. It argues that the human rights ombudsman may {{play a significant role in}} advancing social transformation through the articulation and facilitation of rights claims in an institutional terrain informed by the politically contested nature of formal rules. The analysis goes beyond formal <b>legal</b> channels of <b>redress</b> to consider innovative mechanisms to increase social accountability, including a variety of non-judicial remedies such as policy initiatives, media advocacy and conflict mediation. The article suggests the human rights ombudsman is well placed to advance rights claims through legal, institutional and social pathways, with particular focus on the question of compliance—understood as a matter of both enforcement and management. ...|$|R
25|$|According to GlobalSecurity, police {{impunity}} {{and corruption}} are serious problems. In 2008 President Assad issued {{a law that}} mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant {{in the case of}} a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no <b>legal</b> <b>redress.</b> According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. Incommunicado detention was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to be either in long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held incommunicado for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of legal provisions for a speedy trial or plea bargaining led to lengthy pretrial detentions.|$|E

In colonial appeal courts, Chinese litigants challenged migration controls, contested convictions under opium restriction and gambling laws, sought equitable outcomes in property inheritance and challenged exclusionary regulation under the Factory Acts. In contrast to another kind of history of the Chinese in Australian law, as defendants in criminal prosecution, this article draws attention to the Chinese engagement in legal remedies as an assertion of their entitlement to recognition and fair play.

From the traditional face to face human interaction and trading, to now the modern electronic commerce, which is carried out in total disregard to geographical or political boundaries.

This has brought in new problems and legal requirements so as to protect consumers and boost the increasingly indispensable mode of trade. While some countries and jurisdictions have decided to adopt new laws and legislations, so as to among other reasons, protect consumers, some other countries such as Uganda have been slow to rise up to the challenge,and as a result are still faced with the old laws and legal frameworks that existed before the advent of electronic commerce.

We learn about her childhood, her reason for joining the army and how a love affair ultimately drove her to the very edges of her duty.

40|$|In 1999 the Swedish Parliament {{decided to}} provide {{economic}} {{compensation to victims}} of involuntary sterilization, and in 2012 a similar law was enacted to redress neglect and abuse in foster homes and orphanages. This study explores the dilemmas that arise with reparations for past injustices, focusing on the process {{leading up to the}} reparation laws. Four themes are investigated: [1] state redress as the result of political action, [2] the identification and documentation of historical injustices, [3] how issues of responsibility were discussed and, [4] the juridification of redress. This study shows that it took approximately ten years for the first public claims for redress to gain enough political momentum to yield results. In both cases governmental commissions were set up. However, the commissions used different methods and materials. Involuntary sterilizations were mainly investigated through re-interpretation of existing source material, whereas child abuse was primarily documented through interviews. The two commissions also differed in how they judged the past: the Inquiry on Sterilization employed a historicising approach, while the Inquiry on Child Abuse and Neglect in Institutions and Foster Homes employed a contemporary normative approach. In both cases the moral responsibility of the state to give redress was stressed, rather than any <b>legal</b> liability. <b>Redress</b> was granted ex gratia, i. e. as an act of grace, through temporary laws, rather than as an admis-sion of legally established wrongdoing. Deserving victims were to be identified through court-like procedures, which sparked a debate on how to uphold due process and what kind of evidence would be admissible and sufficient. Hence reparations for historical injustices carry many paradoxes {{that need to be addressed}} in future discussions on redress...|$|R

The article also challenges those who oppose reparations based on its supposed unfairness to contemporary citizens to explain how their position differs from that of past generations who opposed reparations and related <b>legal</b> efforts to <b>redress</b> racial injustices as unfair at that time. To support the challenge to reparations commentators, the article examines the historical framework of blacks’ relationship to the law through legislation and court rulings from 1619 – 1963.
