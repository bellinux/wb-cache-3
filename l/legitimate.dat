5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that <b>legitimate</b> expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive <b>legitimate</b> expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying <b>legitimate</b> expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we argue}} the organic {{industry}} 2 ̆ 7 s move towards a more legal definition of organic production indicated {{a shift in}} the <b>legitimating</b> criteria in the organic agriculture institutional field, which can be observed through the analysis of the <b>legitimating</b> accounts of various actors. Prior to USDA certification, institutional actors in the organic food field largely relied upon the norms and values of its participants to maintain order. Legitimacy was based on the perception that a firm embodied a certain value set, which typically included opposition to large-scale commercial operations (DeLind, 2000; Drinkwater, 2009). To some, the introduction of federal standards signaled a replacement of the personal trust between consumer and producer, and an increased reliance on external policies mandated by federal certification (Guthman, 2000; 2004 a; 2004 b). This study explores the intricacies of the various actors 2 ̆ 7 <b>legitimating</b> accounts during this time of a shifting institutional field. Central questions include: how do these actors adapt their <b>legitimating</b> accounts to the changing context? Is there a discernible pattern to their rhetoric, not only over time, but also in relation to the other contemporary <b>legitimating</b> accounts? And finally, if patterns are evident, can they provide insight into the dynamics of <b>legitimating</b> sources in this institutional field...|$|R

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>legitimate</b> expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a <b>legitimate</b> expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} <b>legitimate</b> expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a <b>legitimate</b> expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a <b>legitimate</b> expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive <b>legitimate</b> expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article {{proposes that}} <b>legitimating</b> {{agencies}} such as accreditation organizations face selection pressures to both maintain their legitimacy among their constituents, but also to expand the domain of their activities.

We use the domain expansion of the AACSB to develop propositions relevant to these three research issues.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the arguments}} advanced {{for and against}} minority rights in the Indian Constituent Assembly. During {{the course of my}} analysis, I show first, that arguments advocating and opposing different kinds of minority provisions, advanced from diverse political and ideological positions, employed a shared <b>legitimating</b> vocabulary. The concepts of secularism, democracy, equality and justice, and national unity and development defined this <b>legitimating</b> vocabulary. Second, while it has generally been assumed that the constitution-makers subscribed to a single notion of secularism or democracy, my analysis shows that different conceptions of these political ideals were at play in arguments about minority rights in the Constituent Assembly. Third, against dominant understandings of Indian political discourse, this article emphasizes that different kinds of liberal norms were a crucial part of the <b>legitimating</b> vocabulary on minority safeguards. Finally, I argue that our understanding of an important and neglected development in India’s constitutional history, the withdrawal of political safeguards for religious minorities during the making of the Indian Constitution, is furthered by an analysis of the <b>legitimating</b> vocabulary on minority rights in the Constituent Assembly debates...|$|R
