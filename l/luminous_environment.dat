A questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate {{the effects of these}} green features on subjective luminous comfort in housing units. The results showed that some practical functions decided the preferences of residents for tilted or horizontal sunshades and balconies with glass walls and parapets. Both features had direct effects on reducing glare and overheating problems, but at the same time, they decreased daylight uniformity. Further, balconies provided poor privacy, which forced residents to use internal shading and artificial lighting more often.

Daylight is a non-depleting energy source with the {{potential}} to reduce building energy consumption and contribute to the health and wellbeing of building occupants.

The mixed method study presented here took a user-centred approach to investigate the relationship between three aspects of evidence collected from the real world: monitored illumination data; observed user interactions with the space and its systems (visual display technologies, electric lights, blinds); and user subjective responses.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{three different}} topics, all {{related to the}} application of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) for the diagnosis of hypersonic air flows. Firstly, a numerical method to retrieve angle of attack of a scramjet inlet from a single path-integrated absorption spectrum of oxygen in a simple hypersonic inlet flow is derived. A sensor design that {{can be incorporated into}} a double-wedge inlet or a conical inlet is proposed. A nonlinear least-squares distribution fitting method is used to simultaneously retrieve the free-stream Mach number and the angle of attack in a simple two-dimensional inlet and the angle of attack with known free-stream Mach number in a conical inlet using simulated absorption spectrum. The advantages of using the distribution technique in spatially non-uniform flows, particularly for applications that are restricted in space, such as for flight testing, is explained in detail. The second topic concerns a systematic error involved with measurements that use log-ratio detection techniques. When log-ratio detectors are used in <b>luminous</b> <b>environments</b> and when the stray light intensity falling on the photodiodes of the detector is significant relative to the intensity of the laser used in the system, the baseline of the absorption spectrum measured is distorted. The conventional method of baseline subtraction introduces a systematic error in the absorption spectrum. It is shown that this systematic error is significant when the intensity of interfering stray light is comparable to the intensity of the laser beam. A method of calibrating the log-ratio detection system to minimise this effect is proposed and verified using a simple experiment. The third topic involves the diagnosis of the free-stream flow in a free-piston shock tunnel using a sensor developed based on TDLAS. Room air is used as the test gas and water vapour absorption peaks near 1392 nm are targeted. The free-stream temperature and velocity of the flow is measured at two different enthalpy conditions and the results are compared with the corresponding simulated values. The sensor is also proposed as a non-intrusive driver gas detector convenient for free-piston shock tunnels. Its effectiveness as a driver gas sensor is investigated...|$|R

One of the goals {{of this study was to}} provide new insight into the impact of luminance distributions on glare. The luminance distribution within the field of view was recorded using CCD camera-based luminance mapping technology. The technology provides a great potential for improved understandings of the relation between measured lighting conditions and user response. With the development of the RADIANCE based evaluation tool "evalglare", it became possible to analyse glare according to a number of daylight glare prediction models as well as contrast ratios in various daylit situations (workplace, VDU). User assessments at two locations (Copenhagen, Freiburg) with more than 70 subjects under various daylighting conditions were performed in order to assess existing glare models and to provide a reliable database for the development of a new glare prediction model. The comparison of the results of the user assessments with existing models clearly shows the great potential for improving glare prediction models. For the window luminance a squared correlation factor of only 0. 12 and for the daylight glare index (DGI) of 0. 56 were found. Due to the low predictive power of existing glare prediction models a new index, daylight glare probability (DGP), was developed and is presented in this paper. DGP is a function of the vertical eye illuminance as well as on the glare source luminance, its solid angle and its position index. The DGP showed a very strong correlation (squared correlation factor of 0. 94) with the user's response regarding glare perception...|$|R

Ultimately, this thesis will demonstrate why using singular metrics is not as effective as using several, complementary metrics in expressing the <b>luminous</b> <b>environment.</b> There are many challenges in practice and research- respectively, time or capabilities of a design team and lack of transparency or unrealistic metric criteria. Moreover, each metric- illuminance and luminance, point-in-time and annual- addresses different luminous qualities. It is critical to understand the nuances, as the results and corresponding design recommendations are highly dependent on the metrics used, and each metric carries technical inadequacies and limitations. Aiming to study these challenges and critique the current landscape of computational lighting design, the objectives of this thesis are to: 1) Evaluate computational lighting metrics for their ability to provide an understanding of the <b>luminous</b> <b>environment,</b> and 2) Investigate the capabilities, assumptions, and methods used in computational lighting metrics as they are developed in the research community and used in practice.

Electrochromic (EC) glass {{is believed to be the}} leading contender in the race to manufacture a glazing technology that will achieve the accolade set down by Steve Selkowitz in 1998. With recent investment in the scaling-up of production capacity, EC glass is now set become a mainstream glazing product. As EC glass darkens (‘tints’) the peak in the spectral transmittance curve shifts to the blue. Whilst control of the <b>luminous</b> and thermal <b>environment</b> is highly desirable, occupants are believed to prefer daylight illumination that is perceived as neutral rather than tinted. Thus the question regarding the neutrality of the illumination spectrum is an important one that needs to be addressed. In this paper the authors show that it is possible to maintain an effectively neutral spectrum of daylight illumination in a space with EC glass in normal operation, provided that a relatively small proportion of the glass is left in the clear state. A theoretical formulation giving the overall spectral transmittance curves for any arbitrary combination of clear and tinted EC glazing in varying proportions is outlined. Applying the theoretical model it should be possible to configure and/or control an actual EC glass installation so that neutral daylight illumination results.
