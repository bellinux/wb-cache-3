Mini CNC machine is a small CNC machine that can operate like a normal CNC machine with a limited area of the machining. The objectives of this project are to develop the mini CNC Machine and to develop the software to control the machine. This thesis describes {{the development of the}} machine and the criteria needed to build the machine. The Mini CNC Machine is initially sketched by referring to the criteria that was decided. The criteria are the travel path length, type of linear motion, type of linear drive, motor and controller, and type of material that used. This machine’s travel on the X axis is 15 cm and Y axis is 15 cm. The linear motion was used is a round linear rail and the linear drive used was a sliding element, <b>lead</b> <b>nuts</b> and <b>lead</b> screws. The motor used is a stepper motor with specification 2. 1 V and 3. 0 A. The frame material used is aluminium. This material is used because it is light in weight, easy to handle and machine and it is rust proof. The design was sketched using SolidWork software.

50|$|The {{position}} of the moving platform relative to the fixed base is typically controlled by a linear actuator of some form, whether manual, motorized, or hydraulic/pneumatic. The most common method is to incorporate a lead screw passing through a <b>lead</b> <b>nut</b> in the platform. The rotation of such a lead screw may be controlled either manually or by a motor.|$|E
50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} lead screw and <b>lead</b> <b>nut.</b> Some use a ball screw and ball nut. In either case the screw may be connected to a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|E
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a <b>lead</b> <b>nut</b> or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of some main {{components}} of a lunar rover assigned to working tasks. The main task of this rover is to clear areas of the lunar soil allocated to the building of a lunar base. In {{the first part of the}} work the lunar environment is studied and described with particular attention to the rover tasks. The rover in the final configuration will be able to advance in all directions on the soil, to control the attitude and to grasp and to remove obstacle and object on the soil. It will be provided by a frame, legs and will, grasping system. The design of the lifting system for the attitude control, based on the action of four motorized legs, has been approached with particular regard to the structural characteristics and to the transmission and motorization. The transmission of the lifting system uses a precision coupling between a <b>lead</b> screw and <b>nut,</b> driven by electrical motors. To allow optimal working conditions for the <b>lead</b> screw and <b>nut,</b> the lifting device was designed as a compact apparatus which also comprises a particular joint which is capable to uncouple shear and bending loads transmitted to it from the other parts. The design of the components has to keep into account the peculiar characteristics of the lunar environment. This aspect was considered by an appropriate geometrical design of the components and a careful choice of the materials. The gripper mechanism of the rover is designed to operate without dedicated motors and it is able to be self-adaptive to the shape of the picked up item also if the object is placed in a non defined position, in any case in a working space. The design optimization of the grasping mechanism, choosing shape and dimension of the different arms, was performed by means of parametric modeling and numerical simulations. Finally an innovative type of wheel was designed and realized to verify the real ability to operate. The wheel is a non pneumatic system with and integrated suspension and energy scavenging system to power the sensors and control system on board. ...|$|R
40|$|A sliding mode {{vibration}} controller for lead screw drives Orang Vahid-Araghi 1 and Farid Golnaraghi 2 The conversion of rotary to translational motion in lead screw drives {{occurs at the}} meshing <b>lead</b> screw and <b>nut</b> threads.

40|$|Multidisciplinary design {{optimization}} {{has been widely}} applied in the optimization of large-scale complex system {{and also in the}} design and optimization of components, which are involved in multidisciplinary behaviors. The wear and fatigue life of lead screw actuators is a typical multidisciplinary problem. The wear behaviors of actuators closely relate to many factors such as loads, lubrications, materials properties, surface properties, pressures, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. In this paper, the wear and fatigue life of a lead screw actuator is modeled and validated. Firstly, the theory of asperity contact and Archard’s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under certain circumstances. Secondly, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol, and the wear phenomenon at the ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model.

40|$|Lead screw drives {{are used}} in various motion {{delivery}} systems ranging from manufacturing to high precision medical devices. Lead screws come in many different shapes and sizes; they may be big enough to move a 140 tons theatre stage or small enough {{to be used in}} a 10 ml liquid dispensing micro-pump. Disproportionate to the popularity of lead screws and their wide range of applications, very little {{attention has been paid to}} their dynamical behavior. Only a few works can be found in the literature that touch on the subject of lead screw dynamics and the instabilities caused by friction. The current work aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive study of lead screw dynamics focusing on the friction-induced instability in such systems. In this thesis, a number of mathematical models are developed for lead screw drive systems. Starting from the basic kinematic model of <b>lead</b> screw and <b>nut,</b> dynamic models are developed with varying number of degrees of freedom to reflect different components of a real lead screw drive from the rotary driver (motor) to the translating payload. In these models, velocity-dependent friction between meshing <b>lead</b> screw and <b>nut</b> threads constitute the main source nonlinearity. A practical case study is presented where friction-induced vibration in a lead screw drive is the cause of excessive audible noise. Using a complete dynamical model of this drive, a two-stage system parameter identification and fine-tuning method is developed to estimate parameters of the velocity-dependent coefficient of friction. In this approach the coupling stiffness and damping in the lead screw supports are also estimated. The numerical simulation results using the identified parameters show the applicability of the developed method in reproducing the actual systems behavior when compared with the measurements. The verified mathematical model is then used to study the role of various system parameters on the stability of the system and the amplitude of vibrations. These studies lead to possible design modifications that solve the system’s excessive noise problem. Friction can cause instability in a dynamical system through different mechanisms. In this work, the three mechanisms relevant to the lead screw systems are considered. These mechanisms are: 1. negative damping; 2. kinematic constraint, and; 3. mode coupling. The negative damping instability, which is caused by the negative gradient of friction with respect to sliding velocity, is studied thorough linear eigenvalue analysis of a 1 -DOF lead screw drive model. The first order averaging method is applied to this model to gain deeper insight into the role of velocity-dependent coefficient of friction and to analyze the stability of possible periodic solutions. This analysis also is extended to a 2 -DOF model. It is also shown that higher order averaging methods can be used to predict the amplitude of vibrations with improved accuracy. Unlike the negative damping instability mechanism, kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can affect a system even when the coefficient of friction is constant. Parametric conditions for these instability mechanisms are found through linear eigenvalue analysis. It is shown that kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can only occur in self-locking lead screws. The experimental case study presented in this work demonstrates the need for active vibration control when eliminating vibration by design fails or when it is not feasible. Using the sliding mode control method, two speed regulators are developed for 1 -DOF and 2 -DOF lead screw drive system models where torque generated by the motor is the controlled input. In these robust controllers, no knowledge of the actual value of any of the system parameters is required and only the upper and lower bounds of parameters are assumed to be available. Simulation results show the applicability and performance of these controllers. The current work provides a detailed treatment of the dynamics of lead screw drives and the topic of friction-induced vibration in such systems. The reported findings regarding the three instability mechanisms and the friction parameters identification approach can improve the design process of lead screw drives. Furthermore, the developed robust vibration controllers can be used to extend the applicability of lead screws to cases where persistent vibrations caused by negative damping cannot be eliminated by design modifications due to constraints...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have {{previously}} {{found to be}} highly tissue- or disease-specific biomarkers with clinical applicability. However, the role of miRNAs in OSCC progression {{has yet to be}} well-studied. Here, we demonstrated the use of FFPE specimens in microarray profiling and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approaches to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in OSCC compared with non-tumour tissues. Materials and methods: Four OSCC and four non-tumour FFPE tissues were obtained from the Malaysian Oral Cancer Database and Tumour System (MOCDTBS), coordinated by OCRCC-UM and profiled using Agilent 8 Ã� 15 k mammalian miRNA microarray. Based on microarray results, TaqMan miRNA Assay (qPCR) is underway to validate the selected differentially expressed miR- 31, miR- 7, miR- 375 and miR- 151 - 3 p with an endogeneous control RNU- 44 using an independent set of FFPE tissue (seven OSCC and three non-tumuor tissues). Biological functions of targeted miRNAs were analyzed using GeneGO Pathway software. Results: Analysis of profiling identified 19 significantly up-regulated miRNAs (2 -fold change) and four significantly down-regulated miRNAs (2 -fold change). The targeted miR- 31, miR- 7 and miR- 151 - 3 p were up-regulated whilst miR- 375 was down-regulated in OSCC compared with non-tumour tissues. These initial microarray profiling results had been subsequently confirmed in qPCR validation except miR- 151 - 3 p, which was validated as down-regulated miRNA. Discussion: Interestingly, we have identified miRNA targets that can potentially be exploited to differentiate between betel-quid exposure OSCC with no risk habit related OSCC. These miRNA targets were found to interact with protein BuBRl in regulation of cellular component organization (p 0. 05, GeneGo Pathway software). BuBR 1 can be modified by arecoline in betel <b>nut</b> <b>leads</b> to abnormal cell cycle progression. Further analyses with larger sample set are on-going to validate the preliminary result and examine if the betel-quid exposures related with OSCC carcinogenesis may be acting through a specific miRNA alterations to lead to a malignant phenotypes.
