25|$|The Prince {{then takes}} Elika's body outside. There are four Fertile Grounds there, {{each with a}} tree, that {{according}} to what Elika had told him, channel the power of all the Fertile Grounds to the Tree of Life. He is given a vision {{which is the same}} one both he and Elika shared much earlier that shows her father's deal with Ahriman to revive her. When they shared the vision at that time she told the Prince that visions come from Ormazd, not Ahriman. The vision (just like the main debate throughout the game between Elika and the Prince was all about Destiny vs Free Will) is all about choice. The Prince re-creates the deal made by Elika's father. He destroys the four Fertile Grounds around the Temple and returns inside. He cuts down the Tree of Life and takes the <b>light</b> <b>power</b> Elika used to heal the Tree. The Prince returns the Light to Elika's body, and she returns to life. The game ends with the Prince carrying Elika across the desert while Ahriman's darkness envelops the world.|$|E
25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The <b>Light</b> <b>power</b> over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|Gates became {{influential}} {{in the development of}} the city of Port Arthur, Texas when he took over the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad in December 1899 after he forced it into bankruptcy along with its previous owner and Port Arthur founder Arthur Edward Stilwell. Gates built a winter home in the city and contributed much to its development. After Gates became the owner of the Port Arthur Canal and Dock Company, he held the asset for a time; in 1906 he gave the canal to the US government under the condition that Port Arthur would be named an international port of entry. [...] Gates founded the first bank, built a rice mill and established the Port Arthur <b>Light,</b> <b>Power</b> and Ice Company. When he decided to make Port Arthur his permanent residence in 1908, the town held a celebration. After Mary Gates died while on a visit to her son and his family in December 1908, Gates built Mary Gates Hospital to honor her memory. He was also a large contributor to Port Arthur Business College, and built a model farm to give the city a source of fresh dairy products.|$|E

2500|$|Energy {{conversion}} efficiency {{is measured by}} dividing the electrical output by the incident <b>light</b> <b>power.</b> Factors influencing output include spectral distribution, spatial distribution of power, temperature, and resistive load. IEC standard 61215 is {{used to compare the}} performance of cells and is designed around standard (terrestrial, temperate) temperature and conditions (STC): irradiance of 1kW/m2, a spectral distribution close to solar radiation through AM (airmass) of 1.5 and a cell temperature 25°C. [...] The resistive load is varied until the peak or maximum power point (MPP) is achieved. [...] The power at this point is recorded as Watt-peak (Wp). [...] The same standard is used for measuring the power and efficiency of PV modules.|$|E
2500|$|The watt (W) is {{the unit}} of power, and is usually quoted for the {{electrical}} power input, not the <b>light</b> <b>power</b> output. Electrical power {{is the product of}} voltage and current (watts = volts × amperes). [...] Input power is only useful when comparing lights of similar technologies. A 3W halogen dynamo headlight will light the road up about the same as a rechargeable light of around 7–10W, but the rechargeable usually outputs much more light to the sides, which is useful on trails (although wide and narrow beam versions are available). A 3W LED is somewhat brighter than a halogen lamp but generally less well focused. HID lights put out large amounts of light and are often quoted in terms like 80W halogen equivalent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{human eye}} with normal vision has {{three kinds of}} cone cells that sense light, having peaks of {{spectral}} sensitivity in short ("S", [...] – [...] ), middle ("M", [...] – [...] ), and long ("L", [...] – [...] ) wavelengths. These cone cells underlie human color perception in conditions of medium and high brightness; in very dim light color vision diminishes, and the low-brightness, monochromatic [...] "night vision" [...] receptors, denominated [...] "rod cells", become effective. Thus, three parameters corresponding to levels of stimulus of the three kinds of cone cells, in principle describe any human color sensation. Weighting a total <b>light</b> <b>power</b> spectrum by the individual spectral sensitivities of the three kinds of cone cells renders three effective values of stimulus; these three values compose a tristimulus specification of the objective color of the light spectrum. The three parameters, denoted [...] "S", [...] "M", and [...] "L", are indicated using a 3-dimensional space denominated the [...] "LMS color space", {{which is one of}} many color spaces devised to quantify human color vision.|$|E
