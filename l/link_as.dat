5|$|The West Durham <b>Link,</b> <b>as</b> it {{was then}} known, was first {{presented}} to Whitby Council on February10, 1992. It quickly drew the ire of local residents fearful of noise levels and the environmental effects on Lynde Creek.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian <b>link,</b> <b>as</b> it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|Tetra {{remains in}} the castle while Link and the King journey to the two sages who {{provided}} the Master Sword's power. They discover Ganon's forces murdered them both, so Link must awaken new sages: the Rito Medli and the Korok Makar. The sages restore the Master Sword, but the King learns that Ganon has abandoned the Forsaken Fortress, and fears an attack. They then track down the eight shards of the missing Triforce of Courage, once kept by the Hero of Time, and the gods recognize <b>Link</b> <b>as</b> the Hero of the Winds.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts flooded {{villages and}} disrupted transport networks. It was estimated by 18 November {{that at least}} 500km of roads had been damaged by flooding, with the Chennai-Kolkata highway damaged the previous day and stranding hundreds of vehicles and motorists; officials {{said it would take}} days to restore the <b>link.</b> <b>As</b> in Tamil Nadu, the Southern Railway diverted or cancelled numerous trains. Over 10,000 lorry drivers were stranded on the Tada-Kavali national highway in Nellore district; district officers established 61 relief camps in the flood-affected areas and deputed senior IAS officers to oversee the relief operations in Gudur, Naidupet and Atmakur divisions, respectively. Up to 500 tanks were breached as rivers overflowed, forcing the administration to suspend rescue operations in marooned villages, though administrators supplied 10,000 food and water packets through the rail network, which managed to operate some trains, while the APSRTC continued to run bus services to less-flooded areas such as Atmakuru, Udayagiri, Marripadu and Seetharampuram.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill <b>Link,</b> <b>as</b> sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
5|$|Passenger train services, using Class 150 diesel {{multiple}} units, were {{restored to}} the line after a gap of 46 years, on 6February 2008; between a new station at Ebbw Vale Parkway (close {{to the site of}} the original Victoria station) and Cardiff Central. The first train of the restored service left Cardiff Central for Ebbw Vale Parkway at 06:35 on Wednesday 6 February 2008. The first train to run in the opposite direction left five minutes later, packed with dignitaries for the official opening. Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones opened the line along with Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council's former Labour leader Hedley McCarthy. The first train from Ebbw Vale Parkway was waved off by local residents, who welcomed the <b>link</b> <b>as</b> a positive contribution to the valley's long term regeneration.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{project cost}} NOK1,814 million. The costs were {{distributed}} to NOK476 million for the Bømlafjord Tunnel, NOK433 million for the Stord Bridge, NOK336 million for the Bømla Bridge, NOK46 million for the Spissøy Bridge, NOK36 million for the Digernes Tunnel, NOK325 million for roadways and NOK172 for administration and common costs. The investment cost was split between state grants and NOK1,036 million in debt {{taken up by the}} toll company. When the project was passed by Parliament it had a budget of NOK1,260 million. The Office of the Auditor General of Norway criticized the Western Norway Public Roads Administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of NOK900 million in three projects, the Triangle Link, the Lærdal Tunnel and parts of National Road 555. The majority of the cost overruns were tied to the Triangle <b>Link.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set on}} a {{group of}} islands in a vast sea, a {{departure}} for the series. The player controls series protagonist <b>Link</b> <b>as</b> he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder's wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor's baton called the Wind Waker.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{advanced}} tolls was {{reviewed by the}} county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist Left Party, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle <b>Link,</b> <b>as</b> {{there would not be}} sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK200 and 300 million, and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997. In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor of the Triangle Link. The Socialist Left Party's proposal to build neither received 11 votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} slow time by landing {{successive}} hits and kills on enemies to fill an on-screen meter. The player {{can return to}} levels to attempt a higher score. The game's action sequences, {{more than half of}} the game, require the player to defeat groups of enemies before proceeding to the next room, and ultimately leading to a boss battle. Kameo has a two-player, split-screen cooperative gameplay mode in which players can fight alongside each other during the action scenes. Rare added support for online cooperative play (via Xbox Live or System <b>Link)</b> <b>as</b> a downloadable patch following the game's release.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Route 9 was {{designated}} {{by the state of}} New Jersey to run from Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth, passing through Clinton, Somerville, Plainfield, and Westfield. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 22 was concurrently designated along the entire length of Route 9. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 28 was legislated to run from Phillipsburg east to the Goethals Bridge, replacing pre-1927 Route 9 between Phillipsburg and present-day Route 439 in Elizabeth, and following current Route 439 toward the Goethals Bridge. Meanwhile, the former alignment of pre-1927 Route 9 east became Route 27-28 <b>Link,</b> <b>as</b> it provided a connection between Route 27 and Route 28. A spur of Route 28, named Route S28, was also legislated in the 1927 renumbering and was to run from Route 28 in Middlesex southeast to Route 4 (now Route 79) in Matawan. What was built of this route became Route 18 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By 1941, U.S. Route 22 was eventually moved from Route 28 to follow Route 28-29 Link and Route 29 between the Somerville area and Newark. Also, U.S. Route 22 was realigned to its current alignment along Route 24 and Route 24-28 Link in Phillipsburg, with the alignment along Route 28 becoming U.S. Route 22 Alternate (now Route 122). In the 1953 renumbering of state highways, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state highways, the western terminus of Route 28 was placed at the intersection of U.S. Route 22 and Easton Turnpike in Branchburg Township, with the designation west of there dropped in favor of U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 22 Alternate. In addition, Route 28 was moved to its current alignment in Elizabeth, replacing Route 27-28 Link; Route 439 {{was designated}} along the former alignment of Route 28 that ran to the Goethals Bridge.|$|E
