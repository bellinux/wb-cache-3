The observed shapes and positions of Fe I lines reveal asymmetries and wavelength shifts that {{indicate the presence}} of granulation. In particular, line bisectors show characteristic C-shapes while line core wavelengths are blueshifted by an amount that increases with decreasing equivalent width (EW). On average, Fe I line bisectors have a span that ranges from nearly 0 for the weakest <b>lines</b> (<b>residual</b> core flux > 0. 7) to about 75 m/s for the strongest <b>lines</b> (<b>residual</b> core flux ~ 0. 3) while wavelength shifts range from about - 150 m/s in the weakest (EW ~ 10 mA) lines to 0 in the strongest (EW > 100 mA) features. A more detailed inspection of the bisectors and wavelength shifts reveals star-to-star differences that are likely associated with differences in stellar parameters, projected rotational velocity, and stellar activity. For the inactive, slow projected rotational velocity stars, we detect, unequivocally, a plateau in the line-shifts at large EW values (EW > 100 mA), a behavior that had been identified before only in the solar spectrum. The detection of this plateau allows us to determine the zero point of the convective blueshifts, which is useful to determine absolute radial velocities.

Changes in the line shape are quantified using spectral line bisectors and <b>line</b> <b>residuals.</b> We detect no variations in either of these quantities above the level of the noise in the data. One spectral line, Fe I 6213 A, does show a hint of sinusoidal variations in the bisector velocity span when phased to the radial velocity period of 3. 3 days, but this is not seen in the bisectors for two other lines, nor in the <b>line</b> <b>residuals.</b> Comparisons of the data to the bisector and residual variations expected for nonradial pulsations indicate that we can exclude those sectoral nonradial modes having m> 2 and all sectoral modes with k> 1, where k is the ratio of the horizontal to vertical velocities for the pulsations. The lack of line shape variability and the 469 m/s radial velocity amplitude is still consistent with nonradial sectoral modes m= 1, and possibly m= 2, but with k~ 1, which is at least 3 orders of magnitude less than the predicted value given the 3. 3 day period of tau Bootis. Such low values of k can probably be excluded given the lack of photometric variations for this star. Although the measurements presented here do not prove, without any doubt, that tau Boo has a planetary companion, they do add significantly to the increasing body of evidence in favor of this hypothesis.

Methods. Very high resolution (R≃ 160, 000 − 210, 000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N � 300) spectra of nine bright K-dwarfs were obtained with the 2 dcoudé spectrograph on the 2. 7 m Telescope at McDonald Observatory to determine wavelength shifts and asymmetries of Feilines. Spectra of the same stars acquired with the High Resolution Spectrograph (R≃ 120, 000) on the 9. 2 m Hobby Eberly Telescope were used as radial velocity templates to calibrate the wavelength scale of the 2 dcoudé spectra. Results. The observed shapes and positions of Feilines reveal asymmetries and wavelength shifts that indicate the presence of granulation. In particular, line bisectors show characteristic C-shapes while line core wavelengths are blueshifted by an amount that increases with decreasing equivalent width (EW).

40|$|Airglow {{emission}} lines, which {{dominate the}} optical-to-near-IR sky radiation, show strong, line-dependent variability on various time scales. Therefore, the subtraction {{of the sky}} background in the affected wavelength regime becomes a problem if plain sky spectra {{have to be taken}} at a different time as the astronomical data. A solution of this issue is the physically motivated scaling of the airglow lines in the plain sky data to fit the sky lines in the object spectrum. We have developed a corresponding instrument-independent approach based on one-dimensional spectra. Our code skycorr separates sky lines and sky/object continuum by an iterative approach involving a line finder and airglow line data. The sky lines are grouped according to their expected variability. The line groups in the sky data are then scaled to fit the sky in the science data. Required pixel-specific weights for overlapping groups are taken from a comprehensive airglow model. Deviations in the wavelength calibration are corrected by fitting Chebyshev polynomials and rebinning via asymmetric damped sinc kernels. The scaled sky lines and the sky continuum are subtracted separately. VLT X-Shooter data covering time intervals from two minutes to about one year were selected to illustrate the performance. Except for short time intervals of a few minutes, the sky <b>line</b> <b>residuals</b> were several times weaker than for sky subtraction without fitting.

While the causality and influencing factors to these trends has widely been discussed, and has range from declining domestic growth rates as economies move towards high mass consumption states to globalisation, political decision making and policy application been referred to as both contributory or an instrument for dampening such trends, through the application of Partisan Business Cycles.

The average effective depths of the formation of used Fraunhofer lines in the photosphere of the Sun are determined. It is shown that with the increasing of the effective formation depths of the <b>lines</b> integral and <b>residual</b> asymmetries of the lines profiles noticeably decrease. It is in fine agreement with the results of intensity dependence of asymmetry. The above-mentioned methods are critically compared and the advantages of author’s method are shown. Key words.

The red line in Figs.  11 and 12 represents the negotiated part of the wages. Note that due to the institutional setting, the evolution of the negotiated part of the wages is sticky as it is usually predetermined for 3  years. As a result the negotiated part of the wages continued to rise even during years of economic downturn (grey area). 16 However, a simple graphical inspection of the evolution of the negotiated (red <b>line)</b> and <b>residual</b> (black <b>line)</b> part of the wages shows that in 2009 and in 2014, firms compensated for the increase of the negotiated part of the wages by reducing the residual component. 17 [...]...|$|R

This paper proposes a leakage {{localisation}} method based on the pressure measurements and pressure sensitivity analysis of nodes in a water distribution network. The sensitivity analysis using analytical tools is not a trivial job in a real network because of the huge non-explicit, non-linear systems of equations that describe its dynamics. Simulations of the network in presence and absence of leakage may provide an approximation of this sensitivity. A fault isolation algorithm which correlates on <b>line</b> the <b>residuals</b> (generated by comparing the available pressure measurements with their estimation using a model) with the fault sensitivity matrix is used. The proposed algorithm has been applied in simulation to a DMA (District Metered Area) in the Barcelona Network using EPANET software. The results obtained were promisingPostprint (published version...|$|R
