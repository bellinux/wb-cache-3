5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
500|$|The wing {{leading edges}} were swept {{back to a}} point inline with the engine nacelles, while the {{trailing}} edges were angled forward slightly. The wing contained two 700L (190US gal) fuel tanks between the inner wing main spars, while {{at the head of}} the main spar the oil coolers were fitted. Between the outer spars, a second pair of reserve fuel tanks were located, carrying an individual capacity of 910L (240US gal) of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved [...] "strip nosed" [...] rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar. Most of the interior ribs were not solid, with the exception of the ribs located between the rear main spar and the flaps and ailerons. These were of solid construction, though even they had <b>lightening</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Southern Railway {{placed an}} order for ten of the new {{locomotives}} to be built at Eastleigh Works, although the boilers had to be supplied from private industry and the tenders were built at Ashford.

The oval-shaped, semi-monocoque fuselage was made of 'shpon', molded birch plywood. The wings were also covered with 'shpon'. The upper wing had two spars, but the lower wing only had one. Internal bracing wires were not used in the wings as it was built up from plywood ribs with large <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> and stringers. V-struts made from Duralumin separated the wings and connected the upper wing to the fuselage. Steel bracing wires were used externally. An airfoil enclosed the axle of the fixed undercarriage and a small ski served as a tailskid. It had an imported [...] Napier Lion engine enclosed in a metal cowling.

50|$|<b>Lightening</b> <b>holes</b> {{are often}} used in the {{aviation}} industry. This allows the aircraft to be lightweight as possible retaining the durability and airworthiness of the aircraft structure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightening</b> <b>holes</b> {{became a}} {{prominent}} feature of motor racing in the 1920s and 1930s. Chassis members, suspension components, engine housings and even connecting rods were drilled {{with a range}} of holes, of sizes almost as large as the component.|$|E
50|$|The main {{differences}} of the Colt ACR and the M16A2 is the distinctive handguard with <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> and an elevated sight track rib {{with a white}} stripe to improve fast target acquisition, the removeable scope and streamlined 6 position telescopic stock and pistol grip.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightening</b> <b>holes</b> {{have been}} used in various {{military}} vehicles, aircraft, equipment and weaponry platforms. This allows equipment to be lighter in weight as well as increase the ruggedness and duribility. They are usually made by drilling holes, pressed stamping or machining and can also save strategic materials and cost during wartime production.|$|E
50|$|Pierced steel {{planking}} {{consisted of}} steel strips with punched <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> in it. These holes were in rows, and a formation of U-shaped channels between the holes. Hooks were formed along one long edge and slots along the other long edge so that adjacent mats could be connected. The short edges were cut straight with no holes or hooks. To achieve lengthwise interlocking, the mats were laid in a staggered pattern.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} to aircraft design, it was noticeable that motor racing 'lightening' {{was carried out}} after {{the design of the}} components, usually without understanding the forces in the structure and without re-performing any stress calculations afterwards. Owing to the increasing number of dangerous failures, the practice of drilling <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> was forbidden by the race scrutineers. Lightening was still permitted, but only where it had been specified by the original designers, not by simply drilling holes afterwards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightening</b> <b>holes</b> are {{holes in}} {{structural}} components of machines and buildings {{used by a}} variety of engineering disciplines to make structures lighter. The edges of the hole may be flanged to increase the rigidity and strength of the component. The holes can be circular, triangular, ovals, or rectangles and should have rounded edges, but they should never have sharp corners, to avoid the risk of stress risers, and they must not be too close {{to the edge of a}} structural component.|$|E
50|$|The Stoner 63 bipod is a {{non-locking}} {{type that}} {{attaches to the}} gas tube; it does not pivot and has a limited height adjustment feature. The Stoner 63A bipod is extensively perforated with <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> and can be locked in either the stowed or deployed positions. It too does not pivot but {{is compatible with the}} earlier Stoner 63, whereas the Stoner 63 bipod will not work with the later 63A pattern guns as the gas tube is of a larger diameter.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Design== The BFB {{comprises}} {{a single}} disc, with teardrop-shaped indentations to give rigidity, and <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> to reduce weight. The advantage over a spoked wheel {{is that a}} disc wheel carries the tyre (the metal hoop shrunk onto the wheel to provide contact with the rail) more efficiently; spoked wheels are prone to shrink over time, causing the tyre to work loose, whilst in a disc wheel this is less pronounced. Disc wheels also distribute the weight more evenly, reducing the hammer effect on, and thus the damage to, the rail.|$|E
50|$|The hooked, non-reciprocating steel {{charging}} handle is typically {{mounted on the}} right side of the receiver. It has 24 <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> and engages a projection on the piston to draw the piston and bolt group to the rear (cocked) position. The handle should then be pushed back forward allowing a flat-spring latch riveted to the front end to capture a slotted plate welded to the front of the receiver. With the right-hand feed mechanism with underslung box carrier installed the handle is awkward to operate, so a special slotted forearm with a bottom cocking handle was developed.|$|E

5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} use spoked {{driving wheels}} of cast steel. A few makers have favoured variants of this, seeking a more weight-efficient design by using {{various forms of}} hollow or girder spoke, rather than solid oval-section spokes. One {{of the most successful}} of these designs was the Bulleid Firth Brown (or BFB) wheel, often incorrectly confused with the Boxpok wheel. This had some features of the wobbly web, being developed from a flat disc wheel with short, wide [...] "spokes" [...] formed in it by displacing teardrop-shaped sections of the disc into another plane. Except for a few small <b>lightening</b> <b>holes,</b> this disc wheel is consistently one wall thickness thick, all around the disc.|$|E
50|$|The L86A1 LSW ("Light Support Weapon") is a magazine-fed squad {{automatic}} weapon {{originally intended to}} provide fire support at a fireteam level. Its barrel is longer than the L85A1 and has a shorter handguard with a support stock with <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> protruding from the front holding a bipod. The stock has a shoulder strap and rear pistol grip. The weapon is otherwise identical to the L85 version on which it is based, and the same 30-round magazines and sighting systems are used. Like the L85 rifle, it has a selector {{on the left side}} behind the magazine housing, enabling either single shots or automatic fire. The bolt and trigger system are modified, so the gun can be fired from open bolt.|$|E
50|$|On initial completion, {{the first}} {{locomotives}} {{were found to}} weigh 3 LT over the specification weight of 72 LT. A programme of lightening was begun: some of this involved cutting circular <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> into the bogie frames, and replacing steel buffer beams or roof panels with aluminium. Much of the over-weight was due to ancillary components, particularly the train-heating steam generators, being supplied over weight. To avoid waste, these components were replaced by lighter versions from other makers, but the heavier originals were then used in the Class 20 and Class 40 locomotives. The lightened locomotives eventually met British Rail's approval, but only after a painstaking weighing that involved specifying the amount of sand in the sandboxes and other precise details.|$|E

The front axle was a re-purposed and inverted (the flipped axle must be inverted to prevent the pinion gears from running the wrong way) rear axle from a contemporary Ford roadster. Tires were provided by Goodyear. The suspension used leaf springs [...] "turned sideways" [...] (transverse leaf springs) and bodywork featured sheet aluminum over an ash wood frame, with a roof partially constructed of snap-on painted canvas. Original blueprints indicate seating for four, including the driver. Fuller claimed to have achieved fuel economy of 36 mpg (7.8l/100 km) and to have reached a speed of 128 mph (206kph).|$|E
5000|$|Brakes on the [...] "CERV-I" [...] {{are similar}} to the HD type {{available}} on the Chevrolet Corvette. Sintered iron linings are used with fin cooled drums, and the brake drum webs are lightened by drilled <b>lightening</b> <b>holes</b> which also permit the flow of cooling air. The brake drums are cast aluminum with cast-in iron braking surfaces. The rear brakes are inboard mounted next to the differential so that braking torque is transmitted directly to the frame without influencing any of the rear wheel articulating members. Braking effort distribution is 57% front and 43% rear {{to take advantage of the}} superior braking characteristics of the weight distribution afforded by the rear engine type vehicle. The brakes may be actuated by either one of two pedals so that the driver may use either foot depending on the particular driving situation. An unusual brake master cylinder utilizes two pistons operating in series so that it either the front or rear brakes fail the remaining brakes can be actuated.|$|E

50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain <b>lightening</b> <b>holes.</b> These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|E
