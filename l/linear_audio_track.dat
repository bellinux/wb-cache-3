50|$|Several DVD volumes (8) were {{released}} in 2008 by Morningstar Ent. in Canada. However, these were direct Betamax transfers, (using the Betamax BII <b>linear</b> <b>audio</b> <b>track</b> {{which resulted in}} muffled sound, even though all the Beta releases had had their audio recorded in Beta Hi-Fi) and were not remastered in any way, Apparently because of legal reasons. Also, strangely, None of the DVDs mention MARVEL COMICS or ENTERTAINMENT anywhere.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, CTL {{timecode}} is {{an absolute}} timecode with specific digital references for every frame of video. Thus, a tape with CTL timecode can always display current timecode position accurately, even if the tape is moved from one machine to another. CTL timecode embedding can be transferred when making a copy, {{as long as the}} recording machine supports CTL timecode. Because CTL timecode is SMPTE timecode, its timecode can be interchanged with other SMPTE timecode schemes, like VITC and LTC (<b>linear,</b> <b>audio</b> <b>track)</b> timecode, as well as SMPTE timecode devices like timecode readers, generators, window dub inserters, MIDI synchronizers, and edit controllers.|$|E
50|$|After {{leaving the}} head drum, the tape passes over the {{stationary}} audio and control head. This records a control track {{at the bottom}} edge of the tape, {{and one or two}} <b>linear</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> along the top edge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{professional}} Betacam SP {{format of}} videocassette also used AFM on the higher-end [...] "BVW"-series of Betacam SP deck models from Sony (such as the BVW-75) to offer 2 extra <b>tracks</b> of <b>audio</b> alongside the 2 standard Dolby C-encoded <b>linear</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> for the format, {{for a total}} of 4 <b>audio</b> <b>tracks.</b> However, the 2 AFM tracks were accessible only on those decks equipped with AFM audio (like the BVW-75).|$|R
5000|$|For the {{professional}} and broadcast video industry, Sony derived Betacam from Betamax. Released in 1982, Betacam became {{the most widely used}} videotape format in ENG (electronic news gathering), replacing the [...]75 in wide U-matic tape format. Betacam and Betamax are similar in some ways: they use the same videocassette shape, use the same oxide tape formulation with the same coercivity, and record <b>linear</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> in the same location of the tape. But in the key area of video recording, Betacam and Betamax are completely different. (For details, see the Betacam article.) ...|$|R
50|$|Around 1984, JVC added Hi-Fi audio to VHS (model HR-D725U, in {{response}} to Betamax's introduction of Beta Hi-Fi.) Both VHS Hi-Fi and Betamax Hi-Fi delivered flat full-range frequency response (20 Hz to 20 kHz), excellent 70 dB signal-to-noise ratio (in consumer space, {{second only to the}} compact disc), dynamic range of 90 dB, and professional audio-grade channel separation (more than 70 dB). VHS Hi-Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation (AFM), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and embedding the combined modulated audio signal pair into the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS's implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called depth multiplexing. The modulated audio carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6 MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use this same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process was audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.) Since JVC had gone through the complexity of ensuring Hi-Fi's backward compatibility with non-Hi-Fi VCRs, virtually all studio home video releases produced after this time contained Hi-Fi audio tracks, in addition to the <b>linear</b> <b>audio</b> <b>track.</b> Under normal circumstances, all Hi-Fi VHS VCRs will record Hi-Fi and linear audio simultaneously to ensure compatibility with VCRs without Hi-Fi playback, though only early high-end Hi-Fi machines provided linear stereo compatibility.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} a {{superficial}} similarity between Betamax and Betacam in that they use the same tape cassette, they are really quite different formats. Betamax records relatively low resolution video using a heterodyne color recording system and only two recording heads, while Betacam uses four heads to record in component format, {{at a much higher}} linear tape speed of 10.15 cm/s (3.99606 in./s) compared with Betamax's 1.87 cm/s (0.7362205 in./s), resulting in much higher video and audio quality. A typical L-750 length Betamax cassette that yielded about 3 hours of recording time on a Betamax VCR at its B-II Speed (NTSC), or on PAL, only provided 30 minutes' record time on a Betacam VCR or camcorder. Another common point between Betamax and Betacam is the placement of the stereo <b>linear</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tracks.</b> Also, some Betacam and Betamax portables share the same batteries.|$|R
5000|$|A VHS {{cassette}} holds {{a maximum}} of about 430 m (1,410 ft.) of tape at the lowest acceptable tape thickness, giving a maximum playing time of about four hours in a T-240/DF480 for NTSC and five hours in an E-300 for PAL at [...] "standard play" [...] (SP) quality. More frequently however, VHS tapes are thicker than the required minimum to avoid complications such as jams or tears in the tape. Other speeds include [...] "long play" [...] (LP), and [...] "extended play" [...] (EP) or [...] "super long play" [...] (SLP) (standard on NTSC; rarely found on PAL machines). For NTSC, LP and EP/SLP doubles and triples the recording time accordingly, but these speed reductions cause a reduction in video quality - from the normal 250 lines in SP, to 230 analog lines horizontal in LP and even less in EP/SLP. The slower speeds cause a very noticeable reduction in <b>linear</b> (non-hifi) <b>audio</b> <b>track</b> quality as well, as the linear tape speed becomes much lower than what is commonly considered a satisfactory minimum for audio recording.|$|R

50|$|Both {{music and}} movie DVDs allow {{delivery}} of DTS audio signal, but DTS {{was not part}} of the original DVD specification, so early DVD players do not recognize DTS <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> at all.

The DTS <b>audio</b> <b>track,</b> if present, can be selected by the user. Subsequent DVD players now decode DTS natively or pass it through to an external decoder. Nearly all standalone receivers and many integrated DVD player/receivers can decode DTS.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{reliability}} and the scalability of content-based retrieval of variant <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> from large music databases, we suggest a new multi-stage LSH scheme that consists in (i) extracting compact but accurate repre-sentations from <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> by exploiting the LSH idea to summarize <b>audio</b> <b>tracks,</b> and (ii) adequately organizing the resulting representations in LSH tables, retaining almost the same accuracy as an exact kNN retrieval. In the first stage, we use major bins of successive chroma features to calcu-late a multi-probe histogram (MPH) that is concise but re-tains the information about local temporal correlations. In the second stage, based on the order statistics (OS) of the MPH, we propose a new LSH scheme, OS-LSH, to organize and probe the histograms. The representation and organi-zation of the <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> are storage efficient and support robust and scalable retrieval. Extensive experiments over a large dataset with 30, 000 real <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme...|$|R
