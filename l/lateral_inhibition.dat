The Notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the intercellular notch signal. In this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures.

25|$|In {{central nervous}} system not all bHLH genes are {{involved}} in neurogenesis because NeuroD and ‘’Math3/NeuroM’’ families are also involved in the neuronal-versus-glial cell fate decision. Another pro-neural family (which includes ‘’math1’’ and ‘’math5’’) {{is essential to the}} development of a small number of neural lineages whereas ‘’math1’’ have also a role in the specification interneuron identity. Cell types that depend on ‘’math1’’ expression belong to the proprioceptive sensory pathway. Bertrand et al. (2002) have confirmed the proneural activity of ‘’mash1’’, ngn1 and ngn2, and possibly math1 and ‘’math5’’ in the mouse. Neurogenesis in the {{central nervous system}} depends on proneural gene inhibition by Notch signaling pathway and the absence of this key regulator results in the premature differentiation of neurons. To maintain neural progenitor cells a regulatory loop takes place between neighboring cells, that involves the <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition</b> process (see <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition).</b> In the absence of <b>Lateral</b> <b>inhibition</b> some proneural genes such as ASCL1 or ‘’neuroG’’ are capable of inducing the expression of neuron-specific genes leading to the premature formation of early born-neurons. Ratié and colleagues (2013) comprised that Notch proneural gene network have an important role in cell fate renewal and transition in the mouse.|$|E
25|$|Not all proneural {{genes are}} equally {{sensitive}} to <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition.</b> For example, in Xenopus, Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete-scute complex) respond differently to <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition,</b> which reflect different ability to activate target genes and differential susceptibility of these target genes to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed {{that even when}} Notch/Delta signaling pathway is blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting neuronal differentiation, through the downregulation of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling {{is involved in the}} control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function.|$|E

Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help.

25|$|The proneural protein Atonal (Ato) is {{responsible}} for the development of Drosophila’s R8 photoreceptors. However, it does not act alone, since it dimerizes with a second identical protein, ‘’Daughterless (Da)’’ that reinforces its expression. The coexpression of ‘’Ato’’ and ‘’Da’’ is important for the migration of the different cell types of an ommatidium and for the repression of atonal in the inter-cluster spaces, functioning as inhibitory signals that regulate both the number and position of the nascent R8 cells. Moreover, this expression leads to the activation of the kinase MAPK that is important for the cellular recruitment and the repressor effect, once, when this kinase is inactive the expression of ‘’Ato’’ is detected in every cell. In an initial state, Hedgehog (‘’Hh’’) and Decapentaplegic are responsible for the activation of ‘’ato’’ in small cellular clusters, leading to the activation of MAPK. First, Hedgehog induces ‘’ato’’ expression in more than just the cells that ultimately become photoreceptor cells, so its expression has to be refined and restricted to a single presumptive R8 cell. Hedgehog signaling is also required to repress ‘’atonal’’ expression between the nascent proneural clusters, which reveals a dual role crucial to building precision and geometry into the adult retina. Therefore, the regulation of ‘’ato’’ expression depends on the levels of Hedgehog: at low levels (that is far from the source) this pronuclear gene is activated and at high levels (close to the source) it is repressed. Combining <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition</b> with the dual role played by Hedgehog, one can imagine how the hexagonal array of R8 cells can be patterned.|$|E
25|$|Proneural {{proteins}} bind DNA as heterodimeric complexes {{that are}} formed by bHLH proteins or E proteins. Because heterodimerization {{is a prerequisite}} for DNA binding, factors that interfere with dimerization effectively act as passive repressors of proneural gene activity. Proneural proteins specifically bind DNA sequences that contain a core hexanucleotide motif, CANNTG, known as an E-box. The basic region and helix 1 of the bHLH domain form a long alpha-helix that is connected with the loop region to helix 2. Direct contacts between bHLH residues and DNA are responsible for the common ability of neural bHLH proteins to bind to the core E-boxsequence. The cells within a cluster that express a proneural gene (called a proneural cluster) {{can be thought of as}} cells of an equivalence group. Within a proneural cluster, the cells compete with each other, such that only a subset of cells is singled out to develop into neuronal precursors. This singling out process is mediated by cell-cell interactions interpreted through the action of neurogenic genes. In neuroectoderm, neurogenic genes are required to single out cells from within proneural clusters to form neuronal precursors, leaving the remaining cells of proneural clusters to develop into epidermal cells. Proneural genes may function in analogous fashions in vertebrates and invertebrates, specifically they were implicated in early neurogenesis. Although proneural proteins are responsible for trigger neurogenesis, different proteins are required for different neural and/or glial cell types. This implies that each of these proteins is capable of regulating both common target genes for neurogenesis and unique target genes for neuronal subtype characteristics. Proneural bHLH transcription factors, not only drive neurogenesis by activating the expression of a cascade of neuronal genes, but they inhibit the expression of glial genes. Neural bHLH genes have different functions depending on: the sensitivity to <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition,</b> which determines if a cell becomes epidermal or neuronal, and whether the gene is expressed in the CNS before or after the terminal mitosis.|$|E

Phyllotaxis arises from reiterative organogenesis driven by <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibitions</b> at the shoot apex. Motivated by recurrent observations of disorders in phyllotaxis patterns, we revisited in depth the classical deterministic view of phyllotaxis.

2500|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>inhibition</b> is a cell-cell {{interaction}} {{that occurs}} within a proneural cluster to determine {{and limit the}} cells {{that give rise to}} neuroblast. During this interaction, nascent neuroblasts express pronuclear genes above a determined threshold and, at the same time, they express a membrane bound ligand, called ‘’Delta’’, which binds and activate Notch receptors expressed in neighboring cells. Once Notch is activated, the activity of proneural genes decreases in these cells, probably due to the activation of genes in the ‘’enhancer of split E(spl)’’ complex, encoding in inhibitory bHLH [...] transcription factors. When inhibited, proneural genes prevent cells from becoming neural, but also reduce their levels of ‘’Delta’’.

2500|$|Behavioral {{neuroscience}} {{applies the}} [...] principles of neurobiology, {{to the study}} of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior. [...] Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting biological factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory neurotransmitters, or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. [...] "GABA, an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the cerebral cortex in substantial quantities". Given the cerebral cortex's importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. Serotonin and dopamine, which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these neurotransmitters are capable of [...] "blocking" [...] the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the central nervous system has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibition,</b> which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the neural background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the cellular level.|$|E
40|$|The Superior Colliculus, a laminar {{structure}} {{involved in}} the retinotopic mapping of the visual field, plays a cardinal role in the several cortical and subcortical loops of the saccadic system. Although the selection of saccade targets has long been {{thought to be the}} sole product of cortical processes, a growing body of evidence hints at the implication of the Superior Colliculus, firstly by the lateral connections between the neurons of its maps, and secondly by its interactions with the midbrain Basal Ganglia, already renowned for their role in decision making. We propose a biomimetic population-coded race model of selection based on a dynamic tecto-basal loop that reproduces the observed ability of the Superior Colliculus to stochastically select between similar stimuli, the accuracy of this selection depending on the discriminability of the target and the distractors. Our model also offers an explanation for the phenomenon of Remote Distractor Effect based on the lateral connectivity within the Basal Ganglia circuitry rather than on <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibitions</b> within the collicular maps.

This behavior suggests that neurons transmit the largest meaningful part of their signal in the first spikes, and than that the spike latency is a good descriptor of the information content in biological neural networks. In this paper this property has been investigated in an artificial sensorial system where a single layer of spiking neurons is trained with the data generated by an artificial olfactory platform based on a large array of chemical sensors. The capability to discriminate between distinct chemicals and mixtures of them was studied with spiking neural networks endowed with and without <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibitions</b> and considering as output feature of the network both the spikes latency and the average firing rate.

However, {{it is still}} not well understood how to create a biologically plausible network of brain-like, spiking neurons with multi-layer, unsupervised learning. This paper explores a novel bio-inspired spiking CNN that is trained in a greedy, layer-wise fashion. The proposed network consists of a spiking convolutional-pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer extracting independent visual features. Kernels for the convolutional layer are trained using local learning. The learning is implemented using a sparse, spiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature discovery layer extracts independent features by probabilistic, leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that are sparsely active in response to stimuli. The layer of the probabilistic, LIF neurons implicitly provides <b>lateral</b> <b>inhibitions</b> to extract sparse and independent features. Experimental results show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to support a multi-layer learning. The visual features obtained from the proposed probabilistic LIF neurons in the feature discovery layer are utilized for training a classifier. Classification results contribute to the independent and informative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and feature discovery layers. The proposed model is evaluated on the MNIST digit dataset using clean and noisy images. The recognition performance for clean images is above 98 %. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is in the range 0. 1 % to 8. 5 % depending on noise types and densities.

In this study, we develop an accessible nonlinear and discrete probabilistic model to study simple generalisations of <b>lateral</b> activation and <b>inhibition.</b> By doing so, we identify novel modes of morphogenesis beyond the familiar Turing-type modes; notably, beyond stripes, hexagonal nets, pores, and labyrinths, we identify labyrinthine highways, Kagome lattices, gyrating labyrinths, and multi-colour travelling waves and spirals. The results are discussed within the context of Turing's original motivating interest: the mechanisms which underpin the morphogenesis of living organisms.
