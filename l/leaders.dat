The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan <b>leaders</b> can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan <b>leaders</b> are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan <b>leaders</b> sleep alone, although male <b>leaders</b> are allowed to take a mate. Female <b>leaders</b> are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E
