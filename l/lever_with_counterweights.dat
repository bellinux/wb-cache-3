2500|$|Tom Horn {{was one of}} the {{few people}} in the [...] "Wild West" [...] to have been hanged by a water-powered gallows, known as the [...] "Julian Gallows." [...] James P. Julian, a Cheyenne, Wyoming architect, {{designed}} the contraption in 1892. The trap door was connected to a lever which pulled the plug out of a barrel of water. This would cause a <b>lever</b> <b>with</b> a <b>counterweight</b> to rise, pulling on the support beam under the gallows. When enough pressure was applied, the beam broke free, opening the trap and hanging the condemned man.|$|R

50|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a precision}} forged unit running in seven three-layer bearings, <b>with</b> <b>counterweights</b> bolted onto the crank webs, much {{like any other}} diesel motor of its vintage. The middle bearing is also the thrust bearing. The connecting rods are of a split design, with bronze bushings for the piston pin.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} camshaft of the NSU Prinz used a two-rod system <b>with</b> <b>counterweights</b> {{at both ends}} of the drive system. NSU began using the system in the early 1950s and continued to use it in the Prinz 4 and Prinz Sport in the mid-1960s, although the NSU 1000 used a chain-driven system instead.|$|R

60|$|As already shown, {{the first}} theorem {{established}} in mechanics was, that equal weights suspended from a <b>lever</b> <b>with</b> equal arms {{would remain in}} equilibrium. Archimedes discovered that a <b>lever</b> <b>with</b> unequal arms was in equilibrium when one weight was to its arm as the other arm to its weight; that is--when the numerical relation between one weight and its arm was equal to the numerical relation between the other arm and its weight.|$|R

50|$|Although most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each {{equipped}} <b>with</b> <b>counterweights,</b> {{some use}} hydraulic jacks located below the deck. An {{example is the}} 52 ft span bridge at St Paul Avenue in Milwaukee (see also table bridges). Another design used balance beams to lift the deck, with pivoting bascules located {{on the top of}} the lift towers. An example of this kind was built at La Salle in Illinois, USA.|$|R
50|$|The same {{test-piece}} {{dimensions of}} 50 mm {{in diameter and}} 50 mm in height are used for both the RUL and the CIC tests. For the high-precision differential measuring system for determination of the deformation, the cylindrical test piece has a co-axial bore of 12.5 mm. Selection and application of the load on the test piece are reproducible and independent of the deformation through use of the hood-type furnace <b>with</b> <b>counterweights.</b>|$|R

30|$|Spring based {{systems have}} the {{advantage}} that no electrical power is needed, which reduces the weight and volume of the exoskeleton. Similar passive concepts do exist. However, due to the additional load, systems <b>with</b> <b>counterweights</b> are too heavy. In addition, springs with zero free length (i.e. ideal springs) compared to non-zero free length springs are costly or require an increased complexity [7]. For simplicity reasons, the solution focuses on using non-zero free length springs.|$|R
50|$|Amal's light-alloy <b>levers</b> <b>with</b> click-stop {{adjusters}} 509/001 {{brake and}} 509/002 clutch were taken-over by BSA and marketed under their 'Motoplas' accessories branding from 1967, with Doherty taking-over {{production of the}} traditional chromed-steel levers.|$|R
50|$|The moving signal {{arms were}} {{suspended}} <b>with</b> <b>counterweights</b> to enable easy adjustment. The indicators measured 1.74 m × 0.33 m. Only {{two of the}} original indicators still exist today; one is {{on display in the}} Boerdemuseum in Ummendorf and the other in the Museum for Communication in Berlin. These arms, as well as preserved construction drawings, suggest that the arms consisted of a wooden framework with a wood or sheet metal interior. This provided greater wind resistance.|$|R
