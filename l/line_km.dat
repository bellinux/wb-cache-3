40|$|Airborne {{geophysical}} surveying in Greenland during 1998 {{consisted of}} a magnetic project referred to as ‘Aeromag 1998 ’ and a combined electromagnetic and magnetic project referred to as ‘AEM Greenland 1998 ’. The Government of Greenland financed both with administration managed by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). With {{the completion of the}} two projects, approximately 305 000 <b>line</b> <b>km</b> of regional high-resolution magnetic data and approxi-mately 75 000 <b>line</b> <b>km</b> of detailed multiparameter data (electromagnetic, magnetic and partly radiometric) are now available from government financed projects. Figure 1 shows the location of the surveyed areas with high-resolution geophysical data together with the area selected for a magnetic survey in 1999. Completion of the two projects was marked by the release of data on 1 March, 1999. The data are included in the geoscien-tific databases at the Survey for public use; digital data and maps may be purchased from the Survey. The combined electromagnetic and magnetic survey in 1998 completes the five-year project AEM Greenland 1994 – 1998 that has had the primary objective of stim-ulating mining exploration activity in Greenland (Stemp & Thorning 1995). During this five-year period, high-resolution electromagnetic and magnetic data have been acquired from selected areas in Greenland (Fig. 1). The surveys cover regions of contrasting topography and geology from the Archaean craton to basalts of the Tertiary igneous province. A complete reference list including publications from the previous surveys is found in Thorning & Stemp (1998).

40|$|Subtractive {{hybridisation}} {{was used}} to select for genes which are differentially expressed between a highly metastatic human colon carcinoma cell <b>line,</b> <b>KM</b> 12 SM, and the isogenetic non-metastatic cell <b>line,</b> <b>KM</b> 12 C. This led to the isolation of cDNA clones for a novel human adenosine 5 '-phosphosulphate kinase/ATP sulphurylase (PAPS synthetase). Northern hybridisation revealed a single 4. 2 kb mRNA species which showed an approximately 20 -fold higher level of expression in the non-metastatic cell line than in the metastatic cell line. The overlapping cDNA clones together covered 3, 774 bp including the entire coding region of 1, 842 bp encoding a protein of 614 amino acids (calculated molecular mass of 69, 496 Da). The protein contains consensus sequences for APS kinase and ATP sulphurylase, in its amino- and carboxy-terminal regions, respectively, {{as well as other}} sequences that are highly conserved amongst ATP sulphurylases and APS kinases. Interestingly, consensus sequences for GTPase activity were also identified, indicating that enzyme activity may be regulated by an intrinsic GTPase mechanism. Overall the new protein is 78 % homologous with a previously described human PAPS synthetase (PAPSS 1) indicating that we have identified the second member of a gene family which we have provisionally named PAPSS 2. The gene locus for PAPSS 2 was identified on chromosome 10 at 10 q 23. 1 -q 23. 2. This locus has synteny with the mouse brachymorphic gene recently identified as a PAPS synthetase (SK 2). PAPSS 2 appears to be the human homologue of this gene and thus PAPSS 2 is likely to be important in human skeletogenesis. Vicki L. Franzon, Mark A.
