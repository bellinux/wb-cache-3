5000|$|To [...] "cut and run" [...] {{was defined}} by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as [...] "to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor". He further {{described}} the practice as [...] "quick but very expensive" [...] but sometimes necessary, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on lee shore and the ship {{is in danger of}} embayment, or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy; instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the hawsehole, Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> and cable. An alternate origin comes from the practice on square rig ships to furl the sails stopped to the yards with ropeyarns so that the yarns may be cut to let the sails fall unfurled should an urgent need to sail arise. The phrase was in use by the early 1700s, and Oxford English Dictionary cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to The Boston News-Letter in 1704.|$|E

40|$|The ever-evolving retail {{landscape}} in the United States represents {{a narrative of}} change for local communities. While change may signify instability, it also presents opportunities for innovation. This dichotomy is particularly pertinent in small downtowns, where the faltering of both national chain and locally owned retail establishments is felt, not only by business owners, but by {{all members of the}} community. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> stores (large stores that serve to draw patrons to a commercial center) has proven especially challenging for downtowns that formerly relied on the consumer traffic generated by a big-name retailer. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> stores also scars the built environment, which is often not designed to respond fluidly to programmatic flux. While the default response to a failed anchor store is often to simply replace it with a slightly more robust retail anchor, this approach to renewal is shortsighted, for the replaced anchor store will inevitably fail as well. Instead, it is essential that the reuse of vacant anchor spaces be designed to not only sustainably support local economies, but also to address and enhance community and the built environment. Reprogramming, as opposed to replacing, former anchor stores presents an opportunity to embrace change in order to build a truly sustainable and vibrant neighborhood that considers retail to be one of many assets. This thesis presents a study of and an intervention at the site of a, still vacant, former Borders bookstore and café in the downtown of a New York City metro north community. The design proposal seeks to identify, develop, and celebrate the coalescence of the site’s economic, social, and architectural potentials. Paradoxically, while the proposal focuses on promoting the local capacity of a particular place, the greater implications of this study can be translated to other small downtowns nationwide, and perhaps even globally...|$|E

40|$|Recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} episodes of recurrent spontaneous epithelial defects. Main clinical symptoms (pain, redness, photophobia, lacrimation) occurred at night. Corneal lesions revealed by slit lamp exam {{vary depending on the}} presence of corneal epithelium raise, epithelial microcysts or epithelial erosions, stromal infiltrates and opacities. Microtraumas, anterior corneal dystrophies, and herpesvirus give rise to RCE. Other causes or factors which increase the risk of RCE syndrome include meibomian gland dysfunction, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, diabetes, and post-LASIK conditions. Basal membrane abnormalities and instability of epithelial adhesion to stroma {{play a key role in}} RCE pathogenesis. Ultrastructural changes in RCE include abnormalities of basal epithelial cells and epithelial basal membrane, absence or deficiency of semi-desmosomes, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> fibrils. Increase in matrix metalloproteinases and collagenases which contribute to basal membrane destruction results in recurrent erosions and further development of abnormal basal membrane. The goals of RCE therapy are to reduce pain (in acute stage), to stimulate re-epithelization, and to restore «adhesion complex» of basal membrane. In most cases, RCE responds to simple conservative treatment that includes lubricants, healing agents, and eye patches. RCEs that are resistant to simple treatment, require complex approach. Non-invasive methods include long-term contact lens use, instillations of autologous serum (eye drops), injections of botulinum toxin (induces ptosis), antiviral agent use or oral intake of metalloproteinase inhibitors. Cell membrane stabilizers, i. e., antioxidants, should be included into treatment approaches as well. Antioxidant effect of Emoxipine promotes tissue reparation due to the prevention of cell membrane lipid peroxidation as well as due to its anti-hypoxic, angioprotective, and antiplatelet effects. If conservative therapy is ineffective, surgical procedures (Bowman’s membrane polishing with diamond drill, anterior stromal puncture, excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy) are required. RCE therapy decision making should consider disease severity, the presence of concurrent pathology, medical experience and surgical instrument availability if needed.  </p...|$|E

40|$|The S-layer of the gram-negative {{bacterium}} Caulobacter crescentus {{is composed of}} a single protein, RsaA, that is secreted and assembled into a hexagonal crystalline array that covers the organism. Despite the widespread occurrence of comparable bacterial S-layers, {{little is known about}} S-layer attachment to cell surfaces, especially for gram-negative organisms. Having preliminary indications that the N terminus <b>of</b> RsaA <b>anchors</b> the monomer to the cell surface, we developed an assay to distinguish direct surface attachment from subunit-subunit interactions where small RsaA fragments are incubated with S-layer-negative cells to assess the ability of the fragments to reattach.

In this research project, concrete spalling and tension stiffening are addressed, the attention being focused on corner spalling in reinforced and unreinforced prismatic specimens in the former case, and on reinforced tension members in the latter case. An experimental procedure to assess concrete sensitivity to spalling is proposed as well. Though very different in their nature, concrete spalling and tension stiffening are investigated within the same project, because (a) the same prismatic specimens are firstly subjected to a rather severe temperature-time ramp to provoke spalling and later to sustained high temperature to induce a generalized damage in the concrete; and (b) the bars placed in the corners are the most exposed {{to the risk of}} spalling and to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> bond, to the detriment of tension stiffening.
