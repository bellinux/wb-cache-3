Spikelets and flag leaves were harvested in 2.0  mL safe <b>lock</b> <b>tube</b> (Eppendorf Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with zirconia beads and stored at − 80  °C until free amino acid extraction. The plant samples were pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen, and then milled with Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen, K. K., Tokyo, Japan) at 25 hertz for 2  min. Powdered samples were resolved in 10  mM HCl, mixed in Tissue Lyser II at 25 hertz for 1  min, and centrifuged at 20, 500 [*]g for 15  min at room temperature. The supernatant (ca. 100  μl) {{was transferred to the}} prepared Amicon Ultra- 0.5  mL Centrifugal Filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) on 1.5  mL tubes, and centrifuged at 20, 500 [*]g for 15  min at room temperature. The flow-through was collected and stored at − 30  °C until labeling. The AccQ•Tag Ultra Derivatization Kit (Nihon Waters K.

25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to <b>lock</b> two telescoping <b>tubes</b> together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer <b>tube</b> thus <b>locking</b> the two <b>tubes</b> together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|R
40|$|Traveling with a {{full size}} bicycle can be problematic. A light weight bicycle frame was {{designed}} to collapse {{to be able to}} fit into carry-on luggage for transport on an airplane. The required dimensions of the suitcase are 22 by 14 by 9 inches. This bicycle was also designed to be able to sustain a load of 200 pounds, with minimal deflection throughout the frame. The frame was constructed using aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes that were cut to a specific size to be used for telescoping tubes along the front triangle of the frame, known as the top, down, and seat tubes. The telescoping <b>tubes</b> are pin <b>locked</b> when extended to ensure the structural integrity of the frame. These hitch pins were selected due to the ball bearing {{at the end of the}} pin, which helps keep the pin in place while the bicycle is being used. The frame along the chain and seat stays of the frame use pin <b>locking</b> <b>tube</b> hinges. These hinges were specifically chosen for this project so that they could assist in easily collapsing the bicycle, while keeping the structural integrity of the bike intact. The designed frame was not to exceed 15 pounds and the finished product was successful, weighing in at less than 13 pounds. While the dimensions of the frame are 38 by 22 by 6 inches when fully extended, the final dimensions of the frame when it is collapsed are 22 by 14 by 5 inches. Other results include load and deflection testing...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the <b>lock</b> torque <b>tube</b> (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the locking pins, making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R

50|$|The weapon {{consists}} of a rocket within a launcher consisting of two tubes, one inside the other. While closed, the outer assembly serves as a watertight container for the rocket and the percussion-cap firing mechanism that activates the rocket. The outer tube contains the trigger, the arming handle, front and rear sights, and the rear cover. The inner tube contains the channel assembly, which houses the firing pin assembly, including the detent lever. When extended, the inner tube telescopes outward toward the rear, guided by the channel assembly, which rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube's trigger housing assembly. This causes the detent lever to move under the trigger assembly in the outer <b>tube,</b> both <b>locking</b> the inner <b>tube</b> in the extended position and cocking the weapon. Once armed, the weapon is no longer watertight, even if the launcher is collapsed into its original configuration.|$|R

40|$|Insertion of trocars, needles, and {{catheters}} into unintended tissues or tissue compartments {{results in}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} complications annually. Current methods for blood vessel cannulation or epidural, chest tube, and initial trocar placement often involve the blind pass of a needle through several layers of tissue and generally rely on distinguishable anatomic landmarks and a high degree of clinical skill. To address this simply and without the use of electronics, a purely mechanical clutch system was developed for use in medical devices that access tissue and tissue compartments. This clutch utilizes the surface contact of a buckled filament inside an S-shaped tube to transmit force from the filament (catheter/guide wire) to the tube (needle). Upon encountering sufficient resistance at the tip, such as dense tissue, the catheter buckles and <b>locks</b> within the <b>tube,</b> causing the filament and needle to advance as one. When the needle reaches the target tissue or fluid-filled cavity, the filament unlocks and slides freely into the target region while the needle remains stationary. A similar locking phenomenon has long been observed in drill strings inside drill shafts used by the oil-drilling industry, and oil industry models were adapted to describe the motion of this clutch system. A predictive analytical model was generated and validated with empirical data and used to develop prototypes of a complete device then tested in vitro on muscle tissue and in vivo on a porcine laparoscopic model with promising results...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} elucidates {{the load}} capacities of wooden shores and adjustable steel tube shores that {{are commonly used}} in construction. A series of loading tests was performed based on actual setups used on construction sites. Research results reveal that the load capacity of an isolated wooden or an adjustable steel tube shore declines as its length increases, and the load capacity of adjustable steel tube shores greatly exceeds that of wooden shores of the same length in isolated and multi-post shoring systems. A wooden shore fails by buckling under compression load. The failure of an adjustable steel tube shore in tests is due to buckling when the shore length exceeds 3. 96 m, and the failure will be resulted from damage of connecting <b>tube</b> <b>lock</b> if the shore length is less than 3. 96 m. When the top block of the adjustable steel tube shore is a wooden stringer, the load capacity is remarkably less than when it is a steel block. Adjustable steel tube shores will be reduced in load capacity after reuses. The load capacity of an isolated shore is reduced when the shore is placed on an inclined base. Reinforcing an isolated wooden shore with horizontal wooden bars and iron wires increases its load capacity. However, when an isolated wooden shore is reinforced with lateral cable bracings, the load capacity is not affected. Inserting the woodblock under an isolated wooden shore on an inclined plane can increase the load capacity of the shore. The multi-post shoring system that is reinforced with horizontal bracings only slightly affects the total load capacity of the system studied in this paper.

40|$|I'he {{accurate}} rreasurement of bed {{shear stress}} {{has been extremely}} difficult due to its changing values until white propunded a theory which would give constant shear along the bed of a flume. In this investigation a flume has been designed according to White's theory and by two separate methods proven to give constant shearing force along the bed. The first method applied the Hydrogen Bubble Technique to obtain accurate values of velocity thus allowing the velocity profile to be plotted and the momentum at the various test sections to be calculated. The use of a 16 mm Beaulieu movie camera allowed the exact velocity profiles created by the hydrogen bubbles to be recorded whilst an analysing projector gave the means of calculating the exact velocities at the various test sections. Simultaneously Preston's technique of measuring skin friction using Pitot tubes was applied. Twc banks of open ended water manometer were used for recording the static and velocity head pressure drop along the flume. This tvpe of manometer eliminated air <b>locks</b> in the <b>tubes</b> and {{was found to be}} sufficiently accurate. Readings of pressure and velocity were taken for various types and diameters of bed material both natural sands and glass spheres and the results tabulated. Graphs of particle Reynolds Number against bed shear stress were plotted and gave a linear relationship which dropped off at high values of Reynolds number. It was found that bed movement occurred instantaneously along the bed of the flume once critical velocity had been reached. On completion of this test a roof curve inappropriate to the bed material was used and then the test repeated. The bed shearing stress was now no longer constant and yet bed movement started instantaneously along the bed of the flume, showing that there are more parameters than critical shear stress to bed movement. It is concluded from the two separate methods applied that the bed shear stress is constant along the bed of the flume...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{researches}} in {{the field}} of bicycle dynamics deal with auto-stabilization and rider control by means of steertorque and lean-torque. Bicycle models composed by rigid bodies with the wheels making knife-edge rolling point contact with the road are suited for carrying out these studies. Numerical analysis of stability by means of these models leads to the capsize, castering and weave modes, which make it possible to understand many aspects of bicycle dynamics. However, some high performance bicycles at high speed show dangerous wobble oscillations. Cyclists’ experience and recent researches highlight that wobble phenomena are related both to tire properties and to fork and frame compliance. Since structural compliance in dynamic conditions generates vibrations, this paper focuses on the study of structural vibrations of high performance bicycles with the modal analysis approach. To isolate the effects of frame and fork compliance, four particular bicycles are considered, they are built assembling a pair of wheels, two forks (fork A and B) with the same shape but different structures and materials and two frames (frame A and B) with the same shape but different structures. Preliminary road tests showed that bicycles made with components A are more prone to wobble oscillations. In order to have a better comprehension of the different influence of fork and frame compliance, first the two forks (with the front wheel) are modally tested with the steer <b>tube</b> <b>locked</b> to a very stiff structure, then, the whole bicycles are tested. Modal analysis is carried out with the impulse method, for the analysis of each bicycle 60 FRFs are measured. The results of modal analysis are presented and the influence of identified modes on bicycle stability is discussed. An important issue of modal analysis of vehicles is the correlation between modal tests carried out in laboratory and bicycle behavior on the road. When the vehicle is tested in laboratory, additional constraints are added to guarantee equilibrium, but centrifugal forces are not present, because the vehicle is stationary. Since the analysis of the equations of linearized dynamics shows that the stiffness matrix includes a part due to centrifugal effects, the additional stiffness terms due to constraints in laboratory tests can be assumed to be equivalent to the centrifugal terms of the stiffness matrix at a certain speed. Details and limits of this equivalence are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Sampling cores {{requires}} the controlled breakoff {{of the core}} at a known location {{with respect to the}} drill end. An additional problem is designing a mechanism that can be implemented at a small scale that is robust and versatile enough to be used for a variety of core samples. This design consists of a set of tubes (a drill tube and an inner tube) and a rolling element (rolling tooth). An additional tube {{can be used as a}} sample tube. The drill tube and the inner tube have longitudinal holes with the axes offset from the axis of each tube. The two eccentricities are equal. The inner tube fits inside the drill tube, and the sample tube fits inside the inner tube. While drilling, the two tubes are positioned relative to each other such that the sample tube is aligned with the drill tube axis and core. The drill tube includes teeth and flutes for cuttings removal. The inner tube includes, at the base, the rolling element implemented as a wheel on a shaft in an eccentric slot. An additional slot in the inner tube and a pin in the drill tube limit the relative motion of the two tubes. While drilling, the drill assembly rotates relative to the core and forces the rolling tooth to stay hidden in the slot along the inner tube wall. When the drilling depth has been reached, the drill bit assembly is rotated in the opposite direction, and the rolling tooth is engaged and penetrates into the core. Depending on the strength of the created core, the rolling tooth can score, <b>lock</b> the inner <b>tube</b> relative to the core, start the eccentric motion of the inner tube, and break the core. The tooth and the relative position of the two tubes can act as a core catcher or core-retention mechanism as well. The design was made to fit the core and hole parameters produced by an existing bit; the parts were fabricated and a series of demonstration tests were performed. This invention is potentially applicable to sample return and in situ missions to planets such as Mars and Venus, to moons such as Titan and Europa, and to comets.

40|$|Authors: Roey Angel ### Abstract The {{following}} protocol {{is intended}} for the simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from various soil samples along with {{suggestions on how to}} tweak the protocol for soil with higher humic content. The protocol has been used by many and results in very high yields of nucleic acids, typically much more than commercial kits. For buffers and solutions used in this protocol, please see accompanying document Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions. pdf. ### Introduction This protocol is a general procedure for the co-extraction of DNA and RNA from soils. The procedure results in very high yields of nucleic acids and is suitable for all downstream enzymatic reactions. The protocol has been published in: [Angel et al. 2012]([URL] **NA extraction considerations** - **RNA handling**: as RNA is very sensitive to both chemical and enzymatic degradation meticulous measures of precaution must be taken. The use of DEPC and DEPC-treated water is not recommended since the substance is toxic and its application was found to be nearly unnecessary (see: [URL] Instead, I recommend to simply work with clean, preferably baked, glassware (3 h at 180 °C), to clean surfaces and spatulas with RNase eliminating solutions (such as RNaseZap®), and to use fresh and clean reagents for the preparation of the different buffers and solutions. As a general rule, work with RNA should be quick, precise, and tubes should be kept on ice. In my experience, this is much more important than any attempt to eliminate all RNases from apparatus and solutions. One should also bear in mind that soil samples contain infinitely more RNases than any contamination which might exist in the buffers or the apparatus. The only exceptions to this are the PEG Precipitation Solution, the Low TE Buffer, and the RNA storage solution. Since these are used to store RNA for relatively long periods of incubation extra care must be taken during their preparation to ensure highest degree of purity. For the preparation of the PEG Precipitation Solution I simply weigh everything into a Schott Bottle and add approximately the right amount of water as I prefer to be somewhat inaccurate in the concentrations than to have to transfer the solution between vessels and risk contamination. - **Selection of extraction buffer**: The TNS buffer used in this protocol is based on The TNS extraction buffer is based on the one used by [Henckel et al]([URL] 1999 TNS buffer results in higher RNA yields and more intact rRNA (more intact 23 S band). However, TNS tends to carry much more humic substances into the nucleic acids phase compared to TNC buffer which could make it ineffective for soils with high organic matter content. - **Use of phenol in the bead beating process**: the use of phenol increases the yield up to 4 times compared with the phenol free option, but also increases the carryover of humic substances. If you choose not to add phenol simply double the amount of extraction buffer added (1. 0 ml in total) - **RNAlater®**: if samples were stored in an RNAlater® solution or similar substance it is necessary to remove it before proceeding with RNA extraction. Centrifuge the sample at 10, 000 rpm for 1 min and pipette the supernatant. Add 1 ml of PB pH 8. 0, vortex the sample for 10 s to make sure the soil is washed by the buffer, and centrifuge it again at 10, 000 rpm for 1 min Remove the supernatant completely and proceed with normal extraction. - **Extra dry soil**: for extra dry soil (< 5 % WC) it is recommended to add some (up to 250 µl) PB pH 8. 0 in addition to the usual amount of 375 µl during the first bead beating processing. The reason is that in dry soils some of the extraction buffer is inevitably absorbed in the soil and cannot be recovered afterwards. This can lead to low recovery volumes from the bead beating process which could make it hard to separate the aqueous phase from the phenolic phase and eventually result in reduced yields. After the first processing the soil is wet enough and no further additions are required. - **pH of the extraction buffers**: The phenol and the extraction buffers used in this protocol are all at pH 8. 0. It has been shown that performing the extraction at pH 5. 5 yields significantly fewer humic substances in the extractant and is recommended for soils rich in organic material. Using such low pH, however, will also significantly decrease the amount of DNA yield (while not affecting RNA yield). Low pH extraction might therefore not be suitable if DNA is also to be analysed. For more information see [Mettel et al]([URL] 2010. - **Number of bead beating processing**: for most soil types (especially if they’re not too clayish), one time processing should be sufficient to obtain enough NA for further applications. The following two repetitions are meant not only to increase yields but also to reduce the bias associated with the susceptibility of different cell types to lysis. [Feinstein et al. 2009]([URL] found that DNA extraction yields kept increasing even after the 6 th bead beating repetition, and that community structure differed somewhat in each repetition. - **Amount of crude extract to use for RNA purification**: this depends mostly on the colour of the crude extract, and its quantity and purity as measured spectrophotometrically. In addition, the decision should take into account the final volume of the RNA. Between 20 - 100 µl may be used depending on colour, purity and amount of NA. - **Quantification**: it’s not possible to precisely quantify total NA using a spectrophotometer because DNA and RNA require different multiplication factors, but this should nevertheless give a sensible estimation. More precise quantifications of DNA and RNA can be obtained using Invitrogen’s PicoGreen™ and RiboGreen™, respectively. Impurities, especially humic substances, greatly interfere with spectrophotometeric quantification, though PicoGreen™ and RiboGreen™ tend to be less sensitive. - **Three steps purification procedure**: purification with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform should yield pure enough samples for most applications. Adding an additional purification step with only phenol prior to the phenol/chloroform purification (step 8) will ensure high TNA purity while only minimally compromising the yield. ### Reagents For recipes of the solutions which need to be prepared see: Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions. pdf under ‘Figures’. 1. TNS or TNC extraction buffer. - Phosphate buffer (PB) pH 8. 0 or pH 5. 5. - PEG precipitation solution. - Phenol for molecular biology, TE saturated (pH ~ 7. 8). - Phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25 : 24 : 1 for molecular biology. - Chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24 : 1 for molecular biology. - Glycogen (20 mg/ml). - 75 % ethanol made with RNase free water, stored at - 20 °C. ### Equipment 1. Bead beater suitable for screw-top 2 mL tubes. - Ice box. - Standard 2 ml polypropylene tubes. - 2 ml Non-Stick tubes (e. g. from Ambion). - 2 ml screw top tubes. - Optional: Phase <b>Lock</b> Gel <b>tubes</b> (5 Prime). - 0. 1 mm glass beads or Lysing Matrix E (MP bio). - Optional: MicroSpin S- 200 HR (GE). ### Procedure **Before you begin** 1. Prepare all solutions, filter and autoclave them. - Clean all surfaces and centrifuges with an RNase eliminating solution. - Prepare beads tubes by pouring 0. 7 g (one full PCR tube) of 0. 1 mm glass beads to the screw top tube. - For each sample prepare in a rack: 1 beads tube, 4 standard 2 ml tubes and 2 Ambion’s Non-Stick 2 ml tubes. Label the beads tube and the Non-Stick tubes with stickers and the standard 2 ml tubes with a marker. **Procedure** 1. Weigh 0. 5 g (0. 3 - 0. 7 g) soil to a silica beads tube and place tube on ice. - Add 375 µl of PB, 125 µl of TNS or TNC and 500 µl of TE saturated phenol. - Immediately place tubes in a bead beater and process for 30 s at 6. 5 m s- 1. - Chill on ice for 10 s. - Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer the supernatant (extraction buffer and the phenolic phase) to a fresh 2 ml tube (or to a Phase <b>Lock</b> Gel <b>tube),</b> retain the silica beads tubes. - Repeat steps 2 - 6 using the same silica beads tubes. If there is not enough space in the tube for all the reagents, decrease the phenol volume (down to 200 µl) to avoid overflow. For the second extraction use fresh 2 ml tubes to collect the supernatant in step 6 while for the third extraction transfer only the aqueous phase and divide it between the tubes from the previous extractions to have equal volumes. - Add approximately 800 µl phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25 : 24 : 1 to each of the tubes containing the extractant, 2 ml total volume. - Mix phases by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer the supernatant from each tube to fresh 2 ml tubes, and add 1 vol. chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24 : 1. Mix phases by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer supernatant from each tube to fresh 2 ml non-stick silicon tubes. - Add to each tube 1 µl of glycogen and 1 ml PEG Precipitation Solution (twice the extractant’s volume). - Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 60 min at 4 o C. - Remove as much as possible from the supernatant. Be careful not to pipette the pellet with the liquid. - Wash once with 1 ml of ice cold 75 % EtOH, invert the tube several times. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 20 min. - Remove as much as possible from the supernatant first using a 1 ml tip, spin down the remaining drops in the tube, and remove them with a 100 µl tip. Once again, be careful not to pipette the pellet with the liquid. - Leave tubes open at room temperature for no more than 5 min (preferably under flame or a biological hood) in order to evaporate the remaining ethanol (note: pellets might not be completely dry at this point). Alternatively, pellets can be dried under a filtered stream of N 2. - Resuspend the pellets in 100 µl Low TE Buffer and combine both subsamples from each sample into one of the non-stick tubes. - Optional: to remove colour and some humic substances purify the extract using MicroSpin S- 200 HR (GE Healthcare) the following way: - a. Resuspend the resin in a column by vortexing. - b. Loosen the cap by a quarter twist, place column in a collection tube and centrifuge 1 min at 735 × g. - c. Place column in a fresh 1. 5 ml tube, apply 25 - 100 µl of sample to the resin. - d. Centrifuge 2 min at 735 × g. - Run 5 - 10 µl on agarose gel to evaluate NA quality. - Quantify total NA spectrophotometrically (dilute 1 : 10 in Low TE buffer before measuring) or DNA using PicoGreen™ (Invitrogen). - Depending on quality and quantity, aliquot 10 - 100 µl for RNA purification. - Optional: aliquot 10 - 100 µl for DNA purification. ### Anticipated Results High yields of high quality DNA and RNA for downstream enzymatic reactions. ### References 1.
