40|$|Intestinal lymphangiectasia is {{characterized}} by obstruction of lymph drainage from the small intestine and lacteal dilation that distorts the villus architecture. <b>Lymphatic</b> vessel <b>obstruction</b> and elevated intestinal lymphatic pressure in turn cause lymphatic leakage into the intestinal lumen, thus resulting in malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy. Intestinal lymphangiectasia can be congenital or secondary to a disease that blocks intestinal lymph drainage. We describe the first case of intestinal lymphangiectasia in a premature infant. The infant presented with peripheral edema and low serum albumin; high fecal concentration of alpha (1) -antitrypsin documented intestinal protein loss. Endoscopy showed white opaque spots on the duodenal mucosa, which indicates dilated lacteal vessels. Histology confirmed dilated lacteals and also showed villus blunting. A formula containing {{a high concentration of}} medium chain triglycerides resulted in a rapid clinical improvement and normalization of biochemical variables. These features should alert neonatologists to the possibility of intestinal lymphangiectasia in newborns with hypoalbuminemia and peripheral edema. The intestinal tract should be examined for enteric protein losses if other causes (ie, malnutrition and protein loss from other sites) are excluded. The diagnosis rests on jejunal biopsy demonstrating dilated lymphatic lacteal vessels...|$|R

The biological effects on tissue inflammation following <b>lymphatic</b> flow <b>obstruction</b> in vivo, however, are not fully known. In this study, we investigated {{the role of the}} lymphatic system in contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses using k-cyclin transgenic (kCYC+/-) mice, which demonstrate severe lymphatic dysfunction. kCYC+/- mice showed enhanced ear swelling to both DNFB and FITC, as well as stronger irritant responses to croton oil compared with wild-type littermates. Consistently, challenged ears of kCYC+/- mice exhibited massive infiltrates of inflammatory cells. In contrast, DC migration to regional LNs, drainage of cell-free antigen to LNs, antigen-specific IFN-γ production, and lymphocyte proliferation were impaired during the sensitization phase of CHS in kCYC+/- mice. Transfer experiments using lymphocytes from sensitized mice and real-time PCR analysis of cytokine expression using challenged ear revealed that ear swelling was enhanced because of impaired lymphatic flow. Collectively, we conclude that insufficient lymphatic drainage augments apparent inflammation to topically applied allergens and irritants.

40|$|Background: Lymph is a fluid {{originating}} in the interstitial spaces {{of the body that}} contains cells, proteins, particles, chylomicrons, and sometimes bacteria. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to demonstrate that primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) results from a disruption of lymphatic circulation, thus corresponding to a secondary rather than a primary event in the context of generalized lymphatic anomaly. Materials and Methods: In this case series and record review, an analysis of intestinal lymphatic involvement was performed on patients diagnosed with PIL between 1965 and 2013. Of the 21 patients included in the study, 10 had been diagnosed before 5 years of age (1 prenatal), 8 between 5 and 18 years of age, and 3 while older than 18 years of age. The follow-up period varied between 1 and 34 years. Clinical data, blood and fecal parameters, imaging studies, endoscopy results, biopsy analyses, treatment details, and outcome information were collected from medical records. Endoscopy, histological studies, magnetic resonance imaging, and lymphoscintigraphy were performed on all patients. Dynamic intranodal lymphangiography was performed on 8 patients. Results: Central <b>lymphatic</b> channel <b>obstruction</b> was identified in 12 patients (57 %). Associated lymphatic malformation (LM) was present in 16, diarrhea in 10, chylothorax in 11, chylous ascites in 10, pericardial effusion in 6, coagulopathy in 3, and osteolysis in 7.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Malignant and {{infectious}} diseases are the most frequent causes of pleural effusion. Malignant diseases produce pleural effusion through different mechanisms: <b>lymphatic</b> and capillary <b>obstruction,</b> pneumonia or atelectasia. Therefore absence of tumor cells in aspirated effusion, highly declines the sensivity of the cytologic study. For this reason, the use of tumor markers to improve the capability of differentiating malignant effusion from benign types are widespread. Materials and methods : 100 patients with pleural effusion were allocated in four groups: I: malignant (positive pleural biology or catology. N= 21). II: paramalignant (lnown case of a cancer, but negative cytology or biopsy. N= 9). III: Empyema/paraneumonics (clinical- paracillinically proved.) IV: Benign process (CHF, CRF, Liver disease [...] . n= 58). CA 15 - 3, CA 19 - 9 and CA 125 quantified using an Ag and ELISA technology. Results : Calculated cut off values were: 500 U/ml for CA 125, 35 U/ml for CA 19 - 9 and 35 U/ml for CA 15 - 3. Sensivity, specifity, efficiency, PPV and NPV were as follows:CA 15 - 3 (80 %, 90 %, 89 %, 82 %, 91 %) CA 19 - 9 (67 %, 89 %, 83 %, 74 %, 86 %), CA 125 (60 %, 83 %, 78 %, 60 %, 82 %) Conclusion : We suggest that using tumor markers in pleural fluid, especially CA 15 - 3 would greatly increase the diagnostic effectiveness of malignant effusions...|$|R

50|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} {{can cause}} long term <b>lymphatic</b> <b>obstruction.</b> Typically, patients have disorders that present local nodes, primary lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency.

Chronic venous edema is only partially reversible and soon becomes hard, especially confirming tenderness. All structures of the skin are affected. Dilated dermal lymphatic vessels with consequent superior organization and fibrosis result in papillomatosis. As dermal lymphatic stasis progreses, these skin changes become more marked and known as elephantiasis. Occasionally, tissue fibrosis and thickening may become so marked in the later stages of lymphedema that pitting is absent.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{adjuvant}} chemotherapy has been administered after surgical resection of tumors for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with stage III disease {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence of cancer. However, it is controversial as to whether all stage II CRC patients, or at least stage II CRC patients with additional risk factors, should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II CRC patients may be considered for patients in high-risk groups. It is a high priority to define prognostic factors for these stage II CRC patients to identify high-risk patients at risk of tumor metastases or recurrence and referral of stage II CRC patients for individual assessment. Recent guidelines advocate the consideration of clinicopathological factors such as free bowel perforation or <b>obstruction,</b> <b>lymphatic</b> and vascular invasion, poorly differentiated tumors, fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined, tumors with adjacent organ involvement, and indeterminate or positive margins as strong predictors of a poor prognosis in stage II CRC. Furthermore, with recent advances in basic research attempting to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis, a variety of candidate genes with potential value for the early detection of cancer have been discovered. Molecular factors such as microsatellite stability and loss of heterozygosity of 18 q have been used to identify groups of patients with stage II CRC who have much worse prognoses and may benefit from administration of chemotherapy. Accumulated reports have described the detection of circulating tumor cell-related molecular markers in the peripheral blood of CRC patients, which has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Consequently, therapeutic decision-making models are likely to be further refined by the inclusion of such molecular markers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Advanced Kaposi's sarcoma is {{frequently}} associated with chronic lymphedema (cLO). The histopathological features of lymphedematous HIV-associated KS (KS) are poorly documented and the co-existence of fibroma-like nodules in lymphedematous KS is under-recognized. The aims {{of this study}} were to assess the clinicopathological spectrum and diagnostic difficulties associated with lymphedematous KS and to highlight the clinicopathological profile of fibroma-like nodules. In addition, the pathogenesis of fibroma-like nodules and cLO is revisited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective 17 -month clinicopathological study of all biopsies from patients with lymphedematous KS. RESULTS: Seventy-four biopsies, the majority from the lower limbs, from 41 patients were evaluated. Nineteen, 14, five and three patients had one, two, three or four biopsies each, respectively. In 14 biopsies, there was poor clinicopathological correlation of KS stage. Exclusive lesional KS (patch, plaque, nodule or lymphangioma-like) was identified in 29 biopsies; 23 and eight biopsies demonstrated KS or fibroma-like morphology and the adjacent dermis demonstrated cLO. There was variable intratumoral and peritumoral venous compression and lymphatic dilatation. Fourteen biopsies demonstrated cLO exclusively. Smaller fibroma-like nodules lacked KS spindle cells, whereas > 5 mm nodules demonstrated focal KS spindle cell proliferation and aggregation on extensive sectioning. The subcutis of 42 biopsies demonstrated variable fibrosis, hemosiderin deposits, lymphocytes, plasma cells, KS, interstitial granular material and pools of lymph fluid. Subcutaneous abscesses were identified in six biopsies. All biopsies had variable epidermal features of cLO. CONCLUSIONS: cLO influences clinicopathological correlation of KS stage and may also mask the presence of KS and the co-existence of subcutaneous abscesses. Smaller fibroma-like nodules are hypothesized to be a manifestation of cLO that have the potential to acquire the characteristics of KS. <b>Lymphatic</b> and venous <b>obstruction,</b> protein-rich interstitial fluid, tissue hemosiderin and subcutaneous infection are hypothesized to play a combined role in the evolution and perpetuation of cLO...|$|R
50|$|Substantial {{numbers of}} {{patients}} with intestinal malabsorption present initially with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities that point to other organ systems {{in the absence of}} or overshadowing symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, there is increasing epidemiologic evidence that more patients with coeliac disease present with anemia and osteopenia in the absence of significant classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Microcytic, macrocytic, or dimorphic anemia may reflect impaired iron, folate, or vitamin B12 absorption. Purpura, subconjunctival hemorrhage, or even frank bleeding may reflect hypoprothrombinemia secondary to vitamin K malabsorption. Osteopenia is common, especially in the presence of steatorrhea. Impaired calcium and vitamin D absorption and chelation of calcium by unabsorbed fatty acids resulting in fecal loss of calcium may all contribute. If calcium deficiency is prolonged, secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop. Prolonged malnutrition may induce amenorrhea, infertility, and impotence. Edema and even ascites may reflect hypoproteinemia associated with protein losing enteropathy caused by <b>lymphatic</b> <b>obstruction</b> or extensive mucosal inflammation. Dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy may be caused by malabsorption of specific vitamins or micronutrients and essential fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|Stasis papillomatosis is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by chronic congestion of the extremities, with blood circulation interrupted in a specific area of the body. A consequence of this congestion and inflammation is long-term <b>lymphatic</b> <b>obstruction.</b> It is also typically characterized {{by the appearance of}} numerous papules. Injuries can range from small to large plates composed of brown or pink, smooth or hyperkeratotic papules. The most typical areas where injuries occur are the back of the feet, the toes, the legs, and the area around a venous ulcer formed in the extremities, although the latter is the rarest of all. These injuries include pachydermia (thickening of the skin), lymphedema, lymphomastic verrucusis and elephantosis verracosa. The disease can be either localized or generalized; the localized form makes up 78% of cases. Treatment includes surgical and pharmaceutical intervention; indications for partial removal include advanced fibrotic lymphedema and elephantiasis. Despite the existence of these treatments, chronic venous edema, which is a derivation of stasis papillomatosis, is only partially reversible. The skin is also affected and its partial removal may mean that the skin and the subcutaneous tissue are excised. A side effect of the procedure is the destruction of existing cutaneous lymphatic vessels. It also risks papillomatosis, skin necrosis and edema exacerbation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Lymphedema is the edema {{that results}} from chronic lymphatic insufficiency. Lymphatic {{filariasis}} {{is caused by the}} filarial nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Lymphatic filariasis is common in tropical and subtropical regions. Early diagnosis and prompt therapy can be implemented using lymphoscintigraphy. Our patient is a 15 -year-old boy presenting with a 3 -month history of hydrocele. The patient was referred to us to rule out any lower limb <b>lymphatic</b> <b>obstruction</b> as the patient is from an endemic area.
