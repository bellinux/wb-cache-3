40|$|Ectopic lymphoid-like {{structures}} often develop {{at sites}} of inflammation where they influence {{the course of}} infection, autoimmune disease, cancer and transplant rejection. These <b>lymphoid</b> aggregates <b>range</b> from tight clusters of B cells and T cells to highly organized structures that comprise functional germinal centres. Although the mechanisms governing ectopic lymphoid neogenesis in human pathology remain poorly defined, the presence of ectopic lymphoid-like structures within inflamed tissues {{has been linked to}} both protective and deleterious outcomes in patients. In this Review, we discuss investigations in both experimental model systems and patient cohorts to provide a perspective on the formation and functions of ectopic lymphoid-like structures in human pathology, with particular reference to the clinical implications and the potential for therapeutic targeting...|$|R
40|$|Post-transplant {{lymphoproliferative}} diseases (PTLD) are heterogeneous <b>lymphoid</b> disorders <b>ranging</b> from indolent polyclonal proliferations to aggressive lymphomas that complicate solid organ or hematopoietic transplantation. Risk factors for PTLD include viral infections, degree of immunosuppression, recipient age and race, allograft type, and host genetic variations. Clinically, extra-nodal disease is common including 10 - 15 % presenting with {{central nervous system}} (CNS) disease. Most PTLD cases are B cell (5 - 10 % T/NK cell or Hodgkin lymphoma), while over one-third are EBV-negative. World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic categories are: early lesions, polymorphic, and monomorphic PTLD; although in practice, a clear separation is not always possible. Therapeutically, reduction in immunosuppression remains a mainstay, and recent data has documented the importance of rituximab +/- combination chemotherapy. Therapy for primary CNS PTLD should be managed according to immunocompetent CNS paradigms. Finally, novel treatment strategies for PTLD have emerged, including adoptive immunotherapy and rational targeted therapeutics (e. g., anti-CD 30 based therapy and downstream signaling pathways of latent membrane protein- 2 A) ...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation of {{untreated}} F 344 rat {{bone marrow}} into irradiated B 10 mouse recipients (non-TCD F 344 -> B 10) to produce fully xenogeneic chimeras resulted in stable xenogeneic <b>lymphoid</b> chimerism, <b>ranging</b> from 82 % to 97 % rat. Survival of animals was excellent, without evidence for GVH disease. The specificity of tolerance which resulted was highly donor-specific; MHC disparate third party mouse and rat skin grafts were promptly rejected while donor-specific F 344 grafts were significantly prolonged (MST> 130 days). Multi-lineage rat stem cell-derived progeny including lymphoid cells (T and B-lymphocytes), myeloid cells, erythrocytes, platelets, and natural killer (NK) cells {{were present in}} the fully xenogeneic chimeras up to 7 months after bone marrow transplantation. Immature rat Tlymphocytes matured and acquired the a/ # Tcell receptor in the thymus of chimeras in a pattern similar to normal rat controls, suggesting that immature Tlymphocytes of rat origin could interact with the murine xenogeneic thymic stroma to undergo normal maturation and differentiation. This model may be useful to study the mechanisms responsible for the induction and maintenance of donor-specific transplantation tolerance across a species barrier.

40|$|Background. Infection {{with the}} human polyomaviruses BK (BKV) and JC (JCV) is almost ubiquitous, asymp-tomatic, and lifelong. However, {{reactivation}} during immunosuppression, associated withmutations in the transcrip-tional control region (TCR) that up-regulates viral replication, can cause life-threatening disease. In this study, we investigated whether the recently discovered WU and KI polyomaviruses (WUPyV and KIPyV) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) could, like BKV and JCV, persist, mutate, and reactivate in immunodeficient subjects. Methods. Autopsy samples of lymphoid tissue from 42 AIDS-immunosuppressed subjects and 55 control sam-ples were screened by polymerase chain reaction for all 5 polyomaviruses. TCR sequences from KIPyV and WUPyV recovered from both immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed subjects were compared. Results. Combined polyomavirus detection frequencies were much higher for the immunosuppressed group, comparedwith the nonimmunosuppressed group (35. 7 % vs. 3. 6 %), with viral loads in <b>lymphoid</b> tissues <b>ranging</b> from 8. 4 105 to 1. 5 105 viral genome copies per 106 cells. MCPyVwas recovered fromonly 1 HIV-negative study subject. TCR sequences from reactivated WUPyV and KIPyV variants showed a number of point mutations and insertions that were absent in viruses recovered from respiratory tract specimens obtained from nonimmunosup-pressed subjects. Conclusions. KIPyV and WUPyV show reactivation frequencies {{comparable to those of}} BKV and JCV durin...|$|R
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} antibody-forming cells (AFC) can be {{identified}} with the Jerne plaque assay In Immunized lung lobes of the beagle dog after localized instillation of particulate antigen. Published data suggest that these AFC are secreting antibody and are respon-sible for increased levels of specific antibody in immunized lung lobes. If AFC in the lung are actively secreting antibody, {{there should be an}} increase in the number of mature plasma cells in lung lobes exposed to antigen. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the number of lymphold cells present In Immunized and control lung lobes and to determine if lung immunization produces a localized Increase in the number of plasma cells. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC), autologous dog red blood cells, and saline were Instilled into specific lung lobes of beagle dogs with the aid of a fiberoptic broncho-scope. Light and transmission electron microscopy studies of tissues from lung lobes Instilled with SRBC showed perivascular Infiltrates and intra-alveolar accumulations of lymphold cells which were not present In control lung lobes. The morphology of these <b>lymphoid</b> cells <b>ranged</b> from small lymphocytes through mature plasma cells. From 5 % to 15 % of the cells present in the interstitial tissues and alveoli of immunized lung lobes were plasma cells. These observations suggest that lymphold cells which entered the SRBC Immunized lung can mature to plasma cells which are probably responsible for the local production of antigen-specific antibody.

Understanding differences in disease susceptibility of individual animals is a key aspect to controlling mycobacterial diseases. This {{study was designed to}} examine the susceptibility or resistance of various breeds of sheep to MAP infection. Merino, Suffolk first cross Merino, Border Leicester, and Poll Dorset sheep were orally inoculated with MAP and monitored for 14  months. Clinical disease occurred more frequently in the Merino (42 %) and Suffolk first cross Merino (36 %) compared to the Border Leicester (12 %) and Poll Dorset (11 %) breeds. Infection risk, as determined by culture of gut and associated <b>lymphoid</b> tissues, <b>ranged</b> from 75 % for the Suffolk first cross Merino to 47 % for the Poll Dorset sheep. Significant differences were identified in the site in the intestines of the most severe histopathological lesions and the immune responses to infection between the breeds. However, {{there was no difference in}} faecal MAP shedding by clinical cases between breeds. All breeds tested were susceptible to MAP infection, as determined by infection and clinical disease development, although there were differences in the proportions of diseased animals between the breeds. Poll Dorset and Border Leicester sheep were more resilient to MAP infection but there was evidence that more animals could have developed disease if given more time. These findings provide evidence of potential differential disease susceptibility between breeds, further our understanding of disease pathogenesis and risks of disease spread, and may have an influence on control programs for paratuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunogenicity}} of single, private H- 2 specificities {{has been}} tested. In most cases, the specificity {{was known to}} be confined either to H- 2 K or to H- 2 D. This was accomplished by the appropriate choice, as donor and recipient, or parent of the F 1 hybrid recipient, of congenic strains differing at H- 2 only, and of recombinant haplotypes in donor and/or recipient. By nearly all tests, the H- 2 K antigen appeared to be a stronger immunogen than the H- 2 D antigen. Skin grafts with an H- 2 K difference showed median survival times (MST) of 9. 3 – 14. 5 days; for H- 2 D the values were 13. 8 – 18. 6. The difference was also present, though narrowed, for second-set grafts. H- 2 K grafts regularly engendered a demonstrable cytotoxic antibody response; with H- 2 D differences the response was absent or very weak. K end cytotoxic titers after multiple immunizations with <b>lymphoid</b> tissues <b>ranged</b> from 1 / 32 to 1 / 2, 048, D end titers from 0 to 1 / 128. Hemagglutination titers showed no clear difference. The results of passive enhancement of skin grafts with H- 2 alloantibody produced in donor recipient combinations, identical to those used for the skin grafts showed a different pattern. H- 2 K, despite its greater immunogenic strength was more easily enhanced than H- 2 D. Prolongation of MST's for H- 2 K was 2. 4 – 6. 7 days, for H- 2 D grafts, 0. 2 – 1. 5 days...|$|R

We wished to determine whether activated human T cells engraft and migrate into lymphoid tissues in SCID mice. PBMC (50 x 10 (6)) activated in vitro in a 4 -day mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) were injected into the peritoneum of 12 SCID mice. In 11 of 12 animals killed at 3 or 4 weeks after injection, human cells were detected in cells pooled from lymphoid organs by flow cytometry and by immunohistochemical staining of frozen tissue sections. The percentage of CD 45 + cells in the 11 mice ranged from 2 % to 45 % and the absolute numbers of CD 45 + cells recovered from <b>lymphoid</b> organs <b>ranged</b> from 4 x 10 (6) to 90 x 10 (6). Up to 93 % of the human cells expressed the CD 3 antigen together with either CD 4 or CD 8. Human T cells were localized in periarteriolar areas in murine spleens, whereas in the lymph nodes and gut mucosa, the T cells did not show the pattern for T-dependent areas found in human lymphoid tissue. Numerous human plasma cells were detected in the spleen and gut mucosal crypts of engrafted SCID mice. Human IgG was detected in the serum of all 11 engrafted SCID mice. The functional activity of human T cells recovered from murine splenic tissue was very low 3 - 4 weeks after engraftment...|$|R
40|$|IgG 4 -related {{disease is}} a novel disease entity {{characterized}} by diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG 4 -positive plasma cells and fibrosis into multiple organs. There is still controversy over whether some thyroid diseases are actually IgG 4 -related disease. The objective {{of this study was}} to elucidate the clinicopathological features of Graves' disease with diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the thyroid. Among 1, 484 Graves' disease patients who underwent thyroidectomy, we examined their histopathological findings including the degree of lymphoplasmacytic and fibrotic infiltration and levels of IgG 4 -positive plasma cells in the thyroid. Their clinical pictures were defined by laboratory and ultrasonographic evaluation. A total of 11 patients (0. 74 %) showed diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the stroma of the thyroid gland. Meanwhile, other patients showed variable <b>lymphoid</b> infiltration <b>ranging</b> from absent to focally dense but no aggregation of plasma cells in the thyroid gland. Based on the diagnostic criteria of IgG 4 -related disease, 5 of the 11 subjects had specifically increased levels of IgG 4 -positive plasma cells in the thyroid. Fibrotic infiltration was present in only 1 patient developing hypothyroidism after anti-thyroid drug treatment for 4 years, but not in the other 10 patients with persistent hyperthyroidism. Obliterative phlebitis was not identified in any of the 11 subjects. Thyroid ultrasound examination showed 1 patient developing hypothyroidism who had diffuse hypoechogenicity, but the other hyperthyroid patients had a coarse echo texture. In our study, Graves' disease patients with persistent hyperthyroidism who had diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG 4 -positive plasma cells in the thyroid showed no concomitant fibrosis or obliterative phlebitis...|$|R
40|$|Global inequalities {{in access}} to health care are {{reflected}} in differences in cancer survival. The CONCORD programme was designed to assess worldwide differences and trends in population-based cancer survival. In this population-based study, we aimed to estimate survival inequalities globally for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia. Methods Cancer registries participating in CONCORD were asked to submit tumour registrations for all children aged 0 – 14 years who were diagnosed with leukaemia between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, and followed up until Dec 31, 2009. Haematological malignancies were defined by morphology codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third revision. We excluded data from registries from which the data were judged to be less reliable, or included only lymphomas, and data from countries in which data for fewer than ten children were available for analysis. We also excluded records because of a missing date of birth, diagnosis, or last known vital status. We estimated 5 -year net survival (ie, the probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis, after controlling for deaths from other causes [background mortality]) for children by calendar period of diagnosis (1995 – 99, 2000 – 04, and 2005 – 09), sex, and age at diagnosis (< 1, 1 – 4, 5 – 9, and 10 – 14 years, inclusive) using appropriate life tables. We estimated age-standardised net survival for international comparison of survival trends for precursor-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Findings We analysed data from 89   828 children from 198 registries in 53 countries. During 1995 – 99, 5 -year age-standardised net survival for all <b>lymphoid</b> leukaemias combined <b>ranged</b> from 10 · 6 % (95 % CI 3 · 1 – 18 · 2) in the Chinese registries to 86 · 8 % (81 · 6 – 92 · 0) in Austria. International differences in 5 -year survival for childhood leukaemia were still large as recently as 2005 – 09, when age-standardised survival for <b>lymphoid</b> leukaemias <b>ranged</b> from 52 · 4 % (95 % CI 42 · 8 – 61 · 9) in Cali, Colombia, to 91 · 6 % (89 · 5 – 93 · 6) in the German registries, and for AML ranged from 33 · 3 % (18 · 9 – 47 · 7) in Bulgaria to 78 · 2 % (72 · 0 – 84 · 3) in German registries. Survival from precursor-cell ALL was very close to that of all lymphoid leukaemias combined, with similar variation. In most countries, survival from AML improved more than survival from ALL between 2000 – 04 and 2005 – 09. Survival for each type of leukaemia varied markedly with age: survival was highest for children aged 1 – 4 and 5 – 9 years, and lowest for infants (younger than 1 year). There was no systematic difference in survival between boys and girls. Interpretation Global inequalities in survival from childhood leukaemia have narrowed with time but remain very wide for both ALL and AML. These results provide useful information for health policy makers on the effectiveness of health-care systems and for cancer policy makers to reduce inequalities in childhood cancer surviva...|$|R
40|$|The time of {{spread of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) from lymphoid to nonlymphoid tissues {{in the course of}} infection was investigated by sequence comparisons of variants infecting a <b>range</b> of <b>lymphoid</b> and nonlymphoid tissues from three individuals with AIDS in the pl 7 gag gene and regions flanking the V 1 /V 2 hypervariable regions. Phylogenetic analysis in both regions revealed several lineages in each individual that contained sequences from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues such as the brain. This observation contrasts strongly with the previously described organ-specific sequences in the V 3 region in this study population and other investigations. Although individual pairwise comparisons of relatively short sequences such as p 17 gag are subject to considerable stochastic error, we found that the diversity of gag sequences in variants from lymphoid tissue was consistently lower than that found among variants amplified from the brain. By estimating mean synonymous pairwise distances in the p 17 gag region, we were able to make an approximate calculation of the ages of populations in different tissues. Those from <b>lymphoid</b> tissue <b>ranged</b> from 2. 65 to 5. 6 years in the three study subjects, compared with 4. 1 to 6. 2 years for variants in the brain. Indeed, variants infecting the brain were no more closely related to each other than they were to variants infecting other tissues in the body. In two of the three individuals, these times of divergence indicate that infection of the brain may have occurred as an early event in the progression to disease, preceding the onset of AIDS by several years. This study is the first in which it was possible to estimate times of diversification in different tissues in vivo and is of importance in understanding the dynamics of the spread of HIV- 1 into nonlymphoid tissues and its possible adaptation for replication in different cell types...|$|R

This prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary referral university hospital examined endometrium obtained from 32 women admitted for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures. Each participant had endometrium sampled using both EAB and D&C. Both methods were assessed as a source of uterine NK and lymphoid progenitor cells. Similar proportions of mature CD 45 +CD 56 + NK cells (range 25. 4 - 36. 2 %) and CD 45 +CD 34 + <b>lymphoid</b> progenitors (<b>range</b> 1. 2 - 2. 0 %) were found in tissue obtained using both EAB and D&C. These cells were adequate for flow cytometric analysis, magnetic bead separation and culture. Colony formation by the CD 34 + population demonstrated maturational potential. Tissues obtained via endometrial biopsy and D&C are equivalent, by analysis of uterine NK and lymphoid progenitor cells. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare two methods of endometrial sampling - endometrial aspiration biopsy and traditional dilatation and curettage - for the procurement of haematopoietic stem cells and uterine natural killer (NK) populations in endometrial tissue. Thirty-two women who had gynaecological procedures in a tertiary referral hospital participated in this study and had endometrial tissue collected via both methods. Similar populations of mature NK cells and haematopoietic stem cells were found in tissue obtained using both endometrial aspiration biopsy and dilatation and curettage. Tissue obtained via endometrial aspiration biopsy was adequate for the culture and growth of haematopoietic stem cells. We conclude that tissue obtained via endometrial biopsy and dilatation and curettage is equivalent, by analysis of uterine NK and haematopoietic stem cells using flow cytometry. This has implications for further more extensive study of endometrial haematopoietic stem cell populations, as these samples can be collected in a clinical setting without a requirement for general anaesthesia...|$|R

We investigated Peyer’s patch adherence, {{the presence of}} virulence genes, ileal brush border aggregation, and pilus expression in 9 strains representing several serotypes of REPEC {{as well as in}} two commensal strains. Postweanling rabbits were inoculated with 106 organisms and sacrificed at 24 h, and tissues were prepared for examination by light microscopy. Strains B 10 and RDEC- 1 were also studied at 12 and 72 h postinoculation. All REPEC strains were eaeA positive, expressed pili, and adhered to ileal brush borders. Both commensal strains expressed pili, and one strain adhered to brush borders. All REPEC strains demonstrated some degree of Peyer’s patch <b>lymphoid</b> follicle adherence, <b>ranging</b> from diffuse coverage to small patches covering two to three dome epithelial cells. Strains C 102 and C 110 had genes homologous with the structural subunit gene of the AF/R 1 pilus (afrA) of RDEC- 1, which correlated with greater degrees of lymphoid follicle adherence and lesser degrees of ileal villus adherence. The observation that all REPEC strains adhere to Peyer’s patch epithelium suggests the possibility that human strains of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) might do likewise. EPEC strains might thus serve as mucosal vaccine vectors in humans. Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of REPEC adherence should provide a model for the targeting of the Peyer’s patch i...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{investigated}} the long-term outcome of gene therapy for {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} (SCID) {{due to the lack}} of adenosine deaminase (ADA), a fatal disorder of purine metabolism and immunodeficiency. METHODS: We infused autologous CD 34 + bone marrow cells transduced with a retroviral vector containing the ADA gene into 10 children with SCID due to ADA deficiency who lacked an HLA-identical sibling donor, after nonmyeloablative conditioning with busulfan. Enzyme-replacement therapy was not given after infusion of the cells. RESULTS: All patients are alive after a median follow-up of 4. 0 years (range, 1. 8 to 8. 0). Transduced hematopoietic stem cells have stably engrafted and differentiated into myeloid cells containing ADA (mean range at 1 year in bone marrow lineages, 3. 5 to 8. 9 %) and <b>lymphoid</b> cells (mean <b>range</b> in peripheral blood, 52. 4 to 88. 0 %). Eight patients do not require enzyme-replacement therapy, their blood cells continue to express ADA, and they have no signs of defective detoxification of purine metabolites. Nine patients had immune reconstitution with increases in T-cell counts (median count at 3 years, 1. 07 x 10 (9) per liter) and normalization of T-cell function. In the five patients in whom intravenous immune globulin replacement was discontinued, antigen-specific antibody responses were elicited after exposure to vaccines or viral antigens. Effective protection against infections and improvement in physical development made a normal lifestyle possible. Serious adverse events included prolonged neutropenia (in two patients), hypertension (in one), central-venous-catheter-related infections (in two), Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (in one), and autoimmune hepatitis (in one). CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy, combined with reduced-intensity conditioning, is a safe and effective treatment for SCID in patients with ADA deficiency.
