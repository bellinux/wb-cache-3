5|$|Van Dijk was {{selected}} to represent her country at the Olympic Games in London, and she competed in the road race and the individual time trial {{on the road and}} in the team pursuit on the track. In the road race, Van Dijk was a domestique for Marianne Vos, who won the gold medal. Van Dijk attacked five times but finished outside the time limit. Because the victory of Marianne Vos was seen as a team performance, Van Dijk, Loes Gunnewijk and Annemiek van Vleuten were all subsequently honoured in both the Holland Heineken House and the Ridderzaal. In the time trial, Van Dijk finished eighth. She said afterwards that she was afraid to start too fast and subsequently lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first part of the race. In the team pursuit, Van Dijk finished sixth together with Kirsten Wild, Amy Pieters and Vera Koedooder. In the qualification heats, the team had held the Olympic record for a short period and they rode a new Dutch national record in round one. According to Van Dijk, sixth place was the highest attainable place the team could have hoped to achieve.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of the episode, the producers [...] "agonized" [...] over the teaser—due {{to the fact that}} it featured the death of a small child—as well as the darkness of the entire episode. Fox's standards and practices department took issues with Steve's strangulation scene; in the end, the sequence was left in the episode, but Steve's face was obscured to [...] "soften the impact".

500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{studio with}} the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song {{was determined to be}} too {{different from the rest of}} the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most." [...] Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings [...] "I knew we had done the right thing. [...] I knew it was a hit the second I heard it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rob Reiner {{said in a}} 2014 {{interview}} about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O'Connor, [...] "We did over 200 shows {{in front of a}} live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don't like, how stories are structured. I would spend a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|E
