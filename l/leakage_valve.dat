An analysis is presented of the flow force acting on a two-way valve using the equilibrium condition of the piston and the equilibrium condition of fluid in the control volume. Three types of flow forces are identified: pressure-difference-induced flow force, viscous-shear-induced flow force, and momentum-induced flow force. Nondimensional analysis shows that among all steady flow force the pressure-difference-induced flow force is largest with viscous-shear-induced flow force the second and momentum-induced flow force the smallest. However, the fluid inertial-induced flow force, which is a momentum-induced flow force, is very important while the pressure transient effect caused by the slight compressibility of the fluid is negligible. A trial test on the steady state flow force shows that the sound-wave phenomenon is strong and additional pressure gradient in the vertical direction needs to be taken into consideration. To enable further experiment 100 -points average and pressure profile factor are introduced. Using a novel square-wave generator it is proved experimentally that the pressure transient effect is true and its magnitude is underestimated by the proposed theory. In addition, geometry characteristic such as <b>leakage,</b> <b>valve</b> length and damping length can change the direction of the pressure transient flow force...|$|E

The simulation involves the development of a mathematical model of five different physical processes: speed–torque characteristics of an induction motor, cylinder pressure variation, crankshaft rotational motion, flow characteristics through valves and vibration of the valve plates. Modelling both <b>valve</b> <b>leakage</b> and <b>valve</b> spring deterioration has also been achieved. The simulation was implemented in a MATLAB environment for an efficient numerical solution and ease of result presentation. For normal operating conditions, the simulated results are in good agreement with the test results for cylinder pressure waveforms and crankshaft instantaneous angular speed (IAS). It has been found that both the IAS fluctuation and pressure waveform are sensitive detection features for compressor faults such as <b>valve</b> <b>leakage</b> and <b>valve</b> spring deterioration.

Designing these pumps requires mathematical models {{to determine the effect}} of parameters that affect their performance. Models proposed in the literature are applicable only to specific micropumps generally operated at low frequency. For high frequency operation models require experimentally evaluated parameters. Hence, they cannot be used for designing and analyzing the performance of electrostatic micropumps. 	The goal of the research reported in this thesis is to develop mathematical tools for the design of multi-stage vacuum micropumps operated at high frequency utilizing electrostatic actuation and active valves for flow control. Two mathematical models are developed in this work. The first is a reduced-order acoustic model used to study the effect of operating frequency, volume ratio, valve <b>leakage,</b> <b>valve</b> timing, dynamic valve timing and transient performance on a multistage vacuum micropump. Using this model the impact of dynamic valve timing and novel multi-stage designs are analyzed and optimized to achieve vacuum efficiently. The second model is a multiphysics model, which accounts for active valve pumping, membrane deflection and electrostatic actuation. Inertial and resistance length relations are proposed using computational fluid dynamics analysis for the given valve design. Static and eigen-frequency analysis is carried out using Finite Element Analysis for a stacked membrane. This model is verified using experimental and computational techniques. Measured results for a 4 -stage micropump showed three resonant points that were predicted by the model with an error of 7 - 21 %. Due to the difficulty in measuring the pressure and flow fields inside the micropump, a high fidelity CFD model which incorporates membrane motion and cavity acoustics is used to validate pressure and flow fields assumptions used in the reduced order model. Pressure and flow rate performance determined using the reduced order model compare well with high fidelity CFD results for a 3 -D device that includes pump and valve membrane motions. The reduced order model suggests {{for the first time the}} dominance of valve pumping that has been experimentally observed. Based on these results, a novel micropump design is proposed that can produce high flow rate...|$|E

The estimation method {{is based on}} a comparison of model data which are simulated by using a mathematical model, and experimental data which are measured on the inside and outside of the reciprocating pump in operation.

These issues are {{of paramount importance}} as potential failures of rotating and reciprocating machinery can be managed properly and avoided in some cases. Various methods have been applied to tackle these issues, but the accuracy of those methods is variable and leaves scope for improvement. This research proposes appropriate methods for fault detection and diagnosis. The main consideration {{of this study is}} use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related mathematics approaches to build a condition monitoring (CM) system that has incremental learning capabilities to select effective diagnostic features for the fault diagnosis of a reciprocating compressor (RC). The investigation involved a series of experiments conducted on a two-stage RC at baseline condition and then with faults introduced into the intercooler, drive belt and 2 nd stage discharge and suction valve respectively. In addition to this, three combined faults: discharge <b>valve</b> <b>leakage</b> combined with intercooler <b>leakage,</b> suction <b>valve</b> <b>leakage</b> combined with intercooler <b>leakage</b> and discharge <b>valve</b> <b>leakage</b> combined with suction <b>valve</b> <b>leakage</b> were created and simulated to test the model. The vibration data was collected from the experimental RC and processed through pre-processing stage, features extraction, features selection before the developed diagnosis and classification model were built. A large number of potential features are calculated from the time domain, the frequency domain and the envelope spectrum. Applying Neural Networks (NNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Relevance Vector Machines (RVMs) which integrate with Genetic Algorithms (GAs), and principle components analysis (PCA) which cooperates with principle components optimisation, to these features, has found that the features from envelope analysis have the most potential for differentiating various common faults in RCs. The practical results for fault detection, diagnosis and classification show that the proposed methods perform very well and accurately and can be used as effective tools for diagnosing reciprocating machinery failure...|$|R

The experimental results have showed that the trained network has the capability to detect and identify various severity magnitudes of the faults of interest. Furthermore, the trained ANN based FDS has the ability to identify fault levels of untrained fault cases accurately.

The object of research is a laboratory, four-stroke, DI diesel engine, operated at loads from 50 kW to 250 kW at a constant speed equal to 750 rpm. During the laboratory tests over 50 parameters of the engine were measured with its technical condition recognized as a „working properly” and with simulated leakage of both air intake valve and exhaust gas valve on the second cylinder. The results of this laboratory research confirm that the <b>leakage</b> of cylinder <b>valves</b> causes no significant changes of the thermodynamic parameters of the engine. Simulated leakages through the inlet and exhaust valve caused a significant increase in fuel consumption of the engine. <b>Valve</b> <b>leakages</b> cause an increase of the exhaust gas temperature behind the cylinder with leakage and behind other cylinders.

40|$|Abstract: The {{simulation}} of oil <b>leakage</b> through a <b>valve</b> stem seal involves complex fluid-structure interaction between a moving valve stem (rigid body), oil and deformable seal (flexible body). In the simulation {{we used a}} full 3 D model of a seal and considered a two-way fluid-structure coupling between the seal (structure) and oil (fluid). The seal deformation is modeled with Abaqus-explicit and oil leakage with FlowVision (finite volume based CFD code). The calculation domain is descretized by a volume Cartesian grid with dynamic local adaptation and uses a Euler grid approach for {{simulation of}} the moving boundary. At each physical time step the simulation domain is re-meshed and loads are exchanged between Abaqus and FlowVision(FV). Pressure values calculated by FV are transferred to Abaqus-explicit to calculate the resulting seal deformation. The data is automatically exchanged using Capvidia’s Multi-Physics-Manager (MPM). The MPM links FV with Abaqus and transfers data via Abaqus user-subroutines.

This paper presents the application of wavelet packet transform (WPT) and envelope analysis to non-stationary vibration signal from a two-stage reciprocating compressor for fault diagnostics. Vibration signal measured on the reciprocating compressor consist of a series of impulsive events with non-stationary random characteristics, which result mostly from mechanical impacts of the valves and impulsive fluid excitation of high-pressure turbulent flows. To characterize such vibration signal, WPT is employed to decompose the measured signal for the extraction of time-frequency information. With the help of statistical based analysis, the most optimal terminal node of the wavelet packet is selected for further study.
