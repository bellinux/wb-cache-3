It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats.

25|$|Meanwhile, by 1932, Szent-Györgyi {{had moved}} to Hungary. By that point he knew that hexanuric acid was present in large amounts in citrus, where it {{prevented}} oxidation of polyphenols, but where {{it was difficult to}} extract because of the other sugars naturally present there. After being fed a meal of paprika peppers — a common spice and food in the Hungarian diet — Szent-Györgyi was inspired to assay it for hexuronic acid, and found it present in large amounts without the contaminating sugars from sweeter plants. With a plentiful source of the pure vitamin, Szent-Györgyi now sent a large sample to noted British sugar chemist Walter Norman Haworth, who chemically identified it as L-hexuronic acid and then proved the identification by total synthesis in 1933. Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed that the substance L-hexuronic acid be called a-scorbic acid, and chemically <b>L-ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> in honor of its activity against scurvy. Ascorbic acid {{turned out not to be}} an amine, nor even to contain any nitrogen. In part, in recognition of his accomplishment with vitamin C, Szent-Györgyi was awarded the unshared 1937 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Haworth also shared that year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in part for his vitamin C synthetic work.|$|E
