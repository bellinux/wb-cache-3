50|$|The {{nation has}} a notable {{forestry}} resource and ably manages a timber program. In an 1870 {{assessment of their}} lands, which totaled roughly 235000 acre, they counted 1.3 billion standing <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of timber.

5000|$|The spruce beetle {{is one of}} many beetle {{species that}} have {{recently}} increased their breeding times. The overpopulation of beetles in some forests in Kenai, Alaska, have damaged several spruce species that are no longer able to dwell there. The spruce beetle destroyed 2300000 acre (2 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet)</b> of spruce forests in Alaska from 1992 to 1999 (about 30 million trees per year at the peak), and 122000 acre of Utah forests in the 1990s (more than 3 million trees). Outbreaks from 1975-2000 were seen in Montana (loss of 25 million <b>board</b> <b>feet),</b> Idaho (loss of 31 million <b>board</b> <b>feet),</b> Arizona (loss of over 100 million <b>board</b> <b>feet),</b> and British Columbia (loss of 3 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet).</b> As of 2000 the beetle was responsible for the loss of about 400 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> annually.

50|$|The {{portable}} {{chain saw}} and other technological developments helped drive more efficient logging, but {{the proliferation of}} other building materials {{in the twentieth century}} saw the end of the rapidly rising demand of the previous century. In 1950, the United States produced 38 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of lumber, and that number remained fairly constant throughout the decades moving forward, with the national production at 32.9 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1960 and 34.7 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1970.|$|R
50|$|The Tongass Timber Act helped {{establish}} The Ketchikan Pulp Company, {{followed by the}} Sitka Pulp Mill. The timber to support these mills increased harvest in the Tongass National Forest from 70 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1954 to 405 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1965.|$|R
50|$|Class 1: {{producers}} {{are defined by}} rule as those paying the harvest tax on 20 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year or less.

50|$|By 1887 Elgin had general stores, a livery, a hotel, and a church, {{as well as}} {{a nearby}} sawmill, which {{continues}} as a more modern Boise Cascade mill. Between 1887 and 1908, the area around Elgin had 35 sawmills, most transportable water-driven whipsaws (vertical reciprocating saws). Local landowners would sell the trees for 50 centers per thousand <b>board</b> <b>feet,</b> which is about how much the sawmills could handle in a day. Log transportation cost about two dollars per thousand <b>board</b> <b>feet,</b> and a mill could sell the processed lumber for $6-10 per thousand <b>board</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 35 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of timber. About 1.5 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> are harvested every year.

5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, many {{companies}} were forced to shut down. Total production of lumber fell at a devastating rate, from 35 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1920 to 10 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1932. Moreover, the steady decline of gross income, net profits, and increased consumption of cement and steel products, exacerbated the decline of lumber production.|$|R
50|$|Founded as a {{railroad}} town, Centralia's economy was originally dependent on such extractive industries as coal and lumber. The explosion of Mt. St. Helens on May 18, 1980 devastated the local lumber industry, as 12 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of stockpiled lumber and 4 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of salable timber was damaged or destroyed. Unemployment surged to double digits, {{and the town}} lost most of its retail base.|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>board</b> <b>feet,</b> {{the peak of}} the lumber era in Pennsylvania arrived in about 1885, when 1.9 million logs went through the boom at Williamsport. These logs {{produced}} a total of about 226 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (533,000 m3) of sawed lumber. After that, production steadily declined throughout the state. Lock Haven's timber business was also affected by flooding, which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} formed {{following}} the winter flood of 1861-1862; that flood level {{was not observed}} again until 1955. The Eel River crested at a gauge height of 72 feet (10.1 feet higher than 1955) on 23 December 1964. Eighteen-million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of redwood logs and 23-million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of lumber were washed out of the Scotia sawmill and scattered along the lower river and Pacific coast {{to the mouth of}} the Columbia River.|$|R
50|$|To {{give some}} idea of the scale of the log drives, Pennsylvania's Pine Creek, the largest {{tributary}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River, had produced rafts of pine spars for decades, ending in 1865. The earliest spring log drives there floated up to 20,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (47,000 m³) of logs in the creek at one time. In 1908, a single splash dam in northcentral Pennsylvania floated 8,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (18,900 m³) in one log drive.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} decades-long effort to expand {{wilderness}} was resolved, however, annual timber harvests on Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington reached a flash {{point in the}} late 1980s. Critics charged that AuCoin, along with other Northwest members of Congress, were forcing unsustainable logging levels, noting that Congress's proposed annual timber harvests of more than 4 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year—well above historical averages of 2.6 to 3 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (bbf) for the region.|$|R

50|$|With the Bean Lumber Company {{opening in}} 1940, {{followed}} by the Barksdale Lumber Company, logging soon became {{the main source of}} employment for the town. At its peak, the Bean Lumber Company was producing more than 150 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of pine lumber and 120 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of treated lumber annually, {{making it one of the}} largest distributors of southern pine in the United States.

5000|$|Hastings is {{a former}} {{community}} in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in Annapolis County. It {{was the scene of}} a thriving lumber operation, E. D.

Its peak of production was during World War I when the mill averaged 170,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of lumber in a 10-hour shift. Producing 7.8 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of lumber annually, it was at the time the busiest saw milling operation in Nova Scotia.|$|R
50|$|Zehnder's Holz Brucke (German for wooden bridge) is {{a wooden}} covered bridge, {{built in a}} style {{similar to that of}} the Black Forest or a river valley in Switzerland, located over the Cass River in the middle of town. Though {{completed}} in 1979, the structure is constructed using traditional covered-bridge timber framing techniques. The floor joists and three-span Town lattice truss system of the 239' bridge are made of 15,960 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of four inch planks. The portion receiving the greatest wear is of oak while the remaining portion is spruce. 20,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of Douglas Fir make up the rafters and the roof is shingled with cedar. An additional 4,340 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of pine was required for the bridge side boards. In addition to two lanes for automobile traffic, the bridge also has two pedestrian walkways.|$|R

50|$|Controversy {{arose in}} 2011 in {{response}} {{to changes in the}} way the forest is managed. Adopted by the land board in October 2011, a new management plan aims to increase annual net revenue from the forest to $13 million, up from $8 million. It would achieve this by increasing the annual timber harvest to 40 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> culled from 1100 acre, of which about three-fourths could be clearcut. The former management plan, adopted in 1995, called for 25 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> from 1000 acre, half of it clearcut.|$|R
