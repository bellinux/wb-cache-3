40|$|Metal Halide (MH) lamps {{are high}} {{pressure}} discharge devices, containing a complex chemical mixture, to emit light on a broad spectrum while maintaining good <b>efficacies.</b> <b>Lamps</b> of this type were first exhibited by General Electric at the 1964 World Fair in New York [1]. They typically consist of an inner burner {{the size of a}} cigarette filter, surrounded by a larger protective outer wall. The inner burner is made from polycrystalline alumina or quartz and is filled with noble gasses, mercury (about 10 mg) and salt additives (a few milligram). Under operating conditions the inner burner has a gas pressure of several tens of atmospheres, most of which is mercury vapor. The salt additives, such as sodium, scandium and dysprosium idide, are present in very low concentrations in the gas phase. Yet it is these minority species that provide most of the light output. A well known [2, 3, 4] phenomena in MH lamps is that, when operated vertically, the metal halides in the lamp tend to demix; the concentration of metal halides in the gas phase is much greater {{at the bottom of the}} lamp. This can be observed directly from the light output, a demixed lamp shows a blue white mercury discharge at the top of the lamp and a much brighter and whiter discharge at the bottom of the lamp [5].

40|$|Development of {{multi-photon}} phosphor {{materials for}} discharge lamps represents {{a goal that}} would achieve up to a doubling of discharge (fluorescent) <b>lamp</b> <b>efficacy.</b> This report reviews the existing literature on multi-photon phosphors, identifies obstacles in developing such phosphors, and recommends {{directions for future research}} to address these obstacles. To critically examine issues involved in developing a multi-photon phosphor, the project brought together a team of experts from universities, national laboratories, and an industrial lamp manufacturer. Results and findings are organized into three categories: (1) Multi-Photon Systems and Processes, (2) Chemistry and Materials Issues, and (3) Concepts and Models. Multi-Photon Systems and Processes: This category focuses on how to use our current understanding of multi-photon phosphor systems to design new phosphor systems for application in fluorescent lamps. The quickest way to develop multi-photon lamp phosphors lies in finding sensitizer ions for Gd{sup 3 +} and identifying activator ions to red shift the blue emission from Pr{sup 3 +} due to the {sup 1 }S{sub 0 } {yields} {sup 1 }I{sub 6 } transition associated with the first cascading step. Success in either of these developments would lead to more efficient fluorescent lamps. Chemistry and Materials Issues: The most promising multi-photon phosphors are found in fluoride hosts. However, stability of fluorides in environments typically found in fluorescent lamps needs to be greatly improved. Experimental investigation of fluorides in actual lamp environments needs to be undertaken while working on oxide and oxyfluoride alternative systems for backup. Concepts and Models: Successful design of a multi-photon phosphor system based on cascading transitions of Gd{sup 3 +} and Pr{sup 3 +} depends critically on how the former can be sensitized and the latter can sensitize an activator ion. Methods to predict energy level diagrams and Judd-Ofelt parameters of multi-photon transitions are needed to help guide the experimental material selection. This report provides the theoretical basis for leading knowledgeable researchers along the path to develop multi-photon phosphor systems. The ultimate goal, a doubling of fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>efficacy,</b> {{is not going to be}} easily obtained.

40|$|The saving {{potential}} of electrical energy for lighting in housing is very high. With {{the first phase}} of the European regulation on the production and sale of non-effective incandescent lamps having just come into effect, it appears that the use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) becomes an important topic. For that reason, this paper lists the major barriers to the spread of compact fluorescent lamps in housing and analyses four of them. 16 compact fluorescent lamps were measured in a laboratory in order to study their warm-up time, their colour shift during warm-up, the impact of their position on their luminous flux and their light output equivalent, in comparison to two incandescent lamps. Measurements show that information given on the lamp package is incomplete and inaccurate. The 1 : 5 rule, currently applied by European manufacturers in order to calculate the power of a CFL replacing an incandescent lamp, is inappropriate. A ratio of 1 : 4 would be better. While it has been observed that the position of the lamp base has an impact of the <b>lamp</b> <b>efficacy,</b> it was impossible to predict which position is best. The run-up time of compact fluorescent lamp can be long and depends on the shape of the lamp. The lamp colour modification during run-up is visible and can be a barrier to the use of compact fluorescent lamps. Tube CFLs should be favored as they have a higher luminous efficacy and take less time to reach their nominal flux. Finally, the measurements did not show any correlation between the lamp price and their quality. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman, Sanford Klein, and Douglas Reindl. The TRNSYS (TRaNsient SYstems Simulations) Hybrid Lighting Model was revised so that two colorimetric indices pertinent to indoor illumination, the correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI), could be predicted by the model. For calculation of the CCT and CRI relevant to the hybrid lighting system, the spectral power density (SPD) of beam normal radiation was needed. Though TRNSYS provides algorithms to calculate the magnitude of beam normal radiation on any surface, no methods were provided in TRNSYS to determine the SPD of solar radiation. This thesis describes {{the inclusion of a}} spectral model in TRNSYS: Gueymard's SMARTS 2 (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) algorithm. This algorithm was used to calculate the SPD of beam normal radiation as a function of solar position, atmospheric turbidity, moisture content, and other atmospheric parameters. The TRNSYS hybrid lighting model, augmented by SMARTS 2, was used to analyze building illumination and energy loads for a 2500 m 2 office building equipped with a hybrid lighting system (HLS). The HLS uses two-axis tracking collectors to collect beam normal radiation that is later divided into visible and infrared components. The visible radiation is piped to luminaires inside the building using optical fibers, while the infrared radiation is focused on thermal photovoltaic arrays and used to generate electricity. The TRNSYS model calculated annual building energy loads (lighting, cooling, and heating) and energy savings in office buildings located in six U. S. cities: Honolulu, HI; Tucson, AZ; Reno, NV; Atlanta, GA; Seattle, WA; and Madison, WI; that were equipped with hybrid lighting systems. Using local utility rates and assuming 52 lm/W <b>lamps</b> <b>efficacies</b> (the commercial average in the U. S.), the annual energy savings per m 2 collector area in these cities were: $ 240 -Tucson, $ 140 -Reno, $ 320 -Honolulu, $ 40 - Atlanta, $ 50 -Madison, and $ 60 -Seattle. For the colorimetry analysis, four representative lamp SPDs - warm white fluorescent, full spectrum fluorescent, tungsten incandescent, and halogen incandescent - were defined as standard indoor light source spectrums. Two cities were chosen to perform the analyses in: Tucson, which represented a clear climate with consistent beam normal radiation values, and Seattle, a cloudier climate. The CCT and CRI were calculated each hour during office working hours. When cloudy, the CCT and CRI of the illumination inside took on the values of the lamp providing it, but when beam normal radiation was available these values were influenced by the 5000 - 5500 K CCT and 80 CRI of the beam normal radiation transmitted though the HLS.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceFred L. HaslerThis paper {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} using LED modules as the primary light source for office buildings’ lighting systems. The LED lamps are the newest mass-produced lamps today; they have many insurmountable advantages compared to other light sources, like long <b>lamp</b> life, high <b>efficacy,</b> and low heat emission. Because of these advantages, owners and occupants of buildings can benefit greatly from the application of LED luminaires. The main focus {{of this paper is}} in 4 categories, which include the reliability of published data, occupant comfort, energy efficiency, and the life cycle costs of building lighting systems. LED light sources are compared to other primary light sources, which include fluorescent and incandescent lamps, of low ceiling office spaces from these 4 categories. The reliability of published data discussion covers color rendering index (CRI), correlated color temperatures (CCT), <b>lamp</b> life, and <b>efficacy</b> of the different type of lamps. The criteria of LED lamps are the most emphasized point of this section. The current CRI, <b>efficacy,</b> and <b>lamp</b> life evaluation systems are not suitable for LED lamps, and this paper {{discusses the}} practical value of each of these published data in office lighting system design. Some technical reports presented in this paper show that high CRI values of LED light sources do not directly link to excellent color rendition. However, LED light sources can have similar spectrum power distributions as natural light, and offer adequate visual comfort. <b>Efficacy</b> and <b>lamp</b> life are in the same situation. Even though, the published values do not necessarily reflect the real life performance of LED lamps, they often still have the longest lamp life and highest efficacy. Human comfort is the second factor discussed. Engineers and lighting designers consider illuminance level, color rendering ability, and glare of lighting systems to be deciding factors of human comfort from a lighting design perspective. However, many medical studies show that the human is much more sensitive to the correlated color of light sources. Light sources must vary output luminous flux and correlated color temperatures over time to help occupants reach optimum office task productivity and maintain health and visual comfort. LED lamps are the only light source that can practically change both the output luminous flux and correlate color temperature without heavy extra investments in equipment, which makes it the perfect candidate for this category. Energy efficiency is the third discussion point presented in this paper. Efficacy is a widely adopted term for evaluating the energy efficiency of a lamp, which describes the ratio of the output illuminance and input power. Because the output illuminance of LED lamps is decided not only by the illuminant bodies, but also many other electronic components in the lamps, some experts suggest that using efficacy to judge LED lamps is biased. This paper states the author’s position on whether efficacy can adequately describe the efficiency of LED lamps. Costs are also an inevitable point of this paper. LED lamps have the reputation of being the most expensive type of light source, but marketing data shows that the price of LEDs has been dropping dramatically recently. Moreover, Haitz’s law predicts that the price of LEDs will drop even more in the future. In this paper, the lifecycle costs of a light system have also been addressed across different types of light sources. Some crucial drawbacks of LED lamps, such as narrow photometric distribution and thermal damage control, are also addressed in this paper. Scientists and engineers still have not found the perfect solution to these drawbacks, but they are not significant enough to jeopardize the application of LED lamps in most architectural lighting design cases. According to the finding of this paper, LED lamps are the mainstream light source of future office lighting systems. The author also gives some suggestions for using LED lamps as primary light sources in office lighting system design applications {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R

High-intensity discharge (HID) lamp electronic ballasting is receiving increasing attention in the recent years as low wattage HID lighting systems are finding indoor applications. Advantages of high frequency electronic ballast for HID <b>lamps</b> include: increased <b>efficacy,</b> ease in starting, good color rendering, small size, etc. However, due to the occurrence of acoustic resonances over a wide frequency range, high-frequency ballasting of HID lamps have been a major challenge. The acoustic resonance occurs when the sound wave inside the inner arc tube specified by the tube shape and the enclosed gases is resonant with the imposed high frequency input power. The periodic input power and subsequent energy exchange by elastic collisions between charged particles and neutral gas are source to pressure perturbations which cause instability in the arc and generate unpleasant light flicker. Lamp properties, such as geometry, type of gas filling, etc., that determine the occurrence of acoustic resonance are known to vary with manufacturing tolerances. Tuned high-frequency operation is one way to avoid acoustic resonance. The knowledge of resonant free zones becomes mandatory and is difficult to find. Lamp power spectrum spreading is another way known to avoid acoustic resonances. This thesis focuses on real-time detection of acoustic resonance occurrence by measuring lamp electrical parameters. Theoretical analysis and experiment results pronounce that the variation of the lamp impedance ([]R) presents the best sensitivity and is a good indicator for the occurrence of acoustic resonance. The proposed method is independent of lamp operating power and the frequency modulation method employed. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 OW metal halide lamps from different manufactures and a lamp acoustic resonance detection method based on []R variation is developed.

It {{can do this}} by preserving the energy generated at the lamp as radiative, departing from precedent and avoiding absorption of and re-emission of radiant heat as convection and conduction. Within thermodynamic limits, the radiant heat generated by an electric lamp or the sun is available for optical concentration and for reconstitution as a high thermodynamic quality power reservoir. Piping light from a large central lamp facilitates the decoupling of lighting related heat at the source, and also means that the efficiency of one central fixture can be stringently optimized instead of the multitude of fixtures it replaces in buildings. Luminous efficacy for a full-spectrum lamp decoupled of its infrared can be shown to approach theoretical limits of 250 lumens/watt. UV generated by the lamp, if coupled along with the illumination into the transport fibers, can be converted into visible radiation at the emitting end of the fiber, supplementing the light output. Fiber optics are used to carry information over long distances (actually encoded pulses of radiative IR), but certain fiber optics can carry tremendous amounts of energy. As fiber optics {{become more and more}} plentiful in telecommunications, their prices will come down. Cost and operating expense studies included in the final chapter of this thesis indicate that a large single source with light that is efficiently coupled and piped throughout a building's interior could reduce electric light consumption to one-fourth, and that even at current fiber pricing levels some systems can be competitive in initial cost to conventional lighting. Certain aspects of centralization suggest further reductions in cost and operating expenses such as centralized, instead of localized, relamping and cleaning, and eliminated requirements for thermal, electrical, and structural hardware at room fixture locations. The economic and technical feasibility of a central system depends on the simultaneous minimization of fiber aperture area and energy losses. Thermodynamically, the concentration of light for transport cannot surpass the energy density of the source. So such a system employs, at best, an optical process that preserves the extent of the source. That is, a high brightness source must be used to drive the system, regardless of the lamp's lumen output. High brightness lamps, then, can be viewed as an alternative to high <b>efficacy</b> <b>lamps</b> for increasing the energy performance of lighting systems in buildings. This thesis anticipates the existence of high brightness, high lumen lamps. The sun's 10, 000 footcandles in peak conditions can be a potent contributor to the energy efficacy of buildings if a collection and utilization strategy is properly devised. At 100 sq. ft of available illumination for each sq. ft of collected sunlight, a scenario including simultaneous collection and distribution of electric light and heat and sunlight and solar heat in a building could reduce to near zero the energy consumed for lighting during peak sun conditions. Studies in this thesis indicate that an economically driven future role of solar energy in the lighting, heating, and cooling of buildings could very well revolve around keeping sunlight in the form of illumination and sunheat in the form of radiative heat, instead of converting both into electricity via photovoltaics and reconversion of this electricity back into electric light. Conventional lighting is an inefficient process, essentially using heat sources for the light they provide. Not only is lighting related electricity generating predominantly waste heat, this heat must be removed from the building's envelope by an additional input of energy. Even energy saving fluorescent lamps and fixtures produce at least 80 % heat. This might serve to explain why 30 % of the country's electricity is consumed by lighting. This thesis proposes a method for decoupling and recovery of lighting related heat, and transporting light in lieu of electricity to lighting fixtures (Chapters 2 and 6). Each of the optical components that would comprise such a system is examined. Chapter 7 investigates the radiation source. Chapter 8 develops the source reflector which will direct the source's radiative output in a particular direction. Chapter 9 studies a mirror that will separate the source's radiation beam into a light beam and a heat beam for subsequent processing. Chapter 10 looks at the heat collector that will convert the heat beam into a usable high-temperature power reservoir. Chapter 11 devises the light collector/ concentrator that will facilitate coupling of light energy into a fiber optic transport network. Chapter 12 assembles the constituent components into central modules. Chapter 5 surveys the light transport media, in particular fiber optics and Prism Optical Light Guide, for suitability to building lighting applications. The exact method of solar couplature is not introduced. Sample energy efficiency comparisons, cost and payback scenarios, implementation issues and concepts for room emitters are included in chapter 13. Related concepts for a transparent concentrating solar collector for use as a window or skylight, and a solar concentrating wall are disclosed in the conclusory chapter.
