40|$|Lipoprotein(a) is an {{independent}} risk factor for premature coronary artery disease (Erqou 2009). The physiological role of liver synthesized lipoprotein is still unclear. The cut off-value to define elevated lipoprotein(a) was determined arbitrarily at 30 mg/dl (Graham 2007). Patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) can develop premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases {{even in the absence}} of other risk factors. Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease and the peripheral arterial occlusive disease are related with elevated lipoprotein(a) -levels (Jones 2007). These cannot sufficiently be influenced either by standard hypolipemic diet or by drug therapy. It has been reported that a 4 g dose of Nicotinic Acid can reduce lipoprotein(a) by up to 38 % (Carlson 1989). Such high doses are restricted in use because of the main adverse reaction of skin flushes. New drugs which are still in a state of devolvement and testing are Mipomersen Sodium, an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the synthesis of apolipoprotein B- 100 as well as Eprotirome, a selective thyroid hormone analogue. At the moment <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis,</b> apart from the drug therapy with nicotinic acid, is the only option to lower lipoprotein(a) levels significantly in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a). There is a lack of prospective, randomized studies on the effect of apheresis on the course of cardiovascular diseases in patients with isolated elevated lipoprotein(a). The goal of this retrospective observational study is to monitor and analyze the effect of <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> on the course of cardiovascular diseases in patients with isolated elevated lipoprotein(a). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were chosen as progression parameters. Furthermore, the efficiency of <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> on the reduction of the lipid parameters, notably lipoprotein(a), was analyzed. Finally, the obtained data should be used as a basis for future studies. This retrospective study investigates the courses of 15 patients treated in the lipid-clinic at the Charité University hospital Berlin with <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> for isolated elevated lipoprotein(a) and progressive cardiovascular disease. The number of events and the number of interventions are compared before the start of the apheresis (starting with first manifestation) and the period with apheresis therapy (until the end of the treatment investigation in July 2007) and analyzed individually for each patient and each year. Furthermore, the lipid lowering effect of the apheresis therapy was investigated. The median of the investigation period before the start of the apheresis therapy is 3 years (min. 8 months, max. 30 years and 8. 5 months). With therapy the median of the investigations period is 2 years and 5 month (min. 1 year, max 9 years and 5 months). The rate of events decreased significantly from 0. 37 (median, min. 0, max 2. 5) to 0 events per patient and year (median, min. 0, max. 1, P = 0. 013). The rate of interventions per patient and year decreased significantly from 1. 3 (median, min. 0. 07, max. 4. 71) to 0 interventions per patient and year (median, min. 0, max. 0. 09, P = 0. 002). For single apheresis sessions significant acute lowering of lipoprotein(a) up to 70. 2 % (max., median 66. 0 %, min. 55. 7 %, P = 0. 001) from pre-apheresis levels of 83. 3 mg/dl (median, min. 62 mg/dl, max 155. 7 mg/dl) were obtained. The statistical significance of these findings has to be scrutinized critically due to the sample number of monitored patients and the different investigation periods. However the results of event and intervention rate are promising. Furthermore, these data showed evidence of the efficacy of <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis.</b> In June 2008 the Federal Joint Committee has authorized the use of <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) > 60 mg/dl suffering from progressive cardiovascular disease (coronary, peripheral, and cerebrovascular arterial disease), despite optimal established therapy.

40|$|Despite {{primary and}} {{secondary}} prevention of coronary disease with lowering plasma cholesterol by diet and drug therapy, coronary heart disease remains the major {{cause of death in}} Western countries. Low density lipoprotein apheresis had the potential to make a significant impact as it acutely leads to a marked reduction in plasma cholesterol. However, recent preliminary results suggest that low density lipoprotein apheresis may not be more effective in preventing progression of coronary disease than current drug therapy. We have devised a new technique, termed <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis,</b> which removes cholesterol and triglycerides from plasma but retains the apolipoproteins. This procedure shows great promise in stimulating regression beyond current therapy. <b>Lipid</b> <b>apheresis,</b> a new extracorporeal procedure based on plasma delipidation with the organic solvent mixture butanol-diisopropyl ether, was applied to hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic roosters. Approximately 25 % of the calculated blood volume was removed from the animals. The plasma was separated from the blood cells. The plasma was delipidated for 20 min with the organic solvent mixture. The delipidated plasma containing all proteins, including the apolipoproteins and other ionic constituents, was remixed with the blood cells and infused back into the identical donor animals. Analyses of serial blood samples collected from lipid apheresed and sham treated animals up to 16 h after infusion revealed that <b>Lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> caused acute, marked reductions in plasma lipids. The pattern and extent of the plasma levels of cholesterol were different in the hypercholesterolemic animals when compared with normocholesterolemic animals, indicating that a readily extraplasma cholesterol pool in the hypercholesterolemic animals was rapidly mobilized into the plasma pool.

Investigations with hemodialysis tubings and membranes revealed contact activation of {{components of the}} immune system, formation of reactive oxygen radicals, and generation of lipid peroxidation products. In the case of LA this would be harmful and undesired since the atherosclerotic process induced by severe hyperlipidemia may be become aggravated by this extracorporeal therapy. Methods: Indicators for non physiological events during LA therapy were investigated in plasma, lipids and blood cells including gene expression studies. Results: Fortunately, no signs of any bioincompatibile reactions were noted during a single LA treatment in plasma and at the cellular level. In addition, no further acute effect of LA treatment on free radical scavenging enzymes (FRSE) could be detected both at the activity and gene level in white blood cells.

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, {{the days}} of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] were {{numbered}} and many people would not have placed a bet on this lipid particle {{making it to the}} next century. However, genetic studies brought Lp(a) back to the front-stage after a Mendelian randomization approach used for the first time provided strong support for a causal role of high Lp(a) concentrations in cardiovascular disease and later also for aortic valve stenosis. This encouraged the use of therapeutic interventions to lower Lp(a) as well numerous drug developments, although these approaches mainly targeted LDL cholesterol, while the Lp(a) -lowering effect was only a 'side-effect'. Several drug developments did show a potent Lp(a) -lowering effect but did not make it to endpoint studies, mainly for safety reasons.

The meeting was the last scientific initiative on LDL-apheresis supported by public funds in Italy. After roughly two decades of use of LDL-apheresis, new guidelines were required based on the latest scientific evidence. In 2006, the Italian multicentre study on LDL-apheresis Working Group (IMSLDLa-WP), a scientific initiative at national level, was developed. It initially gathered together 19 Italian centres qualified for the application of <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> and LDL-apheresis (2007 - 2008), then 23 in 2010, located in the north, south, centre of Italy and in Sicily and Sardinia.

A secondary objective was the creation of a database of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia and other severe forms of dyslipidaemia undergoing treatment with LDL-apheresis using the available techniques. Since LDL-apheresis has multidisciplinary treatment indications, the agreement on the new guidelines was reached through a panel of experts, of different medical and surgical specialties, with scientific and medical interest in the treatment indications, application and development of LDL-apheresis.

40|$|Aim/Background: Heart {{transplantation}} (Htx) {{has become}} a very often used method in patients with a life-threatening heart disease. Many patients develop cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) {{after the first year}} following Htx. The occurrence of a progressing CAV is associated with a higher probability of graft failure and death in these patients. A dyslipidemia plays a {{role in the development of}} CAV, but other risk factors like an elevation of fibrinogen levels also seem to be important. In the literature two groups reported about the application of a <b>lipid</b> <b>apheresis</b> in patients with CAV after Htx. This paper summarizes our experience with this approach. Material/Methods: 7 patients (5 males, 2 females) who underwent Htx have been treated with apheresis at our center since 2002. CAV was diagnosed several years after Htx. Two apheresis methods have been used: HELP and lipid filtration. Results: This paper summarizes the data of 1153 apheresis sessions. They were very well tolerated. In three patients difficulties with the venous access occurred. Due to this fact one female patient could no longer be treated with apheresis after 4 years. LDL cholesterol was acutely reduced by apheresis by 48. 4 %. We also observed relevant reductions of triglycerides, of lipoprotein(a) and of fibrinogen. Our patients survived their Htx by 15 years mean (minimum 12 years, maximum 18 years). One patient died from sepsis. Conclusions: Apheresis treatment in Htx patients is well tolerated. Besides its lipid-lowering effects it also affects other systems (oxidized LDL particles, coagulation, C-reactive protein, adhesion molecules, plasma viscosity, monocytes, inflammatory HDL particles). These parameters may have a major impact on the deterioration of CAV. Future studies to define the role of an apheresis therapy for survival of Htx are clearly needed...|$|E
