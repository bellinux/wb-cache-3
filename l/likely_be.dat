5|$|Parker and Stone {{said in a}} 2008 {{interview}} that a theatrically released sequel would most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> what concludes the series.|$|E
5|$|When {{a reader}} asked Oda who Nami {{is in love}} with, he {{answered}} that there will not <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> any references to romance, since he believes the series' intended demographic is not interested.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> abandoned {{in part because of the}} volcano's remoteness.|$|E

Likely of the Bullion Pit Mine, who was affectionately called [...] "Plato" [...] for his tendency to philosophise.|$|R
25|$|Compared with GABAA, GABAC receptors have {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for GABA, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> longer-lasting in activity, and their responses <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> generated by lower GABA concentrations.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{as there}} <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> {{benefits}} to mate choice copying, there <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> costs as well. Choice and copying <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> not perfect, {{and it is}} very possible for copiers to make errors. There are at least two main potential costs: ...|$|R
5|$|A third sequel, Toy Story 4, will be {{released}} on June 21, 2019. It will be directed by John Lasseter, and {{will focus on the}} toys going to find Bo Peep, who was given away before the third film. Most of the cast of the previous will again reprise their character roles. However Mr. Potato Head will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> recast for the film because of Don Rickles' death in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Vinokourov was the team's leader {{alongside}} Kreuziger. Vinokourov stated {{before the}} season that 2011 would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> his {{last year as a}} professional rider. He sustained a serious crash at the Tour de France. He broke his right femur and retired from the sport for a time, but he eventually went back on this decision and his decision from {{before the season}}, opting instead to return for the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|As noted below, such a {{cloud of}} {{collectors}} would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.|$|E
5000|$|Anyone with [...] "liberal" [...] beliefs <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> {{intolerant}} of others, {{believe that they}} are superior beings, are usually idle and dirty, and (in his later books) <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> homosexual.|$|R
50|$|Today it {{is pointed}} out the accusations to Ikami and Osada <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> plotted for depriving her son of the throne, and they <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> assassinated, by Fujiwara no Momokawa.|$|R
50|$|Shawver most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> a {{corruption}} of Schaeffer.|$|R
5|$|At most 600,000 years old, Kīlauea {{is still}} quite young for a Hawaiian volcano; the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, {{experienced}} almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct. The volcano's foreseeable future activity will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> much {{like it has}} been for the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue to heighten Kīlauea's summit, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, WASP-43b had an orbital period of {{approximately}} 0.8 days (19.2 hours), the second-shortest orbit ever detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, at {{the time of}} discovery, WASP-43b was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter known, a phenomenon that can most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> explained by its host star's low mass.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} of the storm, a high surf advisory and a tropical storm watch were issued for the Hawaiian Islands. Officials urged residents {{to stock up on}} supplies and they closed beaches. Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> upgraded into a hurricane warning, this failed to occur; instead, the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now expecting the storm to pass south of the island chain.|$|E
50|$|Breeden most <b>likely</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} an early settler.|$|R

5|$|Planet Nine {{does not}} have an {{official}} name, and it will not receive one unless its existence is confirmed, typically through optical imaging. Once confirmed, the IAU will certify a name, with priority typically given to a name proposed by its discoverers. It will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> a name chosen from Roman or Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the human}} race become extinct, then the various {{features}} assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000years. The last surviving structures would most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.|$|E
5|$|The 1963 census {{indicated}} that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of local indigenous congregations. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 {{in the number}} of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs, compared with 20%; and only a modest (6%) drop of Muslims which can <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> attributed to immigration, emigration, and birthrate.|$|E

50|$|The community's name most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> {{derived from}} Jeremiah.|$|R
50|$|Mass-{{produced}} cider, such as {{that produced}} by Bulmers, <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> pasteurised and force-carbonated. The colour <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> golden yellow with a clear appearance from the filtration. White ciders are almost colourless in appearance.|$|R
5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. Different meanings may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on the context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his work}} for Marvel takes {{priority}} for him, he also makes {{a significant amount of}} his income from private commissions, which he produces when time permits. In a 2017 interview he stated that if he did interior work again, it would more <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> on a creator-owned project, like Monkeyman And O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the start}} of the 11th century, Welsh society started to build settlements. Food would be cooked in a single {{cauldron}} over an open fire on the floor, it would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> reheated and topped up with fresh ingredients over a number of days. Some dishes could be cooked on a bakestone, a flat stone which could be placed above a fire to heat it evenly.|$|E
50|$|Bank Branch most <b>likely</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} the Banks family.|$|R
50|$|Capels most <b>likely</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} the local Capel family.|$|R
50|$|Flora Creek most <b>likely</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} a pioneer citizen.|$|R
5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> a massive hit.|$|E
5|$|When a {{precipitation}} measurement is made, various networks exist {{across the}} United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as CoCoRAHS or GLOBE. If a network {{is not available}} {{in the area where}} one lives, the nearest local weather or met office will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> interested in the measurement.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
