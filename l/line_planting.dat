Then a part of Mott's division and Ward's brigade of Birney's division gave way and retired in disorder. The enemy under R. H. Anderson took advantage of this and pushed through our <b>line,</b> <b>planting</b> their flags {{on a part of}} the intrenchments not on fire. But owing to the efforts of Hancock, their success was but temporary. Carroll, of Gibbon's division, moved at a double quick with his brigade and drove back the enemy, inflicting great loss. Fighting had continued from five in the morning sometimes along the whole line, at other times only in places. The ground fought over had varied in width, but averaged three-quarters of a mile. The killed, and many of the severely wounded, of both armies, lay within this belt where it was impossible to reach them. The woods were set on fire by the bursting shells, and the conflagration raged. The wounded who had not strength to move themselves were either suffocated or burned to death. Finally the fire communicated with our breastworks, in places. Being constructed of wood, they burned with great fury. But the battle still raged, our men firing through the flames until it became too hot to remain longer.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} few decades since the {{measures}} {{were taken to}} rehabilitate the forest after logging in peninsular Malaysia. Enrichment planting {{is one of the}} potential rehabilitation measures. The technical issues like <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> technique, spacing, species-site matching are crucially related to the success of rehabilitation effort. Different factors are directly or indirectly related to the success of it. These factors affect the overall performance of the plantation. The performance of different techniques varies from each other. The features of the new <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> technique are different from the other conventional planting techniques to some extent. Techniques of enrichment planting, thus, are needed to be reviewed to determine the role of new technique towards sustainability. The study focused on the potentialities of <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> technique of enrichment planting in Peninsular Malaysia. It emphasized on sustainability perspective as well economic feasibility of the technique. The overview of the present enrichment planting indicates that the plantations following <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> technique have good growth performance that leads to an increase in resource base. The salient criteria of <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> considers few aspects of planting technique that are required to be followed by the forest managers to make it sustainable. The use of improved techniques, thus, ensures the necessary conditions for regeneration of forest, its expected growth and sustainability. By carrying out a financial analysis, it was seen that the technique is also economically feasible. The Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return of the enrichment planting with new technique are higher than the enrichment planting with other techniques. In order to ensure it’s more scientific implementation, furthered in depth technical assessment such as species-site matching, biodiversity aspects and adequate information are necessary to establish it towards sustainable forest resource base. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the heartwood, sapwood and bark content, and wood dry density of young and mature teak (Tectona grandis) trees. For this, 17 plantations were selected from 11 sites representing different climatic conditions and plantation densities (156 to 1600 trees ha- 1, and <b>line</b> <b>planting).</b> From these plantations, a total of 87 trees with ages between 5 and 47 years were felled for stem analysis. The highest heartwood proportion of stem volume (over bark) was 61 % and the lowest 0. 4 %. The sapwood proportion ranged between 24 and 72 %, while bark represented from 14 to 37 % of the total volume. Heartwood proportion was significantly different (P< 0. 05) among climatic zones: 'wet' sites producing less heartwood than 'dry' sites Stem diameter (under bark) and heartwood diameter at different stem heights differed among sample trees, even when plotted in relative values to avoid dependency with stem size. Dry density was statistically different between 8 -year-old trees or younger and 47 year-old trees, and between <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> trees and 13 -year-old trees or younger, but did not differ statistically between <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> trees and mature trees.

The survival rate of the two species was not affected by <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> width and gap planting opening. However, its effect on the tree growth was very clear probably due to preference of light intensity under the canopy, which in turn can be controlled by <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> widths and gap planting openings. Principal component analysis categorized the soil properties into three principal components which explained 70 % of the total variation. The First Component Score (PC 1) was related to cation retention capacity with a high contribution of soil organic matter. The linear regression analysis indicated that there were positive correlations between PC 1 score and the proposed SFI and SEF for both soil depths (p < 0. 01). The SFI and SEF were also highly correlated with height, dbh (diameter at breast height) and tree volume, while PC 1 score was only correlated with dbh and tree volume for the surface soils. This shows that the SFI and SEF can be used as indices to predict soil fertility and site quality of rehabilitated degraded forestland...|$|E

Hemispherical photographs were taken over a period of 31 months in three 50 × 50 -m quadrats at each site and in three 100 -m transects along the planting lines. The location of each photo was categorized according to the corresponding type of disturbance, including skid trails, logging gaps, and planting lines. Following logging, the level of canopy openness (CO) increased at both managed forest sites and did not differ significantly between the two. However, CO was greater in skid trails and logging gaps than in planting lines. After 31 months, the mean level of CO at each managed site had decreased significantly due to the establishment of new seedlings. Correlations between changes in CO and the growth of planted seedlings suggested that growth was inhibited by the invasion of the new species. However, the level of CO along the planting lines was greater than that at other disturbed locations. A high level of CO promoted invasion by new species that colonized the space. <b>Line</b> <b>planting</b> may influence forest dynamics and maintain a high level of CO...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of tropical forest management {{has led to}} changes in forest structure and increased surface disturbances due to logging activities. Different forest treatments are suspected to affect soil hydraulic properties in different ways. We investigated the impact of an intensive forest management system (IFMS) on soil hydraulic properties including infiltration characteristics and soil compaction. Infiltration characteristics and soil compaction were measured for four types of surface disturbances (<b>line</b> <b>planting,</b> cleared area, logged area, and skidder tracks) between different periods of operation of an IFMS. The fundamental activities associated with mechanized selective logging and intensive <b>line</b> <b>planting</b> reduced soil hydraulic properties, including infiltration capacity and soil compaction within the near-surface soil profile. Ground-based harvesting using a skidder tractor significantly increased the rate of soil compaction, which influenced the infiltration capacity. Recent forest operations significantly disturbed the soil surface (via compaction and topsoil/subsoil mixing) and produced large variation in the near- surface values. Infiltration capacity values were lower on skidder tracks than other disturbed surface types. The changes in infiltration capacity and soil compaction are evidence that forest disturbances have altered the surface hydrological pathways, thereby creating an opportunity for surface runoff flow to be generated on disturbed sites. Concurrent with succession to forested land cover, an increase in infiltrability reduces the propensity to generate surface runoff flow. The estimated recovery time for near-surface of soil hydraulic properties on the non-skidder tracks was 10 – 15 years, while in the skidder tracks {{it was more than}} 20 years...|$|E

In spite of these differences shoot and root biomass production of Trifolium pratense were more inhibited when growing with endophyte–infected plants of Festuca rubra than with E- plants, regardless of the <b>plant</b> <b>line.</b> In both F. rubra lines, the endophyte increased the phosphorus concentration in shoots. Regardless of F. rubra <b>plant</b> <b>line,</b> root biomass of the five target species was more inhibited when growing with endophyte-infected than with endophyte-free plants. Conclusions: Irrespective of F. rubra <b>line,</b> endophyte-infected <b>plants</b> had a better competitive ability than non-infected plants, as indicated by the lower relative yield of companion plants when growing in mixture with E+ plants. We suggest an allelopathic effect of E+ red fescue on other grassland species. This work was funded by project AGL 2008 - 01159 AGR from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER.
