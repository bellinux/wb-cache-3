40|$|The human {{oral cavity}} {{provides}} the perfect portal of entry for viruses and {{bacteria in the}} environment to access new hosts. Hence, the oral cavity {{is one of the}} most densely populated habitats of the human body containing some 6 billion bacteria and potentially 35 times that many viruses. The role of these viral communities remains unclear; however, many are bacteriophage that may have active roles in shaping the ecology of oral bacterial communities. Other implications for the presence of such vast oral phage communities include accelerating the molecular diversity of their bacterial hosts as both host and phage mutate to gain evolutionary advantages. Additional roles include the acquisitions of new gene functions through <b>lysogenic</b> <b>conversions</b> that may provide selective advantages to host bacteria in response to antibiotics or other types of disturbances, and protection of the human host from invading pathogens by binding to and preventing pathogens from crossing oral mucosal barriers. Recent evidence suggests that phage may be more involved in periodontal diseases than were previously thought, as their compositions in the subgingival crevice in moderate to severe periodontitis are known to be significantly altered. However, it is unclear to what extent they contribute to dysbiosis or the transition of the microbial community into a state promoting oral disease. Bacteriophage communities are distinct in saliva compared to sub- and supragingival areas, suggesting that different oral biogeographic niches have unique phage ecology shaping their bacterial biota. In this review, we summarize what is known about phage communities in the oral cavity, the possible contributions of phage in shaping oral bacterial ecology, and the risks to public health oral phage may pose through their potential to spread antibiotic resistance gene functions to close contacts...|$|R
50|$|Lysogenic phages {{multiply}} {{in one of}} two ways; {{either by}} entering an inactive or latent state or by multiplying through the lytic phase. Through a process known as lysogeny, the phage DNA replicates with the replication of the host chromosome by assimilating into the host chromosome itself. It is then passed on to its daughter cells; this is why it usually isn’t recognized by the host. A process known as <b>lysogenic</b> or phage <b>conversion</b> changes the properties of the bacteria cell; this is possible because the prophage itself contains genes that can present new properties into the bacteria cell or host cell. These bacteria are considered lysogenized. Lysogenized bacteria are resistant to superinfection by same or related phages. This is known as superinfection immunity.|$|R
40|$|Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las), the {{prevalent}} bacterial pathogen associated with citrus huanglongbing (HLB), harbors {{at least two}} prophages, named FP 1 and FP 2. Due to the fastidious nature of Las, {{little is known about}} the prophage’s response to stress conditions. In this study, we used real time PCR to investigate the potential conversion of the FP 1 and FP 2 prophages under stress conditions by comparing the 16 S rDNA copy number in HLB-affected periwinkle and citrus. When HLB-affected periwinkle was exposed to heat stress for 4. 0 hours, more FP 1 and FP 2 phage particles were released at 42 ℃ and 45 ℃ than at 37 ℃. A temperature increase from 23 ℃ to 37 ℃ caused the relative copy numbers of FP 1 and FP 2 to increase six folds, while a shift from 23 ℃ to 42 ℃ or 45 ℃ caused the relative copy numbers of FP 1 and FP 2 to increase between 7. 5 and 15 -folds compared to the initial samples. Meanwhile, similar results were found when HLB-affected citrus scions were treated with tetracycline at concentrations of 500 ppm to 2000 ppm by soaking for three days. When treated with tetracycline for 7 to 9 hours, the relative copy numbers of FP 1 and FP 2 reached their highest levels with an increase of 6 to 11. 1 -folds compared to the initial samples. The results indicate that stress causes the prophages in Las to convert from the lysogenic to lytic cycle. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided direct evidence that an upward temperature shift is accompanied by the <b>lysogenic</b> to lytic <b>conversion.</b> This <b>conversion</b> from the <b>lysogenic</b> to lytic cycle may have applications in terms of modulating HLB populations in naturally occurring infections.

In addition to this, the HMC residues on the T-even phage are glucosylated in a specific pattern. This unique feature allowed the formation of new enzymes that never existed in T-even infected cells or any other cell and modifying T-even phage DNA provided a basic underlying advancement in viral and molecular levels.

Of 27 V. mimicus strains analyzed, which were all negative for genes encoding TCP but positive for the regulatory gene toxR, 2 strains (7. 4 %) were infected by CTX-KmΦ, derived from strain SM 44 (P 27459 ctx::km), and the phage genome integrated into the host chromosome, forming stable lysogens. The lysogens spontaneously produced infectious phage particles in the supernatant fluids of the culture, and high titers of the phage could be achieved when the lysogens were induced with mitomycin C. This is the first demonstration of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>conversion</b> of V. mimicus strains by CTXΦ.
