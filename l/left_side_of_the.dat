5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and visual input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual field.|$|E
5|$|A {{hexagonal}} mortuary {{is located}} on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> façade. It was built by Father Bon between 1867 and 1868. Inside is a baroque retablo, similar to the altars inside the church. It is now used as an adoration chapel.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately {{get out of his}} car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E
50|$|The ventral supraoptic {{decussation}} is the crossover (decussation) {{point for}} {{signals from the}} left and right eye, en route respectively to <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual cortex.|$|R
50|$|According to the MIMSY XG Database {{employed}} by the Indiana State Museum, <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bust is recorded as 'very good'; {{there are very few}} marks/scratches on the proper right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bust.|$|R
50|$|The {{ascending}} lumbar vein is a paired structure (i.e. {{one each}} for <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body). It {{starts at the}} lateral sacral veins, and it runs superiorly, intersecting with the lumbar veins as it crosses them.|$|R
5|$|The Anfield Road stand, on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Main Stand, {{houses the}} away fans during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was {{completed}} in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
5|$|The church {{entrance}} {{is flanked by}} an arcade leading to the narthex. The entrance to the choir loft and the carosa for the images of saints is found {{on the right and}} <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narthex respectively. Since the floor inside is lower than the ground outside, a new floor made of wood (particularly molave) was installed in 1852 which was later replaced by brick tiles from 1874 to 1875.|$|E
50|$|All cases {{reported}} {{appear to}} represent sporadic occurrence. There is no specific inheritance pattern. <b>The</b> male-to-female ratio <b>of</b> affected is 1.8:1 {{and is often}} diagnosed before <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 9. <b>The</b> disorder affects <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxilla almost equally.|$|R
30|$|This report {{highlights}} ccTGA, {{which is}} of special interest because this is <b>the</b> first case <b>of</b> a successful CA of VT in a patient after a DSO and the tachycardia circuit was eliminated after ablating <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VSD patch.|$|R
50|$|IC {{are large}} {{auditory}} nuclei on <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midbrain. It {{is divided into}} three parts, <b>the</b> Central Nucleus <b>of</b> IC (CNIC), dorsal cortex and lateral cortex; however, CNIC is the principal way station for ascending auditory information in the IC.|$|R
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The side altar {{located on}} the left hand side facing the altar is consecrated to the Santo Niño. Joining the statue of the Holy Child are 19th century images of Saint Anthony of Padua and Saint Blaise; and Saint Lucy on the topmost level. Another smaller neoclassical retablo housing a 19th-century image of Saint Mary Magdalene is {{located on the}} <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel retablo.|$|E

This series also provides an excellent hamstring and hip flexor stretch.|$|R
50|$|It was hinged at the top, {{allowing}} {{the user to}} adjust the angle between <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keyboard. The split came between the key pairs: 5/6, T/Y, G/H, and B/N. The space bar floated midway between the two parts. Although the keyboard addressed several ergonomic problems, it was reviewed poorly due to using {{a large amount of}} desk space, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optional palm rests.|$|R
25|$|Combined {{cardiac output}} (CCO) is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart. It {{is a useful}} {{measurement}} in fetal circulation, where cardiac outputs from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart work partly in parallel by the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which directly supply the systemic circulation.|$|R
5|$|Ugg and Wrongway – Two purple {{creatures that}} hop {{along the sides}} of the cubes in an Escheresque manner. Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner, they keep moving toward the top right or top <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid respectively, and fall off the pyramid when they reach the end.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception {{in the initial stages}} until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
50|$|Primary neurulation begins {{after the}} neural plate forms. <b>The</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neural plate start to thicken and lift upward, forming the neural folds. <b>The</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neural plate remains grounded, {{allowing}} a U-shaped neural groove to form. This neural groove sets {{the boundary between}} <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embryo. The neural folds pinch in towards <b>the</b> midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embryo and fuse together to form the neural tube.|$|R

50|$|The {{anterior}} and posterior layers {{converge on}} <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver {{to form the}} right triangular ligament and the left triangular ligament, respectively. In between <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior layer, <b>the</b> reflection <b>of</b> peritoneum has an inferior continuation termed the falciform ligament. The falciform ligament contains <b>the</b> round ligament <b>of</b> liver.|$|R
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel is normally reserved for options {{that will continue}} the conversation in depth, while options {{on the right side}} tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from the arcade game. Some have Donkey Kong on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen in the barrel level (like he is in the arcade game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
30|$|The {{wall behind}} the target {{material}} and the desktop with the monitor arm stand were covered with white canvas. And white canvas curtains were hung {{to the right and}} <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desk. Besides the visual target material, the only object within <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects was the white canvas.|$|R
