5|$|Since their 1882 establishment, the St. Louis Cardinals, {{originally}} {{known as}} the St. Louis Browns, have employed 63 managers. Ned Cuthbert was the franchise's original manager, and Mike Matheny is the team's current skipper. Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> leads the team in regular-season and postseason wins (1,231 and 33), regular-season and postseason losses (1,029 and 25), and playoff appearances (7). <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> and Hall of Famer Billy Southworth won two World Series, tied for the most in club history by a single manager. Charles Comiskey leads the team in winning percentage (.685), {{and is one of}} thirteen Cardinals managers who have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame—three of whom (Comiskey, Southworth, Red Schoendienst) had multiple tenures with the club. <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> and Whitey Herzog each won a Manager of the Year award with the Cardinals—Herzog in 1985 and <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> in 2002, the fourth of his career.|$|E
5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate {{he was trying to}} win the team's 10th championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Bobby Cox {{became the}} first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having {{previously}} won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. <b>La</b> <b>Russa,</b> Piniella, Jim Leyland, Bob Melvin, Davey Johnson, and Joe Maddon have since won the award in both leagues. Cox and <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> have won the most awards, with four. Baker, Leyland, Piniella, Showalter and Maddon have won three times. In 2005, Cox {{became the first}} manager to win the award in consecutive years. Terry Francona and Dave Roberts are the most recent winners.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{missed the}} first month of the season with a {{hamstring}} injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> that had developed after spring training ended. In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> asked Smith if he would like to be traded. Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Pujols donated {{money to}} the Mike Coolbaugh Memorial Tournament, {{allowing}} the event to occur after a sponsor backed out. On August 28, 2010, Pujols and <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> attended Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally in Washington, D.C., after being assured by Beck that the rally was not political. During the rally, Pujols was presented with a medal for his off-the-field efforts.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|E
5000|$|Computer Gaming World in 1991 praised Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> Ultimate Baseballs VGA graphics, and {{concluded}} that the game [...] "packs a tremendous amount into a single box". A 1992 review by the same author of expansion disks was less favorable. It praised the accuracy of a recreation of the 1990 Major League Baseball season, but criticized the incomplete rosters. The magazine stating that the game [...] "still falls short of its potential ... TLRUB may be a bit closer to the [...] "ultimate" [...] with these disks, but it's not there yet". The magazine nonetheless that year named Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> Ultimate Baseball as 1992's best sports game.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, the {{opposing}} managers are close friends. Leyland was <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> third base {{coach for the}} Chicago White Sox in the early 1980s. Leyland {{also served as a}} Pittsburgh-based advance scout for the Cardinals before he was hired by the Tigers.|$|R
50|$|Leyland {{left the}} Tigers {{organization}} {{for the first time}} in 1982 when he became Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> third base coach for four seasons (1982-85) with the Chicago White Sox, including the team's 1983 AL West division title, before being named the 33rd manager in Pittsburgh Pirates history on November 20, 1985.|$|R
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|Upon retirement, Smith {{took over}} for Mel Allen {{as the host}} of the {{television}} series This Week in Baseball (TWIB) in 1997. Smith also became color commentator for the local broadcast of Cardinals games on KPLR-TV from 1997 to 1999. When his stint on This Week in Baseball concluded, Smith then moved on to do work for CNN-SI beginning in 1999. After <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> retired as manager of the Cardinals in 2011, Smith became active in the organization again, starting with his stint as a special instructor for the team's 2012 spring training camp.|$|E
5|$|The Manager of the Year Award is {{an honor}} given {{annually}} since 1983 to the best managers in the American and National Leagues. The winner is voted on by 28 members of the BBWAA. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with {{the highest score in}} each league wins the award. In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa,</b> Lou Piniella, and Jim Leyland have since won the award in both leagues. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record.|$|E

50|$|After {{his playing}} career, he {{eventually}} {{found his way}} back to the White Sox as the bullpen coach, where he served for 19 years (1980-87 and 1997 to 2007). In between, from 1988-95, he held the same position with the Oakland Athletics. He was a longtime member of Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> coaching staffs in both cities. In 2008-2009, he was listed as a roving minor league instructor by the White Sox.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to the coaching ranks the following season, on <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> staff with the St. Louis Cardinals, then coached for the Chicago Cubs and the Mariners, before returning to Oakland in 2005 for three years as bench coach and third base coach. His contract was not renewed {{at the close of}} the 2007 season. From 2008 to 2012 he served as hitting coach for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox before being added to the Rockies' MLB staff by Weiss for the 2013 season.|$|R
5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, {{pitching}} the Giants' home opener, Cain threw {{a complete}} game shut out, striking out 11. Facing 28 batters in 9 innings, {{one over the}} minimum, he allowed a single baserunner on a hit to James McDonald, the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the third one-hitter of Cain's career. In his next start, on April 18, Cain threw another 9 shutout innings using only 91 pitches, dueling Cliff Lee of the Phillies who threw 102 pitches over 10 scoreless innings. The first 9 innings took only 1 hour and 49 minutes. The Giants {{went on to win}} in the 11th inning. Following a dominant first half, Cain was selected to the All-Star Game and was chosen by manager Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> to be the NL's starting pitcher. On July 10 at Kauffman Stadium, Cain allowed a leadoff single to Derek Jeter before retiring the six remaining hitters he faced; he was the winning pitcher in an 8–0 decision. On July 21, Cain hit his sixth career home run, off of Phillies' pitcher Cole Hamels in the third inning of a 10-inning, 65 Giants' victory. Later in that inning Hamels hit his first career home run off of Cain, making this the first time since 2002 when two pitchers have homered off of each other in the same game (Kevin Millwood and Denny Stark were the last to do it).|$|E

5000|$|The Cardinals {{made their}} first World Series {{appearance}} since , when they defeated the Detroit Tigers four games to one {{to win their}} National League-leading 10th World Series title. This was manager Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> sixth World Series appearance as manager and his third with the Cardinals. The Cardinals' last postseason appearance was in 2009, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. They finished the 2010 season {{with a record of}} 86-76 (...) , finishing in second-place in the National League Central standings, five games behind the Cincinnati Reds.|$|R
5000|$|The Athletics' on-field mediocrity, however, {{contained}} a few bright spots. Mark McGwire clubbed 39 {{home runs in}} a mere 104 games; he would hit at least 50 {{in each of the}} four subsequent seasons. The 1995 season also saw the debut of future superstar Jason Giambi. Giambi, in his first major league season, batted [...]256 with six home runs in 54 games. Lastly, the season was Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> last as Oakland's manager. He, along with most of the Athletics' assistant coaches, would join the St. Louis Cardinals in 1996.|$|R
25|$|<b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> credits Loren Babe and Paul Richards of the White Sox {{organization}} for helping {{him to become}} a manager. The White Sox gave <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> his first managerial opportunity in 1978 by naming him skipper of their Double-A affiliate, the Knoxville Sox of the Southern League. <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> spent a half-season at Knoxville before being promoted to the White Sox coaching staff when owner Bill Veeck changed managers from Bob Lemon to Larry Doby. Doby was fired {{at the end of the}} season; Don Kessinger, former star shortstop of the crosstown Cubs, was named the White Sox' player-manager for 1979, and <b>La</b> <b>Russa</b> was named manager of the Triple-A Iowa Oaks of the American Association.|$|E

Coincidentally, having won a championship while managing the Florida Marlins in 1997, Tigers manager Jim Leyland could have achieved this same feat had the Tigers defeated <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> Cardinals in the 2006 World Series.

5000|$|Taguchi {{returned}} to the Cardinals in 2007 and had another solid season, batting [...]290 as a part-time player, with 307 at-bats in 130 games. He was one of manager Tony <b>La</b> <b>Russa's</b> most valuable pinch-hitters; of 46 games in 2007 where he's shown to have had just 1 AB, Taguchi picked up 15 hits. Taguchi played 617 innings in the field, with 41 starts (and 22 other appearances) in center (where Jim Edmonds was banged up) and 21 starts (20 other) in left (where the Cardinals hadn't settled on one player until 2008 and Skip Schumaker).
