25|$|During {{preparation}} for sequencing, cDNA copies of transcripts may be amplified by PCR to enrich for fragments that contain the expected 5’ and 3’ adapter sequences. Amplification {{is also used}} to allow sequencing of very low input amounts of RNA, down to as little as 50 pg, in extreme applications. Spike-in controls can be used to provide quality control assessment of <b>library</b> <b>preparation</b> and sequencing, in terms of GC-content, fragment length, as well as the bias due to fragment position within a transcript. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are short random sequences that are used to individually tag sequence fragments during <b>library</b> <b>preparation,</b> so that every tagged fragment is unique. UMIs provide an absolute scale for quantification and the opportunity to correct for subsequent amplification bias introduced during library construction, and accurately estimate the initial sample size. UMIs are particularly well suited to single-cell RNA-Seq transcriptomics, where the amount of input RNA is restricted and extended amplification of the sample is required.|$|E
25|$|Duplex {{sequencing}} is a <b>library</b> <b>preparation</b> {{and analysis}} method for next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms that employs random tagging of double stranded DNA to detect mutations with higher accuracy and lower error rate. This method uses degenerate molecular tags {{in addition to}} sequencing adapters to recognize reads originating from each strand of DNA. The generated sequencing reads then will be analyzed using two methods: single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) and Duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly.

25|$|In {{the last}} step of duplex {{sequencing}} <b>library</b> <b>preparation,</b> Illumina sequencing adapters {{are added to the}} tagged double stranded libraries by PCR amplification using primers containing sequencing adapters. During PCR amplification both complementary strands of DNA are amplified and generate two types of PCR products. Product 1 derive from strand 1 which have a unique tag sequence (called α in the figure 2) next to the Illumina adapter 1 and product 2 that have a unique tag (called β in the figure 2) next to illumina adapter 1. (Please note that in each strand, tag a is the retrograde, complementary version of tag b and vice versa). The libraries containing duplex tags and Illumina adapters are sequenced using Illumina TruSeq system. Reads that are originating from each single strand of DNA form a group of reads (tag families) that are sharing the same tag. The detected families of reads will be used in next step for analyzing sequencing data.|$|E

However, adequate curation {{of the assembly}} results against potential contamination of non-target organisms requires advanced bioinformatics approaches and practices. Here, we re-analyzed the sequencing data generated for the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini, and created a holistic display of the eukaryotic genome assembly using DNA data originating from two groups and eleven sequencing libraries. By using bacterial single-copy genes, k-mer frequencies, and coverage values of scaffolds we could identify and characterize multiple near-complete bacterial genomes from the raw assembly, and curate a 182 Mbp draft genome for H. dujardini supported by RNA-Seq data. Our results indicate that most contaminant scaffolds were assembled from Moleculo long-read libraries, {{and most of these}} contaminants have differed between <b>library</b> <b>preparations.</b> Our re-analysis shows that visualization and curation of eukaryotic genome assemblies can benefit from tools designed {{to address the needs of}} today’s microbiologists, who are constantly challenged by the difficulties associated with the identification of distinct microbial genomes in complex environmental metagenomes...|$|R

40|$|Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) {{technologies}} are gaining {{importance in the}} routine clinical diagnostic setting. It is thus desirable to simplify the workflow for high-throughput diagnostics. Fragmentation of DNA is a crucial step for <b>preparation</b> of template <b>libraries</b> and various methods are currently known. Here we evaluated the performance of nebulization, sonication and random enzymatic digestion of long-range PCR products {{on the results of}} NGS. All three methods produced high-quality sequencing libraries for the 454 platform. However, if long-range PCR products of different length were pooled equimolarly, sequence coverage drastically dropped for fragments below 3, 000 bp. All three methods performed equally well with regard to overall sequence quality (PHRED) and read length. Enzymatic fragmentation showed highest consistency between three <b>library</b> <b>preparations</b> but performed slightly worse than sonication and nebulization with regard to insertions/ deletions in the raw sequence reads. After filtering for homopolymer errors, enzymatic fragmentation performed best if compared to the results of classic Sanger sequencing. As the overall performance of all three methods was equal with only minor differences, a fragmentation method can be chosen solely according to lab facilities, feasibility and experimental design...|$|R

40|$|The marine {{environment}} harbors {{a large proportion}} of the total biodiversity on this planet, including the majority of the earths’ different phyla and classes. Studying the genomes of marine organisms can bring interesting insights into genome evolution. Today, almost all marine organismal groups are understudied with respect to their genomes. One potential reason is that extraction of high-quality DNA in sufficient amounts is challenging for many marine species. This is due to high polysaccharide content, polyphenols and other secondary metabolites that will inhibit downstream DNA <b>library</b> <b>preparations.</b> Consequently, protocols developed for vertebrates and plants do not always perform well for invertebrates and algae. In addition, many marine species have large population sizes and, as a consequence, highly variable genomes. Thus, to facilitate the sequence read assembly process during genome sequencing, it is desirable to obtain enough DNA from a single individual, which is a challenge in many species of invertebrates and algae. Here, we present DNA extraction protocols for seven marine species (four invertebrates, two algae, and a marine yeast), optimized to provide sufficient DNA quality and yield for de novo genome sequencing projects...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dideoxy-based chain {{termination}} sequencing {{developed by}} Sanger is {{the gold standard}} sequencing approach and allows clinical diagnostics of disorders with relatively low genetic heterogeneity. Recently, new next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have {{found their way into}} diagnostic laboratories, enabling the sequencing of large targeted gene panels or exomes. The development of benchtop NGS instruments now allows the analysis of single genes or small gene panels, making these platforms increasingly competitive with Sanger sequencing. METHODS: We developed a generic automated ion semiconductor sequencing work flow {{that can be used in}} a clinical setting and can serve as a substitute for Sanger sequencing. Standard amplicon-based enrichment remained identical to PCR for Sanger sequencing. A novel postenrichment pooling strategy was developed, limiting the number of <b>library</b> <b>preparations</b> and reducing sequencing costs up to 70 % compared to Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 1224 known pathogenic variants were analyzed, yielding an analytical sensitivity of 99. 92 % and specificity of 99. 99 %.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} profiling {{provides a}} tool to analyze the internal states of cells or organisms, and their responses to perturbations. While global measurements of mRNA levels have thus been widely used for many years, {{it is only through}} the recent development of the ribosome profiling technique that an analogous examination of global mRNA translation programs has become possible. Ribosome profiling reveals which RNAs are being translated to what extent and where the translated open reading frames are located. In addition, different modes of translation regulation can be distinguished and characterized. Here, we present an optimized, step-by-step protocol for ribosome profiling. Although established in Caenorhabditis elegans, our protocol and optimization approaches should be equally usable for other model organisms or cell culture with little adaptation. Next to providing a protocol, we compare two different methods for isolation of single ribosomes and two different <b>library</b> <b>preparations,</b> and describe strategies to optimize the RNase digest and to reduce ribosomal RNA contamination in the libraries. Moreover, we discuss bioinformatic strategies to evaluate the quality of the data and explain how the data can be analyzed for different applications.

50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of 454 systems is their running speed, Manpower can be reduced with automation of <b>library</b> <b>preparation</b> and semi-automation of emulsion PCR. A disadvantage of the 454 system is that it is prone to errors when estimating the number of bases in a long string of identical nucleotides. This is referred to as a homopolymer error and occurs when there are 6 or more identical bases in row. Another disadvantage is that the price of reagents is relatively more expensive compared with other next-generation sequencers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{disadvantages}} of using miRNA-seq over other methods of miRNA profiling {{are that it}} is more expensive, generally requires a larger amount of total RNA, involves extensive amplification, and is more time consuming than microarray and qPCR methods. [...] As well, miRNA-seq <b>library</b> <b>preparation</b> methods seem to have systematic preferential representation of the miRNA complement, and this prevents accurate determination of miRNA abundance. At the same time, the approach is hybridization independent and therefore does not require a priori sequence information. Because of this, one can obtain sequences of novel miRNAs and miRNA isoforms (isoMirs), distinguish sequentially similar miRNAs, and identify point mutations.|$|E
