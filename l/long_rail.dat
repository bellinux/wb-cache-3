This assembly plant produced Rambler Americans, AMC Rebels, and later, Hornets, Concords, Gremlins, Spirits, and Eagles.

500|$|SR510 {{begins as}} Marvin Road at exit 111, a diamond {{interchange}} on [...] (I-5) in southern Lacey. The highway travels south by the Hawks Prairie Village Mall, {{home of the}} Hawks Prairie Center, {{a division of the}} South Puget Sound Community College. South of the mall is the Martin Way intersection, located west of River Ridge High School and one of the busiest intersections on the roadway at a daily average of 24,000motorists in 2008, and the Pacific Avenue roundabout, where SR510 turns east, renamed Pacific Avenue, northeast of Long Lake. After leaving Lacey city limits, the roadway begins to parallel the Quadlok line owned by Tacoma Rail south towards the Old Pacific Highway. At the Old Pacific Highway, the road becomes the St. Clair Cutoff Road, named for nearby Saint Clair Lake, and crosses the railroad tracks twice. After turning northeast, parallel to Saint Clair Lake's shoreline, the highway dips southeast, now parallel to the Nisqually River, into Fort Lewis and the Nisqually Indian Community. Outside of the community, SR510 is renamed the Yelm Highway and passes Southworth Elementary. After intersecting Mudd Run Road, future western terminus of the Yelm Loop, the roadway enters Yelm city limits. After turning southeast, SR510 becomes Yelm Avenue and serves Yelm High School. Shortly thereafter, the roadway serves Yelm Middle School, crosses the Yelm-Tenino Trail, a [...] <b>long</b> <b>rail</b> trail in operation since 1993, and ends at First Street, signed as , which continues southeast as Yelm Avenue.|$|E

The film co-starred Kenneth More and Donald Sinden, with James Robertson Justice as their crabby mentor. The production was initiated by Betty Box, who picked up a copy of the book at Crewe during a <b>long</b> <b>rail</b> journey, and saw its possibility as a film. But Box and Ralph Thomas had [...] difficulties convincing Rank executives that people would go to a film about doctors, and that Bogarde, who up to then had played character roles, had sex appeal and could play light comedy. They were allocated a modest budget, and were only allowed to use available Rank contract artists. The film was the first of the Doctor film series based on the books by Richard Gordon.|$|E
