40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} a novel defect detection algorithm for the semiconductor assembly process by image {{analysis of a}} single captured image, without reference to another image during inspection. The integrated <b>circuit</b> (IC) <b>pattern</b> is usually periodic and regular. Therefore, we can implement a classification scheme whereby the regular pattern in the die image is classified as the acceptable <b>circuit</b> <b>pattern</b> and the die defect can be modeled as irregularity on the image. The detection of irregularity in image is thus equivalent to the detection of die defect. We propose a method where the defect detection algorithm first segments the die image into different regions according to the <b>circuit</b> <b>pattern</b> {{by a set of}} morphological segmentations with different structuring element sizes. Then, a feature vector, which consists of many image attributes, is calculated for each segmented region.

30|$|In a {{previous}} study, the electrical properties of nonwoven (Lee 2011) and silk fabric (Lee 2012) coated with CNF/PVDF-HFP composites were reported. This {{study found that}} the electrical properties of CNF/PVDF-HFP coated nonwoven fabrics increased with increasing CNFs content, and of silk fabric increased with 4 % CNFs content. As well, Kang and Lee (2015) reported that in a preparation of carbon nanofiber composite-coated nylon fabric heating elements, surface temperatures of 16 wt% carbon nanofiber composite-coated fabrics reached 80  °C when 20  V was applied. When coating the entire surface, the coating solution was used in a large amount, but the problem of heating only in the localized region was confirmed. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to fabricate a fabric heating element coated with a carbon nanocomposite with various linear <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> in order to resolve the economic and localized electric heating characteristics by using a smaller amount of carbon nanocomposite than the conventional planar heating element. To achieve this goal, we prepared a CNF/PVDF-HFP composite with electric heating properties, and the carbon nanocomposite was coated onto cotton fabric designed with two types of <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> developed in our laboratory. The samples with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> were analyzed by considering surface morphology, electrical property, electrical heating property, mechanical property, and water repellent property.|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop fabric heating {{elements}} using CNF/PVDF-HFP composite coated cotton fabric with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> with the aim of providing low cost, flexible, light, and uniform heating performance compared to conventional fabric heating elements. We prepared a carbon nanocomposite with electrical properties and it was coated cotton fabric with two types of <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns.</b> The sample code of P 0 designates a reference sample, while P 3, P 5 and P 7 were used when the number of horizontal lines was 3, 5, and 7, respectively; patterns in which a vertical line was added to the horizontal lines were named 2 P 3, 2 P 5, and 2 P 7, respectively. The surface resistivity values ranged from 1.01  ×  103 to 1.65  ×  103  Ω/sq, and it was thus confirmed that the samples with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> exhibit excellent electrical characteristics. The resistances of P 3 and 2 P 3 were lower than those of fabric heaters with 5 and 7 lines, and it is thus presented that the effect of the resistance is less affected by the decrease in the number of lines. Comparing patterns, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed slightly lower resistances than 2 P 7, 2 P 5 and 2 P 3, indicating that the line in the vertical direction slightly increased the resistance. For electrical heating temperature, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed more uniform heating performance than P 0 and the circuit with the added vertical line had a higher surface temperature than P 7, P 5, and P 3 in terms of joule heating. 2 P 3 had the best heating performance, and the surface temperature was similar to P 0 at about 76  °C. In terms of mechanical properties and water repellency, it was confirmed that the coated fabrics had higher values compared to the uncoated fabric. Therefore, we confirmed that the electrical heating performance of the fabric heating element coated with carbon nanocomposite in three lines is improved compared to that of the plane fabric heating element, and it is also confirmed that it is more economical, flexible and lightweight than the conventional products because of its use of a smaller amount of carbon nanocomposite. Thus, it is suitable for use as a functional material for electric heating. Fabric heating elements that employ a CNF/PVDF-HFP composite with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> have potential applicability in extreme work environments, for active winter sports, cold military training, and wet suits that must maintain body temperature in water.|$|R
