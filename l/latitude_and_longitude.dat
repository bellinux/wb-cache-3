5|$|The <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude</b> are {{expressed}} in , in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the southern hemisphere. Similarly, a positive longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the western hemisphere. The coordinates used {{in this article are}} sourced from Google Earth, which makes use of the WGS84 geodetic reference system. Additionally, a negative altitude value refers to land below sea level.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude</b> became more precise {{and it became}} possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude,</b> rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude</b> of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} of each waterfall {{starts with the}} name. While the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Bureau of State Parks names 22 waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park (all but Kitchen Creek and Shingle Cabin), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) names 23 (all but Shingle Cabin), and Scott E. Brown's 2004 book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers names 24. There are also several unnamed waterfalls in the park, with {{the total number of}} falls given as 33 or 34. For each waterfall the height is given next, followed by the elevation above sea level, and the <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude.</b> Each waterfall in the table is classified according to the four types used in Brown's book (falls, cascade, slide, and chute), with some classified as combinations of types. For each waterfall there are notes, which can give more information on the waterfall, the etymology of the name, and the location on the Falls Trail, followed by a photograph.|$|E

25|$|The {{borders of}} Colorado were {{originally}} defined to be lines of <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude,</b> making its shape a latitude-longitude quadrangle which stretches from 37°N to 41°N latitude and from 102°03'W to 109°03'W longitude (25°W to 32°W from the Washington Meridian).

25|$|Two {{levels of}} {{abstraction}} {{are employed in}} the definition of <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude.</b> In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude</b> on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude</b> together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. <b>Latitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitude</b> together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.|$|E

2500|$|Most of our {{knowledge}} of it comes from Strabo, according to whom Hipparchus thoroughly and often unfairly criticized Eratosthenes mainly for internal contradictions and inaccuracy in determining positions of geographical localities.

5000|$|There is {{only one}} {{surviving}} copy of , which is kept at the Strasbourg University Library. A Latin translation is kept at the Biblioteca Nacional de España in Madrid. The book opens with the list of <b>latitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitudes,</b> in order of [...] "weather zones", {{that is to say}} in blocks of <b>latitudes</b> <b>and,</b> in each weather zone, by order of longitude. As Paul Gallez points out, this excellent system allows the deduction of many <b>latitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitudes</b> where the only extant document is in such a bad condition as to make it practically illegible. Neither the Arabic copy nor the Latin translation include the map of the world itself; however, Hubert Daunicht was able to reconstruct the missing map from the list of coordinates. Daunicht read the <b>latitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>longitudes</b> of the coastal points in the manuscript, or deduces them from the context where they were not legible. He transferred the points onto graph paper and connected them with straight lines, obtaining an approximation of the coastline as it was on the original map. He then does the same for the rivers and towns.|$|R
