50|$|A Safe <b>Load</b> <b>Indicator</b> (SLI) or an Automatic Safe <b>Load</b> <b>Indicator</b> (ASLI) is {{a device}} which is {{installed}} on mobile or portal cranes {{to alert the}} operator if the lift is exceeding the safe operating range of the machinery. In some cases, the device will physically lock the machinery in circumstances it determines to be unsafe. SLI systems are usually composed of a microprocessor connected to various sensors on the crane itself. The SLI measures the angle and extension of the boom along with the load weight and compares this with the manufacturer's specifications {{to determine if the}} lift is safe.|$|E
50|$|A safe <b>load</b> <b>indicator</b> has the {{capability}} of detecting the angle, weight of load lifted, and ground radius of any lifting device. It controls the lifting equipment to the level that it tries to keep the machinery functioning as per the manufacturer's suggested safety charts.|$|E
50|$|AB 2460 (Firearms) 2012 - The California Department of Justice {{maintains}} {{a roster of}} firearms which, {{as a result of}} passing a drop test and having features such as a <b>load</b> <b>indicator,</b> are certified to be safe for sale to the public. The sale of firearms that are not certified as safe by the California Department of Justice is prohibited to the general public, and permitted only to specific groups including law enforcement. AB 2460 would have closed a loophole that allowed law enforcement officials, who are legally allowed to own non-rostered firearms, to transfer a non-rostered firearm to a member of the generally public, who is not legally allowed to own such a weapon. This bill was vetoed by the Governor.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Research in {{professional}} soccer {{focusing on the}} relevance of external and internal <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> for injury prevention is scarce. This study {{examined the relationship between}} <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> and overuse injuries. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Data were collected from 35 professional male soccer players over two seasons. Following <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> were examined: total distance covered (TD), distance covered at high speed (THSR; > 20 kmh(- 1)), number of accelerations (ACCeff; > 1 ms(- 2)), number of decelerations (DECeff; 1. 18) resulted in a higher injury risk. In contrast, a lower injury risk was found when comparing medium ratios for ACCeff (0. 87 - 1. 12), DECeff (0. 86 - 1. 12), and RPE x duration (0. 85 - 1. 12) to low ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that mainly external <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> are associated with increased or decreased injury risk. The monitoring of various <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> is recommended for injury prevention {{in professional}} soccer...|$|R

40|$|Background In {{professional}} senior soccer, training load monitoring is used {{to ensure}} an optimal workload to maximize physical fitness and prevent injury or illness. However, to date, different training <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> are used without a clear link to training outcomes. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to identify the state of knowledge {{with respect to the}} relationship between training <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> and training outcomes in terms of physical fitness, injury, and illness. Methods A systematic search was conducted in four electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science). Training load was defined as the amount of stress over a minimum of two training sessions or matches, quantified in either external (e. g., duration, distance covered) or internal load (e. g., heart rate [HR]), to obtain a training outcome over time. Results A total of 6492 records were retrieved, of which 3304 were duplicates. After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts, we identified 12 full-text articles that matched our inclusion criteria. One of these articles was identified through additional sources. All of these articles used correlations {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> and training outcomes. For pre-season, training time spent at high intensity (i. e., > 90 % of maximal HR) was linked to positive changes in aerobic fitness. Exposure time in terms of accumulated training, match or combined training, and match time showed both positive and negative relationships with changes in fitness over a season. Muscular perceived exertion may indicate negative changes in physical fitness. Additionally, it appeared that training at high intensity may involve a higher injury risk. Detailed external <b>load</b> <b>indicators,</b> using electronic performance and tracking systems, are relatively unexamined. In addition, most research focused on the relationship between training <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> and changes in physical fitness, but less on injury and illness. Conclusion HR indicators showed relationships with positive changes in physical fitness during pre-season. In addition, exposure time appeared to be related to positive and negative changes in physical fitness. Despite the availability of more detailed training <b>load</b> <b>indicators</b> nowadays, the evidence about the usefulness in relation to training outcomes is rare. Future research should implement continuous monitoring of training load, combined with the individual characteristics, to further examine their relationship with physical fitness, injury, and illness...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 19) In {{the construction}} of structural steel buildings, a commonly used technique for fastening parts together is the "friction type connection". This connection functions by maintaining a constant frictional force between connected parts, sufficient to transmit design loads. Connections of this type require consistent bolt tension when erected to control this frictional force. Since consistent bolt tension is important, Coronet <b>Load</b> <b>Indicator</b> washers are sometimes used to control tension tolerances. It is also necessary that bolt holes are aligned {{in the field for}} placement of the bolts, but often times the holes are not aligned properly. To reduce the effects misalignment has on bolt holes during construction, it is helpful to use oversized holes. The effects of oversized holes on the Coronet <b>Load</b> <b>Indicator</b> washer are extremely important in their uses. It is found that on regular and oversized holes, the slip loads were larger than the minimums allowed by building code. In certain instances additional washers were required to prevent the <b>load</b> <b>indicator</b> washer from deforming into the oversized hole...|$|E

40|$|ECN is {{developing}} the Flight Leader model, {{which is based}} on a concept with which the accumulated mechanical loading of all turbines in an offshore wind farm can be estimated at acceptable costs. This information can be used to optimise and lower the cost of Operation & Maintenance (O&M), for exam-ple by prioritising inspections and replacements. In this paper the background and general concept of the Flight Leader model are presented. Key to the application of the Flight Leader concept are the relations between standard (SCADA) signals and <b>load</b> <b>indicators.</b> The more accurate these relations, the more reliable are the calculations of accumulated loading.

In the first case study, a wind profile with relatively weak winds is used to demonstrate the importance of launch vehicle velocity relative to the air and its effect on loads. In the second study, a pair of wind profiles is used to show how the determination of load exceedances is strongly influenced by the wind load persistence allowances for the baseline and two day-of-launch (DOL) steering commands called I-LOADs. Characteristics of the wind profiles and associated trajectory variable and wind-sensitive load indicators are examined. Energy spectra of in-plane and out-of-plane wind component and a <b>load</b> <b>indicator</b> are presented.
