5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

At a lower level, {{it is necessary to}} interconnect multiple CPUs with some sort of network, regardless of whether that network is printed onto a circuit board or made up of <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> devices and cables. At a higher level, it is necessary to interconnect processes running on those CPUs with some sort of communication system.|$|E

25|$|Grids are {{a form of}} {{distributed}} computing whereby a “super virtual computer” is composed of many networked <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> computers acting together to perform very large tasks. This technology {{has been applied to}} computationally intensive scientific, mathematical, and academic problems through volunteer computing, and it is used in commercial enterprises for such diverse applications as drug discovery, economic forecasting, seismic analysis, and back office data processing in support for e-commerce and Web services.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} mind uploading, {{in the case}} of copy-and-transfer, is on data acquisition, rather than data {{maintenance}} of the brain. A set of approaches known as <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> off-loading (LCOL) may be used in the attempt to characterize and copy the mental contents of a brain. The LCOL approach may take advantage of self-reports, life-logs and video recordings that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. A bottom-up approach may focus on the specific resolution and morphology of neurons, the spike times of neurons, the times at which neurons produce action potential responses.|$|E
25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), LCC (leadless chip carrier) and PGA (pin grid array) packages.|$|E
50|$|The core webinos {{architecture}} {{is based on}} widget and web runtimes, which consist of rendering components, policy and permission frameworks, packaging components and extended APIs. To realize the cross device communication, webinos has split the packaging, policy and API extensions from the renderer. By <b>loosely</b> <b>coupling</b> these hitherto monolithic components, it is far easier to expose the application centric components to other devices.|$|R

Memory leaks due to inconsistent handling of circular references between JScript objects and DOM objects were corrected. For better security and stability, IE8 uses the <b>Loosely</b> <b>Coupled</b> Internet Explorer (LCIE) architecture and runs the browser frame and tabs in separate processes. LCIE prevents glitches and hangs from bringing down the entire browser and leads to higher performance and scalability. Permissions for ActiveX controls have been made more flexible instead of enabling or disabling them globally, they can now be allowed on a per-site basis.|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer 8 {{introduces}} {{some major}} architectural changes, called <b>Loosely</b> <b>Coupled</b> IE (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, {{each of which}} can be of a different integrity level; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous Inter-Process Communication to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In Windows Vista with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.|$|E

25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.|$|E

[...] Directional coupler tends to be used for 4-port devices that are only <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> – that is, {{only a small fraction of}} the input power appears at the coupled port. [...] Power divider is used for devices with tight coupling (commonly, a power divider will provide half the input power at each of its output ports – a [...] divider) and is usually considered a 3-port device.|$|E
500|$|Two widely spaced {{narrowband}} signals can be diplexed {{by joining}} together the outputs of two appropriate band-pass filters. [...] Steps {{need to be}} taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance. [...] This can be achieved by appropriate spacing. [...] For instance, if the filters are of the iris-coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed λgb/4 from the junction where λgb is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B. [...] Likewise, the nearest iris of filter B is placed λga/4 from the junction. [...] This works because when filter A is at resonance, filter B is in its stopband and only <b>loosely</b> <b>coupled</b> and vice versa. [...] An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions. [...] A decoupling resonator is placed λg/4 from the junction of each filter. [...] This can be {{in the form of a}} short-circuited stub tuned to the resonant frequency of that filter. [...] This arrangement can be extended to multiplexers with any number of bands.|$|E

5000|$|SOA is the {{philosophy}} of encapsulating application logic in services with a uniformly defined interface and making these publicly available via discovery mechanisms. The notion of complexity-hiding and reuse, but also the concept of <b>loosely</b> <b>coupling</b> services has inspired researchers to elaborate on similarities between the two philosophies, SOA and Web 2.0, and their respective applications. Some argue Web 2.0 and SOA have significantly different elements and thus can not be regarded [...] "parallel philosophies", whereas others consider the two concepts as complementary and regard Web 2.0 as the global SOA.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the University of Cambridge submission to WMT 16. Motivated by the complementary nature of syntactical machine translation and {{neural machine translation}} (NMT), we exploit the synergies of Hiero and NMT in different combination schemes. Starting out with a simple neural lattice rescoring approach, we show that the Hiero lattices are often too narrow for NMT ensembles. Therefore, instead of a hard restriction of the NMT search space to the lattice, we propose to <b>loosely</b> <b>couple</b> NMT and Hiero by composition with {{a modified version of}} the edit distance transducer. The loose combination outperforms lattice rescoring, especially when using multiple NMT systems in an ensemble...|$|R
