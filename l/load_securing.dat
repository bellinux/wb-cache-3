50|$|In earlier {{days before}} the {{introduction}} of containerization, men who loaded and unloaded ships had to tie down cargoes with rope. A type of stopper knot is called the stevedore knot. The methods of securely tying up parcels of goods is called stevedore lashing or stevedore knotting. While loading a general cargo vessel, they use dunnage, which are pieces of wood (or nowadays sometimes strong inflatable dunnage bags) set down to keep the cargo out of any water that might be lying in the hold or are placed as shims between cargo crates for <b>load</b> <b>securing.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present {{measures}} related to the <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> on European level. The road transport plays significant role in Europe. With the increasing volume of goods carried by road the number of vehicles are increasing and also the number of accidents involving trucks. The appro-priate <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> increases the safety of road freight transport. European Best Practice Guidelines on Cargo Securing for Road Transport issued by European Commission are the first document on European level offering the <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> information. There is also a lack of <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> training for truck drivers in most of the EU member states. In most member states the <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> is not the part of the training to obtain truck driving licence. The di-rective 2003 / 59 /EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers shall improve the situation. The education of truck drivers from <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> began since September 2009. The standard EN 12195 - 1 offers calculation base to design <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> arrangements. There were cases when it has created unreasonable demands for <b>load</b> <b>securing.</b> The standard has been revised and finally published in May 2011. However, still the differences between the designs according to the EN 12195 - 1, methods using in Nordic countries, Germany and according to the IMO/ILO/UN ECE Gu-idelines on packing of cargo transport units exists. European Best Practice Guidelines on Cargo Secu-ring for Road Transport are need to be revised to reflect the development in the area of <b>load</b> <b>securing...</b>|$|E

The research presen¬ted remedies the absence of academic attention concer-ning such horizontal dynamic effects by measuring the contact forces at load unit level occurring during transportation {{in addition to the}} cumulative effects at vehicle level. Consequently, the study’s results indicate that the significant horizontal dyna¬mic effects must be considered when judging the safety of <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> practices and the effectiveness of transport packa¬ging.

This paper presents a multi-agent based critical <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> in a PV based microgrid. For the trustworthy operation of critical buildings, the reliability, efficiency and security of the power system should be guaranteed. At present, to increase the security and reliability of electricity supply {{there is a need}} to design a distributed and autonomous subset of a larger grid or a microgrid. This work also clearly discusses the modelling and simulation of specialized microgrid called an Intelligent Distributed Autonomous Power Systems (IDAPS). The IDAPS microgrid plays a crucial role in constructing power grid that facilitate use of renewable energy technologies. IDAPS microgrid comprising of solar photovoltaic as distributed energy resources, different loads and their control algorithms, has been developed. Several case studies have been simulated to evaluate the operation of the IDAPS microgrid during parallel, islanded mode operation and securing critical loads during emergency.|$|E
