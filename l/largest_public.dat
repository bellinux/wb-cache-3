40|$|Buildings are {{important}} contributors to total energy consumption accounting for around 30 % of all energy consumed in China. Of this, around two-fifths are consumed within urban homes, one-fifth within public buildings, and two-fifths within rural area. Government {{office buildings and}} large-scale public buildings are the dominant energy consumers in cities but their consumption can be largely cut back through improving efficiency. At present, energy management in the <b>large</b> <b>public</b> sector is a particular priority in China. Firstly, this paper discusses how the <b>large</b> <b>public</b> building is defined, and then energy performance in <b>large</b> <b>public</b> buildings is studied. The paper also describes barriers to improving energy efficiency of <b>large</b> <b>public</b> buildings in China and examines the energy-efficiency policies and programs adopted in United States and European Union. The energy-efficiency supervision (EES) systems developed to improve operation and maintenance practices and promote energy efficiency in <b>large</b> <b>public</b> sector are described.
