40|$|Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural {{networks}} are still limited {{when it comes}} to <b>life-long</b> and one-shot <b>learning,</b> especially in remembering rare events. We present a large-scale life-long memory module for use in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i. e., without the need to reset it during training. Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple convolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence and recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains the ability to remember and do <b>life-long</b> one-shot <b>learning.</b> Our module remembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it can successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, <b>life-long</b> one-shot <b>learning</b> in recurrent {{neural networks}} on a large-scale machine translation task.

This decision is made based on the entropy reduction caused by observations. As a result, our approach scales with the size of the environment and not with the length of the trajectory.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{optimised}} multi-modal dialogue agent for interactive learning of visually grounded word meanings {{from a human}} tutor, trained on real human-human tutoring data. Within a <b>life-long</b> interactive <b>learning</b> period, the agent, trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), {{must be able to}} handle natural conversations with human users and achieve good learning performance (accuracy) while minimising human effort in the learning process. We train and evaluate this system in interaction with a simulated human tutor, which is built on the BURCHAK corpus [...] a Human-Human Dialogue dataset for the visual learning task. The results show that: 1) The learned policy can coherently interact with the simulated user to achieve the goal of the task (i. e. learning visual attributes of objects, e. g. colour and shape); and 2) it finds a better trade-off between classifier accuracy and tutoring costs than hand-crafted rule-based policies, including ones with dynamic policies.

40|$|Dealing with {{unexpected}} situations {{is a key}} challenge faced by autonomous robots. This paper describes a promising solution for this challenge called "Surprise-Based Learning " (SBL). in which a learning robot engages in a <b>life-long</b> cyclic <b>learning</b> process consisting of "prediction, action, observation, analysis (of surprise) and adaptation". In particular, the robot always predicts the consequences of its actions, detects the surprises whenever {{there is a significant}} discrepancy between the prediction and the observed reality, analyzes the surprises for its causes and uses the critical knowledge extracted from analysis to adapt itself to the unexpected situations. SBL was successfully demonstrated on a physical modular robot which learned to navigate to desired goal-scenes with no prior knowledge about the environment, its sensors or the consequences of its actions. The scalability of SBL in the number of sensors and actions was evaluated to be reasonable for a physical robot, while adaptation to unexpected situations such as hardware failure and goal transfer was very successful. 1...|$|R

40|$|Different ways {{by which}} we come to know something, are usefully applied to the {{pedagogy}} of medical education. Jürgen Habermas described three “ways” of knowing. These are empirical-analytic knowing (data collection), historical-hermeneutic knowing (understanding of meanings), and self-reflective critical knowing. These “ways” of knowing have an epistemological basis, which is able to be traced from the classical and medieval epochs of philosophical thought. Given that doctor-patient interactions have a fundamental basis in morality, the three “ways” of Habermas {{can be applied to}} the pedagogy of medical education. This fosters a clinical practice characterised by <b>life-long</b> self-reflective <b>learning.</b> The beneficent action which follows, based upon self-reflection, and impelling the clinician to act as an agent of change, benefits both patients and clinicians. Understanding the importance of Habermas’ three “ways” of knowing, impels a re-balancing of undergraduate and post-graduate medical education curricula, which would foster a progression from empirical-analytic data collection, through historical-hermeneutic understanding of meanings, to self-reflective critical knowing as a life-long objective in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe "Policy Improvement with Path Integrals" (PI 2) [25] and "Covariance Matrix Adaptation [...] Evolutionary Strategy" [8] are {{considered}} to be state-of-the-art in direct reinforcement learning and stochastic optimization respectively. We have recently shown that incorporating covariance matrix adaptation into PI 2 - which yields the PI CMA 2 algorithm [...] enables adaptive exploration by continually and autonomously reconsidering the exploration/exploitation trade-off. In this article, we provide an overview of our recent work on covariance matrix adaptation for direct reinforcement learning [22 - 24], highlight its relevance to developmental robotics, and conduct further experiments to analyze the results. We investigate two complementary phenomena from developmental robotics. First, we demonstrate PI CMA 2 's ability to adapt to slowly or abruptly changing tasks due to its continual and adaptive exploration. This is an important component of <b>life-long</b> skill <b>learning</b> in dynamic environments. Second, we show on a reaching task how PI CMA 2 subsequently releases degrees of freedom from proximal to more distal limbs as learning progresses.

40|$|International audienceLife-long robot {{learning}} in the high-dimensional real world requires guided and structured exploration mechanisms. In this developmental context, we investigate here {{the use of the}} recently proposed PI 2 -CMAES episodic reinforcement learning algorithm, which is able to learn high-dimensional motor tasks through adaptive control of exploration. By studying PI 2 -CMAES in a reaching task on a simulated arm, we observe two developmental properties. First, we show how PI 2 -CMAES autonomously and continuously tunes the global exploration/exploitation trade-off, allowing it to re-adapt to changing tasks. Second, we show how PI 2 -CMAES spontaneously self-organizes a maturational structure whilst exploring the degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of the motor space. In particular, it automatically demonstrates the so-called proximo-distal maturation observed in humans: after first freezing distal DOFs while exploring predominantly the most proximal DOF, it progressively frees exploration in DOFs along the proximo-distal body axis. These emergent properties suggest the use of PI 2 -CMAES as a general tool for studying reinforcement learning of skills in <b>life-long</b> developmental <b>learning</b> contexts...|$|R
40|$|People {{tracking}} is {{an important}} yet challenging task for mobile robots operating in populated environments and interacting with humans. What makes this problem difficult is that human behavior is complex and hard to predict. However, motion of people, {{the rate at which}} people appear and where they appear are not random but strongly place-dependent and follow patterns that are engendered by the environment. In this paper we make use of such information for the purpose of people tracking. Concretely, we learn a probabilistic representation, called spatial affordance map, to spatially ground activity events acquired by observing people in the environment. This representation is a non-homogeneous spatial Poisson process for which we derive expressions for <b>life-long</b> Bayesian <b>learning.</b> We show how the spatial affordance map can be used to compute refined probability distributions over hypotheses in a multi-hypothesis tracker and to make better, place-dependent predictions of human motion. In experiments with real data from a laser range finder, we demonstrate how both extensions lead to more accurate tracking behavior. The system runs in real-time on a typical desktop computer...|$|R
