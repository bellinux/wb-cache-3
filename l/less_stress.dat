5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
25|$|Women {{normally}} outlive men, {{and this}} was as true in pre-industrial times as today. Theories for this include smaller bodies (and thus <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> on the heart), a stronger immune system (since testosterone acts as an immunosuppressant), and less tendency to engage in physically dangerous activities.|$|E
25|$|With {{a distant}} deadline, procrastinators report {{significantly}} <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, {{this relationship is}} reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits, to the extent that, overall, procrastinators suffer more stress and health problems.|$|E

25|$|Its main {{advantage}} is that it accelerates aircraft more smoothly, putting <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> on their airframes. Compared to steam catapults, EMALS also weighs less, is expected to cost less and require less maintenance, and can launch aircraft that are heavier or lighter. It uses far less fresh water, reducing the need for energy-intensive desalination.|$|E
25|$|Designed {{primarily}} {{to replace the}} Soyuz spacecraft, Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure lifting body design and as spaceplane with small wings. In either case, the craft {{would have been able}} to glide into the atmosphere at an angle that produces much <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> on the human occupants than the current Soyuz. Kliper was intended to be designed to be able to carry up to six people and to perform ferry services between Earth and the International Space Station.|$|E
25|$|When Barcelona signed Argentinian forward Diego Maradona in 1982, Spanish league {{restrictions}} meant Simonsen was {{to compete}} with Maradona and Bernd Schuster for only two places allowed for foreign players in each starting line-up. Simonsen {{saw it as a}} personal insult, and asked Barcelona for his contract to be annulled. He made a shock move to English Second Division side Charlton Athletic for £300,000 in October 1982. He rejected offers from Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur, in order to play for a club with <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> and attention. Despite scoring nine times in 16 appearances, the club had trouble funding his transfer and wages after three months, and he was put up for sale. Simonsen then chose to return to his childhood club VB in 1983.|$|E

500|$|The O-Bahn {{track is}} made of concrete; it is {{elevated}} above ground because of the poor quality of alluvial soils along the River Torrens, which frequently move due to their high level of plasticity. Concrete pylons were cast into the ground to ensure stability, {{to a depth of}} up to four metres. On top of the pylons are concrete sleepers on which the track runs. 5,600 pylons were drilled in place to support 5,600 sleepers and 4,200 prefabricated L-shaped track pieces, sited at 12-metre (40-ft) intervals. The width of both tracks, sitting on the sleepers, is [...] The O-Bahn's concrete tracks were narrower and lighter than those of the initially proposed light rail development, and put <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> on the land. The concrete components were precast and then laid onto piers.|$|E
500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune {{believed}} Nolan and Goyer {{managed to}} [...] "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions," [...] and that Nolan takes the series {{out of the}} [...] "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" [...] the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he [...] "felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating", citing this film as {{the best of the}} live-action Batman films. In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the Chicago Reader, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the [...] "hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche". Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was [...] "the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for". Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on [...] "the story and character" [...] with <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> on [...] "high-tech action".|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the drive sprocket to maintain constant chain tension.

2500|$|Telecommuting {{is another}} way {{organizations}} can help reduce stress for their workers. Employees defined telecommuting as [...] "an alternative work arrangement in which employees perform tasks elsewhere that are normally done in a primary or central workplace, {{for at least some}} portion of their work schedule, using electronic media to interact with others inside and outside the organization." [...] One reason that telecommuting gets such high marks is that it allows employees more control over how they do their work. Telecommuters reported more job satisfaction and less desire to find a new job. Employees that worked from home also had <b>less</b> <b>stress,</b> improved work/life balance and higher performance rating by their managers.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{learning}} and memory improve after consuming carbohydrates. There {{are two kinds of}} carbohydrates that you can consume, simple and complex. [...] Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption. [...] Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly. [...] Good sources of complex carbohydrates are whole-grain breads, pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, and potatoes. [...] It is recommended that you consume more complex carbohydrates because consuming complex carbohydrates will cause the level of sugar in your bloodstream to be more stable which will cause <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> hormones to be released. [...] Consuming simple carbohydrates may cause the levels of sugar in your bloodstream to rise and fall which can cause mood swings.|$|E

30|$|The second shed-load type arises as a {{consequence}} of interaction of intermittency of wind power with other disturbances. The sign of the second element can be either positive or negative as it depends on the network operating condition and the criticality of the post-disturbance state.

2500|$|Instead {{came the}} idea of having {{multiple}} groups of cylinders and driven wheels mounted in one rigid frame. A [...] "duplex" [...] version of a 4-8-4 would be a 4-4-4-4, with the eight driving wheels split into two groups of four, each with its own set of cylinders and valve gear. The reciprocating mass of both sets would be substantially less than the single set on the 4-8-4, since they would be under <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> and gentler piston thrusts. The cylinders could be smaller yet have larger, more efficient valves. The most obvious tradeoff was that in Baldwin's proposed design, the rigid wheelbase was longer since the second set of cylinders had to be between the two sets of drivers. This was sufficiently concerning for many roads, for whom current locomotives were taxing enough, to reject the duplex idea.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{original}} applications, {{as people in}} the business world have been introduced to HR or the [...] "Three Principles" [...] (as the core understanding is known), they have started to bring these ideas into the business world they have come from. The approach has been introduced to people in medicine, law, investment and financial services, technology, marketing, manufacturing, publishing, {{and a variety of other}} commercial and financial roles. It has been reported anecdotally to have had significant impact in the areas of individual performance and development, teamwork, leadership, change and diversity. According to HR/Three Principles adherents, these results flow naturally as the individuals exposed to the ideas learn how their thoughts have been creating barriers to others and barriers to their own innate creativity, common sense, and well being. As people learn how to access their full potential more consistently, HR adherents say, they get better results with less effort and <b>less</b> <b>stress</b> in less time.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles of the Bahá'í Faith is that religious truth is not absolute but relative. The teachings of the different world religions are seen as 'facets of one truth'. Bahá'í texts include statements of a dualist nature (e.g. in the Book of Certitude) and statements of a monist nature (e.g. in the Seven Valleys and the Hidden Words). Moojan Momen, in his translation of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's commentary on the tradition [...] "I was a Hidden Treasure", states that the differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that what is observed. This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. God is unknowable. For man {{it is impossible to}} get any knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative. Theological differences about God are caused by imagination, as God's essence can not be described. <b>Less</b> <b>stress</b> is given to metaphysical subjects, while [...] ethics and social action are emphasized.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, {{within these}} phrases are {{distinct}} patterns of stress, which helps to differentiate individual {{elements within the}} phrase, such as a noun from an article.

Furthermore, in verb phrases, auxiliary verbs are <b>less</b> <b>stressed</b> than main verbs. This can be seen in (4).|$|R
50|$|This {{knowledge}} of how hoop stress increased with diameter, and how stresses were independent of drum length led to his invention of the Fairbairn-Beeley and his five-tube boilers, where a single large diameter shell was replaced by multiple smaller, and <b>less</b> <b>stressed,</b> shells. Eventually this {{would lead to the}} near-universal adoption of water-tube boilers with small tubes for high pressures, replacing the older fire-tube designs.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} studies have been done on {{optimism}} and psychological well-being. One study conducted by Aspinwall and Taylor (1990) assessed incoming freshmen on a range of personality factors such as optimism, self-esteem, locus of self-control, etc. It was found that freshmen who scored high on optimism before entering college were reported to have lower levels of psychological distress than their more pessimistic peers, while controlling for the other personality factors. Over time, the more optimistic students were <b>less</b> <b>stressed,</b> <b>less</b> lonely, and less depressed than their pessimistic counterparts. Thus, this study suggests a strong link between optimism and psychological well-being.|$|R
