The club's biggest top-flight win was an 8–0 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa. Chelsea's biggest loss was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953. Officially, Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945.

War is an incentive for states to raise tax and strengthen states capacity. Historically, many taxation breakthroughs took place during the wartime. The introduction of income tax in Britain was due to the Napoleonic War in 1798. US first introduce income tax during Civil War.Taxation is constraint by the fiscal and <b>legal</b> <b>capacities</b> of a country.

25|$|According to English Common Law, which {{developed}} from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held {{at the time of}} marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> which were removed only in 1965. In the 16th century, the Reformation in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers Jane Anger, Aemilia Lanyer, and the prophetess Anna Trapnell. English and American Quakers believed that men and women were equal. Many Quaker women were preachers. Despite relatively greater freedom for Anglo-Saxon women, until the mid-19th century, writers largely assumed that a patriarchal order was a natural order that had always existed. This perception was not seriously challenged until the 18th century when Jesuit missionaries found matrilineality in native North American peoples.|$|E
25|$|Although Hatch had {{suggested}} that Mason might get as many as 1,400 released Union prisoners, a mix-up with the parole camp books and suspicion of bribery from other steamboat captains caused the Union officer {{in charge of the}} loading, Captain George Williams, to place every man at the parole camp on board Sultana, believing the number to be less than 1,500. Although Sultana had a <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of only 376, by the time she backed away from Vicksburg on the night of April 24, 1865, she was severely overcrowded with 1,978 paroled prisoners, 22 guards from the 58th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, 70 paying cabin passengers, and 85 crew members. Many of the paroled prisoners had been weakened by their incarceration in the Confederate prison camps and associated illnesses but had managed to gain some strength while waiting at the parole camp to be officially released. The men were packed into every available space, and the overflow was so severe that in some places, the decks began to creak and sag and had to be supported with heavy wooden beams.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Bjelke-Petersen played {{what turned}} out to be a key role in the {{political}} crisis that brought down the Whitlam government. When Labor Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly in June 1975, Bjelke-Petersen requested from the Labor Party a short list of three nominees, from which he would pick one. The ALP refused to supply such a list, instead nominating Mal Colston, an unsuccessful Labor candidate in the 1970 election, whom Bjelke-Petersen duly rejected. On 3 September Bjelke-Petersen announced that he had selected political novice Albert Field, a long-time ALP member who was critical of the Whitlam government. Field's appointment was the subject of a High Court challenge and he took leave in late 1975. During this period, the Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser declined to allot a pair to balance Field's absence. This gave the Coalition control over the Senate. Fraser used that control to obstruct passage of the Supply Bills through Parliament, denying Whitlam's then-unpopular government the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> to appropriate funds for government business and leading to his dismissal as Prime Minister. During the tumultuous election campaign precipitated by Whitlam's dismissal by Sir John Kerr, Bjelke-Petersen alleged that Queensland police investigations had uncovered damaging documentation in relation to the Loans Affair. This documentation was never made public and these allegations remained unsubstantiated.|$|E

500|$|From a legal perspective, Hungarian {{society was}} divided into freemen and serfs, but {{intermediate}} groups also existed. All freemen had the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> to own property, to sue and to be sued.

Among freemen living in lands attached to a fortress, the [...] "castle warriors" [...] served in the army, and the [...] "castle folk" [...] cultivated the lands, forged weapons or rendered other services. All freemen were to pay a special tax, the [...] "pennies of freemen" [...] to the monarchs. With a transitory status between freemen and serfs, peasants known as udvornici were exempt from it. Serfs theoretically lacked the legal status available to freemen, but in practice {{they had their own}} property: they cultivated their masters' land with their own tools, and kept 50–66percent of the harvest for themselves. StephenI's laws and charters suggest that most commoners lived in sedentary communities which formed villages. An average village was made up of no more than 40 semi-sunken timber huts with a corner hearth.

40|$|The factual, {{not only}} formal {{capacity}} of {{local governments to}} appeal to borrowed resources is, considering the current conditions, a prerequisite for ensuring {{economic and social development}} of local communities. In this paper we intend to position the main theoretical and empirical evidences on local governments' indebtedness capacity, mainly focusing on its sizing according to Romanian regulatory framework. With respect to previous research, the issue approached is one of great interest as it has not been, in the Romanian literature on local public finances, subject to a separate analysis of proportions. The undertaken analysis comprises a quantitative dimension, based on processed data from the consolidated general budget of Romanian local governments for 2007 - 2009, in permanent conjunction with monitoring and analysis of the involved qualitative aspects. To ensure the relevance of the research results, the analysis undertaken refers to the legal framework in function throughout the considered period of time, without involving the legislative changes operated in mid- 2010. The main conclusions drawn from our analysis indicate that, considering the current Romanian socio-economic environment, under the impact of specific factors of different nature, the <b>legal</b> indebtedness <b>capacity</b> is far from being well valued, thus bringing its benefits to local communities development. This conclusion is valid from a global perspective as well as for different types of local communities. This appears to be inconsistent with the permanently claimed need to fund important local public investments, mainly in infrastructure, indicating, despite the high <b>legal</b> indebtedness <b>capacity,</b> the lack of factual access to borrowed resources. We suggest, therefore, to introduce the concept of effective indebtedness capacity, the result of a particularized correlation for different local governments between <b>legal</b> indebtedness <b>capacity</b> and the manifestation of several factors with specific action and we intend to contribute, by future research, to its measurement. <b>legal</b> indebtedness <b>capacity,</b> effective indebtedness capacity, local governments, local public debt, local autonomy...|$|R
