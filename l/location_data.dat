It tracks the number of mentions an individual or company receives on digital properties and analyzes factors such as influence, sentiment and language. The influence of a Twitter handle is measured based on followers, mentions, and retweets Sentiment is assessed as positive, negative or neutral. Viralheat's Human Intent tool labels social media participants as leads if it assesses that {{they are likely to}} consider purchasing a corresponding product. The software's analytics and monitoring can be filtered by <b>location.</b> <b>Data</b> from Viralheat can be exported into PDF files, Excel spreadsheets or onto a publicly available dashboard.|$|E

25|$|Large private telelocation or AVL systems send {{data from}} GPS {{receivers}} in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems {{are used for}} businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which don't justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate <b>location</b> <b>data</b> from vehicles to their dispatching center. <b>Location</b> <b>data</b> is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a central controller or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the GPS receiver is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted dispatch system which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted dispatch system may check {{the location of a}} call for service and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher's choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.|$|E

40|$|The <b>location</b> {{check-in}} <b>data,</b> developing {{along with}} social network, are considered as user-generated crowd-sourcing geospatial data. With massive data volume, abundance in contained information, and high up-to-date status, the check-in data provide a new data source for geographic information service represented by location-based service. However, {{there is a}} significant quality issue regarding to crowd-sourcing data, which has a direct influence to data availability. In this paper, a data quality analysis approach is designed for the <b>location</b> check-in <b>data</b> and a check-in data uncertainty model is proposed. First of all, the quality issue of <b>location</b> check-in <b>data</b> is discussed. Then, according to the characteristics of check-in <b>data,</b> a <b>location</b> check-in <b>data</b> quality analysis and data processing approach is proposed, using certain standard dataset as reference to conduct an affine transformation for the check-in dataset, during which the RANSAC algorithm is adopted for outlier elimination. Subsequently, combining GIS data uncertainty theory, an uncertainty model of processed check-in data is set up. At last, using <b>location</b> check-in <b>data</b> obtained from jiepang. com as experimental data and selected navigation data as <b>data</b> standard, multiple <b>location</b> check-in <b>data</b> quality analysis and uncertainty modeling experiments are conducted. By comprehensive analysis of experimental results, the feasibility of proposed <b>location</b> check-in <b>data</b> quality analysis and process approach and the availability of proposed uncertainty model are verified. The novel approach is proved to have a certain practical significance {{to the study of the}} quality issue of crowd-sourcing geographic data. * Corresponding author...|$|R

500|$|Living in {{the very}} {{southern}} end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick winter coat that moulted each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a [...] diastema, and as being relatively broad with a narrow occiput. Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a dewlap on its neck as the mountain zebra does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and individuals of the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibit limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no <b>location</b> <b>data</b> was recorded. The female specimens used in the study were larger than the males on average.|$|E
