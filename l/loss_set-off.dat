40|$|As of 1 January 2012, the Dutch {{corporate}} {{income tax}} (‘CIT’) system provides for international juridical double tax relief (‘DTR’) under a mechanism referred to in Dutch tax practice as the ‘base exemption for foreign business profits’ 1 (author’s translation). 2 The newly introduced DTR mechanism replaces the Dutch-style ‘tax exemption with progression method’ 3 {{in the area of}} corporate taxation regarding proceeds derived from foreign-source business activities. The rationale for this legislative shift, according to the Dutch tax legislator, is to arrive at an augmented level of converged tax treatment for corporate taxpayers carrying on business operations abroad either directly (i. e., through a permanent establishment; ‘PE’) or indirectly (i. e., through a subsidiary). 4 One of the introduced tax effects is that current losses suffered by resident corporate taxpayers from business activities carried on abroad through a PE are no longer taken into account for CIT calculation purposes. The tax legislator implicitly justifies its amendments by labeling the immediate horizontal cross-border <b>loss</b> <b>set-off</b> possibilities as available under the former DTR mechanism as a “cash flow advantage” granted to Dutch resident corporate taxpayers. That characterization reveals an underlying normative consideration. We do away with an ‘advantage’ to arrive at a taxing system devoid of anomalies at this point. The Dutch tax legislator suggests an improvement. But has he not in fact created a disadvantage? And, by doing that infringes upon the spirit of the internal market within the European Union (‘EU’) in the process...|$|E
40|$|In-line and {{reflective}} semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA and RSOA) can be effectively utilized as external optical intensity modulators. However the limited modulation bandwidth affects the application possibilities, because next generation access networks desire high transmission speed. Bandwidth enhancement {{can be achieved}} by means of optical equalization thanks to the chirping characteristics of semiconductor optical amplifier. The limited modulation transfer function can be combined with the converted phase modulation transfer function. Investigation of optical filter with optimal slope is a crucial challenge in this approach. The presented simulations describe the slope dependence of the modulation band. The model can take into account the different type of realizable optical filters. However there is a trade-off between modulation efficiency and modulation bandwidth due to the extra insertion <b>loss</b> of the <b>set-off</b> optical filter. In the paper theoretical and simulation investigations are presented with the result of improved modulation bandwidth...|$|R
