50|$|The Church had {{accumulated}} wealth from donations by patrons. That capital was too significant to <b>let</b> <b>sit</b> idle, {{so it was}} lent to reputable borrowers, generally at 5 percent interest. Thus, elite land owners had access to credit to finance acquisitions of property and infrastructure improvement, with multi-decade mortgages. Many elite families’ consumption patterns were such that they made little progress on paying off the principal and many estates were very heavily mortgaged to the Church. Estates were also burdened with liens on their income {{to pay for the}} salary of the family’s capellan, a priest guaranteed an income to say masses for the founder of the capellanía.|$|E

5000|$|When {{using the}} ‘’’acid {{digestion}} method’’’ scientists add sulfuric acid to the sample, <b>let</b> <b>sit</b> for 48 hours, centrifuge, mix with distilled water, and mount on slide for examination. Because this method has {{the least amount}} of steps, it gives scientists faster and less expensive results.The ‘’’Soluene-350 method’’’ is used only for freshwater samples. The sample is mixed with formalin, rinsed and centrifuged 3 times with distilled water. Then the pelletis removed from the test tube and added with 8ml of Soluene-350, incubated at 50 degrees Celsius for 2 hours, centrifuged again, and finally mounted on a slide. The ‘’’Enzymatic method’’’ is used for tissue samples and because of the use of enzyme chemicals it is considered an environmentally safe method and has a smaller percentage of damaging the diatoms collected than that of the acid digestion method. [...] Concentrated nitric acid and Proteinase-K, or peroxide, are added to the sample for 12 hours, centrifuged twice, rinsed with distilled water, and then mounted on a slide with Naphrax. Using this form of extraction, observers can use a light microscope when examining the results.The ‘’’Membrane Filter method’’’ is used when there is a presence of either damaged diatoms in the sample (result of pollutants) or inorganic materials. The blood of the victim is taken and filtered through Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate and nitrocellulose membranes with decreasing pore sizes. The membranes are then dried and filtered with distilled water. After being dried the pieces of membrane that filtered the blood are examined for diatoms and pollen grains.‘’’Colloidal Silica Gradient Centrifugation method’’’ can be used with liver and lung samples. The tissue collected is added to saline solution, centrifuged at a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius, and then added to distilled water to then be mounted on a slide and observed. ‘’’Dry Ash method’’’ can only be applied to a bone marrow sample. Five grams of marrow is taken from a victim to be placed in a nitric acid solution and then bunt in a furnace allowing the release of diatoms to then be analyzed.|$|E

40|$|Author: Hancock Laboratory Methods ### REFERENCE: Hanock and Benz. 1986. BBA. 860 : 699 - 707. ### PURPOSE: Derivitization of amino {{groups to}} remove the {{positive}} charge characteristics of the protein, for example to determine the importance of amino groups to a protein's function. ### MATERIALS: 1. Purified protein at approximately 0. 25 mg/ml (diluted in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 3 mM Na azide, and, for membrane proteins, 0. 1 % SDS). - Commercial stock solution of acetic anhydride or succinic anhydride. - Microbeaker and flea bar. - pH microprobe to monitor pH during acetylation reaction. - 5 N NaOH. ### METHOD: 1. Dilute protein sample to correct concentration as described above. - Using microbeaker and flea bar, set up reaction mix {{so that it is}} stirring with the pH probe inserted and pH is monitored. pH must be maintained constantly at between 6. 0 and 7. 0, or irreversible denaturation of the protein may result. Addition of the acetic anhydride causes a transient drop of pH, which must be corrected with 20 µl volumes of 5 N NaOH. - Add 2 µl acetic anhydride from stock solution every 10 min for 60 min, then <b>let</b> <b>sit</b> for another 60 min at room temp. During this time, maintain pH as described above. - Dialyse vs. 1 litre of 35 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 3 mM Na-azide, 0. 1 % SDS for 4 hrs, then dialyse again in the same overnight. - Residual amino groups can be assayed with trinitro benzene sulphonate (TNBS) ...|$|E
40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory The {{best way}} to fix a sample for {{electron}} microscopy is to follow a procedure developed and proven by others. If this is not possible, this method will produce good fixation for most tissues. ### Solutions: 1. 100 mM PIPES, pH 7. 0 - 7. 4 or 50 mM Cacodylate, pH 7. 4 - 2 mM MgSO 4 - 0. 25 M sucrose - 1 - 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde - 50 mM Cacodylate, pH 7. 4 (note: cacodylate contains arsenic, so handle carefully) - 1 % OsO 4 - 1 % Uranyl acetate in water - *Osmium tetroxide and glutaraldehyde can be purchased from the EM lab*. ### Procedure: **Safety notes**: Glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide fix cells by cross-linking their proteins via the amine groups (glutaraldehyde) or their phospholipids (osmium). They are harmful to living cells and you should avoid exposure to them. I prefer to use them in a fume hood. Fixatives are volatile and can fix any cells they contact - other cells in the lab or in respiratory epithelium, corneas, epithelial cells on your hand, etc. The good {{thing is that the}} fixatives cannot penetrate tissue more than a millimeter or two, so exposure to them rarely causes any permanent damage. The plastics used to embed the tissue are more dangerous than the fixatives and many of the components of the plastic have been shown to cause cancer in rats or mice. During the embedding process the plastics are dissolved in solvent that can easily carry the plastic into your tissues and through any plastic gloves you may wear. In contrast to fixatives, whose actions are immediate and apparent, the consequences of exposure to the plastic resins are not apparent for years. Please be careful with the plastic resins prior to polymerization into hard blocks. Plastic-containing waste solutions should be kept in a container in the EM lab. 1. Fix tissue by immersion in buffered glutaraldehyde at room temp. Fix for a minimum of 30 - 60 min. Cells can be left in this solution for days if desired. - Rinse tissue out of glutaraldehyde and into 50 mM Cacodylate, pH 7. 4. Generally 2 - 4 washes of 10 min/wash is plenty to remove most of the glutaraldehyde. - Postfix tissue in the osmium tetroxide solution for 30 - 60 min. This can be done at room temperature or at 4 ûC (on ice). - Rinse the tissue in water and stain with 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 min to overnight. This helps stain the tissue and seems to help to preserve some structures. If you happen to postfix with osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer (which is commonly done), be certain to wash well with water. Uranyl acetate + phosphate forms uranyl phosphate, which forms large electron-dense crystals that will ruin the beauty of your tissue. - Dehydrate the tissue by immersion in increasing concentrations of acetone or ethanol (I prefer acetone). Try 25 % acetone/water, 50 % acetone/water, 75 % acetone/water/ and at least 2 - 3 changes in 100 % acetone. Times vary but 2 - 10 min/acetone solution is fine. - Prepare the plastic mixture. The plastics used vary from one investigator to another. One of the most popular and most stable resins is [Epon]([URL] - Another popular resin is Spurr resin, mixed as follows: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") - 7. Mix 1 / 3 plastic with 2 / 3 acetone (by volume) and add tissue to the plastic. <b>Let</b> <b>sit</b> for 1 - 2 hrs or overnight (with the container top removed to let acetone gradually evaporate). - 8. Transfer to 2 / 3 plastic + 1 / 3 acetone (by volume) for 2 - 3 hrs. - 9. Transfer to 100 % plastic and <b>let</b> <b>sit</b> for ~ 1 hr. - 10. Remove old plastic and add fresh plastic to the cells in an appropriate mold. Label the sample, and put in an embedding oven at 60 - 80 degrees for 1 - 2 days. By that time the blocks should be polymerized and ready for sectioning. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|E
