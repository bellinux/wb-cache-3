25|$|Despite this, the Ro.43 {{had serious}} problems. Its <b>lightweight</b> <b>structure</b> {{meant that it}} was too {{delicate}} for buoyancy at sea, and it had poor sea-handling qualities.

25|$|Rockets as a {{group have}} the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any type of engine; and this helps {{vehicles}} achieve high mass ratios, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a <b>lightweight</b> <b>structure</b> and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20g.|$|E
25|$|The tube frame design, using {{steel core}} and {{perimeter}} columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material, created a relatively <b>lightweight</b> <b>structure</b> that would sway more {{in response to}} the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.|$|E

500|$|The {{project was}} {{daunting}} in its physical complexity. TenFab Design, a tensioned fabric trade-show booth design company from Evanston, Illinois, worked nearly five months with numerous structural engineers on plans before construction could begin. As an example {{the inclusion of}} a [...] projector challenged the dynamics of the <b>lightweight</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] The centennial committee initiated discussions with TenFab in November 2008 at which time the company requested a six-month design and assembly schedule, but the company was not hired until late February 2009.

500|$|The city of Ravenna, Italy, {{had served}} as {{the capital of the}} Western Roman Empire after Milan from 402 and the capital of the {{subsequent}} kingdoms of Odoacer and of Theodoric until Justinian's reconquest in 540. The octagonal Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, begun under Theodoric in 525, was completed under the Byzantines in 547 and contains a terracotta dome. It may belong to a school of architecture from 4th and 5th century Milan. The building is similar to the Byzantine Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the later Chrysotriklinos, or throne hall and palace church of Constantinople, and it would be used as the model for Charlemagne's palace chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle. Hollow amphorae were fitted inside one another to provide a <b>lightweight</b> <b>structure</b> for the dome and avoid additional buttressing. It is [...] in diameter. The amphorae were arranged in a continuous spiral, which required minimal centering and formwork but was not strong enough for large spans. The dome was covered with a timber roof, which would be the favored practice for later medieval architects in Italy although it was unusual at the time.|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{remoteness}} of Arctic locations, construction {{cost penalties}} increase tremendously with increased weight of construction {{materials and equipment}} and there is thus demand for <b>lightweight</b> <b>structures</b> and weight reduction in Arctic maritime vessels and installations. Ships and <b>lightweight</b> <b>structures</b> are usually made of high-strength steels, which allow use of thinner steel plates for the same load-bearing capacity.

40|$|EN 13790 {{suggests}} some quasi-steady-state overheating indicator {{to evaluate}} the summer comfort in buildings. However, only few countries included this method in the rules primarily because the method still needs major improvement.

This paper discusses {{the first step in}} the study: an evaluation of the applicability of the overheating indicator for <b>lightweight</b> <b>structures</b> and an analysis of the effect of several building characteristics and the climate on the calculation parameters of the quasi-steady-state method. To this end the authors performed quasi-steady-state calculations and multi-zone energy simulations with TRNSYS.
