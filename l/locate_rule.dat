Drawing upon data from interviews {{across a range of}} employees, we analyse aspects of emotion, identity and power. Adopting a constructionist perspective we use a method of discourse analysis to analyse how participants constructed emotions according to tacitly understood rules regarding appropriate emotional displays. These rules were made visible through an examination of the participants' positioning strategies as they described emotional experiences. Our findings suggest that, rather than an institutionally held level of appropriate articulations of emotionality, there was a role-related, socially <b>located</b> <b>rule</b> system linked to separate categories of teachers, managers and administrative employees. The contribution of the article is threefold. First, we use in-depth case data from 44 semi-structured interviews to analyse how teachers and managers/administrators in a UK-based further education (FE) college constructed emotions according to certain rules (informal norms) regarding appropriate kinds of emotional displays. Teachers acknowledged and upgraded labelled emotions, while managers and administrators denied and downgraded accounts of emotional experiences. Second, we discuss the implications of talk about emotion for the (re) production of teachers' and managers/administrators' work identities.

The most crucial part in Car Plate Recognition System is plate location. This is because if the system fails to detect {{the location of the}} car plate, then the whole system is a failure because recognition can only be done after successful plate location. Therefore, this research is mainly focused on plate location. In short, this research is entitled Car Plate Detection System. This system will focus on 4 major parts of pre-processing phase which are Image Enhancement using median filtering, Thresholding using global threshold value, Feature Extraction using thresholding, and Plate Location using rule-based conditions. This system was developed as a prototype to fulfill the requirement and prove the correctness of the algorithms used. The data or car plates used are strictly typical Malaysian civilian car plate numbers. Image is acquired using digital camera and fed to the system which thresholds the image to convert it into the binary image.

40|$|Abstract: The variant {{execution}} {{time of the}} update operation repair rules in a parallel and distributed environment is highly affected {{by the way the}} rules and tables settled in a database in according to whether they were partitioned or not. The wellknown partitioning methods in the database were succeeded to reduce the response time of update operations since they expeditiously execute the update operation affecting different sites of partitions. These methods are mortgaged by the determination of the type of partitioning during the design state of the system fixing all sites of the partitioned tables and distributed rules to different nodes. Although distribution and partitioning have these merits, it still face some restrictions since it may be time consuming for the distributed system to <b>locate</b> the proper <b>rule</b> and the partition of data, which fulfill the requirement of repair update operation. This paper proposes virtual rule partition method. This method has more advantages over the classical methods because it allows us to reduce the total cost or the total response time consumed by repair update operations using horizontal partitioned tables...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{reveals the}} underappreciated role of {{liability}} rules in constitutional law. Conventional constitutional theory insists that constitutional entitlements require, by their nature, property rule protection. That is, {{they can only}} be taken with the owner 2 ̆ 7 s consent; nonconsensual takings can be enjoined. This Article shows that many constitutional values are in fact protected by liability rules, which allow for forced transfers followed by payment of compensation. Substantive entitlements form one dimension of constitutional law. The various {{ways in which they}} are protected against transfers form the second dimension. The full picture of constitutional law only emerges from looking at both. The Article <b>locates</b> liability <b>rules</b> in diverse areas such as the First Amendment prior restraint doctrine, the Third Amendment, Fourth Amendment search and seizure rules, the Due Process Clauses, the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Thus constitutional theory 2 ̆ 7 s insistence on property rule protection fails account for how some constitutional values are actually protected. This Article develops a richer understanding of the relationship between constitutional remedies and constitutional entitlements. The transaction cost perspective on constitutional law reveals previously unnoticed connections between various doctrines, and provides a new criterion for evaluating their strengths and weakness. This Article also presents new evidence that the Constitution does not require property rule protection and can be satisfied with liability rules. It shows that the oft-overlooked Third Amendment explicitly mandates property rule protection for the entitlement it defines. This property rule, together with the Takings Clause 2 ̆ 7 s explicit liability rule, shows that for other entitlements the Constitution does not require any particular form of protection. The one explicit property rule and the one explicit liability rule define the second dimension in constitutional lawrengths and weakness...|$|R
