40|$|AbstractAlgorithm of <b>linear</b> <b>references</b> {{detection}} {{is based}} on statistical processing of reflected pulse altimeter signal. It is assumed that <b>linear</b> <b>references</b> formed from two underlying surfaces and differences between statistical distribution of pulse amplitude depend {{on the type of}} underlying surface. The differences allow us to decide which type of surface reflects our signal. To do this we use the method of maximum posteriori probability. This paper describes how to determine the position of <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> and what the accuracy of this process is. The minimum of maximum posteriori probability is closely connected with <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> position. We use this fact to detect the <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> position.

40|$|In this study, a {{procedure}} {{to test the}} <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> air kerma rate of 192 Ir wires using a well-type chamber is described. The method {{is based on a}} special lead insert with a 1 cm acrylic aperture that provides a differential response of the well chamber. The wire is considered divided into 1 cm parts. Using an external positioning system it is possible to place every part of the wire at the aperture position in the lead insert allowing measurement of each 1 cm making up the length of the wire. By means of a set of equations that take into account the contribution of all parts of the wire, in all possible positions, the relative <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> air kerma rate is obtained. The estimated uncertainties of this procedure are about 2 to 3 %. So, a well chamber and the specific inserts allow the measurements of total and <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> air kerma rate for 192 Ir wires...|$|R

50|$|Consequently, a major {{limitation}} of <b>linear</b> <b>referencing</b> is that specifying points {{that are not}} on a linear feature is troublesome and error-prone, though not entirely impossible. Consider for example a ski lodge located 100 meters {{to the right of}} the road, traveling north. The <b>linear</b> <b>referencing</b> system can be extended by specifying a lateral offset, but the absolute location (i.e. coordinates) of the lodge cannot be determined unless coordinates are specified for the road; that process is prone to error particularly on curved roads.|$|E

This paper presents an evaluation of the Cross Streets Profile based upon lab and field tests using commercial street network databases in the County of Santa Barbara.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} using a model reference adaptive control approach to control nonlinear systems. We consider the controller design and stability analysis {{associated with these}} type of adaptive systems. Then we discuss the use of model reference adaptive control algorithms to control systems which exhibit nonlinear dynamical behaviour using {{the example of a}} Duffing oscillator being controlled to follow a <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> model. For this system we show that if the nonlinearity is “small” then standard <b>linear</b> model <b>reference</b> control can be applied. A second example, which is often found in synchronization applications, is when the nonlinearities in the plant and reference model are identical. Again we show that <b>linear</b> model <b>reference</b> adaptive control is sufficient to control the system. Finally we consider controlling more general nonlinear systems using adaptive feedback linearization to control scalar nonlinear systems. As an example we use the Lorenz and Chua systems with parameter values such that they both have chaotic dynamics. The Lorenz system is used as a reference model and a single coordinate from the Chua system is controlled to follow one of the Lorenz system coordinates. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>referencing</b> (also called linear {{reference}} system or <b>linear</b> <b>referencing</b> system or LRS), {{is a method}} of spatial referencing, in which the locations of features are {{described in terms of}} measurements along a linear element, from a defined starting point, for example a milestone along a road. Each feature is located by either a point (e.g. a signpost) or a line (e.g. a no-passing zone). The system is designed so that if a segment of a route is changed, only those milepoints on the changed segment need to be updated.Linear referencing is suitable for management of data related to linear features like roads, railways, oil and gas transmission pipelines, power and data transmission lines, and rivers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>referencing</b> {{systems can}} also be made to be both very precise and very {{accurate}} {{at a much lower}} cost than is needed to collect latitude and longitude coordinates with high accuracy, especially when the goal is sub-meter accuracy. This is highly dependent upon the width of the linear feature, its centerline, and the visibility of the landmarks and markers that are used to define linear reference offsets.|$|E
40|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>references</b> are {{guaranteed}} {{to be free from}} aliases. This is a strong property that simplifies reasoning about programs and enables powerful optimisations, {{but it is also a}} property that is too strong for many applications. Notably, lock-free algorithms, which implement protocols that ensure safe, non-blocking concurrent access to data structures, are generally not typable with <b>linear</b> <b>references</b> because they rely on aliasing to achieve lock-freedom. This paper presents LOLCAT, a type system with a relaxed notion of linearity that allows an unbounded number of aliases to an object as long as at most one alias at a time owns the right to access the contents of the object. This ownership can be transferred between aliases, but can never be duplicated. LOLCAT types are powerful enough to type several lock-free data structures and give a compile-time guarantee of absence of data-races when accessing owned data. In particular, LOLCAT is able to assign types to the CAS (compare and swap) primitive that precisely describe how ownership is transferred across aliases, possibly across different threads. The paper introduces LOLCAT through a sound core procedural calculus, and shows how LOLCAT can be applied to three fundamental lock-free data structures. It also discusses a prototype implementation which integrates LOLCAT with an object-oriented programming language. Structured AliasingUPSCALEUPMAR...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Multichannel syllabic {{compressors}} {{have not}} yet shown clear advantages for speech perception. New multichannel syllabic nonlinear processors are designed and evaluated in this study to test whether they enhance speech perception scores. DESIGN: Nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant words have been processed in real time with two syllabic nonlinear methods in nine different frequency channels: 1) 30 dB of speech information is mapped into the residual dynamic range (DR) of the subjects with hearing impairment using either compression or expansion; 2) speech levels above the rms level are compressed with a ratio of 3 : 1, and input levels below the rms level are mapped into the reduced DR of the subjects. The overall frequency spectrum of speech is tilted with more high-frequency output for this condition. The two syllabic nonlinear processors were compared with two <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> systems (one of them with the same spectral tilt as the second nonlinear condition) for seven hearing-impaired subjects. RESULTS: On average, the syllabic nonlinear processors show scores similar {{to one of the}} linear systems. The <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> with tilt has, on average, 3 % higher scores, mainly due to improved vowel identification.

40|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{irradiated}} with electrons or {{electromagnetic waves}} (gamma-rays) undergoes chain scission, and the macroradicals generated form branched molecules {{as shown by}} size-exclusion chromatography coupled with laser scattering. Information on the irradiation modification of the molecular structure of PP is still limited in the literature, especially {{with respect to the}} controlled generation of long-chain branches (LCB). This paper examines the branching structure of an electron-beam- and gamma-irradiated polypropylene. In general, appropriate irradiation conditions lead to the formation of LCB, which were analyzed in detail by rheological means. At smaller doses, the zero shear-rate viscosities η 0 of the electron-beam-irradiated PP lie above the values for the unmodified PP with the same M w but are distinctly lower than the <b>linear</b> <b>reference</b> at higher doses. This result can be interpreted by the change from a starlike to a treelike branching topography. The gamma-irradiation leads to η 0 values smaller than those of the <b>linear</b> <b>reference,</b> giving rise to the assumption of the generation of treelike molecules. The measurements of the elongational viscosities support this molecular picture. An explanation of these findings is given along the line that the electron irradiation conducted at dose rates higher than the gamma-irradiation creates a larger concentration of short-living radicals, which will partially annihilate each other, but favor the growth of some long branches, which get branched themselves at higher doses. The structure of the gamma-irradiated samples is postulated to consist of a blend of linear and treelike molecules. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R
