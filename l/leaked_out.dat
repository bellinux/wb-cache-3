5|$|News of the Qurayzah's {{supposed}} {{renunciation of}} the pact with Muhammad <b>leaked</b> <b>out,</b> and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were {{reinforced by the}} movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.|$|E

Johnson, a former U.S. Army officer, to take over strike operations. Johnson immediately established a camp atop Bull Hill, which overlooked the town of Altman. He ordered that fortifications be built, a commissary stocked and the miners be drilled in maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|A {{friend of}} Edward, Prince of Wales for over 20 years, in 1891 he {{attended}} a house party at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, where he {{took part in a}} game of baccarat {{at the behest of the}} prince. During the course of two nights' play he was accused of cheating, which he denied vehemently. After news of the affair <b>leaked</b> <b>out,</b> he sued five members of the host family for slander; the Prince of Wales was called as a witness. The case was a public spectacle, widely reported in the UK and abroad, but the judgement went against Gordon-Cumming and he was ostracised from polite society.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project <b>leaked</b> <b>out</b> through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and <b>leaked</b> <b>out</b> of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was {{an attempt}} by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal <b>leaked</b> <b>out.</b> Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E
