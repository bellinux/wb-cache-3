40|$|Although CAPD {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} as routine treatment for uremic patients, recurrent peritonitis still remains a limiting factor. Since 1978 to {{reduce the incidence of}} the peritonitis mainly due to exogenous origin, we have used a doublebag system with satisfactory results. To make easier the connection and to reduce the chances of contamination during the bag-exchange manoeuvre, we designed "Closter", a new closed sterile connection. This device consists of a needle mounted on a <b>Luer</b> <b>cap,</b> and protected by a folding plastic cover. A thin diaphragm {{at the end of the}} needle closes the entire system. During the connecting manoeuvre, the cap is first locked to a branch of the Y adaptor connected to the Tenckhoff catheter, then the needle, driven with a slight pressure through the diaphragm and the antiseptic chamber, puts the system in line...|$|E
40|$|Background Many cancer {{patients}} receive a {{central venous catheter}} or port system prior to therapy to assure correct drug administration. Even appropriate hygienic intervention maintenance carries the risk of contaminating the middle port (C-port) of a three-way cock (TWC), a risk that increases {{with the number of}} medical interventions. Because of the complexity of the cleaning procedure with disconnection and reconnection of the standard <b>luer</b> lock <b>cap</b> (referred as “intervention”), we compared <b>luer</b> lock <b>caps</b> with a “closed access system” consisting of a luer access split septum system with regard to process optimization (work simplification, process time), efficiency (costs) and hygiene (patient safety). Methods For determination of process optimization the workflow of an intervention according to the usual practice and risks was depicted in a process diagram. For determining the actual process costs, we analyzed use of material and time parameters per intervention and used the process parameters for programming the process into a simulation run (n = 1000) to determine the process costs as well as their differences (ACTUAL vs. NOMINAL) within the framework of a discrete event simulation. Additionally cultures were carried out at the TWC C-ports to evaluate possible contamination. Results With the closed access system, the mean working time of 5. 5 minutes could be reduced to 2. 97 minutes. The results for average process costs (labour and material costs per use) were 3. 92 € for <b>luer</b> lock <b>caps</b> and 2. 55 € for the closed access system. The hypothesis test (2 -sample t-test, CI 0. 95, p-value< 0. 05) confirmed the significance of the result. In 50 reviewed samples (TWC’s), the contamination rate for the <b>luer</b> lock <b>cap</b> was 8...|$|R
40|$|Needleless {{connectors}} {{are being}} increasingly used for {{direct access to}} intravascular catheters. However, the potential for microbial contamination of these devices and subsequent infection risk is still widely debated. In this study the microbial contamination rate associated with three-way stopcock <b>luers</b> with standard <b>caps</b> attached was compared to those with Y-type extension set luers with Clearlink® needleless connectors attached. Fifty patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery who required a central venous catheter (CVC) {{as part of their}} peri- and postoperative management were studied for microbial contamination of CVC luers following 72 hrs in situ. Each patient's CVC was randomly designated to have either the three-way stopcocks with caps (control patients) or Clearlink® Y-type extension sets (test patients). Prior to, and following each manipulation of the three-way stopcock luers or Clearlink® devices, a 70 % (v/v) isopropyl alcohol swab was used for disinfection of the connections. The microbial contamination of 393 luers, 200 with standard caps and 193 with Clearlink® attached, was determined. The internal surfaces of 20 of 200 (10 %) three-way stopcock <b>luers</b> with standard <b>caps</b> were contaminated with micro-organisms whereas only one of 193 (0. 5 %) luers with Clearlink® attached was contaminated (P < 0. 0001). These results demonstrate that the use of the Clearlink® device with a dedicated disinfection regimen reduces the internal microbial contamination rate of CVC luers compared with standard caps. The use of such needle-free devices may therefore reduce the intraluminal risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and thereby supplement current preventive guidelines. © 2006 The Hospital Infection Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} contamination rate of luers of central venous catheters (CVCs) with either PosiFlow® needleless connectors or standard caps attached was investigated. The efficacy of 70 % (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 0. 5 % (w/v) chlorhexidine in gluconate 70 % (v/v) isopropyl alcohol and 10 % (w/v) aqueous povidone-iodine to disinfect the intravenous connections was also assessed. Seventy-seven patients undergoing cardiac surgery who required a CVC {{as part of}} their clinical management were randomly allocated either needleless connectors or standard caps. Patients were also designated to receive chlorhexidine/alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or povidone-iodine for pre-CVC insertion skin preparation and disinfection of the connections. After 72 h in situ the {{microbial contamination}} rate of 580 luers, 306 with standard caps and 274 with needleless connectors attached, was determined. The microbial contamination rate of the external compression seals of 274 needleless connectors was also assessed to compare the efficacy of the three disinfectants. The internal surfaces of 55 out of 306 (18 %) <b>luers</b> with standard <b>caps</b> were contaminated with micro-organisms, whilst only 18 out of 274 (6. 6 %) luers with needleless connectors were contaminated (P< 0. 0001). Of those needleless connectors disinfected with isopropyl alcohol, 69. 2 % were externally contaminated with micro-organisms compared with 30. 8 % disinfected with chlorhexidine/alcohol (P< 0. 0001) and 41. 6 % with povidone-iodine (P< 0. 0001). These results suggest that the use of needleless connectors may reduce the microbial contamination rate of CVC luers compared with the standard cap. Furthermore, disinfection of needleless connectors with either chlorhexidine/alcohol or povidone-iodine significantly reduced external microbial contamination. Both these strategies may reduce the risk of catheter-related infections acquired via the intraluminal route. © 2003 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
