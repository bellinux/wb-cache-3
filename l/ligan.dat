40|$|ObjectiveTo {{test whether}} nonalcoholic hepatic {{steatosis}} sensitizes carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) -induced liver injury, {{and to assess}} the therapeutic effect of Chinese medicine extracts of Dangfei <b>Liganning</b> capsules () and their potential underlying mechanisms. MethodsMale Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet to induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or a normal diet (N). Eight weeks later, a nonlethal dose of CCl 4 was applied intraperitoneally. From the start, HF-CCl 4 rats were administered daily Dangyao extracts (D), Dangfei <b>Liganning</b> capsules (DF), or Diammonium Glycyrrhizinate (G) intragastrically. Rats were sacrificed 48 h after CCl 4 administration. In addition to serum biochemistry, liver histopathology was observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and oil red O staining, and hepatic levels of triglyceride (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), caspase- 3 activation and cytochrome P 450 (CYP 2 E 1) expression were assessed. ResultsThere was almost no response to the nonlethal dose of CCl 4 in the N control group. However, the HF group demonstrated massive steatosis, and elevated levels of serum ALT and AST, liver MDA, CYP 2 E 1, and caspase- 3 activation, whereas the levels of GSH and SOD were significantly decreased. All indexes assessed were dramatically worse in the HF-CCl 4 group compared to the HF group, {{in addition to the}} more severe steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and inflammatory infiltration apparent in the centrilobular area. The medicines we tested affected the pathological changes in HF-CCl 4 rats to differing degrees: DF and G led to improvements in all of the above examined indexes, including an obvious improvement in histopathology, and DF improved serum ALT and MDA levels more markedly than G, whereas D extracts produced only mild liver injury attenuation. ConclusionLiver with NAFLD is more sensitive to hepatotoxicity; furthermore, the disrupted balance of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant defense contributes to the underlying mechanisms. Dangfei <b>Liganning</b> capsules potentially decrease this toxic susceptibility and alleviate liver injury in non-alcoholic fatty liver...|$|R
40|$|Tebuconazole {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{utilized}} triazole pesticides in agriculture. Its stability is highly affected by complexation with metals. Moreover, it creates more or less stable complexes with essential elements that become unavailable to plants. In the system with overbundant tebuconazole, an inert (very stable) complex with Zn was found. Elimination voltammetry wit linear scan was used for revealing of the electrode processes on the mercury surface.

40|$|AbstractThe ATP-dependent K+ channel (KATP) was {{purified}} {{from the}} inner mitochondrial membrane and reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes. KATP activity was inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and ADP, but activated by low concentrations (up to 200 μM) of ADP. p-Diethylaminoethylbenzoate (DEB) acted as a KATP opener: at micromolar concentrations, it reversed inhibition by ATP and ADP and it also prevented KATP rundown. Pelargonidine, extracted from flowers of Pelargonium, reduced spontaneous activity of KATP channels and diminished their potentiation by DEB. Their opposite action on KATP corresponded with their opposite redox properties in reactions with free radicals: DEB behaved as an electron donor, whereas pelargonidine acted as an electron acceptor. We hypothesize that thiol groups on mitoKATP are targets for redox-active <b>ligans...</b>|$|R

The fatty acids in sesame seed oil included palmitic acid (16 : 0; 7.0 - 12.0 %), palmitoleic acid (16 : 1; less than 0.5 %), stearic acid (18 : 0; 3.5 - 6.0 %), oleic acid (18 : 1; 35 - 50 %), linoleic acid (18 : 2; 35 - 50 %), linolenic acid (18 : 3; less than 1 %), and eicosenoic (20 : 1; less than 1 %). The nonfat portion (1 – 2  wt%) of this oil contains <b>ligans</b> such as sesamin, sesamol, sesamolin, sesaminol, and episesamin. Sesame oil is unique due to its unusually high oxidative stability and anti-inflammatory property as compared to other edible oils (Kamal-Eldin et al. 1994).

40|$|Background/Aims: Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) could elicit oxidative stress, {{trigger and}} aggravate endothelium damage in several ischemic retinopathies including diabetic retinopathy (DR). The leaves of Eucommia ulmoides O., {{also referred to}} as Tu-chung or Du-zhong, have been used for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes, showing great antioxidant activity and anti-glycation activity. Lignans {{is one of the main}} bioactive components of Eucommia ulmoides. This study mainly investigated the effect of lignans treatment on AGEs-induced endothelium damage. Methods: MTT assay, Hoechst staining, and calcein-AM/ propidium iodide (PI) staining was conducted to determine the effect of lignans treatment on endothelial cell function in vitro. Retinal trypsin digestion, Evans blue assay, isolectin staining, and western blots were conducted to determine the effect of lignans treatment on retinal microvascular function in vivo. Western blot, protein immunoprecipitation (IP), MTT assays, and enzyme activity assay was conducted to detect the effect of <b>ligans</b> treatment on oxidative stress response. Results: Lignans protected retinal endothelial cell against AGEs-induced injury in vitro and diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction in vivo. Lignans treatment could regulate oxidative stress response in retinal endothelial cell line, retina, and liver.

This paper reports the isolation and full spectroscopic characterization of compounds 1 and 2 by NMR, UV, IR and MS data. Background Oxytropis is an important genus of the family Leguminosae, also known as “Locoweed”. The whole plant of Oxytropis myriophylla (Leguminosae) is an important Mongolian medicine, widely distributed in the southeast and northwest areas of China. It has traditionally been used to treat various diseases of rubella and influenza, applied to swelling and throat pain, together with different types of bleeding. Pharmacological research on this plant showed anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [1, 2]. Primary investigation on this plant has led to the isolation of several flavonoids, triterpene glycosides and <b>ligans</b> [3, 4], and in a continuation of studies on its minor constituents, the new natural product neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (1) and the known phloridzin (2), the first reported from the genus Oxytropis were obtained.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation focuses on the design, synthesis, photophysical characterization, and metal ion sensing properties of a conjugated polymer and enhancing the photophysical and acid-base properties of Ru(mtpy) (tpycooh) - a transition metal complex. All the synthesized compounds were based on terpyridine <b>ligans.</b> The objective of the first project is to investigate the effect of positioning the terpyridine unit in the meta position, which does not allow extended conjugation through the polymer backbone, on the metal ion sensing ability of this conjugated Poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) material. A novel PPV containing meta-linked pendant terpyridine ligand was synthesized. Absorption and fluorescence studies indicated that Fe 2 + was coordinate in 1 : 2 ratio to the terpyridyl groups and Cu 2 + bound in 1 : 1 ratio to the terpyridyl groups. A more selective response was observed for this meta-derivative compared to para derivative. Cu 2 + selectively quenches the fluorescence of the polymer, with slight interference from Zn 2 +, Cd 2 + and Hg 2 +. These ions induce partial fluorescence quenching accompanied by a broad new emission band due to the complex formation between the terpyridine (tpy) ligand and the metal ion. The objective of the second project is to synthesize a new mixed-ligand comllex [Ru(mtpy) (tpycooh) ](la), where mtpy = 42 ̆ 7 - methy 1 - 2, 22 ̆ 7 : 62 ̆ 722 ̆ 2 - terpyridine and tpycooh = 2, 22 ̆ 7 : 62 ̆ 7, 22 ̆ 2 - terpyridine- 42 ̆ 7 - carboxylic acid. This new complex incorporated mixed ligands to enhance the photophysical propertics of Ru(II) terpyrine complex like its bypyridine analog. The methyl group on tpy acts as an electron-donating group (EDG) while COOH group on tpy acts as an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The new enhanced complex showed redshifted Metal Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) band in the absorption and emission spectra, larger quantum yield and improved redox properties over the non-enhanced model terpyridine-Ru compex. These results implied {{that the combination of}} mixed ligands of electron donating and electron withdrawing substituents on tpy ligand improved the luminescence and the photophysical properties of the complex...|$|R

However, to date, CD 8 + T-cell characterization is performed {{under the assumption}} that cells of a particular type are identical, and not acknowledging their heterogeneous nature. It has recently been proven, in many different studies, that cells do differ quite significantly and can drive different responses. In order to characterize the heterogeneity of vaccine-induced CD 8 + T cells, we performed gene expression profiling and protein characterization at the single-cell level, after delivery of influenza RNA-based vaccine (SAM (H 1) (A/California/ 07 / 2009 (H 1 /N 1)) or MF 59 TM -adjuvanted Monovalent Influenza Vaccine (aMIV (A/California/ 07 / 2009 (H 1 N 1)). CD 8 + T cells were isolated from mouse splenocytes, stained with MHC class-I HA 533 - 554 pentamer and either single-cell sorted, lysed, and processed for reverse transcription- quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of 96 individual genes, or characterized by mass cytometry for the expression of 32 biomarkers. In parallel, the functionality of the CD 8 + T cells was assessed in an in vivo cytotoxic assay. CD 8 + T cells induced by the SAM(H 1) vaccine showed increased antigen-specific lysis activity in vivo, compared to cells induced by aMIV. Ex vivo, higher frequencies of HA 533 - 541 -pentamer+ CD 8 + T cells were induced by SAM(H 1) compared to aMIV at all time points tested, and pentamer+ cells were single-cell sorted for gene expression analysis. Refined analysis of TEFF (il- 7 rα [...] cd 62 l-), TEM (il- 7 rα +- cd 62 l-) and TCM (il- 7 rα +- cd 62 l+)) highlighted significant differences in gene expression profiles between and within the vaccines. Overall, SAM(H 1) induced mostly TEM cells, while aMIV induced equal number of TCM and TEM cells. Both vaccines induced few TEFF cells, and only CD 8 + T cells from SAM(H 1) showed TEFF terminally differentiated short-lived effector cells (SLEC) (klrg 1 + il- 7 rα - cd 62 lcxcr 3 - tbet+ blimp- 1 +). Ten days after the second immunization, TEM cells, unlike TCM cells, showed a transcriptional difference between the vaccines. SAM(H 1) and aMIV, with up regulation of members of the cytolytic/Fas <b>Ligans</b> (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Superfamily pathways, respectively. A specific molecular signature of 12 differentially expressed genes (DEG) was identified and further evaluated at the protein expression level using mass cytometry. Most of the proteins corresponding to the 12 DEG list were also expressed. The aim {{of this study was to}} apply state-of-the-art technology platforms to the study of gene and protein expression by immune cells in response to vaccination. With this approach, we identified distinct HA 533 - 541 - pentamer+ CD 8 + T-cell subsets elicited by RNA- and adjuvanted protein-based vaccines, which revealed a particular biomarker signature associated to each vaccine. In conclusion, our results showed that these novel technology platforms might be extremely useful for the in-depth characterization of immune responses to vaccination and can be extended to other medical applications...|$|R
