40|$|In this paper, a {{new kind}} of {{hierarchical}} tube with a negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) is proposed. The first <b>level</b> <b>tube</b> is constructed by rolling up an auxetic hexagonal honeycomb. Then, the second <b>level</b> <b>tube</b> is produced by substituting the arm of the auxetic sheet with the first <b>level</b> <b>tube</b> and rolling it up. The Nth () <b>level</b> <b>tube</b> can be built recursively. Based on the Euler beam theory, the equivalent elastic parameters of the NPR hierarchical tubes under small deformations are derived. Under longitudinal axial tension, instead of shrinking, all levels of the NPR hierarchical tubes expand in the transverse direction. Using these kinds of auxetic tubes as reinforced fibers in composite materials would result in a higher resistance to fiber pullout. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the design of fiber reinforced hierarchical bio-inspired composites with a superior pull-out mechanism, strength and toughness. An application with super carbon nanotubes concludes the paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify and {{validate}} a noise simulation tool called Dose Tutor (VAMP GmbH) in terms of level and texture of the simulated noise. By adding artificial noise to measured computed tomography (CT) raw data, a scan acquired with a lower dose (mAs) than the actual one can be simulated. A homogeneous polyethylene phantom and an anthropomorphic chest phantom were scanned for different mAs <b>levels,</b> <b>tube</b> voltages, slice thicknesses and reconstruction kernels. The simulated noise levels were compared with the noise levels in real transverse slice images actually acquired with corresponding mAs values. In general, the noise comparisons showed acceptable agreement in magnitude (< 20 % deviation in pixel standard deviation). Also, the calculated noise power spectra were similar, which indicates that the noise texture is correctly reproduced. In conclusion, this study establishes that the Dose Tutor might be a useful tool for estimating the dose reduction potential for CT protocols...|$|R
500|$|Most of the C's route {{had been}} {{constructed}} with tunnels [...] or [...] in diameter, {{smaller than the}} [...] diameter that had been adopted as the standard for the CCE and other deep <b>level</b> <b>tube</b> lines. The smaller tunnel size restricted {{the capacity of the}} C's trains and, in 1912, the C published a bill for their enlargement. A separate bill was published at the same time by the London Electric Railway (LER), that included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C at Euston to the CCE's station at Camden Town. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable trains of each company to run over the route of the other, effectively combining the two separate railways. The reconstruction and extension works were postponed during World War I and did not begin until 1922. The C platforms and the tunnels between Euston and Moorgate were closed for the reconstruction on 8 August 1922. They reopened on 20 April 1924 along with the new link to Camden Town.|$|R

40|$|Air-to-refrigerant heat {{exchangers}} are a main component in air-conditioning and heat pump systems {{and are therefore}} a topic of major research focus. Such {{heat exchangers}}, mainly made of fin-and-tube and microchannels, use fins to augment the heat transfer area of the air-side. Recently {{it has been shown that}} finless designs using â‰¤ 1 mm hydraulic diameter bare tubes can deliver better air-side heat transfer performance than conventional heat exchangers. In current study, a novel air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger consisting of branching bare tubes with two different tube diameters is designed using fractal theory. The tubes in the first level split into two or more tubes at certain angles. The secondary tubes then merge back to the first <b>level</b> <b>tube</b> again. Principles of fractal design are applied to improve both air-side heat transfer area and heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics are numerically analyzed using a 3 -D model and compared with the bare tube heat exchangers. The novel finless heat exchanger based on fractals is found to have intrinsic advantage of increasing heat transfer performance and is a promising area for future investigations...|$|R
