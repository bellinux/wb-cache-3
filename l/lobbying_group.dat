5|$|The Canadian Unity Council {{incorporated}} a Montreal-based <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> called Option Canada with the mandate to promote federalism in Quebec. Option Canada received $1.6 million in {{funding from the}} Canadian Heritage Department in 1994, $3.35 million in 1995 and $1.1 million in 1996. The Montreal Gazette reported in March 1997 that the group also had other funds from undeclared sources. A Committee to Register Voters Outside Quebec was created to help citizens who had left Quebec before the 1995 vote register on the electoral list. The Committee handed out pamphlets during the referendum, including a form {{to be added to}} the list of voters. The pamphlet gave out a toll-free number as contact information, which was the same number as the one used by the Canadian Unity Council.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} strategic entry decisions in a two-player political transfer contest, i. e. the prize is a transfer from one <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> to another. The {{size of the}} transfer depends on the lobbying effort of the political active <b>lobby</b> <b>groups.</b> We show that the entry decision involves a trade-off between an influence loss and a strategic gain. The influence loss {{is related to the}} value of the foregone option to influence policymaking. The strategic gain is related to the strategic behaviour of the competitor. The existence of symmetric equilibria in which both <b>lobby</b> <b>groups</b> enter the contest and asymmetric equilibria in which only one <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> enters is proved. In the latter type of equilibrium, rent-seeking expenditures are substantially reduced, and the strategic behaviour of the active <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> acts as a barrier to entry by rewarding the competitor for staying out of the contest. Rent-seeking, entry, <b>lobby</b> <b>groups,</b> transfer contests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} {{empirical}} {{contributions to the}} literature, based on predictions generated by a <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> model. First, we investigate how environmental <b>lobby</b> <b>groups</b> affect the determination of environmental policy in rich and developing countries. Second, we explore the interaction between democratic participation and political (electoral) competition. The empirical findings suggest that environmental <b>lobby</b> <b>groups</b> tend to positively affect the stringency of environmental policy. Moreover, political competition tends to raise policy stringency, in particular where citizens’ participation in the democratic process is widespread. ...|$|R
5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have {{banded together to}} form the Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA). The 900-member group is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and {{is designed to provide}} what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy. It acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes, as a government <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> to deal with issues that affect the fast-food industry as a whole, and it provides group health, property and casualty insurance. In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E
5|$|The {{high school}} was the first new high school {{to be built in}} Saint Paul or Minneapolis since the 1970s. The school {{district}} was also not expecting to build another high school for 40 years after. As a result, the competition to name the school was fierce. The name Arlington High School was eventually chosen from a list of 85 suggestions. Two names, Arlington and Mechanic Arts, were quickly favored. Mechanic Arts was the initial favorite after alumni of the former school campaigned for the name to be reused after the first Mechanic Arts High School was closed down in 1976 after operating for 86 years. The alumni created a <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> and even enlisted the help of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a 1925 graduate of Mechanic Arts. However, the school board's policy of naming schools after local neighborhoods and street names eventually won out with the name Arlington being chosen in a 5-2 vote. The chosen school colors, blue and white, were the colors of Mechanic Arts.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, as {{national}} gasoline prices rose to over $4 a gallon, Bachmann became a leading Congressional advocate for increased domestic {{oil and natural gas}} exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the Outer Continental Shelf. She joined 10 other House Republicans and members of the media on a Congressional Energy Tour to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, and to Alaska. The trip was set up by Arctic Power, an Alaskan <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> that advocates for ANWR development. The purpose of the trip was to receive a first hand account of emerging renewable energy technologies and the prospects of increased domestic oil and natural gas production in Alaska, including ANWR.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led {{the launch}} of a 501(c)(4) <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> called FWD.us. The founders and {{contributors}} to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, {{a close friend of}} Zuckerberg. The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.|$|E

25|$|In 1957 Araúz co-founded Junta Nacional de la Comunion Tradicionalista, styled as formal body within {{mainstream}} Carlism; presiding it, he co-ordinated {{buildup of}} its local structures. He also co-founded Amigos de Maeztu, a monarchist <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> styled {{as a literary}} association, and became its vice-president {{and a member of}} Junta Directiva. His relations with Don Juan cooled; Araúz was disappointed by the claimant’s backtracking on his declared Traditionalist outlook, while Don Juan was disappointed by Araúz’s failure to bring all Carlists into his camp. Nevertheless, he remained a member of the juanist Consejo de la Corona and Consejo Privado (though not his Secretariado Político). As advisor to Don Juan he firmly opposed the democratic tendency. In 1961, when El Boletín de la Secretaria del Consejo Privado endorsed a monarchy based on parliamentary party politics, Araúz reacted with a letter to the Council’s head, José María Pemán, voicing his disgust. He presented the same stand in public debate. When ABC published a front-page piece of Rafael Calvo, pointing to a possible co-existence between liberalism and Catholicism, Araúz repelled the thesis. By mid-1960s Araúz discarded his anti-Francoism and pressed a collaborative strategy towards the regime, somewhat against a cautious approach favoured by Pemán and other juanista leaders.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009 Growth Energy, a <b>lobbying</b> <b>group</b> for {{the ethanol}} industry, {{formally}} requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{to allow the}} ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15%, from 10%. In October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver to allow up to 15% blends to be sold for cars and trucks with a model year of 2007 or later, representing about 15% of vehicles on the roads. In January 2011 the waiver was expanded to authorize use of E15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles. The EPA also decided not to grant any waiver for E15 use in any motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines because current testing data does not support such a waiver. According to the Renewable Fuels Association the E15 waivers now cover 62% of vehicles {{on the road in}} the country. In December 2010 several groups, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, filed suit against the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In August 2012 the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA ruling that the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{lobbying and}} corruption as {{alternative ways of}} dealing with regulatory obstacles. I propose a model where firms facing a costly regulation can bribe a rule-enforcing bureaucrat to get around it, lobby the government to reduce its impact, or do both. I then use a firm-level dataset of Eastern European enterprises to examine whether firms use membership in a <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> as a substitute for the bribe payments they make to rule-enforcing bureaucrats. The results indicate that firms who join <b>lobby</b> <b>groups</b> do not stop paying bribes to bureaucrats, and firms more impacted by corruption are no more likely to join a <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> than their counterparts. On the other hand joining a <b>lobby</b> <b>group</b> increases the likelihood of a firm bribing legislators and other rule makers, suggesting that lobbying introduces the possibility of state capture by allowing firms access to policy makers that they wouldn't otherwise have. ...|$|R
5000|$|The major {{concerns}} {{of the general public}} do not reflect those of the <b>lobbying</b> <b>groups.</b> This is why the <b>lobbying</b> <b>groups</b> feel that they must use the aforementioned tactics to sway the public a certain way on an issue that they may never knew existed. To the general public, crime is the number one problem in nation, followed by {{the state of the economy}} and international affairs. However, the main concern for <b>lobbying</b> <b>groups</b> in the past has been on health concerns. A study done in 2009 shows that over 20 percent of <b>lobbying</b> <b>groups</b> put health concerns such as disease prevention, Medicare, or prescription drugs as a top priority. This interest in health is followed closely by environmental concerns as well. [...] Although Grassroots lobbying has changed the stage of such advocacy, it is still concerning the same issues as other more traditional or direct lobbying.|$|R

A public enquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2-ton weight limit in place.|$|E
