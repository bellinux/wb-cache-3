5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with <b>long</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with <b>long</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair {{running up and down the}} staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, [...] "The Blonde in Black." ...|$|E

I mean none." [...] Weintraub explained to Maureen Orth of Newsweek in December 1976, [...] "I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Plant enjoyed {{great success}} with Led Zeppelin {{throughout}} the 1970s {{and developed a}} compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries, the Who singer Roger Daltrey, Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and Jim Morrison of the Doors. With his mane of <b>long</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the [...] "god of rock and roll" [...] or [...] "rock god" [...] archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing {{his hands on his}} hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.|$|E

2500|$|In 1894, Rosetti also debuted as an epigrammatist in Graiul magazine, {{which was}} edited by Ilarie Chendi. A volume of such works {{came out that}} year, as Epigrame, and other volumes of verse {{followed}} in quick succession: Din inimă ("From the Heart", 1895), Sincere ("Sincere Ones", 1897), Duioase ("Soothing Ones", 1897). For a while, with Ludovic Dauș, he put out the literary magazine Doina—named after the folk singing style. To 1898, Rosetti {{was one of the}} regulars at literary gatherings in Fialcovsky Coffeehouse (also attended by his father), where he met Alexandru Macedonski, Mircea Demetriade, and actor Ion Livescu. The latter recalled that Rosetti was [...] "as gentle and soft as his poetry, as thin and as supple as a reed, with <b>long</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and dreamy eyes". Macedonski also co-opted him to write for Literatorul. While not connected to the Symbolist movement, he was an early and episodic influence on young Symbolists such as Eftimiu and Ion Minulescu. This did not refer just to his poetic standard, but also to his lifestyle: as Eftimiu recalls, they were envious of his physical beauty and sentimental adventures. Although Eftimiu believes that Rosetti was wholly indifferent to Baudelaire and Verlaine, he in fact revered the latter. In 1935 he recalled that he chanced upon aging and [...] "stiff drunk" [...] Verlaine while walking around Paris: [...] "It seemed to me that even his inebriation was something grand and beautiful".|$|E
2500|$|Just {{as in the}} {{previous}} match, the Arena Mexico crowd was decidedly [...] "pro rudo" [...] for the first Luchas de Apuestas match, supporting La Amapola as she faced off against [...] "La Más Bonita" [...] Estrellita in the third match of the night. Throughout most of the match the crowd chanted for La Amapola and booed when Estrellita was in control of the match. Estrellita was seconded by La Máscara for this important match while La Amapola had Ephesto in her corner for the night, neither corner man was based on any existing, ongoing storylines. Estrellita won the first fall in quick fashion when she used the La Casita cradle hold to get the three count. In the second fall La Fleur Lethal, as La Amapola is also known, got the upper hand and quickly evened the score between the two. The third fall was longer, more drawn out than the first two falls combined and saw La Amapola almost win on more than one occasion. In the end Estrellit trapped her opponent in an armbar submission hold and managed to keep La Amapola away from the ring ropes. With no way of escaping La Amapola reluctantly gave up and lost the third fall and thus the match. A visibly infuriated La Amapola stood {{in the center of the}} ring as all of her <b>long</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> was shaved off as per the match stipulation, she even grabbed the clippers and did part of the shaving herself. After the haircut Estrellita displayed La Amapola's hair, celebrating a victory that seemed to not be popular with the Arena Mexico crowd but was expected.|$|E
60|$|Brayle {{was beyond}} recall, {{galloping}} easily along, {{parallel to the}} enemy and less than two hundred yards distant. He was a picture to see! His hat had been blown or shot from his head, and his <b>long,</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> rose and fell with the motion of his horse. He sat erect in the saddle, holding the reins lightly in his left hand, his right hanging carelessly at his side. An occasional glimpse of his handsome profile as {{he turned his head}} {{one way or the other}} proved that the interest which he took in what was going on was natural and without affectation.|$|E

However, if her hair is damaged in some way, she will either disappear entirely or be stripped of her powers and beauty.|$|R
6000|$|Mistress Thankful {{remained}} at the wall until her lover had disappeared. Then she turned, a mere lissom shadow in that uncertain light, and glided under the eaves of the shed, and thence {{from tree to tree}} of the orchard, lingering a moment under each as a trout lingers {{in the shadow of the}} bank in passing a shallow, and so reached the farmhouse and the kitchen door, where she entered. Thence by a back staircase she slipped to her own bower, from whose window half an hour before she had taken the signalling light. This she lit again and placed upon a chest of drawers; and, taking off her hood and a shapeless sleeveless mantle she had worn, went to the mirror, and proceeded to re-adjust a high horn comb that had been somewhat displaced by the captain's arm, and otherwise after the fashion of her sex to remove all traces of a previous lover. It may be here observed that a man is very apt to come from the smallest encounter with his dulcinea distrait, bored, or shame-faced; to forget that his cravat is awry, or that a <b>long</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> is adhering to his button. But as to Mademoiselle--well, looking at Miss Pussy's sleek paws and spotless face, would you ever know that she had been at the cream-jug? ...|$|E
