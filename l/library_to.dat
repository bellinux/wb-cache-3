5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template <b>Library</b> <b>to</b> the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, {{which led to the}} creation of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E

But one obstacle remained: the anti-trust crusading President Theodore Roosevelt, who had made breaking up monopolies a focus of his presidency.|$|E

40|$|Electronic serials (e-serials) {{have had}} a {{profound}} effect on technical and collection services in most academic libraries. E-serials circumvent traditional serials control practices; they force <b>libraries</b> <b>to</b> rely on publishers and third parties for archiving, and most pertinent to this volume, they relocate from <b>libraries</b> <b>to</b> e-serials providers the responsibility for measuring use. The disaggregation of “big deals” makes the collection and analysis of usage statistics especially important activities. Often uses of e-serials merely meet professorial requirements, rather than satisfy an information need, with no ability for <b>libraries</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the two. Furthermore, the cost-per-use calculation performed by <b>libraries</b> <b>to</b> determine whether subscription or article-on-demand purchasing is the more fiscally-prudent option is fraught with error. A new means of calculating these figures must be developed...|$|R
5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces into {{the lobby of the}} <b>library</b> <b>to</b> lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of Bel Air Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, the doors of the presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential <b>library</b> <b>to</b> see the casket.|$|E

A public memorial service was held in December 2006 and his cremated remains were buried outside of the library. Despite numerous offers, the library placed a two-year moratorium on getting a new cat. In January 2009, the library board voted to have a permanent prohibition against any other cats or pets at the <b>library,</b> <b>to</b> avoid problems for patrons with allergies.|$|E
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new <b>library</b> <b>to</b> the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E
5|$|George {{donated the}} royal <b>library</b> <b>to</b> the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation. He had no {{interest}} in reading, or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became Columbia University. The province of Georgia, founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.|$|E

5|$|In 1561, he {{finished}} his Historia General de las Indias and signed {{it over to the}} College of San Gregorio, stipulating that it could not be published until after forty years. In fact it was not published for 314 years, finally being done so in 1875. He also had to repeatedly defend himself against accusations of treason: someone, possibly Sepúlveda, denounced him to the Spanish Inquisition, but nothing came from the case. Las Casas also appeared as a witness {{in the case of the}} Inquisition against his friend Archbishop Bartolomé Carranza de Miranda, who had been falsely accused of heresy. In 1565 he wrote his last will, signing over his immense <b>library</b> <b>to</b> the college. Bartolomé de Las Casas died on July 18, 1566, in Madrid.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Andy overhears {{the captain}} of the guards, Byron Hadley, {{complaining}} about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison <b>library</b> <b>to</b> assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the warden begins using him to handle matters for himself and variety of people, including guards from other prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the <b>library</b> <b>to</b> feed the pigeons. While {{crossing}} a street {{a couple of blocks}} from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E

5|$|John of Tours or John de Villula (died1122) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Wells in England who moved the diocese seat to Bath.

After his consecration as bishop, he was either given or purchased Bath Abbey, a rich monastery, and then moved the headquarters of the diocese from Wells, to the abbey. He rebuilt the church at Bath, building a large cathedral that no longer survives. He gave a large <b>library</b> <b>to</b> his cathedral and received the right to hold a fair in Bath. Not noted for his scholarship, he died suddenly in 1122.|$|E
