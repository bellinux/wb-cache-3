In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
25|$|Wrapping copper or {{aluminium}} wire around branches and trunks allows the bonsai designer {{to create the}} desired general form and make detailed branch and leaf placements. When wire is used on new branches or shoots, it holds the branches in place until they <b>lignify</b> (convert into wood). The time required is usually 69 months or one growing season for deciduous trees, but can be several years for conifers like pines and spruce, which maintain their branch flexibility through multiple growing seasons. Wires are also used to connect a branch to another object (e.g., another branch, the pot itself) so that tightening the wire applies force to the branch. Some species do not <b>lignify</b> strongly, and some specimens' branches are too stiff or brittle to be bent easily. These cases are not conducive to wiring, and shaping them is accomplished primarily through pruning.|$|E

40|$|Light {{promotes}} {{the formation of}} <b>lignified</b> clements in Cucurbita popo. The nature of the response and the region perceptive of the light stimulus were determined. The effect of removal of the apex and its replacement with IAA, {{and the effects of}} IAA and hydrogen peroxide on the formation of lingnified clements in hypocotyl segments in culture, were studied. A light formed inhibitor of IAA-oxidase activity was detected, and investigations made of the effects of variations in light treatment, and treatment with gibberellic acid, on the level of this inhibitor and the amount of <b>lignified</b> tissue formed. Tosts for peroxidase distribution were carried out, and the effects of red and blue light on the formation of <b>lignified</b> tissue were studied. Experiments show that IAA has marked effects on the formation of <b>lignified</b> tissue. IAA appears, on the one hand, to initiate and promote the differentiation of prospective <b>lignified</b> clements, and yet, {{at the same time to}} inhibit lignification. It seems likely that light affects the phase of lignification, probably as a result of induced peroxide genesis, and possibly as a result (in some material at least) of the formation of an inhibitor of IAA-oxidase. The presence of a specific inhibitor of this kind may lead to an increase in the level of peroxidase free to function in lignin synthesis. It seems likely, therefore, that light promotion of the formation of <b>lignified</b> elements is connected with auxin metabolism, but whether light affects all the phases in the formation of mature elements that are affected by auxin, it is impossible to say.

The physiological processes during healing are revisited. Under sub-optimal humidities (65 % +/- 10) the depth of the <b>lignified</b> layer i. e. the thickness of the desiccated cell layers is affected by both cultivar and humidity. Some cultivars consistently failed to produce a <b>lignified</b> layer and for others the layer is often not continuous. The continuity of the <b>lignified</b> layer is more important for effectiveness of wound healing than the actual thickness. A method for assessing efficiency of wound healing based on assessing the continuity of <b>lignified</b> layers was developed, and called the lignification index. Would healing efficiency as measured by the lignification index was found to be a major factor for the shelf-life of sweet potato cultivars. Lignification of wounds correlates with reduced rate of weight loss and reduced susceptibility to microbial infection. A high dry matter content in cultivars correlated with a low lignification index. This relationship was consistent for 5 trials, including 34 cultivars...|$|R

50|$|Hedera helix is able {{to climb}} {{relatively}} smooth vertical surfaces, creating a strong, long lasting adhesion with a force of around 300 nN. This is accomplished through a complex method of attachment starting as adventitious roots growing along the stem {{make contact with the}} surface and extend root hairs that range from 20-400 μm in length. These tiny hairs grow into any small crevices available, secrete glue-like nanoparticles, and <b>lignify.</b> As they dry out, the hairs shrink and curl, effectively pulling the root closer to the surface.The glue-like substance is a nano composite adhesive that consists of uniform spherical nanoparticles 50-80 nm in diameter in a liquid polymer matrix. Chemical analyses of the nanoparticles detected only trace amounts of metals, once thought be responsible for their high strength, indicating that they are largely organic. Recent work has shown that the nanoparticles are likely composed in large part of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), which exist in other plant adhesives as well.The matrix portion of the composite is made of pectic polysaccharides. Calcium ions present in the matrix induce interactions between carboxyl groups of these components, causing a cross linking that hardens the adhesive.|$|E

Dry weight loss in alfalfa was similar for whole ruminal fluid and streptomycin-penicillin treatment, whereas that with streptomycin-penicillin treatment was significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 05) than that with cycloheximide treatment. In Bermuda grass, dry weight loss was significantly higher with streptomycin-penicillin than that with whole ruminal fluid and cycloheximide treatment, which were equal. Both peak load (Newtons) and peak stress were less (P ≤ 0. 05) for streptomycin-penicillin treatment than with other treatments in both forages. Fungi colonized the <b>lignified</b> ring in alfalfa and tended to reduce the width of cell walls in this tissue, but a large number of fungal penetrations through cell walls was not observed. In contrast, fungal rhizoids frequently penetrated into and through cell walls in the <b>lignified</b> ring of Bermuda grass, often expanding the pit fields between the cells. Ruminal fungi disrupt <b>lignified</b> tissues in stems, and their activity results in a weakened residue more amendable to physical degradation.

40|$|Lignin {{is a key}} {{structural}} component of plant cell walls that provides rigidity, strength, and resistance against microbial attacks. This hydrophobic polymer also serves {{a crucial role in}} water transport. Despite its abundance and essential functions, several aspects of lignin biosynthesis and deposition remain cryptic. Lignin precursors are known to be synthesized in the cytoplasm by complex biosynthetic pathways, after which they are transported to the apoplastic space, where they are polymerized via free radical coupling reactions into polymeric lignin. However, the lignin deposition process and the factors controlling it are unclear. In this study, the biochemical and developmental dependencies of lignification were investigated using a click-compatible monolignol analog, 3 -O-propargylcaffeyl alcohol (3 -OPC), which can incorporate into both in vitro polymerized lignin and Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Fluorescence labeling of 3 -OPC using click chemistry followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy enabled the detection and imaging of 3 -OPC incorporation patterns. These patterns were consistent with endogenous lignification observed in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems. However, the concentration of supplied monolignols influenced where lignification occurred at the subcellular level, with low concentrations being deposited in cell corners and middle lamellae and high concentrations also being deposited in secondary walls. Experimental inhibition of multiple lignification factors confirmed that 3 -OPC incorporation proceeds via a free radical coupling mechanism involving peroxidases/laccases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the presence of peroxide-producing enzymes determined which cell walls lignified: adding exogenous peroxide and peroxidase caused cells that do not naturally <b>lignify</b> in Arabidopsis stems to <b>lignify.</b> In summary, 3 -OPC accurately mimics natural lignification patterns in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems and allows for the dissection of key biochemical and enzymatic factors controlling lignification...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} show the {{potential}} of the approach and analyse its applicability, a variety of proof of concept studies have to be conducted. Since this cannot be carried out for all potential organisms, bamboo is used as an exemplary plant species. Bamboo seems to be an advantageous plant species, since it is already utilised in building, construction for plywood and composites [22]. Most importantly, bamboos belong to the fastest growing species in plant kingdom. For example, the bamboo species Dendrocalamus giganteus grows within one growth period of several months to its full length of up to 35  m with a diameter of around 30  cm. Subsequently, the culms <b>lignify</b> and incorporate silica resulting in the typical hard and strong bamboo material [23]. The woody stems exceed tree wood, brick or concrete in terms of compressive strength and can compete with steel when compared for tensile strength [24]. Finally, the outer surface of the hollow stem with longitudinal fibres and intersections shows the most favourable properties in terms of hardness [22, 24].|$|E

Bahar, Pishtaz and Sistan cultivars were employed as tolerant to drought and Shiraz and Yavaros as sensitive. Twelve plants from each wheat cultivar in three replications were compared in a completely randomized design. Seminal roots had four to five cortical cell layers, and typically one large central metaxylem and 5 ± 1 (in Bahar) to 7 ± 1 (in Yavaros) smaller and circularly arranged peripheral metaxylem vessels. Stellar cells were less <b>lignified</b> in adventitious roots, as compared with seminal roots, and mature xylem vessels of seminal roots of Shiraz and Yavaros cultivars had more <b>lignified</b> walls {{compared to the other}} cultivars of the 18 day old plants.
