40|$|Single {{crystals}} of undoped {{and zinc}} chloride doped <b>L-asparagine</b> <b>hydrate</b> were grown by solution method. Solubility of the grown crystals {{was measured by}} gravimetric method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that the grown single crystals crystallize in orthorhombic structure. The UV–Vis–NIR spectral {{studies were carried out}} to find the absorbance of the samples. The Vickers microhardress test was carried out to test the mechanical stability. The second Harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency of the crystals was found by Kurtz and Perry technique. Dielectric constant and loss factor of the samples were determined at various temperatures and frequencies...|$|E
