5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

500|$|Following active infection, herpes viruses {{establish}} a <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> in sensory and autonomic ganglia {{of the nervous}} system. [...] The double-stranded DNA of the virus is incorporated into the cell physiology by infection of the nucleus of a nerve's cell body. [...] HSV latency is static; no virus is produced; and is controlled {{by a number of}} viral genes, including latency-associated transcript.|$|E
500|$|Tuberculosis is {{classified}} {{as one of the}} granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts [...] aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. [...] However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. [...] Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in <b>latent</b> <b>infection.</b> Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles. [...] To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} this is found in a study {{published}} in Nature, which showed that mice with a <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> of a Herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. [...] Mice were infected with murine gammherpesvirus 68 (a member of the gammaherpesvirinae subfamily) and then challenged with Listeria monocytogenes. [...] The mice that had a <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine cytomegalovirus, a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which provided similar results. [...] However, infection with human herpes simplex virus type-1, a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection. [...] They also used Yersinia pestis (the causative agent of the Black Death) to challenge mice with a <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> of gammaherpesvirus 68, and they found the mice did have an increased resistance to the bacteria. The suspected {{reason for this is that}} peritoneal macrophages in the mouse are activated after <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in immunity, this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure. [...] It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), both of which lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.|$|E

Long {{regarded as an}} invariably fatal disease, there is increasing evidence that infection by T. b. gambiense {{can result in a}} wide range of clinical outcomes, including <b>latent</b> <b>infections,</b> which are long lasting infections with no parasites detectable by microscopy. The determinants of this clinical diversity are not well understood but could be due in part to parasite or host genetic diversity in multiple genes, or their interactions. A candidate gene association study was conducted in Côte d’Ivoire using a case-control design which included a total of 233 subjects (100 active HAT cases, 100 controls and 33 <b>latent</b> <b>infections).</b> All three possible pairwise comparisons between the three phenotypes were tested using 96 SNPs in 16 candidate genes (IL 1, IL 4, IL 4 R, IL 6, IL 8, IL 10, IL 12, IL 12 R, TNFA, INFG, MIF, APOL 1, HPR, CFH, HLA-A and HLA-G). Data from 77 SNPs passed quality control. There were suggestive associations at three loci in IL 6 and TNFA in the comparison between active cases and controls, one SNP in each of APOL 1, MIF and IL 6 in the comparison between <b>latent</b> <b>infections</b> and active cases and seven SNP in IL 4, HLA-G and TNFA between <b>latent</b> <b>infections</b> and controls. No associations remained significant after Bonferroni correction, but the Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate test indicated that there were strong probabilities that at least some of the associations were genuine. The excess of associations with <b>latent</b> <b>infections</b> despite the small number of samples available suggests that these subjects form a distinct genetic cluster different from active HAT cases and controls, although no clustering by phenotype was observed by principle component analysis.

2500|$|During <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> a viral RNA {{transcript}} inhibits {{expression of}} the herpes virus ICP0 gene via an antisense RNA mechanism. [...] The RNA transcript is produced by the virus and accumulates in host cells during latent infection; it is known as Latency Associated Transcript (LAT).

2500|$|Some viruses [...] {{are thought}} to {{establish}} a persistent (or <b>latent)</b> <b>infection</b> without symptoms, e.g., the varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr viruses, both of the herpes family. [...] Reactivation of an existing (dormant) viral infection has been suggested {{as a cause of}} acute Bell's palsy.

2500|$|HSVs may {{persist in}} a {{quiescent}} but persistent form known as <b>latent</b> <b>infection,</b> notably in neural ganglia. HSV-1 tends {{to reside in}} the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia, but these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> of a cell, HSVs express latency associated transcript (LAT) RNA. LAT regulates the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or [...] "outbreaks" [...] characteristic of non-latency. Whether or not recurrences are symptomatic, viral shedding occurs to infect a new host. A protein found in neurons may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate latency. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important transactivator of genes associated with lytic infection in HSV-1. Elements surrounding the gene for ICP4 bind a protein known as the human neuronal protein Neuronal Restrictive Silencing Factor (NRSF) or human Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor (REST). When bound to the viral DNA elements, histone deacetylation occurs atop the ICP4 gene sequence to prevent initiation of transcription from this gene, thereby preventing transcription of other viral genes involved in the lytic cycle. Another HSV protein reverses the inhibition of ICP4 protein synthesis. ICP0 dissociates NRSF from the ICP4 gene and thus prevents silencing of the viral DNA.|$|E

However, due to <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> (the [...] "window period" [...] in which an individual is infectious, but has not had time to develop antibodies) many cases of HIV seropositive blood were missed. The development of a nucleic acid test for the HIV-1 RNA has dramatically lowered the rate of donor blood seropositivity to about 1 in 3 million units.

2500|$|In humans, T. gondii {{is one of}} {{the most}} common parasites in {{developed}} countries; [...] serological studies estimate that 30–50% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with T. gondii, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country. [...] For example, previous estimates have shown the highest prevalence of persons infected to be in France, at 84%. [...] Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure, infection with T. gondii produces no readily observable symptoms in healthy human adults. [...] This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> and has recently been associated with numerous subtle adverse or pathological behavioral alterations in humans.

2500|$|The white {{appearance}} {{is created by}} hyperkeratosis (overproduction of keratin) and epithelial hyperplasia. The causative agent implicated is Epstein-Barr virus, the same virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever).

The virus also causes lytic infection in the oropharynx, but is kept in check by a normal, functioning immune system. Uncontrolled lytic infection is manifested as oral hairy leukoplakia in immunocompromised hosts. OHL usually arises where the immunocompromise is secondary to HIV/AIDS. Rarely are other causes of immunocompromise associated with OHL, but it has been reported in people who have received transplants and are taking immunosuppressive medication. OHL may also accompany chronic graft versus host disease. Even more rare are reports of OHL in persons with competent immune systems.|$|E
40|$|A {{sampling}} protocol for detecting <b>latent</b> <b>infections</b> in potato tubers stored in bins, {{based on the}} preparation of standard samples of 200 tubers, was tested for reliability. Bins of tubers were manually distributed in windrows and 1 % of tubers were replaced with painted tubers, simulating tubers with <b>latent</b> <b>infections.</b> The painted tubers were distributed in windrows with clustered, regular and random distribution. Tubers were harvested and transferred to bins. Each bin {{was considered to be}} divided into layers 15 cm in depth, and 20 tubers were collected along an X-shaped sampling path of each bin layer. A simulated sampling approach was applied to obtain 10 bulk samples (200 tubers) for each kind of tuber distribution. The number of marked tubers, the mean percentage and the standard deviation of the bulk samples of each group was computed. The results confirmed that the sampling design adopted in this study ensured preparation of representative bulk samples. In fact, marked tubers were effectively detected; the observed mean percentages of marked tubers were acceptable in value, even though an overestimate of the true percentage was generally obtained. The percentage of marked tubers was underestimated in 50 % of cases when considering a regular distribution of marked tubers. However, it was never underestimated when considering the clustered distribution, which is most representative of the situation for tubers with <b>latent</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The fight Against Tuberculosis (TB) has {{mainly focused}} on the adult {{population}} because children were perceived to pose a very low risk in TB transmission. This assumption ignores the potential risk children had as reservoirs of <b>latent</b> <b>infections</b> from which future cases evolve when they become adults. It was therefore important to investigate the dynamics of TB taking into consideration, children. Approach: We formulated a compartmental model for TB with two age classes, children and adults. Qualitative analysis of the model was done to investigate {{the stability of the}} model equilibria in terms of the model reproduction number R 0 Numerical simulations were also done to investigate the role played by some key epidemiological parameters in the dynamics of the disease. Results: The model had two equilibria: The disease free equilibrium which was globally stable for R 0 0 > 1, for R 0 near 1. The study showed increased <b>latent</b> <b>infections</b> in the adult population as a result of increased latently infected children who mature to adulthood with <b>latent</b> <b>infections.</b> Conclusion/Recommendations: Progression to active TB among adults is epidemiologically significant and interventions should focus on the adult population. Anti-tuberculosis, treatment of adults is crucial in controlling the epidemic and should interventions be proposed, they should target progression to active TB for those latently infected.

2500|$|A puzzling {{aspect of}} BTV is its {{survival}} between midge seasons in temperate regions. Adult Culicoides {{are killed by}} cold winter temperatures, and BTV infections typically do not last for more than 60 days, which is not long enough for BTV to last until the next spring. It is believed that the virus somehow survives in overwintering midges or animals. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed. [...] A few adult Culicoides midges infected with BTV may survive the mild winters of the temperate zone. [...] Some midges may even move indoors to avoid the cold temperature of the winter. [...] Additionally, BTV could cause a chronic or <b>latent</b> <b>infection</b> in some animals, providing another means for BTV to survive the winter. [...] BTV can also be transmitted from mother to fetus. [...] The outcome is abortion or stillbirth if fetal infection occurs early in gestation and survival if infection occurs late.
