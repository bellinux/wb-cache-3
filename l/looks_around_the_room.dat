60|$|By {{the time}} the teacher has {{proceeded}} thus far, he finds, as he <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> that the countenances of his pupils are assuming a listless and inattentive air. One is restless in his seat, evidently paying no attention. Another has reclined his head upon his desk, lost in a reverie, and others are looking round the room, at one another, or at the door, restless and impatient, hoping the dull lecture will soon be over.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{openings}} of King of the Hill {{start with}} Bill, Dale, and Boomhauer all agreeing to something before the action kicks in, drinking from Alamo branded beer cans. A running joke throughout {{the series is}} an angry Hank yelling [...] "I'm gonna kick your ass!" [...] This is just a threat; he rarely, if ever, harms anyone. Hank's honesty and naivety often get him in unpredictable and troublesome situations. Ultimately, Hank cares for the people around him, particularly {{his family and friends}} and is always out to do what is right. One characteristic that Hank shows is when he lies to someone, he turns his head or <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

50|$|The sketch {{starts with}} a milkman (Michael Palin) {{delivering}} milk to a suburban house. The door opens and a seductive woman (Thelma Taylor in the Television version, Carol Cleveland in the film version) steps out and lures the milkman in; the milkman looks around, then enters the house. The woman takes the milkman upstairs, smiling at him and beckoning him with her finger. The milkman cautiously follows her as she unlocks her bedroom door. She {{opens the door and}} ushers the milkman inside. As the milkman enters the room, she shuts the door and locks it. The milkman <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and sees several milkmen, some of whom are very old, including one who is a skeleton.|$|E

50|$|Jake is {{eventually}} bitten as the trio find the basement key. Angela and Scott now {{appear to be}} the only human survivors. Rather than making their way to the basement, the pair are forced upstairs to the attic apartment by the remaining infected, where they find lab equipment and newspaper clippings about a doomsday cult and a break-in at a chemical weapons lab where a virus was stolen. A trapdoor opens from the attic and Scott loses the camera light as he invsestigates it, the light broken by a small boy swatting at it. Scott turns on the night vision, and he and Angela hear loud banging noises inside the apartment. The source of the noises is an emaciated man, apparently unaware of them, blindly searching. Scott attempts escape but trips and drops the camera. Angela retrieves it and <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> only to see the man eating Scott. In fright, she cries out and is attacked. She drops the camera and is unable to locate it; as she is crawling in pain, she is then dragged screaming into the darkness.|$|E
5000|$|That evening, John joins Gordon and Margo for dinner. After {{they tell}} her about the game, Margo {{suggests}} {{it would be fun to}} play it. When they put the tape in, Evelyn instructs Gordon ("the blue player") to stand in front of the TV, and asks the brothers if they have the courage to do what is necessary to save their father - namely to locate the [...] "four keys." [...] The gameboard has four key images at its corners. Distrubed by Evelyn's specific knowledge of them, they once again turn the game off. That evening, Gordon wakes at 3:13 again and goes downstairs to find he TV on with a static screen and he is soon joined by John and Margo. They are concerned enough that they call their friend Derek, a police officer, to have him look at the tape. This time, however, Evelyn just <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> when they play the tape, and Derek leaves. They find a receipt in the game and decide to go there in the morning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second part}} opens with Alice at home trapped behind the living-room mirror and {{invisible}} to her parents. The Jabberwocky scares Alice and she wishes it away, it disappears as she hides behind the chessboard, knocking it over. She sees {{that she has}} knocked all the pieces onto the floor and begins placing them back on the table, but realizes they are all alive, but can't hear her. The White Queen, White King, The Red King (Patrick Culliton) and the Red Queen decide that Alice's lifting them up was a [...] "Tornado". Alice <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and sees that a painting of an Owl has come to life. The Owl explains that until she overcomes her fear of growing up, she {{will be unable to}} return to the real world. Until then she will be stuck in Looking-Glass World, where everything is the reverse of what she expected. She is informed by The Owl that the Jabberwocky may come back any time and reveals to her that it is a creation of Alice's own fears. Alice looks around and is back in the forest again.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "You and I Tonight" [...] was filmed in Vancouver and {{features}} a classic [...] "break up, make up" [...] story. The video starts {{off with a}} boyfriend and girlfriend who appear {{to have had a}} fight. The girl walks away and toward the camera with tears streaming down her face. In between are shots of Faber Drive performing on a street filled with cars in the pouring rain. The boyfriend yells at the girl, who rips off a locket she has on and throws it on the floor. She leaves the room and the boyfriend gets up and throws a vase at a wall. Just as the vase hits the wall and shatters into pieces, time appears to have stopped and everything, except the boyfriend and later the girlfriend, is frozen in time, including a cat appearing to jump down from a shelf. Puzzled, he <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and grabs a rose from the broken vase. Meanwhile, the girlfriend is outside and tries to hail a taxi, but it drives away. A van drives by through a puddle of water which is about to splash the girl, but as she ducks, time stops and she avoids being soaked.|$|E
50|$|Edie Britt’s {{gynecologist}} {{tells her}} that she has crabs, Edie talks with her fiancé Carlos Solis about it, who is pretty grossed out, and they both have to use an awful licorice-smelling shampoo and a fine-toothed comb {{to take care of}} it. Carlos realizes as he has been secretly sleeping with his ex-wife Gabrielle, that she must have it, too. He drops by one of Gabrielle’s husband's Victor press conferences to warn Gabrielle, and they both realize that since Gabrielle might have it, Victor stands a good chance of having it, too. When they see him briefly scratch his crotch, they know they have to do something. Gabrielle later dresses up in a sexy nurse’s costume for a night of passion with Victor. She pretends the awful-smelling shampoo is a lotion that she made out of natural herbs, and she seductively rubs the shampoo on him. Later, at Bree’s baby shower, Edie smells the shampoo on Victor, wonders how he came about it and asks about his “cologne”. He tells her Gabrielle rubbed some homemade lotion stuff on him. As she <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at people eating the crab cake entree, she slowly makes the connection between Carlos, Gaby, and Victor, and her suspicion grows strong as she crunches up her crab cake in anger.|$|E
5000|$|Opening {{credits for}} seasons 1-7 showed {{members of the}} cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together. At the {{conclusion}} of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening). After Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, Mila Kunis [...] "Hanging Out...;" [...] Danny Masterson [...] "Down the Street"). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were Kurtwood Smith and Tommy Chong, {{with the exception of the}} first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last [...] "We're all alright". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> confused as he hears [...] "Hello, Wisconsin!" [...] The final episode omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.|$|E

40|$|When {{a five-year-old}} enters the {{classroom}} {{for the first}} time, expectations of his parents and teachers are high, but still higher are {{the expectations of the}} child. S/he has heard of this magical day from the time words were understandable. However, the dreams and magical moments are quickly dispelled when s/he finds that s/he cannot conform to the demands of a regimented curriculum. S/he <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at other children who seem to be laughing and doing their activities with ease. Most of them are drawing compliments on their neat work. But no matter how hard s/he tries, the work always seemed to be messy, and even s/he is not pleased with the results. The small child who walked in with head held high now shuffles out with a dejected backward glance, for this child feels s/he cannot compete. School is not fun [...] it is exhausting when you are expected to do things you cannot. One may withdraw or may lash out angrily at one 2 ̆ 7 s more competent peers (Hammond, 1986). S/he certainly lets everyone know that s/he {{does not want to be}} in school. A failure IS in the making...|$|E
