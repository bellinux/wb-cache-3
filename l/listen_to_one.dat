25|$|DJs {{generally}} use {{higher quality}} headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate {{the sounds of}} the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.|$|E
25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is {{not good}} for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E

40|$|Theories {{of verbal}} {{self-monitoring}} generally assume an internal (pre-articulatory) monitoring channel, {{but there is}} debate about whether this channel relies on speech perception or on production-internal mechanisms. Perception-based theories predict that <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>one's</b> own inner speech has similar behavioral consequences as <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> someone else's speech. Our experiment therefore registered eye-movements while speakers named objects accompanied by phonologically related or unrelated written words. The data showed that <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>one's</b> own speech drives eye-movements to phonologically related words, just as <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> someone else's speech does in perception experiments. The time-course of these eye-movements was {{very similar to that}} in other-perception (starting 300 ms post-articulation), which demonstrates that these eye-movements were driven by the perception of overt speech, not inner speech. We conclude that external, but not internal monitoring, is based on speech perception...|$|R

500|$|Bush {{opined that}} this record wasn't very {{different}} from their previous releases. [...] "It's still an Anthrax album with many different parts that can appeal to a wide audience. Our sound is recognizable each time you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of our songs and that's something we really want for our music. You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have everything you can expect from an Anthrax record." [...] Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores [...] "other territories".|$|E
500|$|The {{shifting}} {{point of}} view coincides with the movie's subject matter: filmmaking. The film begins {{with the end of}} a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton (who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: [...] "hough we <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> scene, we watch another.... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist (his play) and the world outside it (what goes into creating a performance)".|$|E

After Kurisu and Okabe have decided that they should cause a shift to the beta attactor field, Kurisu spends time contemplating her coming death. She meets Faris, a staff member at a maid café, and learns that Faris's and Kurisu's {{respective}} fathers, Yukitaka Akiha and doctor Nakabachi, knew each other. They <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of Yukitaka's audio diary cassettes, on which a conversation between Yukitaka, Nakabachi and an unknown third party, professor Hashida, discuss researching time travel. They later find and listen to an audio recording in which Nakabachi expresses regret over having rejected Kurisu; motivated, she runs to tell Okabe that she loves him before he causes the world line shift.|$|E

500|$|The album explores gloomy lyrical {{subjects}} such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth [...] "cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger". The album's title, {{as well as its}} lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. [...] "I mean, it's great to thrash and pound, cut yourself up, scream and have fun, but you don't have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He's already there. I'd rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to whatever I want to than be forced to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> style of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn thing out of this tax problem. I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E
500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} for Esquire magazine, author and Coltrane biographer Ben Ratliff praised Coltrane's music and balladry, stating [...] "His work contains {{most of the}} well-known ideals of jazz... If you're interested in improvisation, this guy pushed improvisation to the wall. He was the best blues player of his time. He wrote and played incredible ballads. Record companies are still putting out compilations of Coltrane ballads called Coltrane for Lovers or whatever. You can poke fun at the idea, but if you ever <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>one,</b> they're indescribably beautiful." [...] The recordings compiled for Coltrane for Lovers have endured a legacy as one of Coltrane's best performing and interpreting of ballads and standards. In a September 2000 essay on the recordings, writer Al Young elaborated on John Coltrane's ability {{during the period of}} recording the compiled jazz ballads, writing that [...] "The rapport between performer and audience smooths and deepens when a player of John Coltrane's caliber breathes personal expression into some aspect of a song's lyric or meaning." [...] Young continued in his review of the album, stating: ...|$|E

2500|$|It's a fantastically {{powerful}} recording {{that was}} done {{a matter of days}} before his death.

At a private gathering before the flight, one of her guests, Guglielmo Marconi, spoke of the close association between aviation and wireless telephony: “Mention {{has been made of}} the possibility of wireless rays passing out through the terrestrial air into space, and of the sending of messages to Mars.
