50|$|However, <b>regional</b> <b>party</b> {{governments in}} the state have {{witnessed}} fulfillment of personal interests {{of the leaders in}} power, rather than the common regional interests.

Secondly, Assamese regionalism created a new type of ethnic awakening among different ethnic groups. <b>Regional</b> <b>party</b> {{governments in the}} state had failed to influence the Central Government to implement the 'Assam Accord' in letter and spirit.|$|R

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>parties</b> {{encourage}} government {{instability in}} Europe {{because they make}} extreme demands on governments for regional autonomy. These demands {{are different from the}} demands other parties make and are also more difficult to accommodate, because they require national governments to relinquish decision-making authority over certain issues, whereas the demands of other parties only require government to adjust their policies in some direction. <b>Regional</b> <b>parties</b> are also unlikely to compromise their demands because {{they do not have the}} tools available to them that other types of parties have. I support this argument through a statistical analysis of twenty-four democracies in Europe, showing that the presence of <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> in government increases government instability and that the saliency of autonomy issues affects stability only if it is mediated through <b>regional</b> <b>parties.</b> Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005 <b>regional</b> <b>parties,</b> cabinet stability, decentralization, federalism,...|$|R

40|$|While {{some analysts}} fear that <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> in federal democracies are narrow in orientation, Indian {{experience}} {{has shown that}} <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> can sometimes improve both voter turnout and human development (HD) in their region. Based {{on the experience of}} the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamilnadu, this article develops a theory of how <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> in developing countries may occasionally succeed at these goals while identifying five obstacles that may prevent HD improvement even if voter turnout expands. Testing this theory across Indian states over the period from 1970 to 2000, I discover that <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> significantly increased voter turnout. Utilising pooled regression analysis of the human development index (HDI), I find that HD performance was largely determined by initial conditions, social spending, agricultural yield and gender equality, but the evidence also suggests a small but positive relationship between <b>regional</b> <b>party</b> control of state governments and HDI improvement...|$|R

40|$|Regionalism is {{a concept}} of {{extensive}} proportions and as such is complex to define. This phenomenon becomes much clearer by studying it from different perspectives. This paper focuses on <b>regional</b> political <b>parties</b> and description of their political ideas. The goal {{of this paper is}} to examine and compare <b>regional</b> political <b>parties</b> in two Swedish regions: Norrbotten and Skåne. By studying two biggest <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> in these regions, namely Norrbottensparti and Skånepartiet, I will try to get an insight into the regional politics, as well as illustrate regionalism and its meaning. My primary intention is to examine how these two <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> experience their regions and what they consider of importance in regional development. By studying these <b>regional</b> <b>parties</b> and their opinion/apprehension about regional politics and their ideological/political affiliation, I will try to illustrate an ideological dimension of regionalism. My intention is to point out differences and similarities between politics of these <b>regional</b> <b>parties,</b> as well as to illustrate approach to the regionalism and its meaning...|$|R
