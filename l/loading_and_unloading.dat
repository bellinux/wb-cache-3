Lift-on/lift-off vessels can operate out of docks with no dockside cargo handling equipment.|$|R

5|$|<b>Loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> a bulker is {{time-consuming}} and dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E

5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading,</b> when partially and fully loaded, and {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E
5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> ramps where {{water and food}} are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} passenger-carrying CMV (e.g., commercial and city buses, passenger vans, and school buses) {{for more than}} 10hours, or to drive after having been on-duty for 15hours.

After completing a 10 to 15-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 8hours off-duty.|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, most cargo was <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloaded</b> by hand by longshoremen. [...] Hand-loading a ship cost $5.86 a ton at that time. [...] Using containers, it {{cost only}} 16 cents a ton to load a ship, a 36-fold savings. Containerization also greatly reduced {{the time to}} <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>unload</b> ships. [...] McLean knew [...] "A ship earns money only when she's at sea", and based his {{business}} on that efficiency.|$|R
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{enclosed}} {{design of}} the Albert Dock and the direct <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within Liverpool. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer. The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from China coming through it and more generally {{half of all the}} far eastern trade income.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> platforms.|$|E

5|$|International {{reaction}} to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as was the Soviet Union and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The United Nations Security Council became {{directly involved in the}} conflict, establishing a Good Offices Committee to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by UNSC resolution 27, was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947. During the military action, on 9 December 1947 Dutch troops killed many civilians in the village of Rawagede (now Balongsari in Karawang, West Java).|$|E
5|$|Mantou kiln: The mantou kiln was {{the most}} common type of pottery kiln in north China, in {{historical}} periods when the dragon kiln dominated south China; both seem to have emerged in the Warring States period of approximately 475 to 221 BC. It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese mantou bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the ground plan resembles a horseshoe. The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central firing area, and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370°C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading,</b> and one or two short chimneys at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, {{because of the number}} of ships which used the river for <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had {{advocated}} the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls for boats not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage.|$|E
