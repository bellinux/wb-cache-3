5|$|Gen. Lee {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault was underway, he <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E
5|$|With {{two games}} remaining, Yorke scored his 29th {{goal of the}} season at Middlesbrough to help his team return {{to the top of}} the table. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's late winner against Arsenal two days later all but ended Wenger’s chances of {{retaining}} the league championship. United now needed only four points, one of them gained at Ewood Park, relegating Blackburn Rovers in the process. Manchester United eventually secured the championship on the final day, coming back from a goal down against Tottenham to win 2–1. The achievement was all the more special for Ferguson, who <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> fifth domestic championship in seven seasons.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2012, Buffon <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> first trophy {{as the new}} Juventus captain, {{following}} Alessandro Del Piero's departure as Juventus defeated Napoli 4–2 {{in extra}} time in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana in Beijing. Buffon suffered a minor injury and missed the first Serie A match of the 2012–13 season against Parma on 25 August 2012. He returned to the starting line-up for the next match against Udinese in Udine on 2 September, wearing the captain's armband; Juventus won the match 4–1. On 20 September, in Juventus's first Champions League match of the season against defending champions Chelsea, Buffon made his 400th appearance for Juventus; the match ended in a 2–2 away draw.

40|$|Pollard et al. 1 {{analysed}} men’s Grand Slam set scores over {{a ten-year}} period {{and found that}} the scores depend to some extent on progress during a match. They fitted a model to account for this dependency in the data and concluded the following. The better player <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning a set in certain situations. These situations are: 1. The player is behind in the set score, needs to <b>lift</b> <b>his</b> game, and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning the next set by (on average) 0. 035; 2. The player has just won a set, is ‘on-a-run’, and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning the next set by (on average) 0. 035; 3. The player has just lost two sets in a row, desperately needs to <b>lift</b> <b>his</b> game, and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning each remaining set by (on average) 0. 110, a substantial amount. In this article, the above results are used to determine what proportion of a match win can be attributed to a player’s ability (by assuming no memory of the scoreboard) and what proportion of a match win {{can be attributed to the}} psychological affects when a scoreboard is present. Further analysis is carried out to determine how the percentages of points won on serve vary as the match progresses from set to set. These results could be used in the training and coaching of players...|$|R

5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry on the undercard {{was for the}} WWF Intercontinental Championship. The feud took place between Razor Ramon, the 1–2–3 Kid, the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett, and his personal enforcer, The Roadie. Ramon and Jarrett faced each other at WrestleMania XI, but Jarrett was disqualified. Jarrett faced Aldo Montoya on the April 8 episode of Superstars of Wrestling in a non-title match, where Jarrett accidentally pinned himself (he never <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> shoulder off the ground after being slammed to the mat by Montoya). Jarrett was initially announced the winner, but Montoya was later declared the winner. Jarrett and Montoya faced each other again two weeks later, on the April 22 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. During the match, Razor Ramon came to ringside and chased The Roadie backstage. Despite this, Jarrett managed to gain the victory, making Montoya submit to the figure four leglock. The next day on Wrestling Challenge, Ramon and the 1–2–3 Kid were scheduled to square off against Jarrett and The Roadie at In Your House. After the 1–2–3 Kid a legit neck injury rendered Kid unable to wrestle, the match was changed into a Handicap match, in which Ramon would face both Jarrett and The Roadie by himself.|$|E
5|$|The two armies met on {{the large}} plain of al-Mudiq (cf. Qalaat al-Madiq), {{surrounded}} by mountains and located near the Lake of Apamea, on 19 July 998. According to Ibn al-Qalanisi, the Fatimid army's left wing was commanded by Maysur the Slav, governor of Tripoli; the centre, where the Daylamite infantry and the army baggage train were located, was {{under the command of}} Badr al-Attar; the right was commanded by Jaysh ibn Samsama and Wahid al-Hilali. According to all accounts, the Byzantines charged the Fatimid army and drove it to flight, killing some 2,000 and capturing the baggage train. Only 500 ghilman under Bishara the Ikhshidid remained steadfast and held firm against the assault, while the Banu Kilab simply abandoned the fight and began looting the battlefield. At that point, a Kurdish rider, named Abu'l-Hajar Ahmad ibn al-Dahhak al-Salil by Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Qalanisi and Bar Kefa by the Byzantine sources and Abu'l-Faraj, rode towards Dalassenos, who was near his battle standard on top of a height and was accompanied only by two of his sons and ten men of his retinue. Believing the battle won and that the Kurd wanted to surrender, Dalassenos took no precautions. As he approached the Byzantine general, Ibn al-Dahhak suddenly charged. Dalassenos <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> arm to shield himself, but the Kurd launched his spear at him. The general wore no cuirass, and the blow killed him.|$|E

In Australia, the sport attracted criticism when a 39-year-old man playing at a registered field in Victoria died of a suspected heart attack, after being struck in the chest.|$|E
25|$|A right-arm fast-medium bowler {{capable of}} {{generating}} good pace with late swing, he {{is a genuine}} strike bowler. Although he was prone to leaking runs in his earlier career, of late he has used vast county experience to be economical in death overs. He often bowls the reverse-swinging yorker in one day and T20 cricket and has good control over changes of pace, though he sometimes can be expensive. Rana is also a useful attacking lower-order batsman with 5 first-class centuries and many fifties, including a score of 95 in 57 balls in a T20 game which <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> team Sialkot Stallions to the tournament final.

In his return to Nashville, Radulov scored the Predators' only goal in a 5–1 loss to the Penguins. He concluded the 2011–12 regular season with seven points (three goals and four assists) in nine games.|$|E
25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Al-Ahly faced Club América of Mexico, for {{the third}} place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1–0 for Al-Ahly.

After surging out of midfield and finding Flavio Amado with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.|$|E
