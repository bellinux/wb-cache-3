5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a <b>low</b> <b>pay</b> grade to a task that was considered to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a <b>low</b> <b>pay</b> grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price}} of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters.|$|E
5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E

A 2000 study found that 62.1% of FDI employed workers were female. Gendered wages, however, have been inconsistently affected by FDI, with pay equality in FDI industries increasing in 1995 and decreasing in 2005. This shift may {{be a result of}} recent greater FDI investment in production, resulting in additional creation of <b>low</b> <b>paying</b> factory jobs which are predominantly filled by women.|$|R

5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were saddled with <b>low</b> <b>pay</b> (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The <b>low</b> <b>pay</b> meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E

5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary {{police officers to}} Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), the police were the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment to mutiny. Dissatisfied with their <b>low</b> <b>pay</b> rates and with the slow progress of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order on the African mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, {{and the only}} demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the {{abolition}} of what they called slavery: they objected to <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) {{and the use of}} whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May. A small group of Uyghurs arrived on 2 May, and workers at the factory remarked that {{relations between the two}} groups deteriorated as the number of Uyghurs increased. State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported that workers at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by verbal abuse from factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E

According {{to a survey by}} the Japan Institute of Labor in 2000, the average freeter works 4.9 days per week and earns ¥139,000 per month (ca. $1,300 U.S.). Two thirds of freeters have never had a regular, full-time job.|$|R
5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of <b>low</b> <b>pay</b> and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E
5|$|Unsatisfied {{with the}} <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> in Kremenchuk Adler led an {{unsuccessful}} actors' strike.

When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg {{to form a new}} one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin. In Chernigov, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of Boris Gudonov. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to be headed for a triumphant entry into Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Walmer Castle {{was left}} to decline in the early 17th century, with little money being made {{available}} for repairs and the garrison receiving <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> leading some members to reside in nearby Deal rather the fort itself, and to take on additional employment to supplement their wages. Walmer Castle was seized by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament, but did not play a significant role in the remainder of the initial conflict. After the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.|$|E

25|$|In 1870, {{police in}} Newcastle upon Tyne were {{recorded}} as 'in dispute' with their local Watch Committee over conditions {{of work and}} <b>low</b> <b>pay,</b> though they did not withdraw from duty.

Of the 179 men who refused duty, 69 were dismissed from the force. The rest were allowed back on duty after having had apologised for their conduct. They gained improvements in pay and conditions. This action was significant for establishing a precedent for collective action by police in order to improve working conditions.|$|E
