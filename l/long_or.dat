5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with <b>long</b> <b>or</b> short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around their shoulders. The main difference in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E
5|$|A normal tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{for which}} every tile is topologically {{equivalent to a}} disk, the intersection of any two tiles is a single connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius {{can be used for}} all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically <b>long</b> <b>or</b> thin.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be <b>long</b> <b>or</b> short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E

5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair <b>long</b> <b>or</b> wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|Principe di Carignano {{took part}} in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866, where she led the Italian line of battle, but was not heavily engaged. Rendered {{obsolescent}} by the advent of central battery and turret ships in the 1870s, the three Principe di Carignano-class ships did not have particularly <b>long</b> <b>or</b> active service lives. In an effort to reduce the maintenance budget to offset the cost of newer ships under construction, Principe di Carignano was stricken from the naval register in 1875; Messina and Conte Verde followed in 1880, the latter just nine years after completion.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon is a <b>long</b> <b>or</b> medium haired cat. The coat is {{soft and}} silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E

5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm <b>long</b> <b>or</b> less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively <b>long</b> <b>or</b> violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as <b>long</b> <b>or</b> suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are as <b>long</b> <b>or</b> {{longer than}} the head, with a nearly straight front margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is large with a rounded apex, and is placed behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny. The caudal peduncle is expanded laterally into strong keels. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, with a small notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The dermal denticles are elliptical, longer than wide, with three to seven horizontal ridges leading to a toothed posterior margin. The coloration is dark blue to grayish black above and white below. The unpaired fins are dark except for a white rear margin on the anal fin; the pectoral and pelvic fins are dark above and white below with sharp gray posterior margins. In adults and large juveniles, the area beneath the snout, around the jaw, and the origin of the pectoral fins have dusky mottling.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{growing to}} certain heights, the Star Plant grows through larger {{floating}} islands. These islands, {{along with the}} smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant, contain power-up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities. Creatures and other plant life {{can also be found}} throughout the game's islands, as well as environmental features, such as caves and water currents. Some parts of the environment, such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible, can affect how the player moves throughout the world. Teleportation pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points. The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die, which can be caused by falling long distances, being in too much water for too <b>long,</b> <b>or</b> by the player making B.U.D. self-destruct. Additionally, players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to retrieve data from them. Items can be picked up by the player and stored in B.U.D.'s backpack one at a time, such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground, and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} jewellery, beads, and charms was also found. 100 beads in total were {{recovered}} from 16 graves, though only two {{had more than}} 10 beads. The small number of beads found in the remaining 14 graves is indicative of how styles had changed; in the 6th century it was customary for women to wear up to 100 relatively plain beads {{at a time in}} the form of necklaces, but by the mid-7th century, the fashion was for a small number of high-quality beads which may have been attached with wire or carried in a bag. A very unusual discovery was made in grave 21– the remnants of a necklace comprising eight beads and two Iron Age gold coins minted by the Corieltauvi tribe of modern Lincolnshire some time between 15–45AD, before the Roman conquest of Britain. Holes had been drilled in the coins, which were more than 600years old {{by the time they were}} buried, to convert them into items of jewellery. Their excellent condition suggests that they had not been used for <b>long,</b> <b>or</b> at all, as currency; it is possible that they had been part of a hoard buried shortly after they were minted and were rediscovered during Saxon times. The discovery of Roman coins in a Saxon grave of this period is unique to the Street House cemetery. It is likely that they were valued because of the cross-shaped designs on the coins' reverse.|$|E
