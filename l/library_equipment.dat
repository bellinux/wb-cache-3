The spacious library building, which {{at that time}} was located on the Radianska Street 30, was repurposed as a hospital for infectious diseases, and the Scientific Library of LSMU was eliminated. During World War II, parts of the library collection were looted, burned, and destroyed.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{factors related to}} five antecedents of library anxiety among college students: (1) barriers with staff (the perception that librarians and other library staff are intimidating and unapproachable; (2) affective barriers (feelings of inadequacy about using the library); (3) comfort with the library (how safe, welcoming, and non-threatening students perceive the library to be); (4) knowledge of the library (how familiar with the library students feel they are); and (5) mechanical barriers (feelings which emerge {{as a result of}} reliance on mechanical <b>library</b> <b>equipment).</b> Students from two universities (n= 522) were administered the Library Anxiety Scale (LAS) and the Demographic Information Form (DIF). The LAS, a 43 -item 5 -point Likert-format instrument, assessed levels of library anxiety based on the five antecedents. The DIF recorded relevant demographic information, including gender, age, native language, year of study, academic achievement, course load, number of credit hours, number of library instruction courses taken, computer experience, study habits, employment status, distance between home and the library, frequency of library visits, and reasons for visiting the library. Data were analyzed to determine the relationship between the antecedents of library anxiety and selected variables. Based on the findings, recommendations specific to each antecedent were developed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess the {{preservation}} of library collections in the Slavic library and to determine the level of emergency to modify the present conditions of preservation. Methodology/approach: It addresses the situation in the period from December 2010 to June 2011 in three different depots of the Slavic Library as well as preservation aspects of handling of library materials. The methodology of S. Michalski and R. Waller is used for a systematic analysis and assessment of risk factors as well as the level of risk. Results: Observation and analysis of the situation showed problems with maintaining a constant humidity and temperature level, the occurrence of mold and deficiencies of the recently constructed library building. The article identifies the placement of library depot in the basement as inappropriate, the air conditioning systems as ill-suited to the standards of library material preservation and the inadequacy of equipment and fixtures. The assessment according to Michalski showed the »level of emergency« relating to the moisture and temperature, fire safety and intrusion of water into the depot. Research limitation: The study refers to the period of seven months and is limited to the depots of the Slavic Library. Originality/practical implications: The example shows how to detect the causes of damage on library materials and how to recognize risk factors and threats on the basis of the state of library materials and storage conditions. It anticipates developments and allows reflections on <b>library</b> <b>equipment</b> and optimal library building construction...|$|E
40|$|As {{libraries}} {{were established}} in a few secondary schools in America {{at the turn of}} the century, in all probability those responsible felt that they faced insurmountable problems. These pioneer libraries were placed wherever space could be spared in buildings not planned to accommodate them at all. In retrospect, it seems remarkable that school administrators and librarians of the early 1900 ' s could arrange <b>library</b> <b>equipment</b> and materials as effectively as they often did in the small and unsuitable areas then designated for libraries. Sixty years later, designing new or renovated quarters for school library services is one of the most complex and challenging problems school library or materials specialists face. The buildings they help to plan represent their concepts of the role of the library in education today, as well as their ability to influence school administrators and architects to accept their ideas. The amount of space allocated for library services, the nature and location of the special areas designated, and specific provisions for the housing and dissemination of the educational media considered legitimate library materials all these tell a community what the planners believe to be a good school library and what services may be expected from it. Winston Churchill is often quoted as having said that we shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us. Recognition of the truth of his statement only contributes to the insecurity a thoughtful school librarian must surely feel today. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|In the past, most {{automated}} systems employed large, {{general purpose}} processors, or very specialized applications software, usually both. An approach employing either method {{does not support}} library automation in any but the largest and best-financed libraries. Smaller libraries must either affiliate with these larger <b>libraries</b> or share <b>equipment</b> with nonlibrary applications. In either case, processing methodologies, standards and equipment decisions are made outside the affected library by persons unfamiliar with their requirements. Current technology and pricing make this approach to library automation unnecessarily restrictive to individual libraries and unnecessarily expensive for the <b>library</b> community. <b>Equipment</b> selected for its suitability in library-type problems combined with generalized data management software designed for library applications will make dedicated, self-contained systems cost effective for most libraries. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
