The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate complications, sexual activity, urinary symptoms, and satisfaction with health care after vaginal hysterectomy due to prolapse. Methods We analyzed data from the Swedish National Register for Gynecological Surgery (SNRGS) from January 1997 to August 2005. Women participating in the SNRGS were asked to complete surveys at two and six months postoperatively. Of 941 women who underwent vaginal hysterectomy for uterovaginal prolapse, 791 responded to questionnaires at two months and 682 at six months. Complications during surgery and hospital stay were investigated. The two-month questionnaire investigated complications after discharge, and patients' satisfaction with their health care. Sexual activity and urinary symptoms were reported and compared in preoperative and six-month postoperative questionnaires. Results Almost 60 % of women reported normal activity of daily life (ADL) within one week of surgery, irrespective of their age. Severe complications occurred in 3 % and were mainly intra-abdominal bleeding and vaginal vault hematomas. Six months postoperative, sexual activity had increased for 20 % (p = 0. 006) of women and urinary urgency was reduced for 50 % (p = 0. 001); however, 14 % (n = 76) of women developed urinary incontinence, 76 % (n = 58) of whom reported urinary stress incontinence. Patients were satisfied with the postoperative result in 93 % of cases and 94 % recommended the surgery. Conclusion Vaginal hysterectomy is a patient-evaluated efficient treatment for uterovaginal prolapse with swift recovery and a low rate of complication. Sexual activity and symptoms of urinary urgency were improved. However, 14 % developed incontinence, mainly urinary stress incontinence (11 %). Therefore efforts to disclose <b>latent</b> <b>stress</b> incontinence should be undertaken preoperatively. </p...|$|E

In this study the complexity between ARD, and the influence of the reduction of growth parameters, the influence on the synthesis of valuable, antioxidative compounds, such as phenols, and its interaction with other valuable antioxidative compounds in leaves {{and other parts of the}} plants was shown for the first time. The study showed a communication between compounds in roots and leaves which could affect a higher tolerance of plant parts (leaves) against a secondary occurring oxidative stress (in this study induced by paraquat). Seedlings were grown under controlled conditions within a growth chamber. ARD playing a major role in apple fruit production and soil fertility, respectively, was observed as a biotic stress induction factor. Parameters such as photosynthetic activity, antioxidant capacity in the leaves (AC) and total phenolic compounds within the roots were observed to alter significantly under replant conditions. Vegetative growth parameters showed a significantly inhibited development in those plants exposed to replant conditions. Plants having undergone a <b>latent</b> <b>stress</b> through ARD affected soil showed significantly less impact of a secondary oxidative stressor such as the application of paraquat. When exposed to a secondary stressor such as Paraquat the photosynthetic activity (Fv/Fm) within the leaves of those plants did not alter under replant conditions whereas Fv/Fm values decreased in leaves of plants grown in none affected soil. The accumulation of total phenolic compounds within the root of plants grown under replant conditions increased significantly suggesting an ongoing defense mechanism within the host plant.

The predominant explanatory model is the minority stress theory; however, this model was developed largely with adults, and no valid and comprehensive measure of minority stress has been developed for adolescents. The present study validated a newly developed instrument to measure minority stress among racially and ethnically diverse SMA. A sample of 346 SMA aged 14 – 17 was recruited and surveyed between February 2015 and July 2016. The focal measure of interest was the 64 -item, 11 -factor Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI) developed in the initial phase of this study. Criterion validation measures included measures of depressive symptoms, suicidality and self-harm, youth problem behaviors, and substance use; the general Adolescent Stress Questionnaire (ASQ) was included {{as a measure of}} divergent validity.

In {{this study we}} determined whether AGEs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and studied the ER stress-activated pathways that stimulate cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression in human chondrocytes. MethodsChondrocytes were stimulated with AGE-BSA. Gene expression was determined by quantitative PCR and protein expression was studied by immunoblotting. Studies to elucidate involved pathways were executed using siRNAs and specific inhibitors of eukaryotic initiation factor- 2 α (eIF 2 α), MAPKs and NF-κB. ResultsAGE-BSA induced expression of GRP 78 with concomitant increase in COX- 2 expression was observed in human chondrocytes. In addition, expression of Bag- 1, an ER stress marker was also increased by AGE-BSA. RAGE knockdown inhibited AGE-BSA-induced expression of GRP 78 and COX- 2. Treatment with eIF 2 α inhibitor or eIF 2 α knockdown inhibited AGE-BSA-induced expression of GRP 78 and COX- 2 with decreased PGE 2 production. Treatment with SB 202190 inhibited AGE-BSA-induced expression of GRP 78 and COX- 2, while treatment with PD 98051 inhibited AGE-BSA-induced GRP 78 protein expression but {{had no effect on}} COX- 2 protein expression. SP 600125 had no effect on either GRP 78 or COX- 2 protein expression. Bay 11 - 7082 suppressed AGE-BSA-induced GRP 78 and COX- 2 expression. AGE-BSA-induced activation of NF-κB was inhibited by treatment with SB 202190 and by eIF 2 α knockdown, but was not inhibited when chondrocytes were treated with SP 600125 or PD 98059.

We report that Toxoplasma eukaryotic initiation factor- 2 α (TgIF 2 α) is phosphorylated during stress and establish that protozoan parasites utilize translation control to modulate gene expression during development. Importantly, TgIF 2 α remains phosphorylated in bradyzoites, explaining how these cells maintain their quiescent state. Furthermore, we have characterized novel eIF 2 kinases; one in the endoplasmic reticulum and a likely regulator of the unfolded protein response (TgIF 2 K-A) and another that is a probable responder to cytoplasmic stresses (TgIF 2 K-B). Significantly, our data suggest that 1) the regulation of protein translation through eIF 2 kinases is associated with development, 2) eIF 2 α phosphorylation is employed by cells to maintain a latent state, and 3) endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic stress responses evolved in eukaryotic cells before the early diverging Apicomplexa.

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) states that there exist differences in structural complexity in security prices between regular and abnormal situations. Yet, despite a clear link between market acceleration (cf. recession in security prices) and stress in physical systems, indices of financial stress still have significant scope for further development. The overarching {{aim of this}} work is therefore to determine the characteristics of financial indices related to financial stress, and to establish a robust metric for the extent of such `stress'. This is achieved based on intrinsic multiscale analysis which quantifies the so called complexity-loss hypothesis {{in the context of}} financial stress. The multiscale sample entropy and our proposed Assessment of <b>Latent</b> Index of <b>Stress</b> methods have successfully assessed financial stress, and have served as a measure to establish an analogy between transitions from `normal' (relaxed) to `abnormal' (stressed) financial periods with the sympatho-vagal balance in humans.

Although most mothers cope well, 25 - 30 % show prolonged distress. Here, we assessed distress, interleukin (IL) - 6, and glucocorticoid resistance among 120 mothers at 1, 6, and 12 months after their child’s diagnosis. A latent factor for distress was indicated by depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic <b>stress.</b> <b>Latent</b> difference score models revealed a significant positive association between change in distress and change in GCR from 0 - 6 mo.

These findings provide initial longitudinal evidence for an increase in GCR over the first 12 months following onset of a chronic stressor that parallels changes in distress. However, changes in GCR were unrelated to IL- 6 over the same period. Future studies should consider additional pathways through which chronic stress relates to increases in IL- 6. Given the health consequences of reduced sensitivity to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids, it is important to investigate the timing and mechanisms through which chronic stress relates to GCR...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is change in {{environmental}} content in Mexican primary school textbooks before and after the decentralization of public education in 1993. The literature review in the opening chapter gives the background information on environmental education, internationally and in Mexico. The authors mention and discuss the major groups involved in the development and initiation of programs and curriculum such as the UNESCO, Man and the Biosphere (MAB), and the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). The gradual Mexican ownership of the environmental cause and the promotion of awareness in Mexico lead to {{the main part of the}} study. This study employs both manifest and latent content analysis to find trends and themes in the textbooks. The primary focus of the manifest content analysis is individual words while the <b>latent</b> content analysis <b>stresses</b> excerpts and images from the textbooks. The use of an Excel database and PivotTables generated by Excel to correlate data indicates areas to examine for differences in content between the textbooks. In addition, the use of the two forms of analysis provides validation and significance when the data agree. The final portion of the study offers some general conclusions for the analysis and a summary of how the environmental content has increased in the primary school textbooks over the period studied. There are also suggestions for future research on the content of textbooks, surveys of environmental knowledge and attitudes, and alternatives to the formal education implied by the use of textbooks in the classroom. In the end we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, we will understand only what we are taught...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent fluxes of momentum, moisture, {{and heat}} at the air-sea {{interface}} {{are essential for}} climate studies. Version 2 Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes (GSSTF 2) has been derived from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) radiance measurements. This dataset, covering the period July 1987 -December 2000 over global oceans, has a spatial resolution of 1 deg x 1 deg lat-long and a temporal resolution of 1 day. Turbulent fluxes are derived from the SSM/I surface winds and surface air humidity, {{as well as the}} 2 -m air and sea surface temperatures (SST) of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, using a bulk aerodynamic algorithm based on the surface layer similarity theory. The GSSTF 2 bulk flux model, and retrieved daily wind <b>stress,</b> <b>latent</b> heat flux, wind speed, and surface air humidity validate well with ship observations of ten field experiments over the tropical and midlatitude oceans during 1991 - 99. The global distributions of 1988 - 2000 annual- and seasonal-mean turbulent fluxes show reasonable patterns related to the atmospheric general circulation and seasonal variations. Latent heat fluxes and related input parameters over global oceans during 1992 - 93 have been compared among GSSTF 1 (version 1), GSSTF 2, HOAPS (Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data), NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, and one based on COADS (Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set). Our analyses suggest that the GSSTF 2 latent heat flux, surface air humidity, surface wind, and SST are quite realistic compared to the other four flux datasets examined. However, significant differences are found among these five flux datasets. The GSSTF 2, available at [URL] is useful for climate studies...|$|R
40|$|The interannual {{variability}} of upper ocean heat content (OHC) in the South China Sea (SCS) {{for the period}} of 1987 - 2006 and its response to ENSO events are investigated. It is found that the variability has a good correspondence with ENSO events, but with opposite phase. Negative OHC anomalies appear during ENSO warm phases, while positive OHC anomalies occur during ENSO cool phases. In addition, negative (positive) OHC anomalies propagate westward obviously during ENSO warm (cool) phases in the northern SCS. In contrast. OHC anomalies in the southern SCS do not exhibit distinct westward propagation during ENSO events. To explore why the OHC anomalies cannot propagate westward in the southern SCS, the interannual {{variability of}} oceanic and atmospheric anomaly fields including wind stress curl (WSC), horizontal wind <b>stress,</b> <b>latent</b> heat flux (LHF) and sea level pressure (SLP) is investigated. The results show that after a mature phase of ENSO warm (cool) event, negative (positive) OHC anomalies first appear in the northern SCS, which comes from the western Pacific through Luzon Strait. Then cyclonic (anticyclonic) wind stress anomalies occur in the northern SCS, which leads to positive (negative) WSC anomalies. Meanwhile, positive (negative) LHF anomalies which correspond to oceanic heat loss (gain) occur in this region. The effects of WSC and LHF, combined with the westward propagating negative (positive) OHC anomalies from the western Pacific, may contribute to rapid growth and propagation of the OHC anomalies in the northern SCS. On the contrary, the negative (positive) WSC and LHF anomalies associated with positive (negative) SLP in the southern SCS seem to be the important processes responsible for the weakening and non-propagation of the OHC anomalies in the southern SCS after a mature phase of ENSO warm (cool) event.

40|$|The global air-sea fluxes of momentum, latent and {{sensible}} heat, radiation, and freshwater (precipitation-evaporation) {{are required for}} driving Ocean models and validating coupled ocean- atmosphere global models. Wind stress is the major forcing for driving the oceanic circulation, while evaporation is {{a key component of}} hydrological cycle and surface heat budget. We have produced a 13. 5 -year (July 1987 -December 2000) dataset containing daily, monthly, and climatological surface fluxes of momentum, latent {{and sensible}} heat over the global Oceans from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) radiance easurements. This dataset is called version 2 Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes (GSSTF- 2). The GSSW- 2 has a spatial resolution of 1. 0 deg x 1. 0 deg lat-long. In addition, evaporation has been combined with the satellite-retrieved precipitation to produce monthly freshwater fluxes over the global Ocean for the same period. Daily turbulent fluxes are derived from the S S M surface winds and surface air humidity, and 2 -m air and sea surface temperatures (SST) of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, using an improved stability-dependent bulk flux algorithm based on the surface layer similarity theory. Hourly fluxes computed from the GSSTF- 2 bulk flux algorithm using the observed hourly input variables validate well against those of ten experiments observed by the research ships over the tropical and midlatitude oceans. In addition, daily wind <b>stresses,</b> <b>latent</b> heat fluxes, wind speeds, surface air humidity and SSTs of the GSSTF- 2 compare reasonably well with those of the collocated in situ measurements of the ten experiments. The global distributions of 1988 - 2000 annual- and seasonal-mean turbulent fluxes show reasonable patterns related to the atmospheric general circulation and its seasonal variations. The comparison of zonally-averaged wind <b>stress</b> and <b>latent</b> heat fluxes of the GSSTF- 2 with those of other satellite products as well as the NCEPNCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for the annual mean and seasonal variations during 1992 - 93 will be discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that some cases of {{prenatal}} depression {{may be associated with}} reactivation of latent infections of the herpesvirus family. The possible relationships among stress, prenatal depression, and herpes viral reactivation in pregnancy are understudied and the molecular pathways such as the neuroimmune biogenic amine pathway are unidentified. Chronic stress shifts the T helper- 1 cell (Th 1) cytokine profile to a Th 2 profile, which favors virus induced pathogenesis and survival. Pregnancy is also associated with a similar Th 2 dominance. In non-pregnant individuals, exposure to psychological or physical stress may be associated with latent herpes viral reactivation and could result in behavioral deficits and depression. Normally, type- 1 cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN -gamma) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induce indoleamine- 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) activation which inhibits herpes virus replication and reactivation, decreases tryptophan production, and alters phenylalanine /tyrosine metabolism. Thus it is possible that prenatal depression may occur from tryptophan stealing through the IDO pathway which results in decreased serotonin as well as increased risk for latent herpes viral reactivation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the relationships among stress, herpes viral titers, depression, and metabolites of IDO activation, which involves tryptophan and guanosine-triphosphate-cyclohydrolase- 1 (GTP-CH 1) pathways. This study builds on Influence of Lactation on Postpartum Stress and Immunity (Grant number: R 01 -NR 05000) which investigated perinatal immune, endocrine, and inflammatory changes in pregnancy and the postpartum. A secondary data analysis was conducted on baseline data from women collected at 16 to 25 gestational weeks. This data set included some herpes viral titers, and additional ones were measured in stored plasma samples. The aim of this study is to examine relationships among stress, herpes viral reactivation, depression, and the IDO activation pathway. The results of this study provide information about the possible role of further relationships of prenatal <b>stress,</b> <b>latent</b> herpes viral reactivation, and depression mechanisms. The results will be important in health promotion and disease prevention during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{developed}} to estimate daily turbulent airsea fluxes over the global ocean on a 0. 25 degrees grid. The required surface wind speed (w(10)) and specific air humidity (q(10)) at 10 m height are both estimated from remotely sensed measurements. w(10) is {{obtained from the}} SeaWinds scatterometer on board the QuikSCAT satellite. A new empirical model relating brightness temperatures (T-b) from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and q(10) is developed. It {{is an extension of}} the author's previous q(10) model. In addition to T-b, the empirical model includes sea surface temperature (SST) and airsea temperature difference data. The calibration of the new empirical q(10) model utilizes q(10) from the latest version of the National Oceanography Centre airsea interaction gridded data set (NOCS 2. 0). Compared with mooring data, the new satellite q(10) exhibits better statistical results than previous estimates. For instance, the bias, the root mean square (RMS), and the correlation coefficient values estimated from comparisons between satellite and moorings in the northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea are 0. 04 gkg(1), 0. 87 gkg(1), and 0. 95, respectively. The new satellite q(10) is used in combination with the newly reprocessed QuikSCAT V 3, the latest version of SST analyses provided by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and 10 m air temperature estimated from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses (ERA-Interim), to determine three daily gridded turbulent quantities at 0. 25 degrees spatial resolution: surface wind <b>stress,</b> <b>latent</b> heat flux (LHF), and sensible heat flux (SHF). Validation of the resulting fields is performed through a comprehensive comparison with daily, in situ values of LHF and SHF from buoys. In the northeast Atlantic basin, the satellite-derived daily LHF has bias, RMS, and correlation of 5 Wm(2), 27 Wm(2), and 0. 89, respectively. For SHF, the statistical parameters are 2 Wm(2), 10 Wm(2), and 0. 94, respectively. At global scale, the new satellite LHF and SHF are compared to NOCS 2. 0 daily estimates. Both daily fluxes exhibit similar spatial and seasonal variability. The main departures are found at latitudes south of 40 degrees S, where satellite latent and sensible heat fluxes are generally larger...|$|R
40|$|Plant water {{status is}} a key factor {{impacting}} crop growth and agricultural water management. Crop water stress may alter canopy temperature, the energy balance, transpiration, photosynthesis, canopy water use efficiency, and crop yield. The objective {{of this study was}} to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) from canopy temperature and energy balance measurements and evaluate the utility of CWSI to quantify water stress by comparing CWSI to latent heat and carbon dioxide (CO 2) flux measurements over canopies of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.). The experiment was conducted at the Yucheng Integrated Agricultural Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2003 to 2005. Latent heat and CO 2 fluxes (by eddy covariance), canopy and air temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, wind speed, and soil heat flux were averaged at half-hour intervals. Leaf area index and crop height were measured every 7 days. CWSI was calculated from measured canopy-air temperature differences using the Jackson method. Under high net radiation conditions (greater than 500 Wm- 2), calculated values of minimum canopy-air temperature differences were similar to previously published empirically determined non-water-stressed baselines. Valid measures of CWSI were only obtained when canopy closure minimized the influence of viewed soil on infrared canopy temperature measurements (leaf area index was greater than 2. 5 m 2 m- 2). Wheat and maize latent heat flux and canopy CO 2 flux generally decreased linearly with increases in CWSI when net radiation levels were greater than 300 Wm- 2. The responses of latent heat flux and CO 2 flux to CWSI did not demonstrate a consistent relationship in wheat that would recommend it as a reliable water stress quantification tool. The responses of latent heat flux and CO 2 flux to CWSI were more consistent in maize, suggesting that CWSI could be useful in identifying and quantifying water stress conditions when net radiation was greater than 300 Wm- 2. The results suggest that CWSI calculated by the Jackson method under varying solar radiation and wind speed conditions may be used for irrigation scheduling and agricultural water management of maize in irrigated agricultural regions, such as the North China Plain.

40|$|The primary study {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the latent biological effect of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) on adults by quantifying acquired cytogenetic changes and cortisol levels in identical twins who were discordant (N= 22) or concordant (N= 2) for a history of CSA. Although the difference scores for cortisol values between discordant identical co-twins {{were not significantly different}} from zero, a trend was observed for the twins exposed to intercourse, the most severe form of CSA, to have a blunted cortisol awakening response. Acquired cytogenetic changes were assessed by scoring telomere lengths and somatic cell abnormality frequencies via a cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) assay. No significant difference in overall telomere intensity values was observed between co-twins, but chromosome-specific telomere differences were observed in the individuals exposed to intercourse compared to their unabused co-twins ([χ 2 (45) = 62. 88; p= 0. 040 and χ 2 (45) = 73. 72; p= 0. 004). Specifically, shortened telomeres were observed on the short arms of chromosomes 3, 5, 2 ̆ 6 6, and long arms of chromosomes 11 2 ̆ 6 13. A significant increase in MN frequencies was observed in the abused twins compared to unabused twins (t= 2. 65; df= 16; p= 0. 009). A significant interaction between micronuclei frequencies and age was also observed, suggesting that the biological effects of stress are cumulative (coefficient [SE] = 0. 030 [0. 009]; p= 0. 0006). However, the pattern of chromatin present in MN, which was assessed using spectral karyotyping methodologies, was not limited to the subset of chromosomes with telomeric attrition. In summary, this is the first assessment of acquired chromosomal abnormalities, chromosome-specific telomere lengths and cortisol levels in identical adult twins discordant for exposure to CSA. Given that a portion of biological changes were most pronounced in the intercourse discordant twins, these findings support a possible dose-response relationship with CSA severity. Our data also suggest that the MN assay is a superior tool in assessing the <b>latent</b> effects of <b>stress</b> compared to either cortisol profiling or the measurement of telomere lengths. Collectively, application of the information gained from these studies may allow for novel screening techniques to identify individuals who are most at risk for developing stress-associated disease states...|$|R
