While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children.

When you arrive, you notice that the night nurse from last evening is still there. The night nurse looks really tired. You wonder how she keeps functioning after working almost a day and a half. You greet your <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> as you enter their room, but something is not right. Your <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> is acting abnormally lethargic. You ask for the nurse to come check on your <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> When she does, she notices that your <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> was given the wrong dose of a certain medication.

Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby scrapbook. While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and {{goes so far as}} blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment.

Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a restraining order against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her and tears up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated when {{he was trying to get}} pregnant with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility.

25|$|Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God {{is portrayed}} as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's {{principal}} relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created. Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and {{is concerned with the}} actions of mankind. According to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation. Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to <b>love</b> <b>one</b> another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people. These commandments are but two of a large corpus of commandments and laws that constitute this covenant, which is the substance of Judaism.|$|E

When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father Max (Jake Wood) and they end up in bed. Subsequently, they begin an affair and Max agrees to divorce his wife, Tanya (Jo Joyner). However, he has this on a halt as he learns that Tanya is expecting their son. He leaves Stacey and she reunites with Bradley, later marrying. Max propositions Stacey after the wedding ceremony and their brief kiss is recorded on Max's daughter Lauren's (Madeline Duggan) hidden video camera. Lauren gives a DVD of the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present, revealing the fling as he plays it to the family. Devastated, Tanya slaps Stacey and Bradley ends their marriage again for six months. He eventually decides to give their marriage another chance, suggesting that they start a family. Stacey is uncertain and secretly continues having birth control pills. She seduces Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan). She immediately regrets cheating on Bradley. Although she attempts to reignite the spark in her marriage, Stacey divorces Bradley. She has a one-night stand with Callum, which leads to them dating.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The study {{presented}} in this thesis provides a description and interpretation of the experiences of family members during their older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. Fourteen women, aged 51 to 74 years, {{participated in the study}} and, over an interview period of nineteen months, described their experiences. These twelve daughters and two wives supported and cared for their <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> at home, in residential aged care and/or while hospitalised. The approach used to explore the women’s experiences was existential phenomenology, informed by the philosophies of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Changing family portraits: Sudden existential absence during delirium depicts the women’s experiences during their older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. Existential absence for these women was experienced as the sudden absence of their familiar older <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and the arrival of a stranger. The meaning of existential absence is further represented by the theme Living the fragility of a <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> presence and the sub-themes Facing a <b>loved</b> <b>one's</b> existential absence and Living with a stranger, as well as the theme Living life holding on and the sub-themes Waiting for a <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> In the dark, On the fringe but centre stage, On thin ice, and Keeping secrets. These themes describe the unexpected and distressing nature of their <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> absence during delirium, and how difficult it was for the women to cope and await their <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> return. The description and interpretation {{presented in}} this thesis reveals the profound impact of family member experiences during their older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. It establishes the importance of health care staff appreciating family member experiences and relates the insights gained to health care practice, suggesting how family member experiences can inform ways health care staff include family members in their older person’s care and provide compassionate, sensitive support during delirium...|$|R

[...] Caregivers in this situation often report high caregiver burden lasting the entire period.

Having a difficult time with caregiving increases distress caregivers face as they enter the bereavement period after the death of their <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> whereas finding meaning in caring for their <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> may relate to better long term adjustment for caregivers.
