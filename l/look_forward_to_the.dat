5|$|A {{terrorist}} group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage {{in exchange for}} Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no past memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} each legal year is {{marked with a}} {{ceremony}} usually held on the first Saturday of January, though in 2011 it {{took place on the}} first Friday.

25|$|Thomas Jones (26 September 1742 – 29 April 1803) was a Welsh {{landscape}} painter. He was a pupil of Richard Wilson and {{was best}} known in his lifetime as a painter of Welsh and Italian landscapes {{in the style of}} his master. However, Jones's reputation grew in the 20th century when more unconventional works by him, not originally intended for exhibition, came to light. Most notable among these is a series of views of Naples which he painted from 1782 to 1783. By breaking with the conventions of classical landscape painting in favour of direct observation, they <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work of Camille Corot and the Barbizon School in the 19th century. His autobiography, Memoirs of Thomas Jones of Penkerrig, went unpublished until 1951 but is now recognised as an important source of information on the 18th-century art world.|$|E
25|$|Every {{single year}} Feyenoord fans <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club's first {{training}} of the new season.

Around the training pitch there are several other activities held before the first and in between the first and second {{training of the}} day. No other club in the Netherlands attracts as much supporters towards the first training and the new players are positively surprised every year. Despite finishing 9th in the Eredivisie in the 2006–07 season for instance the first training of the 2007–08 season broke all records when 20,000 fans showed up to support the team and to erase the previous season out of their minds.|$|E

That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as [...] "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen". Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of [...] "share settled costless collar arrangements," [...] "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts," [...] and strategies that served [...] "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." [...] Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business.

500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E

500|$|New York {{magazine}} writer Steve Kendell said [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] was {{an excellent}} episode, and that he appreciated seeing Leslie portrayed in a sexier and more confident way than previous episodes had.

He said it showcased the deadpan comedic talents of Adam Scott, and that April and Andy continue to be an excellent pairing. The A.V.

She particularly praised Adam Scott's performance, but {{said she did not}} <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> romantic pairing of Scott and Amy Poehler because she feels they lack chemistry. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode featured great scenes about government inaction and the way small-time media can make a frenzy out of any minor thing. He also praised the subplot with April and Andy, which he said demonstrated how the two characters getting married hasn't at all changed who they are.|$|E
