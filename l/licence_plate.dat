25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> holder.|$|E
50|$|Canadian Forces {{vehicles}} that travel on regular roads display <b>licence</b> <b>plates.</b> These vehicles have <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> {{issued by the}} Department of National Defence. Domestic plates were issued by the DND after 1968. By contrast, tactical vehicles of the United States military do not bear <b>licence</b> <b>plates,</b> even if they travel regularly on public streets and highways. Prison inmates in some Canadian provinces make <b>licence</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Often, <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> {{are called}} {{registration}} plates (drivers are licensed, vehicles are registered), but the term [...] "licence plate" [...] {{is common in}} informal usage.

25|$|Vehicle <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> in Singapore are {{the same}} 520mm x 110mm size found in many European countries. Red <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> {{indicate}} that the car may be driven only during off-peak times unless a daily fee is paid. Off peak times are from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the end of January 2010, off-peak car usage is no longer restricted on Saturday, Sunday, and the days before public holidays. Off-peak <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> cost less than regular ones. Standard <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow rear plate combination and Off-peak <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> are white on red.|$|R
25|$|An {{aircraft}} registration {{is a unique}} alphanumeric string that identifies a civil aircraft, in similar fashion to a <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> on an automobile.

25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front door handles, recessed rear door handles, and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear door handles and prominent front door handles to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 1986, {{the then}} {{director}} of El Espectador, Guillermo Cano Isaza, {{was assassinated in}} front of the newspaper offices by gunmen paid by Pablo Escobar, after publishing several articles critical of Colombia's drug barons. Cano left the headquarters around 19:00 in his family station wagon. After he made a U-turn on the Avenida El Espectador, one of the hitmen approached the wagon Cano was driving, shot him in the chest four times, and then fled on a motorcycle identified with the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> FAX84. Cano was 61 years old, and had been a journalist for 44 years. His murder is still considered unpunished. The next day, El Espectadors main headline was Seguimos adelante ("We are going on").|$|E

25|$|The similar Eagle Vision, {{featured}} a smaller split-grill {{with a large}} Eagle badge in the center. The Vision's taillights, although the same shape as the Concorde's were clustered differently and featured European-inspired amber turn signals. The Vision did not share the Concorde's lightbar, instead using the area as space for a trunk-mounted license plate (as opposed to rear bumper-mounted <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> on the Concorde). On the other hand, the Intrepid incorporated very different headlight and taillight assemblies, and had no grille at all. The interior of the Concorde was also nearly identical to that the Vision, the main difference being the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem; the Intrepid's interior was substantially different from the Concorde and Vision. Concordes and Intrepids could be equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, bringing total capacity to six. The Vision could only be equipped with front bucket seats. Unlike its Dodge and Eagle siblings, Chrysler Concordes never {{had the option of}} autostick transmission and its special instrument cluster. It was only available with an automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|Since Moore, {{other actors}} played him in later series, notably Return of the Saint (1978–1979) {{starring}} Ian Ogilvy; the series ran for one season, {{although it was}} picked up by the CBS network. In the mid-1980s, the National Enquirer and other newspapers reported that Moore was planning to produce a movie based on The Saint with Pierce Brosnan as Templar, but it was never made. (Ironically Brosnan almost became Moore's immediate successor as James Bond.) A television pilot for a The Saint in Manhattan series starring Australian actor Andrew Clarke was shown on CBS in 1987 as part of the CBS Summer Playhouse; the pilot was produced by Don Taffner, but it never progressed beyond the pilot stage. Inspector John Fernack of the NYPD, played by Kevin Tighe, made his first film appearance since the 1940s in that production, while Templar (sporting a moustache) got about in a black Lamborghini bearing the ST1 <b>licence</b> <b>plate.</b> In 1989, six movies were made by Taffner starring Simon Dutton. These were syndicated in the United States as part of a series of films titled Mystery Wheel of Adventure, while in the United Kingdom they were shown as a series on ITV.|$|E
5000|$|The Polish {{military}} uses <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> {{beginning with}} [...] "U" [...] {{instead of the}} voivodeship code. The following letter denotes the usage of the vehicle.

500|$|The couple's bus {{left for}} Delhi, but en route at 4:30pm, Babli's {{relatives}} stopped the bus near Raipur Jatan village, about [...] from Pipli. They kidnapped {{the couple in}} a Scorpio SUV driven by Mandeep Singh. Kuldip Thekedar, a road contractor, witnessed the kidnapping and filed a complaint at the Butana police station in Karnal district, giving the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> number of the Scorpio. Later, Chanderpati ascribed the murder to the unauthorised withdrawal of the couple's security team ignoring the orders given by the district and sessions judge (DSJ) of Kaithal. Upon receiving no further news, Chanderpati's nephew, Narendra Singh traced the contractor, and after he was shown {{a photo of the}} couple, the contractor recognised the couple. The family then understood that Manoj and Babli were the victims of the kidnapping.|$|E
500|$|Before filming began, {{several of}} the main cast members were sent to a boot camp in South Africa and went through {{intensive}} and rigorous military training by former SAS and SBS soldiers. Stapleton and Winchester had more training than Birthistle, who {{just wanted to make}} sure she could at least be a believable soldier. The actors were trained in several aspects including running, teamwork, and weapons. Mealing meanwhile, did not go through as much training as the other actors, but did spend mornings training with a commander for the SBS who is also a military adviser on the show. Winchester recalled, [...] "Sully and I would meet every morning at 6am. We would run to a chosen location and on the way we had to memorise street names and directions and then our trainers would say 'that car that you just passed what was the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> number?' Our trainers were ex-SAS guys who made us study everything in detail, for example, we learnt step by step how to enter a room in twos, then alone. At the same time, we had to be constantly aware of where our weapon was trained." ...|$|E
500|$|A trace on the killer's <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> {{eventually}} leads Bond to Mr. Big, {{a ruthless}} gangster {{who runs a}} chain of Fillet of Soul restaurants throughout the United States. It is here that Bond first meets Solitaire, a beautiful tarot expert who has {{the power of the}} Obeah and can see both the future and remote events in the present. Mr. Big, who is actually Kananga in disguise, demands that his henchmen kill Bond, but Bond overpowers them and escapes unscathed. Bond flies to San Monique, where he meets Rosie Carver, a CIA double agent. They meet up with a friend of Bond's, Quarrel Jr., who takes them by boat near Solitaire's home. Bond suspects Rosie of working for Kananga. She is shot dead, remotely, by Kananga, to stop her confessing the truth to Bond. Inside Solitaire's house, Bond uses a stacked tarot deck of cards, that show only [...] "The Lovers", to trick her into thinking that seduction is in her future, and then seduces her. Solitaire loses her ability to foretell the future when she loses her virginity to Bond, and decides to co-operate with Bond as she has feelings for him and has grown tired of being controlled by Kananga.|$|E

500|$|Hamilton remarked, [...] "Before , gadgets {{were not}} really a part of Bond's world." [...] Production {{designer}} Ken Adam chose the DB5 {{because it was the}} latest version of the Aston Martin (in the novel Bond drove a DB Mark III, which he considered England's most sophisticated car). The company was initially reluctant, but was finally convinced to make a product placement deal. In the script, the car was armed only with a smoke screen, but every crew member began suggesting gadgets to install in it: Hamilton conceived the revolving <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> because he had been getting lots of parking tickets, while his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which he saw on television). A gadget near the lights that would drop sharp nails was replaced with an oil dispenser because the producers thought the original could be easily copied by viewers. Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car over six weeks. The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice, with the second take being used in the film. The first take, in which the car drives through the fake wall, {{can be seen in the}} trailer. Two of the gadgets were not installed in the car: the wheel-destroying spikes, inspired by Ben-Hurs scythed chariots, were entirely made in-studio; and the ejector seat used a seat thrown by compressed air, with a dummy sitting atop it. Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for Thunderball.|$|E
