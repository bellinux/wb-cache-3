It differs from other U.S. stock market indices, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Nasdaq Composite index, because of its diverse constituency and weighting methodology.

500|$|Few {{of the new}} {{magazines}} launched {{during the}} boom lasted {{until the end of}} the war, which brought paper shortages that forced difficult decisions on the publishers. [...] Not every magazine cancellation was because of the war; the usual vicissitudes of magazine publishing also played a role. [...] In 1941, Silberkleit cancelled Science Fiction after 12 issues because of poor sales, merging it with Future Fiction. Two years later Silberkleit ceased publication of both Future and Science Fiction Quarterly when he decided to use the limited paper he could acquire for his western and detective titles instead. [...] Both Science Fiction and Future eventually reappeared in the 1950s. [...] Fantastic Novels merged with its stablemate, Famous Fantastic Mysteries, in 1941, probably because of wartime difficulties, after only five issues. [...] In 1942 Famous Fantastic Mysteries was sold by Munsey to Popular, who were already the publishers of Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories. [...] Mary Gnaedinger continued as editor, but the editorial policy changed to exclude reprints of stories that had appeared in magazine form. [...] Booklength work was still reprinted, including G. K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday and H. G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau. [...] In the event, Famous Fantastic Mysteries was the only one of Popular's science fiction and fantasy titles to survive the war. Both Astonishing and Super Science Stories ceased publication in 1943 when Frederik Pohl, the editor of both titles, enlisted in the army; the publisher was having difficulty obtaining enough paper and decided to close the magazines down. [...] The same year, paper shortages forced John Campbell to choose between Astounding and Unknown, which had already gone to a bimonthly schedule; he decided to keep Astounding on a monthly schedule, and Unknown ceased publication with the October 1943 issue. [...] Astounding switched to digest format the following month; this was a <b>leading</b> <b>indicator</b> for the direction the field would take, though it would be over a decade before the rest of the field followed suit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the recession}} in 2008 / 2009 in Germany, {{which is very}} different from previous recessions, in particular regarding its cause and magnitude. We show to what extent forecasters and forecasts based on <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> fail to detect the timing and the magnitude of the recession. This study shows that large forecast errors for both expert forecasts and forecasts based on <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> resulted during this recession which implies that the recession was very difficult to forecast. However, some <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> (survey data, risk spreads, stock prices) have indicated an economic downturn and hence, beat univariate time series models. Although the combination of individual forecasts provides an improvement compared to the benchmark model, the combined forecasts are worse than several individual models. A comparison of expert forecasts with the best forecasts based on <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> shows only minor deviations. Overall, the range for an improvement of expert forecasts during the crisis compared to indicator forecasts is relatively small. <b>leading</b> <b>indicators,</b> recession, consensus forecast, non-linearities...|$|R

The analysis examined the temporal relationships between the safety performance indicators measured at the project, including traditional lagging indicators, as well as expected <b>leading</b> <b>indicators.</b> The purpose of the research was to uncover time dependent relationships and explore causal relationships between indicators. The analysis revealed complex interactions between safety indicators over time. Notably, the expected <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> behaved as both <b>leading</b> and lagging <b>indicators</b> {{in relation to the}} project total recordable injury frequency rate. This finding suggested a cyclical relationship between management actions relating to safety and the rate of safety incidents. This cyclical relationship is unlikely to produce long term sustained improvement in safety performance. The expected <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> of safety were also inter-related with one another in complex ways. The results indicate that assumptions underpinning the use of <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> should be reconsidered. In particular, the findings challenge the assumption that <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> measured at one point in time can predict safety outcomes at a subsequent point in time.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{construct}} <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> that anticipate inflation cycle turning points on a real time monitoring basis. As a first step, turning points of the IPCA inflation are determined using a periodic stochastic Markov switching model. These turning points are the event timing that the <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> should anticipate. A dynamic factor model is then used to extract common cyclical movements {{in a set of}} variables that display predictive content for inflation. The <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> are designed to serve as practical tools to assist real-time monitoring of monetary policy on a month-to-month basis. Thus, the indicators are built and ranked according to their out-of-sample forecasting performance. The <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> are found to be an informative tool for signaling future phases of the inflation cycle out-of-sample, even in real time when only preliminary and unrevised data are available. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The goal of <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> {{for safety}} is to {{identify}} the potential for an accident before it occurs. Past efforts have focused on identifying general <b>leading</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as maintenance backlog, that apply widely in an industry or even across industries. Other recommendations produce more system-specific <b>leading</b> <b>indicators,</b> but start from system hazard analysis and thus are limited by the causes considered by the traditional hazard analysis techniques. Most rely on quantitative metrics, often based on probabilistic risk assessments. This paper describes a new and different approach to identifying system-specific <b>leading</b> <b>indicators</b> and provides guidance in designing a risk management structure to generate, monitor and use the results. The approach {{is based on the}} STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) model of accident causation and tools that have been designed to build on that model. STAMP extends current accident causality to include more complex causes than simply component failures and chains of failure events or deviations from operational expectations. It incorporates basic principles of systems thinking and is based on systems theory rathe...|$|R
