40|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) {{have been}} widely used as antidepressants. However, it remains unclear whether a {{difference}} exists between non-selective MAO inhibitors and selective MAO-A inhibitors in terms of their antidepressant effects. Using in vivo microdialysis methods, we measured extracellular noradrenaline and serotonin levels following administration of Ro 41 - 1049, a reversible MAO-A inhibitor and/or <b>lazabemide,</b> a reversible MAO-B inhibitor in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. We examined the effect of local infusion of β-phenylethylamine to the mPFC of rats on extracellular noradrenaline and serotonin levels. Furthermore, the concentrations of β-phenylethylamine in the tissue of the mPFC after combined treatment with Ro 41 - 1049 and <b>lazabemide</b> were measured. The Ro 41 - 1049 alone and the combined treatment significantly increased extracellular noradrenaline levels compared with vehicle and <b>lazabemide</b> alone. Furthermore, the combined treatment increased noradrenaline levels significantly more than Ro 41 - 1049 alone did. The Ro 41 - 1049 alone and the combined treatment significantly increased extracellular serotonin levels compared with vehicle and <b>lazabemide</b> alone, but no difference in serotonin levels was found between the combined treatment group and the Ro 41 - 1049 group. Local infusion of low-dose β-phenylethylamine increased extracellular noradrenaline levels, but not that of serotonin. Only the combined treatment significantly increased β-phenylethylamine levels in tissues of the mPFC.

Male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected with 12. 5 μg 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) into the right median forebrain bundle to induce a unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal tract. After 6 weeks, test drugs were administered either alone or in combination with L-DOPA (L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylamine) and the circling behaviour of animals was monitored as an index of anti-Parkinsonian activity. Intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of the irreversible MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl (20 mg kg− 1) or the imidazoline I 2 -site ligands BU 224 (14 mg kg− 1) and 2 -BFI (7 and 14 mg kg− 1) produced significant increases in ipsiversive rotations compared to vehicle controls totaling, at the highest respective doses tested, 521 ± 120, 131 ± 37 and 92. 5 ± 16. 3 net contraversive rotations in 30 (deprenyl) or 60 (BU 224 and 2 -BFI) min. In contrast, the reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide (2. 5 – 10 mg kg− 1) and the reversible MAO-B inhibitor <b>lazabemide</b> (2. 5 – 10 mg kg− 1) failed to instigate significant rotational behaviour compared to vehicle. Coadministration of <b>lazabemide</b> (10 mg kg− 1), moclobemide (10 mg kg− 1) or 2 -BFI (14 mg kg− 1) with L-DOPA (20 mg kg− 1) significantly increased either the duration or total number of contraversive rotations emitted over the testing period in comparison to L-DOPA alone. These data suggest that I 2 -specific ligands have dual effects in the 6 -OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease; a first effect associated with an increase in activity in the intact hemisphere, probably via an increase in striatal dopamine content, and a secondary action which, through the previously documented inhibition of MAO-A and/or MAO-B, increases the availability of dopamine produced by L-DOPA...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the deamination of dopamine in the intact pulmonary circulation of isolated lungs of the rat. The first part of the study showed that dopamine is not converted to noradrenaline by dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) when dopamine is perfused through isolated lung preparations with monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibited. Hence, it was not necessary to inhibit DBH in subsequent experiments. The metabolite profile for deamination of dopamine in the lungs was examined by determining whether MAO and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAO) contribute to the deamination of dopamine (and noradrenaline), and by determining the activity of MAO (kMAO) for the metabolism of dopamine. Lungs were perfused with I nmol/l 3 H-dopamine or 3 H-noradrenaline with COMT inhibited and, in experiments to determine the contribution of SSAO to deamination, with MAO inhibited. Inhibition of MAO reduced the deamination of dopamine and noradrenaline by 99. 8 % and 98. 6 %, respectively, indicating that MAO, and not SSAO, was responsible for deamination of the catecholamines in the lungs. The kMAO value for deamination of dopamine was 3. 89 min- 1. Further experiments were carried out to determine the contributions of MAO-A and MAO-B to the deamination of dopamine in lungs perfused with 1 nmol/l 3 H-dopamine and 100 nmol/ 1 <b>lazabemide</b> or 300 nmol/I Ro 41 - 1049, respectively. The values of kMAO-A and kMAO-B were 3. 05 min- 1 and 0. 626 min- 1, respectively. It was concluded that, in rat lungs, MAO-A contributed 78 - 84 % and MAO-B 16 - 22 % to the total deamination of dopamine and SSAO had no significant role in its pulmonary metabolism. These relative contributions of MAO-A and MAO-B to the deamination of dopamine are very similar to those that have been determined previously for noradrenaline, but the rate constant for deamination of dopamine is 26 -fold greater than that for noradrenaline in rat lungs...|$|E

40|$|MSc (Pharmaceutical Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{affecting the}} central nervous system, primarily, the substantia nigra. It is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigro-striatal pathway, and ultimately patients with Parkinson’s disease may lose up to 80 % of their dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Symptoms include bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, resting tremor and impaired postural balance. Symptomatic relief is obtained by using levodopa and various adjunct therapy including dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. Levodopa is used as the gold-standard for treatment of this disease. It effectively controls motor symptoms, however, motor complications that impair {{the quality of life}} develop with continued levodopa use. No treatments currently available can halt disease progression, therefore novel drugs that can slow down or stop disease progression are urgently required. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B enzymes are flavoenzymes that {{play an important role in}} the oxidative degradation of amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and epinephrine. Early attempts to block dopamine metabolism in the brain using nonselective MAO inhibitors was effective but led to side effects such as hypertensive crisis, thus they lost favor. The MAO-B enzyme is of particular importance in Parkinson’s disease because it is more active than MAO-A in the basal ganglia, and is thus primarily responsible for the catabolism of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline and rasagiline, both irreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitors have proven efficacy in symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease, but due to the irreversible nature of their binding, it can take several weeks after treatment termination for the enzyme to recover. Use of reversible inhibitors such as <b>lazabemide</b> and safinamide do not have this disadvantage, and have safer side effect profiles. Unfortunately, clinical trials for <b>lazabemide</b> use in Parkinson’s disease have been discontinued. Therefore, due to the lack of disease modifying agents for Parkinson’s disease, as well as safety concerns of current PD therapy, an urgent need exists for novel, safe and efficient MAO inhibitors. Current research is thus aimed at designing selective or non-selective reversible inhibitors that bind competitively to the enzyme. The MAO inhibitory potential of chromone derivatives has been illustrated previously. Evaluation of C 6 - and C 7 -alkyloxy substituted chromones, for example revealed that these compounds were potent, selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitors. It has further been shown that chromone 3 -carboxylic acid is a potent selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor. Phenylcarboxamide substitution in position 3 of chromone 3 -carboxylic acid also results in potent, selective MAO-B inhibitory activity. Therefore, further evaluation of the effect of substitution with flexible side chains in the 3 -position to evaluate MAO-B inhibition is of importance. The chromone ring system is thus a privileged scaffold for the design of inhibitors that are selective for MAO-B and has the additional advantages of generally exhibiting low mammalian toxicity and ease of synthesis. AIM The aim of this study was to design, synthesize and evaluate novel chromone derivatives as inhibitors of monoamine oxidase. RESULTS Design and Synthesis 3 -Aminomethylene- 2, 4 -chromandiones and ester chromone derivatives were synthesized by coupling several aromatic and aliphatic amines and alcohols, to chromone 3 -carboxylic acid, in the presence of CDI (carbonyldiimidazole). 15 Compounds were successfully synthesized and characterized by using NMR and IR spectroscopy, as well as mass spectrometry. X-ray crystallography was used to obtain a crystal structure for the 3 -aminomethylene- 2, 4 - chromandione derivative, 46, in a bid to verify the structures of the synthesized compounds. Melting points of all compounds were determined, and the purity determined using HPLC techniques. MAO inhibition studies A fluorometric assay was employed using kynuramine as substrate, to determine the IC 50 (50 % inhibition concentration) values and SI (selectivity index) of the synthesized compounds. Generally, the esters exhibited weak MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition, while the 3 - aminomethylene- 2, 4 -chromandione derivatives showed promise as selective MAO-B inhibitors, with IC 50 values in the micromolar range. Compound 38, 3 - [(benzylamino) methylidene]- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 2, 4 -dione, was the most potent MAO-B inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 0. 638 μM and a SI of 122 for MAO-B inhibition. Interesting trends were revealed through analysis of the structure activity relationships, for example, for the 3 -aminomethylene- 2, 4 -chromandione derivatives, the presence of a chlorine moiety in the side chains of the compounds resulted in a decrease of MAO-B inhibition activity. Chain elongation further also resulted in weakening the MAO-B inhibition activity, while chain elongation in the ester derivatives led to a slight increase in MAO-B inhibition activity. Reversibility studies The reversibility of binding of the most potent compound in the 3 -aminomethylene- 2, 4 - chromandione series, 38, was evaluated. None of the synthesized inhibitors were potent MAO-A inhibitors, therefore reversibility of MAO-A inhibition was not examined. Recovery of enzyme activity was determined after dialysis of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Analysis of the kinetic data obtained showed that MAO-B catalytic activity was recovered to 115 % of the control value. This suggests that compound 38 is a reversible inhibitor of MAO-B. Mode of inhibition A set of Lineweaver-Burk plots were constructed to determine mode of inhibition of compound 38. The results show linear lines that intersect at a single point just to the left on the y-axis. This indicates that compound 38 interacts competitively with the MAO-B enzyme. In conclusion, chromone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of MAO. Compound 38 was the most potent MAO-B inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 0. 638 μM. The effect of chain elongation and introduction of flexible substituents in position 3 of the chromone 3 -carboxylic acid nucleus was explored and the results showed that 3 - aminomethylene- 2, 4 -chromandione substitution is preferable over ester substitution.

40|$|The in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{characteristics}} of the I 2 binding site were probed using the technique of drug discrimination and receptor autoradiography. Data presented in this thesis indicates the I 2 ligand 2 -BFI generates a cue in drug discrimination. Further studies indicated agmatine, a proposed endogenous imidazoline ligand, {{and a number of}} imidazoline and imidazole analogues of 2 -BFI substitute significantly for 2 -BFI. In addition to specific I 2 ligands the administration of NRl's (noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), the sympathomimetic d-amphetamine, the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, but not the β 1 agonist dobutamine or the β 2 agonist salbutamol, gave rise to significant levels of substitution for the 2 -BFI cue. The administration of the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist WB 4101, prior to 2 - BFI itself significantly reduced levels of 2 -BFI appropriate responding. Administration of the reversible MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and Ro 41 - 1049, but not the reversible MAO-B inhibitors <b>lazabemide</b> and Ro 16 - 6491, gave rise to potent dose dependent levels of substitution for the 2 -BFI cue. Further studies indicated the administration of a number of β-carbolines and the structurally related indole alkaloid ibogaine also gave rise to dose dependent significant levels of substitution. Due to the relationship of indole alkaloids to serotonin the 5 -HT releaser fenfluramine and a number of SSRI's (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were also administered and these compounds gave rise to significant partial (20 - 80 % responses to the 2 -BFI lever) levels of substitution. The autoradiographical studies reported here indicate [3 H] 2 -BFI labels I 2 sites within the rat arcuate nucleus, area postrema, pineal gland, interpeduncular nucleus and subfornical organ. Subsequent experiments confirmed that the drug discrimination dosing schedule significantly increases levels of [3 H] 2 -BFI 12 binding within two of these nuclei. However, levels of [3 H] 2 -BFI specific binding were significantly reduced within four of these nuclei after chronic treatment with the irreversible MAO inhibitors deprenyl and tranylcypromine but not pargyline, which only reduced levels significantly in two. Further autoradiographical studies indicated that the distribution of [3 H] 2 -BFI within the C 57 /B mouse compares favourably to that within the rat. Comparison of these levels of binding to those from transgenic mice who over-express MAO-B indicates two possibly distinct populations of [3 H] 2 -BFI 12 sites exist in mouse brain. The data presented here indicates the 2 -BFI cue is associated with the selective activation of α 1 -adrenoceptors and possibly 5 -HT receptors. 2 -BFI trained rats recognise reversible MAO-A but not MAO-B inhibitors. However, data within this thesis indicates the autoradiographical distribution of I 2 sites bears a closer resemblance to that of MAO-B not MAO-A and further studies using transgenic mice that over-express MAO-B suggests a non-MAO-B I 2 site exists in mouse brain...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Background and rationale: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, {{degenerative}} {{disorder of}} {{the central nervous system}} and is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The loss of functional dopamine in the striatum is thought to be responsible for the typical symptoms of PD. Cardinal features of PD include bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, resting tremor and impairment of postural balance. This study focuses on the inhibition of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and antagonism of A 2 A receptors as therapeutic strategies for PD. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) -containing mitochondrial bound isoenzyme which consists of two isoforms namely MAO-A and MAO-B. The primary function of MAO is to catalyze the oxidative deamination of dietary amines, monoamine neurotransmitters and hormones. MAO-A is responsible for the oxidative deamination of serotonin (5 -HT) and norepinephrine (NE), while MAO-B is responsible for the oxidative deamination of dopamine (DA). The formation of DA takes place in the presynaptic neuron where it is stored in vesicles and released into the presynaptic cleft. The released DA then either binds to D 1 and D 2 receptors which results in an effector response. The excess DA in the presynaptic cleft is metabolized by MAO-B which may result in the formation of free radicals and a decrease in DA concentrations. Under normal physiological conditions free radicals are removed from the body via normal physiological processes, but in PD these normal physiological processes are thought to be unable to remove the radicals and this may lead to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is believed {{to be one of the}} leading causes of neurodegeneration in PD. The rationale for the use of MAO-B inhibitors in PD would be to increase the natural DA levels in the brain and also diminish the likelihood of free radicals to be formed. Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside and yields a variety of physiological effects. Four adenosine receptor subtypes have been characterized: A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B and A 3. They are all part of the G-protein-coupled receptor family and have seven transmembrane domains. The A 2 A receptor is highly concentrated in the striatum. There are two important pathways in the basal ganglia (BG) through which striatal information reaches the globus pallidus, namely the direct pathway containing A 1 and D 1 receptors and the indirect pathway containing A 2 A and D 2 receptors. The direct pathway facilitates willed movement and the indirect pathway inhibits willed movement. A balance of the two pathways is necessary for normal movement. In PD, there is a decrease in DA in the striatum, thus leading to unopposed A 2 A receptor signaling and ultimately resulting in overactivity of the indirect pathway. Overactivity of the indirect pathway results in the locomotor symptoms associated with PD. Treatment with an A 2 A antagonist will block the A 2 A receptor, resulting in the restoration of balance between the indirect and direct pathways, thus leading to a decrease in locomotor symptoms. Aim: In this study, caffeine served as a lead compound for the design of dual-targeted drugs that are selective, reversible MAO-B inhibitors as well as A 2 A antagonists. Caffeine is a very weak MAO-B inhibitor and a moderately potent A 2 A antagonist. Substitution on the C 8 position of caffeine yields compounds with good MAO-B inhibition activities and A 2 A receptor affinities. An example of this behaviour is found with (E) - 8 -(3 -chlorostyryl) caffeine (CSC), which is not only a potent A 2 A antagonist but also a potent MAO-B inhibitor. The goal of this study was to identify and synthesize dual-targeted xanthine compounds. Recently Swanepoel and co-workers (2012) found that 8 -phenoxymethyl substituted caffeines are potent reversible inhibitors of MAO-B. Therefore, this study focused on expanding the 8 -(phenoxymethyl) caffeine series and evaluating the resulting compounds as both MAO-A and -B inhibitors as well as A 2 A antagonists. Synthesis: Two series were synthesized namely the 8 -(phenoxymethyl) caffeines and 1, 3 -diethyl- 7 -methyl- 8 -(phenoxymethyl) xanthines. The analogues were synthesized according to the literature procedure. 1, 3 -Dimethyl- 5, 6 -diaminouracil or 1, 3 -diethyl- 5, 6 -diaminouracil were used as starting materials and were acylated with a suitable substituted phenoxyacetic acid in the presence of N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -N’-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) as an activating reagent. The intermediary amide was treated with sodium hydroxide, which resulted in ring closure to yield the corresponding 1, 3 -dimethyl- 8 -phenoxymethyl- 7 Hxanthinyl or 1, 3 -diethyl- 8 -phenoxymethyl- 7 H-xanthinyl analogues. These xanthines were 7 -N-methylated in the presence of an excess of potassium carbonate and iodomethane to yield the target compounds. In vitro evaluation: A radioligand binding assay was performed to determine the affinities of the synthesized compounds for the A 2 A receptor. The MAO-B inhibition studies were carried out via a fluorometric assay where the MAO-catalyzed formation of H 2 O 2 was measured. Results: Both series showed good to moderate MAO-B inhibition activities, while none of the compounds had activity towards MAO-A. Results were comparable to that of a known MAOB inhibitor <b>lazabemide.</b> For example, <b>lazabemide</b> (IC 50 = 0. 091 μM) was twice as potent as the most potent compound identified in this study, 8 -(3 -chlorophenoxymethyl) caffeine (compound 3; IC 50 = 0. 189 μM). Two additional compounds, 8 -(4 -iodophenoxymethyl) caffeine and 8 -(3, 4 -dimethylphenoxymethyl) caffeine, also exhibited submicromolar IC 50 values for the inhibition of MAO-B. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) indicated that 1, 3 -diethyl substitution resulted in decreased inhibition potency towards MAO-B and that 1, 3 -dimethyl substitution was a more suitable substitution pattern, leading to better inhibition potencies towards MAO-B. The compounds were also evaluated for A 2 A binding affinity, and relatively weak affinities were recorded with the most potent compound, 1, 3 -diethyl- 7 -methyl- 8 -[4 -chlorophenoxymethyl]xanthine (compound 16), exhibiting a Ki value of 0. 923 μM. Compared to KW- 6002 (Ki = 7. 94 nM), a potent reference A 2 A antagonist, compound 16 was 35 -fold less potent. Comparing compound 16 to CSC [Ki(A 2 A) = 22. 6 nM; IC 50 (MAO-B) = 0. 146 nM], it was found that compound 16 is 31 -fold less potent as an A 2 A antagonist and 21 -fold less potent as a MAO-B inhibitor. Loss of MAO-B inhibition potency may be attributed to 1, 3 -diethyl substitution which correlates with similar conclusions reached in earlier studies. In addition, the replacement of the styryl functional group (as found with CSC and KW- 6002) with the phenoxymethyl functional group (as found with the present series) may explain the general reduction in affinity for the A 2 A receptor. This suggests that the styryl side chain is more appropriate for A 2 A antagonism than the phenoxymethyl functional group. Conclusion: In this study two series of xanthine derivatives were successfully synthesized, namely the 8 -(phenoxymethyl) caffeines and 1, 3 -diethyl- 7 -methyl- 8 -(phenoxymethyl) xanthines (11 compounds in total). Three of the newly synthesized compounds were found to act as potent inhibitors of MAO-B, with IC 50 values in the submicromolar range. None of the compounds were however noteworthy MAO-A inhibitors. The most potent A 2 A antagonist among the examined compounds, compound 16, proved to be moderately potent compared to the reference antagonists, CSC and KW- 6002. It may be concluded that the styryl functional group (as found with CSC and KW- 6002) is more optimal than the phenoxymethyl functional group (as found with the present series) for A 2 A antagonism. 1, 3 -Diethyl substitution of the xanthine ring was found to be less optimal for MAO-B inhibition compared to 1, 3 -dimethyl substitution.

It {{is the second most}} common age-related neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). PD occurs when there is a dramatic loss of dopamine (DA) in the striatum, a substructure of the basal ganglia, of the brain due to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway that contains the dopaminergic neurons. Motor symptoms of PD include bradykinesia, muscular rigidity and resting tremors. Non-motor symptoms include speech and sleep problems, hallucinations and depression. Diverse treatment options are available to treat the symptoms of PD, including levodopa (L-Dopa), DA agonists and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors. The MAOs are flavoproteins that are bound to the outer membrane of the mitochondria and catalyze the oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5 -HT), noradrenaline (NA) and DA. Two isoforms occur, namely MAO-A and –B, which share a 70 % sequence identity. MAO-A catalyzes the oxidation of 5 -HT and MAO-B has a substrate specificity towards benzylamine and 2 -phenylethylamine. DA, NA, adrenaline and tryptamine are oxidized by both forms. MAO-A {{plays an important role in}} depression while MAO-B plays an important role in PD. The two isoforms are not evenly distributed in the brain. Of particular relevance to PD is the observation that, in the basal ganglia, MAO-B is the predominant form and the oxidation of DA in this region is largely due to MAO-B activity. Also, with an increase in age, there is an up to fourfold increase in MAO-B activity in the brain. In the aged parkinsonian brain, MAO-B is therefore a major DA metabolizing enzyme and MAO-B inhibitors have an important role in the therapy of PD. MAO-B inhibitors may potentially reduce the metabolic destruction of DA and thereby provide relief from the symptoms of PD. MAO-B inhibitors may also exert a neuroprotective effect in PD. In the catalytic cycle of MAO-B, one mole each of an aldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia are formed for each mole of primary amine substrate oxidized. Ferrous iron, which is abundant in the basal ganglia, may react with the hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton reaction. The hydroxyl radical damages virtually all types of biomolecules including proteins, DNA, lipids, carbohydrates and amino acids. The aldehyde, in turn, may react with amino groups of proteins, and thus lead to cell injury. Inhibitors of MAO-B may reduce the MAO-catalyzed formation of hydrogen peroxide and aldehydes in the basal ganglia, and thus act as neuroprotective agents. MAO-B inhibitors that are currently being used in the treatment of PD are selegiline and rasagiline. Both are irreversible inhibitors of MAO-B. While irreversible inhibitors of MAO have been used extensively as drugs, irreversible inhibition has a number of disadvantages. These include the loss of selectivity as a result of repeated drug administration and a slow and variable rate of enzyme recovery following termination of drug treatment. The turnover rate for the biosynthesis of MAO-B in the human brain may require as much as 40 days while with reversible inhibition, enzyme activity is recovered when the inhibitor is eliminated from the tissues. For these reasons the discovery of novel MAO-B inhibitors, which interact reversibly with the enzymes are of value in the therapy of PD. The goal of this study was to design novel and reversible inhibitors of MAO-B, which may find application in the therapy of PD. In the current study, caffeine was used as scaffold for the design of new MAO inhibitors. Caffeine is reported to be a weak inhibitor of MAO-B, with an IC 50 value of 5084 μM. Substitution at C- 8 of the caffeine moiety, however, yields compounds with potent MAO-B inhibitory properties. Of particular importance to this study is a recent report that a series of 8 -sulfanylcaffeine analogues acts as selective inhibitors of human MAO-B. Among the compounds examined, 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine was found to be a particularly potent MAO-B inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 0. 223 μM. In an attempt to further enhance the MAO-B inhibition potency of 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine, and possibly to discover highly potent MAO-B inhibitors, a series of five 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine analogues was synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of human MAO-A and –B. For the purpose of this study 8 - [(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine homologues containing C- 3 alkyl (CF 3, CH 3 and OCH 3) and halogen (Cl and Br) substituents on the phenyl ring were considered. Furthermore, a series of two 8 -sulfinylcaffeine analogues and one 8 -sulfonylcaffeine were synthesized and their MAO inhibitory potencies were measured. The purpose with these compounds was to compare the MAO inhibitory properties of the 8 -sulfinylcaffeine analogues and 8 -sulfonylcaffeine with those of the 8 -sulfanylcaffeine analogues. This study also investigates the MAO inhibition properties of three selected 8 -[(phenylpropyl) sulfanyl]caffeine and two 8 -(benzylsulfanyl) caffeine analogues. Chemistry: The target 8 -sulfanylcaffeine analogues were synthesized according to the literature procedure. 8 -Chlorocaffeine was reacted with an appropriate mercaptan in the presence of NaOH, to yield the target 8 -sulfanylcaffeine analogues in yields of 6. 4 – 50. 7 %. 8 -Chlorocaffeine, in turn, was conveniently synthesized in high yield by reacting chlorine with caffeine in chloroform. In certain instances, the mercaptan starting materials were not commercially available and were thus synthesized according to the literature procedure by reacting an appropriate alkylbromide with thiourea. The resulting thiouronium salt was hydrolyzed in the presence of NaOH to yield the target mercaptan. The 8 -sulfinylcaffeine analogues and 8 - sulfonylcaffeine were synthesized by reacting the 8 -sulfanylcaffeines with H 2 O 2 in the presence of glacial acetic acid and acetic anhydride. The structures and the purities of the inhibitors were verified by NMR, MS and HPLC analyses. MAO inhibition studies: The MAO inhibitory properties of the test compounds were examined using the recombinant human enzymes. The mixed MAO-A/B substrate, kynuramine, was employed as substrate for both enzymes and the inhibition potencies were expressed as the IC 50 values. The 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine analogues were found to be highly potent inhibitors of MAO-B. The IC 50 values recorded for these homologues ranged from 0. 017 – 0. 125 μM, making them twofold to 13 -fold more potent MAO-B inhibitors than the lead compound, 8 - [(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine (IC 50 = 0. 223 μM). For comparison, the reversible MAO-B selective inhibitor, <b>lazabemide,</b> exhibits an IC 50 value of 0. 091 μM under the same conditions (unpublished data from our laboratory). Interestingly, both alkyl (CF 3, CH 3 and OCH 3) and halogen (Cl and Br) substitution lead to highly potent MAO-B inhibition. It may therefore be concluded that substitution on C- 3 is a general strategy to enhance the MAO-B inhibition potency of 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeine. The results of the MAO inhibitory studies with the 8 - [(phenylpropyl) sulfanyl]caffeine analogues showed that these compounds are also inhibitors of MAO-B with IC 50 values of 0. 061 – 0. 500 μM. Those homologues substituted with chlorine on the para and meta positions of the phenyl ring were found to be exceptionally potent inhibitors with IC 50 values of 0. 061 μM and 0. 062 μM, respectively. For the series of 8 - (benzylsulfanyl) caffeines, meta substitution with chlorine (IC 50 = 0. 227 μM) and bromine (IC 50 = 0. 199 μM) was also found to enhance the MAO-B inhibition potency of 8 - (benzylsulfanyl) caffeine (IC 50 = 1. 86 μM). The results document that the 8 -sulfinylcaffeines are also inhibitors of MAO-B with IC 50 values of 11. 8 – 131 μM. The 8 -sulfonylcaffeine was also found to be a MAO-B inhibitor. Compared to the 8 -sulfanylcaffeines, these homologues are, however, weaker inhibitors. It may, therefore, be concluded that 8 -sulfinylcaffeines and 8 -sulfonylcaffeines are comparatively weak MAO-B inhibitors and less suited for the design of high potency MAO-B inhibitors. The results also document that the 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeines are relatively weak MAO-A inhibitors with IC 50 values of 5. 66 – 141 μM, with one homologue exhibiting no inhibition under the experimental conditions. As evident from the selectivity indices (SI values), the 8 - [(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeines were all selective inhibitors of the MAO-B isoform. Two compounds exhibited SI values in excess of 1000. Since these compounds are also highly potent MAO-B inhibitors, they represent suitable leads for the design of potent and selective MAO-B inhibitors. The 8 -sulfinylcaffeines and 8 -sulfonylcaffeine were found to be weak MAO-A inhibitors with IC 50 values of 166 – 250 μM. The SI values demonstrate that these compounds are MAO-B selective inhibitors, although to a lesser degree than the 8 - [(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeines. The 8 -[(phenylpropyl) sulfanyl]caffeines are also MAO-A inhibitors with IC 50 values of 0. 708 – 6. 48 μM. It is noteworthy that these homologues are the most potent MAO-A inhibitors among the compounds evaluated in this study. In fact, one of the 8 -[(phenylpropyl) sulfanyl]caffeines, 8 -{[3 -(4 -chlorophenyl) propyl]sulfanyl}caffeine (IC 50 = 0. 708 μM), is the only compound with an IC 50 value for the inhibition of MAO-A in the submicromolar range. The 8 -[(phenylpropyl) sulfanyl]caffeines display, in general, lower degrees of selectivity for MAO-B than the corresponding 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeines. Reversibility studies: The reversibility of the interaction of a representative inhibitor, 8 -{[2 -(3 - (trifluoromethyl) phenyl) ethyl]sulfanyl}caffeine, with MAO-B was investigated by evaluating the recovery of the enzymatic activity after dilution of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. For this purpose, MAO-B was preincubated with the test compound at concentrations of 10 × IC 50 and 100 × IC 50 for 30 min. The reactions were subsequently diluted 100 -fold to 0. 1 × IC 50 and 1 × IC 50, respectively. The results show that, after dilution to 0. 1 × IC 50 and 1 × IC 50, the MAO-B catalytic activities are recovered to 35 % and 22 %, respectively, of the control value. For reversible enzyme inhibition, the enzyme activities are expected to recover to levels of approximately 90 % and 50 %, respectively, after 100 -fold dilution of the preincubations containing inhibitor concentrations of 10 × IC 50 and 100 × IC 50. After preincubation of MAO-B with the irreversible inhibitor (R) -deprenyl (at 10 × IC 50), and dilution of the resulting complex to 0. 1 × IC 50, MAO-B activity is not recovered (3. 0 % of control). These data indicate that the test compound does indeed react reversibly with MAO-B but because enzyme activities are not recovered to the expected 90 % and 50 % respectively, it may suggest that the test compound possess a quasi-reversible or tight-binding component. Hansch-type structure activity relationship studies: A limited Hansch-type QSAR study was performed for the inhibition of MAO by the 8 -[(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeines. For this purpose, five parameters were used to describe the physicochemical properties of the C- 3 substituents on the phenyl rings of the inhibitors. The Van der Waals volume (Vw) and Taft steric parameter (Es) served as descriptors of the bulkiness of the substituents, while the lipophilicities were described by the Hansch constant (π). The electronic properties were described by the classical Hammett constant (σm) and the Swain-Lupton constant (F). A one-parameter fit with the Taft steric parameter versus the inhibition potency (logIC 50) yielded the best correlation with a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 912 and a statistical F value of 41. 27 (Fmax = 35). The positive sign of the Es (+ 0. 47) parameter coefficient indicated that the inhibition potencies of the 8 - [(phenylethyl) sulfanyl]caffeines towards MAO-B may be enhanced by substitution with sterically large groups at C- 3 of the phenyl rings of the inhibitors.
