30|$|Now {{displace}} the subtalar osteotomy by levering the calcaneus to move distal and medial {{using a small}} Hohmann elevator. This takes time and patience to get the calcaneus to move. It should slide medial-distally and not wedge open on the <b>lateral</b> <b>side.</b> Its cut <b>surfaces</b> should remain in contact. Once the calcaneus is medialized, varusized and distalized, it should be pinned with two retrograde wires through the foot. Advance these pins from the calcaneus to the talus across the ankle joint {{to the level of}} the distal tibial physis. Remove the two temporary medial pins crossing the ankle joint (Fig.  26).|$|R

40|$|International audienceScanning and {{transmission}} electron microscopy analyses have been performed for tiles extracted from the toroidal pump limiter of Tore Supra for erosion- and deposition-dominated zones. Deposit thicknesses have been estimated for the plasma-facing top and the gap <b>side</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Deposit thickness profiles have been measured inside gaps, showing that deposition mainly occurs in the first millimetre and that both poloidal and toroidal gap deposition is asymmetric. Quantitative information on the deposit volume and on D-retention are thus obtained from these measurements. Carbon probed at the tile top surfaces is mainly amorphous carbon, due either to the amorphization induced by ion bombardment in the erosion dominated zone, or to deposit formation processes in the deposition-dominated zones. Deposits are tip-shaped and are oriented, which should give information on transport processes...|$|R
30|$|This {{boundary}} value problem was also solved by the finite element method, but already for {{the case of a}} plane deformed state. The model sample was {{in the form of a}} square with side H (Fig. 5). There was a microdefect on the <b>lateral</b> <b>side.</b> It has the form of a small notch shaped like an elongated half-ellipse The distance between the edges of the notch h 1 is 0.05 H, and its length h 2 [*]=[*] 0.075 H. The sample is stretched vertically due to the displacement of the upper and lower faces, and the <b>side</b> <b>surfaces</b> are free.|$|R

40|$|This study {{introduces}} a turning function based technique to classify foot outlines. Foot scans from ten males and ten females were obtained using a laser scanner. The similarities {{among the different}} foot shapes were assessed based on the Euclidean distance between turning functions. Thereafter, average linkage clustering was used to classify the differing foot outlines. Two distinct shape groups emerged for both medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>sides.</b> The {{presence or absence of}} a medial bulge results in two clusters on the medial side. Similarly, a narrow <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> with more concavity and a wider <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> in the midfoot region are the two clusters for the <b>lateral</b> <b>side.</b> More males (60 %) showed a bulge on the medial side. The group that belongs to the narrower <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> were predominantly females (70 %). These differences {{in the structure of the}} clusters were reflected in the lack of a correlation between the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> clusters. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Injuries to the <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> of {{the knee}} are rare and account for only 1 % of all serious knee {{ligament}} injuries. 45 Typically, when injuries to the <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> {{of the knee}} do occur, they occur as part of multiligament knee injuries or knee dislocations. Currently, {{the definition of a}} knee dislocation is a grossly unstable knee with disruption to at least 2 of the 4 major ligamentous structures of the knee. 6 Most commonly, however, knee dislocations involve both cruciate ligaments as well as the medial collateral liga-ment. Knee dislocations with <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> injuries account for only 10 % of all knee dislocations. 45 Unfortunately, because of their rarity, <b>lateral</b> <b>side</b> knee injuries are often not immediately recognized, which can lead to serious long-term consequences for the patient including persist-ent pain, disability, and functional limitations. 18, 40 <b>Lateral</b> <b>side</b> knee injuries have received {{a great deal of attention}} recently in the literature; however, their man-agement continues to be controversial.
