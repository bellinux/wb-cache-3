At the time he didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> his voice. The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, and later All in Together, saw the three rapping and DJing, {{switching}} names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol' Dirty would travel from Brooklyn out to Staten Island {{to meet up with}} their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles.

500|$|Fox was {{discovered}} by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film Letters from Frank, credited under the name [...] "Michael Fox". He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild, which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities, he discovered that Michael Fox, a veteran character actor, was already registered under the name. As he explained in his autobiography, Lucky Man: A Memoir and in interviews, he needed {{to come up with}} a different name. He did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Michael A. Fox" [...] during a time when [...] "fox" [...] was coming to mean [...] "attractive" [...] and because his middle initial sounded too much like the Canadian [...] "eh?" [...] He also didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Andrew" [...] or [...] "Andy," [...] so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on [...] "J", as a homage to actor Michael J. Pollard.|$|E

The only gear remaining was a Roland Chorus guitar amplifier and a Bond Electraglide guitar in a closet that {{had been given to}} the Edge as a promotional item; Lanois said the guitar [...] "was considered to be just a piece of junk". After the Edge and the producer began playing with the instrument, they were impressed by its sound and subsequently added it to [...] "Exit".

John Bush commented: [...] "'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its {{fragmented}} style made it essentially cover-proof." [...] In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: [...] "Oh, he did a marvelous job, {{he did a great}} job. I was very proud of his version." [...] Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: [...] "I used to <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting—like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [...] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone." ...|$|E
500|$|Pound {{broadcast}} over Rome Radio, although the Italian government {{was at first}} reluctant, concerned {{that he might be}} a double agent. He told a friend: [...] "It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone." [...] He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, and rambling about his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a [...] "rasping, buzzing quality <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the [...] "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage." [...] The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped —his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo — and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.|$|E
500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I really <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't {{get a chance to see}} the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—"Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha" [...] and [...] "Roni"—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' [...] "Tender Love" [...] and LL Cool J's [...] "I Need Love".|$|E

2500|$|Despite royal {{patronage}} and encouragement, {{there was}} never any overt mandate to use the new translation. It was not until 1661 that the Authorized Version replaced the Bishops Bible in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the Book of Common Prayer, and it never did replace the older translation in the Psalter. In 1763 The Critical Review complained that [...] "many false interpretations, ambiguous phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions...excite the derision of the scorner". Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say of the translation, [...] "It lives on the ear, like music that can never be forgotten, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he can forego." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{development}} from trainspotting (almost {{unique to the}} UK) is the [...] "haulage basher" [...] or locomotive haulage enthusiast These individuals attempt to ride behind or in the cab (some people do not count the latter as proper [...] "haulage") of as many locomotives as they can, marking them off in a book as would a regular trainspotter. Even the shortest haulage will count, such as being hauled for {{a few hundred yards}} by a shunting locomotive when one portion of a train is being hooked up to another at a junction. In some cases fans who <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a particular type of locomotive working hard hauling a train will ride behind them as much as possible, even following English-built locomotives exported abroad, Portugal's 1800 Class (similar to BR Class 50) being one example.

2500|$|There were no {{surviving}} eyewitnesses to the collapse, but {{at least}} five people passed the dam within the hour prior without noticing anything unusual. The last, Ace Hopewell, a carpenter at Powerhouse , rode his motorcycle past the dam about ten minutes before midnight. He testified at the Coroner's Inquest that he had passed Powerhouse [...] without seeing anything there or at the dam that caused him concern. He went on to state that at approximately one and one-half miles (2.4km) upstream he heard above the roar of his motorcycle a rumbling much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> [...] "rocks rolling on the hill." [...] He stopped and got off, leaving the engine idling, and smoked a cigarette while checking the hillside above him. The rumble that had caught his attention earlier had begun to fade behind him.

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} different people. Taylor stated that [...] "I Feel Better" [...] was based on Joe Goddard [...] "listening to Susan Boyle on TV and [...] thought of [...] string melody [...] by kind of misremembering [...] Les Misérables song". Following this, Taylor wrote the chorus, which he described as sounding like [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] by Madonna. This was not the only song to be influenced by Boyle; [...] "Keep Quiet" [...] was written by Goddard immediately after seeing Boyle perform [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] on Britain's Got Talent. Goddard said he [...] "found it quite incredible" [...] and listening to it made him want to write a song, which he sent to Taylor, who wrote the words and sent it back." [...] Taylor stated that though the song [...] "Alley Cats" [...] {{was influenced by}} the song [...] "That's Us/Wild Combination" [...] by Arthur Russell, which he and Goddard both <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the finished version was [...] "something a bit more Fleetwood Mac-y". Taylor said that a new bass line, which gave the song a different feel, was responsible for the transformation. Taylor said [...] "We Have Love" [...] had a similar feel to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] "in terms of the euphoria of the chorus", which he described as being [...] "reminiscent of that".|$|E
2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought {{at first it was}} merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|E
