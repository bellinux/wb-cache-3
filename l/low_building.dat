5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level <b>low</b> <b>building</b> downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{analyses}} {{the statistical}} data of questionnaires about <b>low</b> carbon <b>building</b> awareness of Jiaxing City residents, and concludes three points as following. Firstly, residents get <b>low</b> carbon <b>building</b> information from internet, television, magazines and so on, which {{gives them a}} hand to {{develop a sense of}} <b>low</b> carbon <b>building.</b> Secondly, the residences also have a relatively high degree of cognitive about the effect of <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings</b> to both the environment and economy. Thirdly, as the price of <b>low</b> carbon <b>building</b> is more expensive than ordinary buildings, citizens do not have a strong realistic desire to purse <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings.</b> However, it can not be neglected that the higher annual household income the stronger willing of purchasing <b>low</b> carbon <b>building.</b> Under these circumstances, it is an ideal way for government to carry on more incentive policies not only to support developer to develop <b>low</b> carbon <b>building</b> but also encourage citizen to purchase <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings.</b> Background and Purpose It is universally acknowledged that low carbon is imperative to develop our economy especially in real estate area, the pillar of the national economy industry. <b>Low</b> carbon <b>building,</b> an important part in low carbon economy, has a bright futur...|$|R

25|$|Early Meiji Architecture was {{initially}} influenced by colonial architecture in Chinese treaty ports such as Hong Kong. In Nagasaki, the British trader Thomas Glover built {{his own house}} in just such a style using the skill of local carpenters. His influence helped the career of architect Thomas Waters who designed the Osaka Mint in 1868, a long, <b>low</b> <b>building</b> in brick and stone with a central pedimented portico. In Tōkyō, Waters designed the Commercial Museum, {{thought to have been}} the city's first brick building.|$|E
25|$|The site, {{sandwiched}} between the Civic District {{and the central}} business district, was sold together with an underpass and the seafront site on which One Fullerton now stands for S$110 million. The two are linked by an air-conditioned underground pedestrian walkway with travellators. To ensure that the historical Fullerton Building continues to be visible from Marina Bay, URA specified a <b>low</b> <b>building</b> height for One Fullerton across the road. This also ensured that guests at The Fullerton Hotel would have unobstructed views of the sea.|$|E

Seku Amadu {{appears to have}} disapproved of the existing mosque and allowed it to fall into disrepair. This {{would have been the}} building that Caillié saw. Seku Amadu had also closed all the small neighbourhood mosques. Between 1834 and 1836, Seku Amadu built a new mosque to the east of the existing mosque {{on the site of the}} former palace. The new mosque was a large, <b>low</b> <b>building</b> lacking any towers or ornamentation.|$|E

25|$|If {{the rail}} {{line has been}} built with {{sufficient}} vertical clearance then Double-stack rail transport can be used. Where lines are electrified with overhead electric wiring double stacking is normally not possible. The mandatory requirement to fit under overhead wire for the traction engine electrical power supply sets the height limit for the railcars to allow for trailer transport. This requires a certain <b>low</b> <b>building</b> height {{which led to a}} minor size of wheels for the railcars. Hence increased degradation of bogeys by wheel wear-out is a cost disadvantage for the system.|$|E

25|$|Every Greek {{town had}} an open-air theatre. These {{were used for}} both public {{meetings}} as well as dramatic performances. The theatre was usually set in a hillside outside the town, and had rows of tiered seating set in a semicircle around the central performance area, the orchestra. Behind the orchestra was a <b>low</b> <b>building</b> called the skênê, which served as a store-room, a dressing-room, and also as a backdrop to the action {{taking place in the}} orchestra. A number of Greek theatres survive almost intact, the best known being at Epidaurus, by the architect Polykleitos the Younger.|$|E

40|$|Results of {{an ongoing}} inter-laboratory {{comparative}} study of approach flow and wind pressures on <b>low</b> <b>buildings</b> are presented. The wind tunnel data generated at six wind engineering laboratories during a pilot project initiated and coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology was employed. Variability in the laboratory wind loading on <b>low</b> <b>buildings</b> was investigated. The largest variability in the laboratory wind pressures and in the associated wind-induced internal loading in structural frames of generic <b>low</b> <b>buildings</b> was found for suburban wind exposure, for which an average coefficient of variation of 26. 6 % was observed. This variability was primarily attributed to differences in the approach flows employed in physical modeling of wind pressures on tested buildings, {{carried out by the}} participating laboratories. The variability in the approach flows resulted in a large measure from the differences in the along-wind turbulence intensity implied by different empirical models, defining the target wind exposures and used by the laboratories...|$|R
25|$|By 1605, Lanfranco was obtaining some {{independent}} commissions; for example, he contributed {{paintings to}} the Camerino degli Eremiti in the Palazzetto Farnese (also known as Casino della Morte), once a <b>low</b> <b>building</b> on the Via Giulia, {{adjacent to the}} church of Santa Maria dell’Orazione e Morte. The camerino had been constructed by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, next to his palace and gardens, and was destroyed in 1734 {{to allow for the}} construction of the aforementioned church. Of the canvases and frescoes by Domenichino, Girolamo Pulzone, Paul Bril, and Lanfranco, some are conserved in the new church. Among other works, Lanfranco contributed to this series, the eccentric Translation of the Magdalen.|$|E

It is a long <b>low</b> <b>building</b> with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what Pevsner refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, {{made all the more}} so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.|$|E

We {{looked again}} at the heap of skulls and skeletons before us, and we {{observed}} that they were all small and that the articles of clothing intermingled with them and lying about were all women's apparel. These, then, were all women and girls. From my saddle I counted about a hundred skulls, not including those that were hidden beneath the others in the ghastly heap nor those that were scattered far and wide through the fields. The skulls were nearly all separated {{from the rest of the}} bones – the skeletons were nearly all headless. These women had all been beheaded...and the procedure seems to have been, as follows: They would seize a woman, strip her carefully to her chemise, laying aside articles of clothing that were valuable, with any ornaments and jewels she might have about her. Then as many of them as cared would violate her, and the last man would kill her or not as the humour took him....We looked into the church which had been blackened by the burning of the woodwork, but not destroyed, nor even much injured. It was a <b>low</b> <b>building</b> with a low roof, supported by heavy irregular arches, that as we looked in seemed scarcely high enough for a tall man to stand under. What we saw there was too frightful for more than a hasty glance. An immense number of bodies had been partially burnt there and the charred and blackened remains seemed to fill it half way up to the low dark arches and make them lower and darker still, were lying in a state of putrefaction too frightful to look upon. I had never imagined anything so horrible. We all turned away sick and faint, and staggered out of the fearful pest house glad to get into the street again. We walked about the place and saw the same thing repeated over and over a hundred times. Skeletons of men with the clothing and flesh still hanging to and rotting together; skulls of women, with the hair dragging in the dust. bones of children and infants everywhere.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report {{research}} conducted in the UK’s East Midlands region which explores optimising practice for <b>low</b> carbon <b>building</b> through an architectural award system. Design/methodology/approach – To explore the complexity of the contexts, philosophies and demonstrations involved in best practice for <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings,</b> a mixed research approach was adopted through an online survey and interviews with 13 experts. Findings – The research provides practical means to evaluate <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings</b> and suggests an approach where aesthetic design and technical compliance are given similar weightings. It also presents the opinions of construction professional practitioners and academics on best practice for <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings.</b> Research limitations/implications – The research focuses on investigating the judging criteria and opinions of construction professionals who have, in the past, strongly identified with sustainable building design practice. Practical implications – As this research and other studies show, there is a need for a simple methodology and the use of existing tools to evaluate best practice for <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings.</b> Originality/value – The value of the paper lies in its purpose to establish a precedent for judging <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings</b> through an architectural award system. Although there is a plethora of literature, tools and environmental assessment systems that point towards best practice, this research aims to highlight the underlying principles and combine these with practical methods that can enable the construction industry to achieve <b>low</b> carbon <b>buildings.</b> Keywords United Kingdom, Building specifications, Sustainable design, <b>Low</b> carbon <b>buildings,</b> Sustainability, Construction professional...|$|R
