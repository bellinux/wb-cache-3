It is likely that the Spanish chose the Indian town of Maniani as the location for the new Spanish settlement. On 20 July 1536, Pedro de Alvarado sent instructions to found the new city, to be called Gracias a Dios, to provide better communication between Honduras and Guatemala. Pedro de Alvarado used the town of Tencoa as a base of operations, and sent his brother Gonzalo with 40 Spanish soldiers, and an unspecified number of indigenous allies, to help establish the new town. Alvarado appointed the members of the town council, and assigned 100 Spanish citizens to inhabit it. The natives around Gracias a Dios where not completely subjugated, however, and there were violent indigenous rebellions in the province until around 1539. As at San Pedro, Alvarado annulled all previous encomiendas in the region and reassigned them. Gonzalo de Alvarado had been exploring the central region around Siguatepeque, the Tinto River and Yoro, successfully dealing with native resistance and collecting supplies for San Pedro. He had about a dozen cavalry and fifteen or so infantry under his command, and joined up with ten more soldiers under Gaspar Xuárez de Ávila, who was to serve as his lieutenant. They proceed to Gracias a Dios with the <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> establishing its formal existence.|$|E

25|$|Many Europeans {{who arrived}} in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries came under {{contract}} as indentured servants. The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> of such a shift was in 1640 where a negro, John Punch, was sentenced to lifetime slavery for attempting to run away. This case also marked the disparate treatment of Africans as held by the Virginia County Court, as two white runaways received far lesser sentences. After 1640, planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts and kept their servants as slaves for life. This was demonstrated by the case Johnson v. Parker, where {{the court ruled that}} John Casor, an indentured servant, be returned to Johnson who claimed that Casor belonged to him for his life. According to the 1860 U. S. census, 393,975 individuals, representing 8% of all US families, owned 3,950,528 slaves. One-third of Southern families owned slaves.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson did not {{immediately}} involve himself in Gold Coast politics. He surveyed the political atmosphere and reestablished connections he had made in his trips to Europe. Most of his activities involved political agitation, as he began working with the Gold Coast Drivers' Union, and started contributing articles to local newspapers like the Gold Coast Spectator, the Vox Populi and the Gold Coast Provincial Pioneer. He also helped workers who suffered injustice by preparing <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> for cases. Overall, he tried to raise political expectations regarding peoples' rights {{and their ability to}} influence political decision-making. Through contacts in London, he arranged for questions to be asked by sympathetic left wing Labour Party members in the British Parliament about working conditions and rights in the colonies. Wallace-Johnson also established a new form of mass demonstrations, in which members of the traditional elite no longer dominated African politics. In Wallace-Johnson's reformation of mass meetings, ordinary citizens could vocalise their political opinions. These people took full advantage of the new system; they frequently lambasted colonial authorities and the political establishment, in general. The idea won Wallace-Johnson widespread acclaim and adulation.|$|E
25|$|In response, the Legislative Council {{proposed}} {{to restrict the}} right of such persons by adding another requirement {{that one of the}} child's parents must have been a permanent resident {{at the time of the}} child's birth. On 10 July 1997, the Legislative Council passed the Immigration Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, which introduced a certification system. Under this system, any person who claimed to have the right of abode in Hong Kong could prove their status only by showing a certificate of right of abode issued by the Director of Immigration of Hong Kong. This certificate could be applied for only in mainland China, and it would not be issued until the application obtained a one-way permit to cross the border to Hong Kong from the Chinese Public Security Bureau. The amendment was made retroactive to 1 July 1997, which meant that even children who had already arrived in Hong Kong with previously sufficient <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> would have been stripped of their right for lack of a certificate that did not yet exist when they entered Hong Kong. The retroactivity of the amendment triggered a number of test cases in court, which eventually came before the Court of Final Appeal as Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration and Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration.|$|E

50|$|Politically, the low-country {{governments of}} Virginia and the Carolinas {{did little to}} assist and much to exploit this cohee migration. During the {{earliest}} decades, the established Anglican Church refused to recognize Presbyterian weddings and required exorbitant marriage bond fees of the up-country settlers {{in order to obtain}} a legally recognized marriage certificate. Failure to obtain <b>legal</b> marriage <b>documentation</b> could have severe consequences when trying to sell land, and during the handling of estates. Similarly, upcountry political representation in colony governments was inhibited, while wealthy low-country aristocrats held dominance in political, military and taxation matters. The stage was set for a major cultural divide, and tuckahoe-cohee antagonism grew from this early social dynamic.|$|R

Quisling's biographer, Dahl, believes that in all likelihood the second marriage was never official.

Soon after the wedding, the aid mission came to an end and the trio left the Ukraine, and from the summer of 1923 onwards they planned to spend a year in Paris.

In July 1891, Handy, acting in his mother's name, sued his ex-wife for unlawful detainer of property, trying to force her out of the house that the court had granted her.
