However, manually monitoring land development using these large and complex images is time consuming and prone to errors. To handle this problem, an automated system is needed to measure development in urban regions. Therefore, in this study we propose such an automated method to measure land {{development in a}} given urban region imaged in different times. We benefit from novel <b>land</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> for this purpose. They are based on local features obtained from sequential images. As a novel contribution, we represent these local features in a spatial voting matrix. Then, we propose five different <b>land</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> on the formed voting matrix. We test our method on 19 sets of sequential panchromatic Ikonos images. Our test results indicate the possible use of our method in measuring land development automatically...|$|E

Agricultural crops {{could be}} a wise option for the {{reclamation}} since abandoned tin-mining lands have a high potency to be used as agricultural lands. This study was aimed to evaluate of the land/soil characteristics of abandoned tin-mining areas and to establish land suitability of the land area for agriculture used to formulate appropriate <b>land</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> and amelioration strategies for utilization of mined areas for crop production. The land evaluation was conducted by comparing the land characteristics in every type of abandoned tin-mining areas with its crop requirements. The current suitability showed that in general food crops, vegetable crops, fruit crops, and industrial crops were consider as not suitable (N). Spice and medicinal crops [pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and citronella (Andropogoh nardus L. Rendle) ] were consider as not suitable (N), while the Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) and Kemiri Sunan (Aleurites moluccana L.

The water availability, soil texture, and low soil fertility were considered as the limiting factors of all crops to get optimum production. For agricultural development, the soil physical and chemical properties of abandoned tin-mining land must be improved through integrated farming...|$|E
40|$|In Hungary, {{wind erosion}} {{is one of}} the most serious natural hazards. Spatial and {{temporal}} variation in the factors that determine the location and intensity of wind erosion damage are not well known, nor are the regional and local sensitivities to erosion. Because of methodological challenges, no multi-factor, regional wind erosion sensitivity map is available for Hungary. The aim of this study was to develop a method to estimate the regional differences in wind erosion sensitivity and exposure in Hungary. Wind erosion sensitivity was modelled using the key factors of soil sensitivity, vegetation cover and wind erodibility as proxies. These factors were first estimated separately by factor sensitivity maps and later combined by fuzzy logic into a regional-scale wind erosion sensitivity map. Large areas were evaluated by using publicly available data sets of remotely sensed vegetation information, soil maps and meteorological data on wind speed. The resulting estimates were verified by field studies and examining the economic losses from wind erosion as compensated by the state insurance company. The spatial resolution of the resulting sensitivity map is suitable for regional applications, as identifying sensitive areas is the foundation for diverse <b>land</b> <b>development</b> control <b>measures</b> and implementing management activities...|$|R

40|$|Landscape {{pattern has}} long been {{hypothesized}} to influence automobile dependency. Because choices about <b>land</b> <b>development</b> tend to have long-lasting impacts that span over decades, understanding {{the magnitude of this}} influence is critical to the design of policies to reduce emissions and other negative externalities associated with car use. Combining household survey data from Germany with satellite imagery and other geo-referenced data sources, we undertake an econometric analysis of the relation between landscape pattern and automobile dependency. Specifically, we employ a two-part model to investigate two dimensions of car use, the discrete decision to own a car and, conditional upon ownership, the continuous decision of how far to drive. Results indicate that landscape pattern, as captured by measures of both land cover (e. g. the extent of open space and landscape diversity) and land use (e. g. the density of regional businesses) are important predictors of car ownership and use. Other policy-relevant variables, such as fuel prices and public transit infrastructure, are also identified as correlates. Based on the magnitude of our estimates, we conclude that carefully considered <b>land</b> <b>development</b> and zoning <b>measures</b> – ones that encourage dense <b>development,</b> diverse <b>land</b> cover and mixed land use – can have beneficial impacts in reducing car dependency that extend far into the future...|$|R

40|$|Land use and {{transportation}} interaction {{has been a}} research topic for several decades. There have been efforts to identify impacts of transportation on land use from several different perspectives. One focus has been the role of transportation improvements in encouraging new <b>land</b> <b>developments</b> or relocation of activities due to improved accessibility. The impacts studied have included property values and increased development. Another {{focus has been on}} the changes in travel behavior due to better mobility and accessibility. Most studies to date have been conducted in metropolitan level, thus unable to account for interactions spatially and temporally at smaller geographic scales. ^ In this study, a framework for studying the temporal interactions between transportation and land use was proposed and applied to three selected corridor areas in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The framework consists of two parts: one is developing of temporal data and the other is applying time series analysis to this temporal data to identify their dynamic interactions. Temporal GIS databases were constructed and used to compile building permit data {{and transportation}} improvement projects. Two types of time series analysis approaches were utilized: univariate models and multivariate models. Time series analysis is designed to describe the dynamic consequences of time series by developing models and forecasting the future of the system based on historical trends. Model estimation results from the selected corridors were then compared. ^ It was found that the time series models predicted residential development better than commercial development. It was also found that results from three study corridors varied in terms of the magnitude of impacts, length of lags, significance of the variables, and the model structure. Long-run effect or cumulated impact of transportation improvement on <b>land</b> <b>developments</b> was also <b>measured</b> with time series techniques.

Urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> {{plays an important role}} in dynamic urban economic development. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> and its mechanisms in China. We conceptualized the mechanism of urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> from multiple perspectives based on a case study in Jiangsu Province. We employed the methods of global and local spatial auto-correlation detection and spatial lag model to analyze the provincial land use conveyance and survey data from 2004 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012 to understand the dynamics of urban <b>land</b> <b>development.</b> The results show that urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> varies significantly across different time periods, spatial scales, and regions in Jiangsu. Higher absolute urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> mainly occurred in Sunan, expanding to Subei and Suzhong, while faster development occurred mainly in Subei, where the initial bases were lower but had strong economic growth potential. The regression analysis shows that market activities and administrative levels had played a more critical role in driving urban <b>land</b> <b>development,</b> which suggests that rapid urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> has institutional and market foundations.

Nevertheless, evaluation of equity within the informal urban <b>land</b> <b>development</b> system in SSA will a priori require a suitable evaluation framework. Based on a review of the relevant literature, this study interrogates the concept of equity in urban <b>land</b> <b>development.</b> The aim is to offer insights to {{contribute to the development of}} a comprehensive framework for evaluation of equity within the urban informal <b>land</b> <b>development</b> system in SSA.
