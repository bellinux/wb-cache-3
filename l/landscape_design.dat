5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of {{architectural}} courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand drawing in addition to architectural and <b>landscape</b> <b>design.</b> She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the <b>landscape</b> <b>design</b> program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E

BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary, with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family. Yeates left behind an estate valued at £47,000, which included money set aside to purchase a home with Reardon. As she had not written a will, the sum was inherited by her parents.|$|E

In order to evaluate different effects of <b>landscaping</b> <b>design</b> factors, a field measurement on outdoor environmental parameters were carried out in a residential community in Guangzhou, China. Meanwhile, a CFD software of microclimatic simulation, ENVI-met, was employed to simulate the conditions during the experiment days.

5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional <b>landscape</b> <b>design</b> techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including umbrella pines and Colorado blue spruce.|$|E
5|$|Marian Cruger Coffin (September 16, 1876 – February 2, 1957) {{was one of}} {{the first}} American women to work as a {{professional}} landscape architect, and became famous for designing numerous gardens for members of the East Coast elite to whom she had connections through her mother's side of the family. As a child, she received almost no formal education but was home-tutored while living with her mother's relatives in upstate New York. Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for a woman of her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901–4 as one of only four women in architecture and <b>landscape</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oakwood Cemetery is a nonsectarian rural {{cemetery}} in northeastern Troy, New York, United States. It operates {{under the direction}} of the Troy Cemetery Association, a non-profit board of directors that deals strictly with the operation of the cemetery. It was established in 1848 in response to the growing rural cemetery movement in New England and went into service in 1850. The cemetery was designed by architect John C. Sidney and underwent its greatest development in the late 19th century under superintendent John Boetcher, who incorporated rare foliage and a clear <b>landscape</b> <b>design</b> strategy. Oakwood was the fourth rural cemetery opened in New York and its governing body was the first rural cemetery association created in the state.|$|E

5|$|The first gardens on the Cummer {{property}} {{were designed}} by Ossian Cole Simonds in 1903, just after the adjoining house was completed. Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia redesigned this garden and created what would {{become known as the}} English Garden in 1910. Ellen Biddle Shipman designed the Italian Garden in 1931. Sections of Clara and Waldo's garden {{were designed by}} William Lyman Phillips, a partner in the Olmstead Brothers firm. The Olmsted Brothers also advised Ninah on a design for a wall garden in 1922, but she chose to plant a garden designed by William Mercer of Philadelphia. The Cummer Gardens were selected for the National Register of Historic Places because they represent the history of American <b>landscape</b> <b>design</b> in the first four decades of the twentieth century.|$|E
