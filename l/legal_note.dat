Competing against local heavyweights like Melquíades Álvarez and José Manuel Pedregal he stood little chance and lost, afterwards appealing corruption and unfair deployment of Guardia Civil. The following year he tried his chances in local elections in Valencia; this time banking on support of local Carlists like Manuel Simó and Luis Lucia, the latter running a daily Diario de Valencia; the bid proved unsuccessful. In Madrid he engaged in launching a periodical of Traditionalist youth, which eventually materialized as Juventud - Organo de las Juventudes Tradicionalistas. Given lack of broader Carlist base in Madrid the initiative proved to be short-lived, and the weekly was issued in 1912-1913 only. Nevertheless, Larramendi was already well known among conservative youth of the capital: [...] "quién no conoce al simpático y cultisimo Larramendi?" [...] - asked one of the periodicals. With ease of writing, by the mid-1910s he supplied Carlist periodicals as far as Tortosa, Castellón, Alicante and Badajoz, let alone other titles in Madrid.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 7 years or so, the World Bank has {{expanded}} its rule of law agenda by moving into the area of criminal justice reform. This turn to criminal justice reform, however obvious it may be from a development perspective, was — and still is — a controversial step. This is because the World Bank, like most other multilateral development banks, is prohibited by its basic legal document, the Articles of Agreement, from interfering in the political affairs of its members. It must make its decisions {{on the basis of}} economic considerations only. Following the 2011 World Development Report, which made the case for World Bank involvement in criminal justice, in early 2012 the Bank’s legal vice presidency released the <b>Legal</b> <b>Note</b> on Bank Involvement in the Criminal Justice Sector and a Staff Guidance Note: World Bank Support for Criminal Justice Activities. This paper shows how the <b>Legal</b> <b>Note</b> and the Guidance Note, by offering new interpretations of the World Bank’s mandate and of the criminal justice sector, seek to incorporate criminal justice reform within the World Bank’s governance agenda. It argues that the interpretation offered by these documents is unconvincing in addressing the two components of the political prohibition clause, being the injunction to decide on the basis of economic considerations only and the prohibition on political interference. As a result, the <b>Legal</b> <b>Note</b> does not entirely succeed in its mission to provide ‘…a general legal framework for determining which interventions by the Bank in this sector would fall within the World Bank’s mandate under its Articles of Agreement’. This paper concludes by suggesting that some of the loose ends in the <b>Legal</b> <b>Note</b> and the Guidance Note {{can be explained by the}} purpose of this new legal interpretation of the mandate, which is not so much to provide a consistent legal argument, but rather — and above all — to play [to] constituencies with different interests and maintain the myth of a common understanding of the World Bank’s mandate and mission...|$|E

Although the law {{can be a}} powerful tool to minimize the risk of violence against women, it can also be an obstacle to interventions. As legislators, prosecutors, and advocates implement legal interventions to respond to violence against women, the Supreme Court has increasingly been called on to interpret these laws and assess their constitutionality.

Part I discusses the elements needed to bring a claim under ATS and the history behind the statute. Part II describes the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Kiobel and what it represents. This section also covers why holding corporations accountable is important, focusing on globalization, the corporation’s power, and their role; and discusses the importance of seeking remedies for human rights victims. Part III examines whether ATS is still viable for suing corporations for human rights abuses after Kiobel and the possible alternatives available for holding corporations accountable including: regional human rights courts, naming and shaming, or suing in domestic courts where the violations occur...|$|E

[1] Sending Spam, however, is no longer the only reason for deception, as crackers have taken pleasure in the challenge of manipulating computer systems and, additionally, find recreational enjoyment in doing so. In this <b>legal</b> <b>Note,</b> the author’s intent is to show that criminal, rather than civil liability {{is the best way to}} effectively deter and punish the spoofer. The injury that results when a computer system’s technological safety measures fail to adequately safeguard the system affects not only the owner of the hijacked e-mail address, but also the Internet Service Provider, and the Network as a whole. Current Anti-Spam Legislation is arguably ineffective at targeting these particular types of malicious attacks, and a different legal approach is suggested...|$|E
40|$|In Eweida {{and others}} v UK the European Court of Human Rights held {{that there was}} a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights article 9 where an employee’s claim for {{indirect}} discrimination on grounds of religion or belief was unsuccessful in the Court of Appeal because she could not show that a group of people sharing her views had been disadvantaged by the employer’s action. This led to a <b>legal</b> <b>note</b> from the Equality and Human Rights Commission on the effects of the decisions and guidance on how employers should deal with employees who wanted modifications of their working conditions because of their religion or belief. This guidance could be taken to suggest that employers should do their best to accommodate employees’ religious requirements where reasonable to do so. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to argue that, on the contrary, the European Court of Human Rights’s decision in Eweida v UK does not require the concept of reasonable accommodation to be introduced into English law, and that there are good reasons for regarding such a development as undesirable...|$|E
