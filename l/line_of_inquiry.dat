5|$|In 2004 Bamber's defence team, which {{included}} Giovanni di Stefano, applied unsuccessfully {{to have the}} CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal. His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009. The CCRC provisionally rejected Bamber's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document. It invited his lawyers to respond within three months, extended the deadline {{to allow them to}} study all 406 crime-scene photographs, and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} tens of {{thousands}} of documents translated, released an age-progressed image, and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four. In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> and another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year. By March 2017 the inquiry had cost £11.1 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b> John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the tools of}} {{literary}} criticism were applied to the synoptic problem in earnest, especially in German scholarship.

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties.

In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants.

25|$|A {{circuit board}} fragment, {{allegedly}} found {{embedded in a}} piece of charred material, was identified as part of an electronic timer similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a Semtex bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee Ulrich Lumpert identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, Edwin Bollier, testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board from a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was asked to identify at the trial was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so. Bollier later claimed that in 1991 he had declined an offer of $4million from the FBI in exchange for his support of the main <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> though this claim has never been verified.|$|E
25|$|Weir and Jerman {{suggested}} that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust. They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found {{in the company of}} images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b> They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the pilgrim routes to and from Santiago de Compostella. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at Haddon Hall appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson {{appealed the}} conviction, but his pre-trial confessions, his {{knowledge}} of the [...] "secret details" [...] and his refusal to take the stand during the trial led to the application for leave to appeal being refused: [...] "n 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the Forensic Science Service to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the Forensic Science Service, as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained." [...] Hodgson, who was at that time in the prison hospital, became more seriously ill, his solicitor was unable to take further instructions, and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> was closed.|$|E

500|$|Most visibly {{during the}} 2012 term, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor {{was part of}} a {{landmark}} 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, [...] "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b> States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)." [...] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: [...] "Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" [...] For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.|$|E

The EPB derided the government's raise of the UPR's tuition and the withdrawal of funds for cultural organizations. It also expressed support to those opposing the Via Verde project, stating that it would [...] "destroy the environment [...] endanger human life and property". All of these conditions convinced the Macheteros that the conditions for a public revolt were being formed, citing that they would [...] "do everything in their power to convince the people {{that there is a need}} to defend themselves". Guasábara admitted that the organization was receiving information concerning military and political strategies that the United States intended to enact in Puerto Rico and that they employ it to remain elusive and to prepare counter measures, only making a portion of it public, but refused to reveal their sources. When questioned about the possibility of reopening a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> with the Catholic Church (an initiative abandoned in 2005 after the death of Ojeda Ríos), the officer said that the EPB is open [...] "to chat [...] exchange ideas", but that they would not abandon armed resistance.|$|E

2500|$|In December {{the police}} {{acquired}} a memorandum {{belonging to a}} Daily Mail journalist, concerning rumours of homosexuality between [...] "a police officer, a magistrate and a doctor". The last directly implied Adams. This information had come, according to the reporter, directly from Hannam. The 'magistrate' was Sir Roland Gwynne, Mayor of Eastbourne (1929–31) and brother of Rupert Gwynne, MP for Eastbourne (1910–24). Gwynne was Adams's patient and known to visit every day at 9am. They went on frequent holidays together and had spent three weeks in Scotland that September. The 'police officer' was the Deputy Chief Constable of Eastbourne, Alexander Seekings. Hannam ignored this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> (despite homosexual acts being a criminal offence in 1956), and the police instead gave the journalist a dressing-down.

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{interest}} in radio waves in the physics community, but the interest was in radio as a scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method. [...] Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light, a short range phenomenon which could only travel along a line of sight path, and thus its range was limited to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling, making it unsuitable for long distance communication. Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist Oliver Lodge and an article about Hertz's work by Marconi's teacher, Augusto Righi. Righi's article renewed Marconi's interest in developing a wireless telegraphy system based on radio waves, a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> that Marconi noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, {{the young}} Italian {{inventor}} Guglielmo Marconi began working {{on the idea of}} building a commercial wireless telegraphy system based on the use of Hertzian waves (radio waves), a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> that he noted other inventors {{did not seem to be}} pursuing. Building on the ideas of previous scientists and inventors Marconi re-engineered their apparatus by trial and error attempting to build a radio based wireless telegraphic system that would function the same as wired telegraphy. He would work on the system through 1895 in his lab and then in field tests making improvements to extend its range. After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted. Having failed to interest the Italian government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met William Preece, a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the General Post Office. A series of demonstrations for the British government followed—by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about [...] across Salisbury Plain.|$|E
