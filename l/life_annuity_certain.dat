40|$|There are {{two kinds}} of <b>annuity,</b> <b>annuity</b> <b>certain</b> and <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> <b>Annuity</b> <b>certain</b> does not depend on life probability, for example, mortgage. <b>Life</b> <b>annuity</b> depends on time until death and life probability, for example, pension payment from {{insurance}} company. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss further about <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> and the relationship with life probability that is influences by time until death and the assumption of interest which is used. Time until death (T) is a random variable, because it is unpredictable. To determine the value of distribution, assumption values on tqx will be used. These values are generated by T simulation which depends on Uniform distribution (0, 1) random values. A few cases of determining <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> using tpx distribution values by T simulation will be discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A pure <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> {{ceases to}} make {{payments}} {{on the death of}} the annuitant. A guaranteed <b>annuity</b> or <b>life</b> and <b>certain</b> <b>annuity,</b> makes payments for at least a certain number of years (the [...] "period certain"); if the annuitant outlives the specified period <b>certain,</b> <b>annuity</b> payments then continue until the annuitant's death, and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain, the annuitant's estate or beneficiary is entitled to collect the remaining payments certain. The tradeoff between the pure <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> and the life-with-period-certain annuity is that in exchange for the reduced risk of loss, the annuity payments for the latter will be smaller.|$|R
50|$|Valuation of <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> may be {{performed}} by calculating the actuarial present value of the future life contingent payments. Life tables are {{used to calculate the}} probability that the annuitant lives to each future payment period. Valuation of <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> also depends on the timing of payments just as with <b>annuities</b> <b>certain,</b> however <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> may not be calculated with similar formulas because actuarial present value accounts for the probability of death at each age.|$|R
50|$|Annuities {{that provide}} {{payments}} {{that will be}} paid over a period known in advance are <b>annuities</b> <b>certain</b> or guaranteed <b>annuities.</b> Annuities paid only under certain circumstances are contingent annuities. A common example is a <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> which is paid over the remaining lifetime of the annuitant. <b>Certain</b> and <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> are guaranteed {{to be paid for}} a number of years and then become contingent on the annuitant being alive.|$|R
50|$|In 1671 De Witt {{conceived}} of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as a weighted average of <b>annuities</b> <b>certain</b> where the weights were mortality probabilities (that sum to one), thereby producing the expected {{value of the}} present value of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Edmond Halley’s (of comet fame) representation of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> dates to 1693, when he re-expressed a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as the discounted value of each annual payment multiplied by the probability of surviving long enough to receive the payment and summed until there are no survivors. De Witt's approach was especially insightful and ahead of its time. In modern terminology, De Witt treats a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as a random variable and its expected value is what we call the value of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Also in modern terminology, De Witt's approach allows one to readily understand other properties of this random variable such as its standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, or any other characteristic of interest.|$|R
50|$|A {{hybrid of}} these is when the {{payments}} stop at death, but also after a predetermined number of payments, if this is earlier: known as a temporary <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> The difference with the period <b>certain</b> <b>annuity</b> is that the period <b>certain</b> <b>annuity</b> will keep paying {{after the death of}} the nominee until the period is completed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the distributional implications of mandatory longevity insurance {{when there is}} mortality heterogeneity in the population. Previous research has demonstrated the significant financial redistribution that occurs under alternative annuity programs {{in the presence of}} differential mortality across groups. This paper embeds that analysis into a life cycle framework that allows for an examination of distributional effects on a utility-adjusted basis. It finds that the degree of redistribution that occurs from the introduction of a mandatory annuity program is substantially lower on a utility-adjusted basis than when evaluated on a purely financial basis. Complete annuitization is shown to be optimal even when annuities are not actuarially fair for each individual, so long as there are no administrative costs and no bequest motives. In the presence of bequest motives, mandatory complete annuitization can make some individuals worse off. Even with strong bequest motives, however, welfare can be substantially enhanced by annuities by allowing individuals to only partially annuitize their wealth. Finally, <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> with “period <b>certain</b> ” bequest options are shown to be inferior to partial annuitization, while having identical distributional effects...|$|R

First, we focus on various arrangements which aim at building the post-retirement income, and involve either the accumulation phase, or the payout phase, or both.

40|$|Abstract: Asset {{allocation}} {{and consumption}} {{towards the end}} of the life cycle is complicated by the uncertainty associated with the length of life. Although this risk can be hedged with <b>life</b> <b>annuities,</b> empirical evidence suggests that voluntary annuitization amongst the public is not very common, nor is it well understood. This paper develops a normative model of when, and if, one should purchase an immediate <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> This problem is particularly relevant given the increasing number of Defined Contribution pension plans in the U. S – for which participants must make this decision – and the corresponding trend away from Defined Benefit guarantees. Specifically, our main qualitative argument is that there is a real option – akin to the corporate finance usage of the word – embedded in the decision to annuitize. A <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> can be viewed as a project with a positive net present value. However, quite distinct from a fixed-income bond or period <b>certain</b> <b>annuity,</b> once purchased, a lif...|$|R

40|$|Oregon Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) retirees {{must choose}} between {{receiving}} {{all of their}} retirement benefits as <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments and receiving lower <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments coupled with a partial lump sum payout. For the median retiree, the expected present value of the incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments is 1. 50 times the lump sum payout, and demand for lump sums is low. This pattern is consistent with value-maximizing decisions by retirees. However, when we exploit variation {{in the value of}} the incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments arising from how PERS calculates retirement benefits, we find robust evidence that demand for lump sum payouts is higher when the forgone <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments are more valuable. We also find that demand for lump sum payouts is higher when the lump sum payout is “large, ” and when equity market returns over the prior 12 months are higher. Collectively, these findings suggest that retirees value incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments at less than their expected present value, either because they do not know how to accurately value <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> or because they have strong demand for large lump sum payouts. In contrast, when we measure variation {{in the value of the}} incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments along a dimension that is easier for retirees to observe and interpret—poor health at retirement—we find evidence consistent with value-maximizing decision-making...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> is an annuity, {{or series}} of {{payments}} at fixed intervals, paid while the purchaser (or annuitant) is alive. A <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> is an insurance product typically sold or issued by life insurance companies. <b>Life</b> <b>annuities</b> may {{be sold in}} exchange for the immediate payment of a lump sum (single-payment annuity) or a series of regular payments (flexible payment annuity), prior to the onset of the annuity.|$|R

40|$|This article compares wealth {{management}} strategies for individuals in retirement, focusing on trade-offs regarding wealth creation and income security. Specifically, it compares the following six strategies: (1) systematic withdrawal from mutual funds, (2) fixed payout immediate <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> (3) immediate variable <b>annuity</b> for <b>life,</b> (4) variable <b>annuity</b> plus guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (VA+GMWB), (5) mix of withdrawals from {{mutual funds and}} fixed payout immediate <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> one-time wealth split at retirement, and (6) mix of mutual fund withdrawals and fixed payout <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> gradual annuitization at certain ages. Systematic withdrawals from mutual funds usually give opportunities for greater wealth creation {{at the risk of}} large investment losses and income shortfalls. Fixed and variable <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> forgo bequest considerations and distribute the highest incomes.

40|$|Economists {{have long}} been puzzled by the low demand for <b>life</b> <b>annuities.</b> To shed new light on this puzzle, we study payout choices in the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System, where each retiree must choose between a lump sum and a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Notably, the average <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> we study is better than actuarially fair when {{compared}} to the lump sum and 85 % of retirees choose the <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Whether and how retirees respond to variation in the value of <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments depends crucially on the source of variation. We find strong evidence that demand responds to variation in retiree characteristics. In contrast, we find little evidence that demand responds to plausibly exogenous variation in annuity pricing, which is economically meaningful but less salient. Finally, we find robust evidence that demand for the lump sum increases with recent equity market returns and other salient measures of investor sentiment. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{find the}} minimum {{probability}} of lifetime ruin of an investor who can {{invest in a}} market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can purchase a reversible <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> The surrender charge of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> is a proportion of its value. Ruin occurs when the total {{of the value of}} the risky and riskless assets and the surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> reaches zero. We find the optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is allowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> keeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets is required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has the flexiblity to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and she will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders just enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this second case, the individual’s annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size of the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the individual will not buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> unless she can cover all her consumption, the so-called safe level. When the charge is small enough, the individual will buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> at a wealth lower than this safe level.

50|$|The pure <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> {{can have}} harsh {{consequences}} for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract.

The tradeoff between the pure <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> and the life-with-period-certain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller. A viable alternative to the life-with-period-certain annuity is to purchase a single-premium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity.|$|R

40|$|For many years, the {{longevity}} risk of individuals has been underestimated, as survival probabilities have improved across the developed world. The uncertainty and volatility of future longevity has posed significant risk issues for both individuals and product providers of annuities and pensions. This paper investigates {{the effectiveness of}} static hedging strategies for longevity risk management using longevity bonds and derivatives (q-forwards) for the retail products: <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> deferred <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> indexed <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> and variable annuity with guaranteed lifetime benefits. Improved market and mortality models are developed for the underlying risks in annuities. The market model is a regime-switching vector error correction model for GDP, inflation, interest rates, and share prices. The mortality model is a discrete-time logit model for mortality rates with age dependence. Models were estimated using Australian data. The basis risk between annuitant portfolios and population mortality was based on UK experience. Results show that static hedging using q-forwards or longevity bonds reduces {{the longevity}} risk substantially for <b>life</b> <b>annuities,</b> but significantly less for deferred annuities. For inflation-indexed annuities, static hedging of longevity is less effective because of the inflation risk. Variable annuities provide limited longevity protection compared to <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> and indexed annuities, {{and as a result}} longevity risk hedging adds little value for these products.
