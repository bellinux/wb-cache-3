5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Police Alf Reksten {{arrived in}} the {{afternoon}} and took over responsibility. Later, the ship Mira, belonging to Bergen Steamship Company (BSD), arrived with two doctors, two nurses, material from the Red Cross, specialist police officers, fire fighters, representatives from the airline and Norway Post, and journalists. The sister aircraft Najaden arrived <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.|$|E
5|$|The Bull's Head {{hotel on}} 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to the mob, was burned. The mayor's {{residence}} on Fifth Avenue, the Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included {{the office of}} the New York Times. The mob was turned back at the Times office by staff manning Gatling guns, including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond. Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke all the windows with paving stones ripped from the street. The mob beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black people, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.|$|E

25|$|In rural areas, {{meals are}} {{typically}} more simple than in cities. The Maya use maize, beans, or squash for most meals, and the Garifuna {{are fond of}} seafood, cassava (particularly made into cassava bread or Ereba) and vegetables. The nation abounds with restaurants and fast food establishments selling fairly cheaply. Local fruits are quite common, but raw vegetables from the markets less so. Mealtime is a communion for families and schools and some businesses close at midday for lunch, reopening <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Steak is also common.|$|E
25|$|A crowd {{gathered}} at Cronulla {{on the morning}} of Sunday, 11 December, and, by midday, approximately 5,000 people had gathered near the beach. The gathering began peacefully, but <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> a man of Middle Eastern appearance was surrounded outside a local hotel and attacked by members of the crowd. The police eventually intervened. Several similar attacks took place later in the day, followed by retaliatory attacks that night and on subsequent nights, resulting in extensive property damage. Violence spread to other southern suburbs of Sydney, where more assaults occurred, including two stabbings and attacks on ambulances and police officers.|$|E
25|$|However, if a fielder {{takes up}} {{position}} at square leg or somewhere {{so as to}} block his view, or {{if there is an}} injured batsman with a runner, then the umpire must move somewhere else – typically either a short distance or to point {{on the opposite side of}} the batsman. If the square-leg umpire elects to stand at point, he is required to inform both the batsmen, the captain of the fielding team, and his colleague. He may also move to the point position <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> if the setting sun prevents a clear view of the popping crease at his end.|$|E

25|$|The {{activity}} quickly redeveloped late in {{the morning}} of April 24. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the risk that day was upgraded to a high risk over parts of East Texas. Tornadoes, along with large hail and damaging winds, occurred in the afternoon and evening hours across the Plains. 22 tornadoes were reported. One large tornadic supercell also moved through Piedras Negras, Coahuila in Mexico, and moved into Eagle Pass, Texas, with reports of significant damage on the U.S. side of the border and at least seven deaths and 74 injuries from that EF3 tornado, plus at least three deaths and at least 40 injuries across the river in Piedras Negras. There was virtually no activity in the high risk area, however, and that busted.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Brigade was {{in reserve}} around noon but was sent into the {{fighting}} about 3:30 pm with the 1st Carabiniers leading. Because the 5th Light Dragoons were roughly handled by French Chasseurs à Cheval at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June, {{they were held}} in reserve on 18 June. Recruited in November 1814, the 8th Hussar Regiment under Louis Duvivier {{was made up of}} raw soldiers of French, Belgian and German nationalities. During the struggle at Waterloo, the 8th found itself face-to-face with the elite French Guard Horse Grenadiers. After an order given in Dutch threw the 8th Hussars into confusion, they were charged and put to flight by the Horse Grenadiers. Enough troopers rallied to form a single squadron which cooperated with the brigades of Hussey Vivian and John Ormsby Vandeleur <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Morval was {{an attack}} by the Fourth Army on Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesboeufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final {{objectives}} of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The attack was postponed to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on Combles, south of Morval and because of rain. The combined attack was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west, near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. Combles, Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt were captured and {{a small number of}} tanks joined in the battle <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Many casualties were inflicted on the Germans but the French made slower progress. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a salient near Combles. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge.|$|E

25|$|On 26 May, around lunchtime, Reynaud {{attended}} {{a meeting in}} London with Churchill. At 2 pm Churchill reported to the War Cabinet that Reynaud had stated that the French military situation was hopeless, {{that he had no}} intention of signing a separate peace with Germany, but that he might be forced to resign and that others in the French government might sign such a treaty. At this stage Churchill told Reynaud that he did not rule out talks with Mussolini altogether (Italy was still neutral). The Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met Reynaud <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> before the latter’s return to France. This was the beginning of the British May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, in which Halifax favoured what was euphemistically described as “the Reynaud Option”: approaching the Italians to see if acceptable peace terms could be negotiated, perhaps by giving up some British territory in the Mediterranean. Halifax was eventually overruled by Churchill.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{heightened}} state of alert had been declared throughout the IAF on October 5, Rephidim was ill-prepared for the Egyptian attack which launched the war. 16 Su-7s, escorted by 6 MiG-21s, struck {{the field at}} 14:00 on October 6, escaping unharmed. Although the main runway was disabled for four hours, the parallel taxiway was operational within 30 minutes of the attack, allowing Rephidim to join the fighting now raging along the Suez Canal. Two 119 Squadron F-4 Phantoms (the squadron had retired the Mirage in 1970) launched from Rephidim to assist Israeli units under attack, and pilot Moshe Melnik with navigator Zvi Tal shot down an AS-5 Kelt launched by a Tu-16 {{as well as a}} Su-7. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> a mixed pair consisting of a Phantom and an IAI Nesher scrambled from Rephidim to down several Mi-8 helicopters airlifting Egyptian commandos into the Sinai. That same night also saw the IAF deploying several helicopters to Rephidim for medevac (medical evacuation) duties. One Israeli CH-53 was shot down over the field on October 12, killing five crewmen.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 December, Verhofstadt met with CDH head Joëlle Milquet and offered the party a part in an interim Government through a person outside the party, a move that {{confirmed}} the refusal by MR to a full participation of cdH in the interim Government. In reaction, CDH called a party meeting, soon followed by a press conference where cdH announced its withdrawal from formation talks. The move was followed in the afternoon by a call for francophone unity by PS head Elio di Rupo that announced it will not {{take part in a}} Government without CDH. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> CD head Jo Vandeurzen and Yves Leterme requested a meeting with Verhofstadt where they call for an inclusion of CDH in the coalition. MR thus remained the only party opposing a deal that would include CDH, Verhofstadt decided to meet with Milquet again in the evening and bring back his morning proposal of a participation of CDH in the Government through an external actor, but added that this Minister would have the rank though not the title of Deputy Prime Minister. Milquet and her party met and agreed on this proposal.|$|E
50|$|Fenning {{was born}} in Fulham, London. He entered London Hospital Medical College in January 1904 but it took him {{thirteen}} years to complete his course. He became a rower for Leander Club.

50|$|For many years, {{the station}} pre-empted NBC's daytime game shows - which <b>later</b> aired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> hours - with Dialing for Dollars and daytime soaps. The NET/PBS shows Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood were also {{broadcast}} {{due to the}} lack of a full-market public television station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area at the time. Las Cruces-based KRWG-TV (channel 22) was an NET/PBS member, but its reception was spotty within El Paso proper due to the Franklin Mountains cutting across western El Paso, NET/PBS arranged for channel 9 to carry select programs including Sesame Street; <b>in</b> particular, <b>the</b> children's program aired on the station from its debut in 1969 until KCOS signed on in August 1978.|$|R

25|$|On 20 June, British heavy {{artillery}} bombarded German communications {{behind the front}} line {{as far back as}} Bapaume and then continued intermittently until the evening of 22 June. At dawn on 24 June, a shrapnel barrage began on the German front position and villages nearby. At noon more accurate fire began and in the evening a light rain turned the German positions into mud. On 25 June, {{heavy artillery}}-fire predominated, smashing trenches and blocking dug-outs, setting fire to supply dumps and causing large explosions in Montauban. Variations in the intensity of fire indicated likely areas to be attacked, the greatest weight of fire occurring at Mametz, Fricourt and Ovillers; during the night the German commanders prepared their defences around the villages and ordered the second line to be manned. After an overnight lull, the bombardment increased again on 26 June, then suddenly stopped. The German garrisons took post and fired red rockets to call for artillery support and a German barrage was fired into no man's land. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> huge mortar bombs began to fall, destroying shallower dug-outs and a super-heavy gun bombarded the main German strong-points, as smaller guns pulverised the villages close to the front line, from which civilians were hurriedly removed.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 June, one of the {{greatest}} ever feats of British arms began: The Battle of Waterloo. The British, Dutch, Belgian, Nassau and German troops were posted on higher ground south of Waterloo. There had been heavy rain overnight and Napoleon chose not to attack until almost midday. The delay meant that the Prussians had a chance to march towards the battle, but in the meantime, Wellington had to hold on. The French started their attack with an artillery bombardment. The first French attacks were then directed against the Chateau of Hougemont down from the main ridge. Here British and Nassau troops stubbornly defended the Hougomont buildings all day; the action eventually engaging a whole French Corps which failed to capture the Chateau. At half past one, the Anglo-Allied Army was assaulted by d'Erlon's infantry attack on the British left wing but the French were forced back with heavy losses. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> British troops were amazed to see waves of cavalrymen heading towards them. The British troops, as per standard drill, formed infantry squares (hollow box-formations four ranks deep) after which the French cavalry was driven off. As the Prussian advance guard began to arrive from the east, Napoleon sent French units to stabilise his right wing. At around seven o'clock, Napoleon ordered his Old and Middle Guard to make a final assault on the by now fragile Allied line. The attack was repulsed. At that point Wellington stood up and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines in a full assault on the retreating French. Napoleon fled the scene.|$|E
