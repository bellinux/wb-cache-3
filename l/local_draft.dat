Those assigned to [...] "work of national importance" [...] would be under civilian, not military, control and violations of law on the part of those in the program were subject to normal federal jurisdiction, not the military justice system.

40|$|Personalized {{ventilation}} {{is expected}} {{to improve the quality}} of inhaled air and accommodate individual thermal preferences. In this paper, a chair-based personalized ventilation system is proposed that can potentially be applied in theatres, cinemas, lecture halls, aircrafts, and even offices. Air quality, thermal comfort, and the human response to this ventilation method were investigated by experiments. By comparing eight different air terminal devices (ATDs) it was found that up to 80 % of the inhaled air could be composed of fresh personalized air with a supply flow rate of less than 3. 0 l/s. Perceived air quality improved greatly by serving cool air directly to the breathing zone. Feelings of irritation and <b>local</b> <b>drafts</b> could be eliminated by proper designs. Personalized air with a temperature below that of room air was able to bring "a cool head" and increased thermal comfort in comparison with mixing ventilation. Massive applications of this chair-based personalized ventilation system can be envisaged in the future. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
2500|$|In 1948, the United States {{instituted a}} peace-time draft with the Universal Military Training and Service Act (also called the Selective Service Act), which {{required}} all male American citizens {{to register with}} a <b>local</b> <b>draft</b> board upon reaching the age of 18.

2500|$|In October 1942 Blount {{received}} a selective service notification {{that he had}} been drafted into the Military of the United States. He quickly declared himself a conscientious objector, citing religious objections to war and killing, his financial support of his great-aunt Ida, and his chronic hernia. The <b>local</b> <b>draft</b> board rejected his claim. In an appeal to the national draft board, Blount wrote that the lack of black men on the draft appeal board [...] "smacks of Hitlerism." [...] Sonny's refusal to join the military deeply embarrassed his family, and many relatives ostracized him. He was eventually approved for alternate service at Civilian Public Service camp in Pennsylvania—but he did not appear at the camp as required on December 8, 1942. Shortly after, he was arrested in Alabama.|$|E

A wartime agency, the Custodian had responsibility for the seizure, administration, and sometimes the sale of enemy property in the United States. Palmer's background in law and banking qualified him for the position, along with his party loyalty and intimate knowledge of political patronage.|$|E
2500|$|In the 19th century, the {{municipality}} suffered several outbreaks of livestock diseases. [...] To protect the dairy industry, non-local herds were forbidden from passing through {{the municipality}}. [...] Cheese was no longer allowed to be carried across the mountains but was now transported on <b>local</b> <b>draft</b> horses. [...] Due to customs taxes with the neighboring Canton of Fribourg, cheese was carried on a route over the Col de Chaude to Villeneuve (VD) {{and from there to}} the shores of Lake Geneva, without crossing the Fribourg border. [...] The abolition of the inter-canton customs and taxes in 1848 led to the demolition of the Fribourg customs station on the main road that had linked Château-d'Œx with the grain and livestock markets. [...] Changes in markets and improvements in animal husbandry led to more Simmental cattle being raised for meat rather than cheese production. [...] The construction of the road over the Col des Mosses (1865–71) and {{the construction of a new}} road to Bulle (1895) eased transportation.|$|E
