40|$|AbstractMultiple axial cyclic and {{static loading}} tests have been {{performed}} on industrial steel pipe-piles driven at Dunkerque, northern France. This paper describes the site's geotechnical characteristics and experimental arrangements before defining and describing the stable, unstable or meta-stable responses observed under various combinations of cyclic loading. The interpretation draws on numerical analyses and a parallel model study by Tsuha et al. (2012), relating the field response to the probable shaft shear stress distributions and local effective stress conditions. It is argued that cyclic degradation is controlled by: (i) contraction in the highly constrained interface shear zone and (ii) kinematic yielding within the surrounding soil mass. Finally, interaction diagrams <b>linking</b> <b>shaft</b> response to cyclic loading parameters are proposed based on the field test data and a simplified cyclic capacity predictive approach...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{knowledge}} of the fine structure of vestibular hair bundles is increasing, the mechanical properties and functional significance of those structures remain unclear. In 2004, Bashtanov and colleagues reported the contribution of different extracellular links to bundle stiffness. We simulated Bashtanov’s experimental protocol using a three-dimensional finite element bundle model with geometry measured from a typical striolar hair cell. Unlike any previous models, we separately consider two types of horizontal links: <b>shaft</b> <b>links</b> and upper lateral links. Our most important results are as follows. First, we identified the material properties required to match Bashtanov’s experiment: stereocilia Young’s modulus of 0. 74 GPa, tip link assembly (gating spring) stiffness of 5300 pN/μm, and the combined stiffness of <b>shaft</b> <b>links</b> binding two adjacent stereocilia of 750 ∼ 2250 pN/μm. Second, we conclude that upper lateral links {{are likely to have}} nonlinear mechanical properties: they have minimal stiffness during small bundle deformations but stiffen as the bundle deflects further. Third, we estimated the stiffness of the gating spring based on our realistic three-dimensional bundle model rather than a conventional model relying on the parallel arrangement assumption. Our predicted stiffness of the gating spring was greater than the previous estimation...|$|R

40|$|Up to four link {{types are}} {{found between the}} stereocilia of chick {{vestibular}} hair bundles: tip links, horizontal top connectors, shaft connectors and ankle links. A fifth type, the kinocilial link, couples the hair bundle to the kinocilium. Brownian-motion microinterferometry was used to study the mechanical properties of the hair bundle and investigate changes caused by removing different links with the calcium chelator BAPTA or the protease subtilisin. Immunofluorescence with an antibody to the hair-cell antigen (HCA) and electron microscopy were used to verify destruction of the links. The root mean square displacement and the corresponding absolute stiffness of untreated hair bundles were 4. 3 nm and 0. 9 mN m- 1, respectively. The ratio of Brownian-motion spectra before and after treatment was calculated and processed using a single oscillator model to obtain relative stiffness. Treatment with BAPTA, which cleaves tip, kinocilial and ankle links, reduces hair-bundle stiffness by 43 %, whilst subtilisin treatment, which breaks ankle <b>links</b> and <b>shaft</b> connectors, reduces stiffness by 48 %. No changes were detected in viscous damping following either treatment. The time course of the subtilisin-induced stiffness change was close to that of HCA loss, {{but not to the}} disappearance of the ankle <b>links,</b> suggesting that <b>shaft</b> connectors make a more significant contribution to hair-bundle stiffness. Sequential treatments of the hair bundles with BAPTA and subtilisin show that the effects are additive. The implication of complete additivity is that structures resistant to both agents (e. g. top connectors and stereocilia pivots) are responsible for approximately 9 % of the overall bundle stiffness...|$|R

The device comprises a shape memory alloy wire wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum contrasted by a backup beam spring and fitted to the output shaft through an overrunning clutch. Electrical heating produces a contraction of the wire, hence a rotation of the drum which is transferred to the shaft. Thanks to the overrunning clutch, during the recoiling phase, the drum rotates backward while the shaft does not move. Spurious backward movements of the shaft are contrasted by a second overrunning clutch <b>linking</b> the <b>shaft</b> to the frame.
