40|$|Information {{critical}} {{to the security of}} nations is embedded in an array of foreign <b>languages.</b> Foreign <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> must often analyze complex information from different language sources, and the integrity of their analyses can significantly affect corporate and government decision-making, policy development, and response to world events. Psychological stress and fatigue can degrade the performance of foreign <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> resulting in errors that may adversely affect security. Optimal design of work organization and work environments, individual stress management training, and augmented cognitive linguistics may facilitate the performance of foreign <b>language</b> <b>professionals.</b> Strategic assessment and management of stress and fatigue in foreign <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> can improve the integrity of information analysis, facilitate decision-making, and enhance global security...|$|R

50|$|In the {{academic}} research setting, career advancement and funding {{depend on the}} number and quality of published papers. However, not all researchers are naturally skilled writers, especially among those in the hard and clinical sciences, and many do not receive formal training in how to write the specific genre of the research paper. These researchers can benefit from a <b>language</b> <b>professional</b> such as a teacher of academic writing or an authors' editor who provides substantive editing. In extreme cases, when the drafted manuscript does not match the genre and requires substantial restructuring before being able to meet readers' and peer reviewers' expectations, the <b>language</b> <b>professional</b> may offer developmental editing; however certain professional and ethical issues must be considered.|$|E
50|$|The <b>language</b> <b>professional</b> {{facilitates}} {{the writing process}} without interfering with the authors' ownership of and responsibility for the published document. He or she does not substitute the authors' role in conceiving the document and producing the content: {{she is not a}} ghost writer. She is familiar with issues of publication ethics and adheres to publishing guidelines, especially those of the Committee on Publication Ethics and, in the medical field at least, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. In particular, the work of the <b>language</b> <b>professional</b> does not cross the boundary into authorship. Rather, it is becoming increasingly common (especially in the biomedical sciences) for the language professional's contribution to a paper to be recognized in the paper's acknowledgements section.|$|E
50|$|Content editing, {{also known}} as {{substantive}} editing, comprehensive editing, macro editing, or heavy editing, {{is a form of}} copy editing that evaluates the overall formatting, style, and content of a document in order to enhance visual design and comprehension. Comprehensive editors are a type of <b>language</b> <b>professional.</b>|$|E
50|$|The writing support {{provided}} by <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> may involve teaching specific writing skills, translating documents into the desired publishing language, editing drafts {{at various stages}} of completion, guiding {{the creation of a}} new document and - in some cases - writing for authors. Thus, the services offered by <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> include <b>language</b> teaching (especially the teaching of academic writing), translation, author editing, developmental editing, and writing (medical writing and technical writing). These activities differ in functional terms but they share a common goal, namely helping authors produce quality papers for publication.|$|R
50|$|Multitran {{may offer}} well over 100 {{translations}} for a word, which complicates {{the task of}} choosing the right equivalent for beginning language learners, though it comes very handy for <b>language</b> <b>professionals.</b>|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the intense}} {{concentration}} needed by interpreters to hear every word spoken and provide an accurate rendition in the target <b>language,</b> <b>professional</b> interpreters work in pairs or in teams of three, so that the interpreters can switch and rest after interpreting for about ten to twenty minutes (depending on {{the difficulty of the}} content).|$|E
50|$|Whether the <b>language</b> <b>professional</b> is an authors' editor, {{a teacher}} of {{academic}} writing, or a translator, the particularly challenging situation requires developmental editing alongside other writing support services (e.g., education about good writing practices, translation, and linguistic editing). Language professionals who support such novice researcher-authors know to perform editorial—not authorial—duties, so they avoid ghost writing if authorship is not wanted.|$|E

40|$|Misunderstandings between {{economic}} approaches to {{language and the}} field of language policy/language planning arise from deficiencies {{in the literature of}} both camps. This paper examines four examples: (1) liaison interpreting, where traditional economic analysis points to surprisingbenefits of engaging interpreters,often not recognised by practitioners themselves; (2) sometimes exaggeratedclaims by <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> for the economic benefits of studying languages; (3) unresolved issues in language use in international organisations and trade; and (4) misinterpretations of links between multilingualism and disadvantage. Lack of understanding by economists of language issues is often matched by illiteracy in economics on the part of <b>language</b> <b>professionals...</b>|$|R

50|$|Given that <b>language</b> <b>professionals</b> {{are called}} on to solve {{problems}} that cannot be standardized, they engage in educational activities {{to keep up with}} new developments in, for example, publishing standards, tools and technology, didactic methods and ethics.

Examples of associations providing continuing professional development activities are EATAW, the Council of Science Editors, the European Medical Writers Association, the European Association of Science Editors, the Society for Editors and Proofreaders and Mediterranean Editors and Translators, the first association to specifically aim to bring together different types of <b>language</b> <b>professionals.</b>|$|R
