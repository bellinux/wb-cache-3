5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using <b>ladder</b> <b>network</b> topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E

Our analytical results indicate that unlike symmetric <b>ladder</b> <b>networks,</b> structural asymmetry introduced by a single slanted bypass {{can be used to}} modulate the relative drop spacing, enabling them to contract, synchronize, expand, or even flip at the ladder exit. Our experiments confirm all these behaviors predicted by theory. Numerical analysis further shows that while <b>ladder</b> <b>networks</b> containing several identical bypasses are limited to nearly linear transformation of input delay between drops, mixed combination of bypasses can cause significant non-linear transformation enabling coding and decoding of input delays.

500|$|Graph {{theory can}} be applied to network {{synthesis}}. [...] Classical network synthesis realises the required network in {{one of a number of}} canonical forms. [...] Examples of canonical forms are the realisation of a driving-point impedance by Cauer's canonical <b>ladder</b> <b>network</b> or Foster's canonical form or Brune's realisation of an immittance from his positive-real functions. [...] Topological methods, on the other hand, do not start from a given canonical form. [...] Rather, the form is a result of the mathematical representation. [...] Some canonical forms require mutual inductances for their realisation. [...] A major aim of topological methods of network synthesis has been to eliminate the need for these mutual inductances. [...] One theorem to come out of topology is that a realisation of a driving-point impedance without mutual couplings is minimal if and only if there are no all-inductor or all-capacitor loops.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} of RC <b>ladder</b> <b>networks,</b> which can represent chains of transmission gate or long wire interconnections, is modeled. Their energy {{dependence on the}} input rise time is analyzed by assuming a ramp input waveform. Since the analysis {{can be carried out}} in a straightforward manner only for very simple RC <b>ladder</b> <b>networks,</b> the exact analysis is first limited to asymptotic values of the input rise time T (i. e. for T 0 and T). Successively, the energy expression is extended to arbitrary values of the input rise time by introducing a suitable equivalent first-order RC circuit, whose resistance and capacitance are simply related to the resistances and capacitances of the original network. The energy expression found is useful for pencil-and-paper evaluation and affords an intuitive understanding of the network dissipation, since each term has an evident physical meaning. By comparison with SPICE simulations, the energy expression proposed is showed to be accurate enough for modeling purposes...|$|R
500|$|Waveguide filter designs {{frequently}} {{consist of}} two different components repeated a number of times. [...] Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit. [...] Often, the filter type will take {{its name from the}} style of this component. [...] These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer. [...] The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance. [...] The net result is a lumped element equivalent circuit of a <b>ladder</b> <b>network.</b> [...] Lumped element filters are commonly ladder topology, and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs. [...] Figure 4 shows such a ladder. [...] Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be LC resonators instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as prototype filters {{with the use of a}} band-pass or band-stop transformation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{respect of}} {{constant}} resistance filters, the term half section has {{a somewhat different}} meaning to other kinds of image filter. [...] Generally, a half section is formed by cutting through {{the midpoint of the}} series impedance and shunt admittance of a full section of a <b>ladder</b> <b>network.</b> [...] It is literally half a section. [...] Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. [...] A half section is either the series impedance (series half-section) or shunt admittance (shunt half-section) that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. [...] The purpose of using half sections is that the same functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count.|$|E

[...] Just as the input impedance of a Bode network is used as the Z impedance of a Zobel network to form a Zobel Bode equaliser, so the input impedance of a Cauer network is {{used to make a}} Zobel Cauer equaliser. [...] The equaliser is required to correct an attenuation increasing with frequency and for this a Cauer <b>ladder</b> <b>network</b> consisting of series resistors and shunt capacitors is required. [...] Optionally, there may be an inductor included in series with the first capacitor which increases the equalisation at the high end due to the steeper slope produced as resonance is approached.
