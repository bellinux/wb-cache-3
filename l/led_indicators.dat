25|$|The first {{air-conditioned}} rake {{for use on}} {{the suburban}} system was built by the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai {{at a cost of}} over , and arrived in Mumbai on 5 April 2016. The rake has a seating capacity of 1,028 passengers, and standing room for up to 6,000 passengers. The 12 coach rake is configured as two sets of six interconnected bogies, meaning passengers can walk between coaches but only up to a maximum of 6 coaches. The train is also equipped with a new electrical system and software, automatic doors with emergency opening features, and GPS-based destination display on <b>LED</b> <b>indicators.</b> The old system of pulling a chain to halt the train was replaced by four intercoms per coach that enable commuters to communicate with the driver.|$|E

The use of an integrated design with microcontroller and a ZigBee transceiver gives the possibility of developing wireless devices with small dimensions, low power consumption, and good computing capability. The pulse oximeter {{is used as a}} sensor to detect the heart rate from the user while ZigBee modules get all commands from microcontroller unit with complete ZigBee stack inside. Then, the heart rate information is obtained using a pulse oximeter, and it is displayed through the multicolor light emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> <b>indicator</b> on the bracelet. The <b>LED</b> <b>indicator</b> can show the different colors that indicate the range of heart rate. The results will help coaches as well as individual to monitor and regulate the user exercise training using a computer...|$|R
