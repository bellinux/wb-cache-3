50|$|Causes {{of upper}} airway {{obstruction}} include foreign body aspiration, blunt <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma,</b> penetrating <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma,</b> tonsillar hypertrophy, paralysis of the vocal cord or vocal fold, acute laryngotracheitis such as viral croup, bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, pertussis, retropharyngeal abscess, spasmodic croup. In basic and advanced life support airway obstructions are {{often referred to}} as A-problems. Management of airways relies on both minimal-invasive and invasive techniques.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesLaryngotracheal {{trauma is}} a rare and {{potentially}} deadly spectrum of injuries. We sought to characterize the contemporary mechanisms, diagnostic modalities, and outcomes common in <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma</b> today. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of all <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma</b> cases at 2 major metropolitan hospitals between 1996 and 2004, detailing mechanisms, associated injuries, diagnostic modalities, and outcomes of <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma.</b> ResultsWe identified 71 patients {{with a mean age}} of 32. 8 ± 13. 3 years (range, 15 – 71 years). In our series penetrating trauma was the cause in 73. 2 % of patients; however, blunt trauma had a significantly higher mortality (63. 2 % vs 13. 5 %, respectively; P <. 0001). Blunt mechanisms involved older patients (38. 5 ± 15. 2 years vs 30. 1 ± 11. 9 years, P =. 017), and these patients were more likely to require emergency airways than those with penetrating trauma (78. 9 % vs 46. 2 %, P =. 017). The requirement of an emergency airway was an independent predictor of mortality (P =. 0066). ConclusionLaryngotracheal trauma is a deadly spectrum of injuries with a mortality of 26. 8 %. Blunt mechanisms are decreasing in frequency. This might reflect improvements in automobile safety. Additionally, violent crime is on the increase, producing penetrating injuries with increasing frequency. The most fundamental intervention for patients with laryngotracheal injury is airway control. Either routine intubation or a tracheostomy can secure the airway. Blunt trauma and the requirement of an emergency airway are independent predictors of mortality. <b>Laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma</b> requires prompt recognition, airway protection, and skillful management to lessen the mortality of this deadly spectrum of injuries...|$|E
40|$|<b>Laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma</b> is life-threatening. We {{identified}} 23 patients between 1992 and 1998 with laryngeal (12), tracheal (8), {{and combined}} injuries (3). Nineteen patients had penetrating trauma (gunshot wound, 12; stab wound, 7), and four patients had blunt injury. Flexible laryngoscopy identified the injury in 8 of 12 patients (75 %), and computer tomography scan was positive in 9 of 9 patients (100 %). Twelve of the 19 patients with penetrating wounds were managed by primary repair, 4 had endotracheal intubation without surgical repair, and 3 were observed. No {{patient with a}} blunt tracheal injury required repair. Two had endotracheal intubation, and two were observed. A high index of suspicion is essential to identifying laryngotracheal injury. Computer tomography scan is a sensitive diagnostic test for laryngotracheal injury, and may be indicated despite normal flexible laryngoscopy. The decision to repair injuries or observe injuries is primarily based on respiratory distress and associated injuries...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and objective: <b>Laryngotracheal</b> deep <b>traumas</b> are {{uncommon}} damages {{that can}} result in potential fatal injury. Prompt intervention significantly improves patient survival and prevents short- and long-term aerodigestive tract sequelae. The progression of a patient was studied during and after his hospital stay. Case description: We report a clinical patient with a cervical trauma who required tracheotomy to secure the airway and subsequent surgical reconstruction with insertion of an endolaryngeal stent {{in order to preserve}} its permeability. Discussion: The diagnosis of cervical trauma is based on clinical history and physical examination. In spite of this, the absence of signs and symptoms do not reject the presence of a major injury. AngioCT is now the method of choice for the diagnosis of cervical trauma. The management of this pathology depends on the severity of the injuries.  Conclusions: The main objective in laryngotracheal injuries is to secure the airway. Morbidity and mortality of these lesions are related to prematurity in acting. Hence, early diagnosis is required. Prompt surgical repair decreases the rate of late complications, improving the patient’s quality of life...|$|R
5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest <b>trauma.</b> <b>Laryngotracheal</b> injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate the outcome following stenting {{over a period of}} 10 years in patients with chronic laryngotracheal stenosis.   Materials and Methods: Between 2000 – 2010, out of 111 patients with <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma,</b> 71 underwent tracheal        T-stenting for laryngotracheal stenosis in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India. All 71 patients underwent stenting by tracheal T-stent through an external approach. The follow-up period ranged from 3 – 10 years (mean, 3. 2 years). The tracheal T-stent was removed after a minimum period of 6 – 12 months.   Results: The majority of patients in this study were aged less than 10 years or between the ages of 20 – 30 years. A pre-operative tracheostomy (emergency or elective) was performed in all patients. of 71 patients, decannulation was not possible in six (8 %).   Conclusion:  Management of laryngotracheal stenosis is a challenging problem that demands a multidisciplinary approach from surgical teams well trained in this field. The ideal treatment option should be individualized according to patient characteristics. The use of silastic stents has both advantages and disadvantages...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma</b> {{is a rare}} but {{clinically}} important injury. Complications are frequent. Early recognition, accurate {{evaluation and}} proper treatment is vital. In order to learn from our past experience and refine our management, we reviewed our cases. METHODS: Fifteen patients with external laryngotracheal injuries were analyzed retrospectively. The outcome was assessed {{both in terms of}} voice and airway, on short term and long term basis. RESULTS: Commonest cause of injury was cut throat injuries followed by road traffic accidents. The main presenting symptoms and signs were hoarseness, haemoptysis, odynophagia and stridor. Major laryngeal injuries (10 cases) outnumbered minor injuries (5 cases). A good association exists between the symptoms of haemoptysis and stridor at presentation and severity of the injury. Sites of laryngeal injury included; thyroid cartilage, mixed soft tissue and cartilaginous injuries, thyrohyoid membrane, aryepiglottic fold and cricothyroid membrane. Ten patients presented within 24 hours of the injury. Out come (airway and voice) was good in 12 patients whereas it was poor in 3 patients. Poor results were seen in patients who had delayed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The presence of stridor and haemoptysis are suggestive of major injury. Early surgical intervention is recommended for all major injuries to ensure a good outcome...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Non-iatrogenic {{trauma to}} the airway is rare and {{presents}} a significant challenge to the anaesthetist. Although guidelines {{for the management of}} the unanticipated difficult airway have been published, these do not make provision for the ‘anticipated’ difficult airway. This systematic review aims to inform best practice and suggest management options for different injury patterns. Methods A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar for papers after the year 2000 reporting on the acute airway management of adult patients who suffered airway trauma. Our protocol and search strategy are registered with and published by PROSPERO ([URL] ID: CRD 42016032763). Results A systematic literature search yielded 578 articles, of which a total of 148 full-text papers were reviewed. We present our results categorized by mechanism of injury: blunt, penetrating, blast, and burns. Conclusions The hallmark of airway management with {{trauma to the}} airway is the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation, intubation under direct vision to avoid the creation of a false passage, and the avoidance of both intermittent positive pressure ventilation and cricoid pressure (the latter for <b>laryngotracheal</b> <b>trauma</b> only) during a rapid sequence induction. Management depends on available resources and time to perform airway assessment, investigations, and intervention (patients will be classified into one of three categories: no time, some time, or adequate time). Human factors, particularly the development of a shared mental model amongst the trauma team, are vital to mitigate risk and improve patient safety...|$|E
