Moreover, the CNB conducts open market operations {{in the form of}} repurchase agreements (REPOs). The basic duration is 2 weeks. Currently the CNB is absorbing {{excess liquidity}}. The aim of these operations is to influence short-term rates which subsequently affect economic activity, the flow of capital, and inflation.|$|E
50|$|Lombard {{credit is}} the {{granting}} of credit to banks against pledged items, mostly {{in the form of}} securities or life insurance policies. The pledged items must be readily marketable. Lending is via central banks, in particular the securities 'eligible for collateral' which are registered on lists; as a general rule, the <b>Lombard</b> <b>rate</b> (interest rate) is more or less one per cent above discount rate. The pledging of securities means that the credit institutions have the opportunity of acquiring money in the short term from central banks.|$|E
40|$|Although {{its primary}} {{ultimate}} objective is price stability, the Bundesbank has drawn {{a distinction between}} its money-focus strategy and the inflation targeting approach recently adopted {{by a number of}} central banks. We show that, holding constant the current forecast of inflation, German monetary policy responds very little to changes in forecasted money growth; we conclude that the Bundesbank is much better described as an inflation targeter than as a money targeter. An additional contribution of the paper is to apply the structural VAR methods of Bernanke and Mihov (1995) to determine the optimal indicator of German monetary policy: We find that the <b>Lombard</b> <b>rate</b> has historically been a good policy indicator, although the use of the call rate as an indicator cannot be statistically rejected. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on issue of {{monetary}} policy of the Czech National Bank and on application of its tools. The first part is devoted to explaining basic concepts related to the Czech National Bank and to defening {{its role in the}} banking system. The descriptive part is also dedicated to explanation of the role of monetary policy and the essence of the individual instruments of this policy. The practical part of the thesis deals with the usage of direct and indirect instruments of monetary policy, which affect not only the banking sector in the Czech Republic, but also the other economic indicators such as GDP growth, interest rate, then the discount, <b>lombard</b> and repo <b>rate.</b> All these aspects are important not only for residents of the Czech Republic, but also for potential foreign investors and business partners, for which serve as a measure of economic development of state...|$|R

Seven variables are considered: the consumer price index, oil price, exchange rate, tourist arrival rate, electricity consumption, <b>Lombard</b> <b>rate</b> and aggregate money supply. The sample data are monthly observations from January 2002 to December 2006. Four variables that are statistically significant at the 10 % level or better in explaining variation in the equity premium on the SEM are: {{the level of the}} price index, the oil price (given that Mauritius is heavily dependent on oil imports), the exchange rate and the level of economic activity as proxied by electricity consumption. The most important variable is the exchange rate. The reliability of the model is tested and found to be adequate. stock markets; emerging markets; arbitrage pricing theory; APT; Mauritius; consumer price index; oil price; exchange rate; tourist arrival rate; electricity consumption; Lombard rate; aggregate money supply. ...|$|E
40|$|Linkages between {{inflation}} and various monetary aggregates and other instruments of monetary policy are a basic subject of central banks’ attention. This article aims at answering the question, {{whether in the}} period of direct inflation targeting, being a strategy for monetary policy in Poland, the shifts in instruments of monetary policy and monetary aggregates were a cause for shifts in core {{inflation and}} inflation measured by CPI. Central bank interest rates (such as <b>lombard</b> <b>rate,</b> reference rate, rediscount rate and refinancing rate), reserve requirements, open market operations and monetary aggregates MO, Ml, M 2 and M 3 have been brought under study. It has been decided to measure the influence of these instruments on the three core inflation measures (15 % trimmed mean, core inflation excluding most volatile prices and core inflation excluding most volatile prices and fuel prices) and on CPI. According to our results, shifts in interest rates levels are generally reflected in the inflation level after 3 or 4 quarters. Reserve requirements ratios influence CPI to a much lesser degree and do not influence measures of underlying inflation at all. Open market operations have no impact on inflation either. As far as monetary aggregates are concerned, it is visible that only the widest measures of money supply affect inflation...|$|E
40|$|Interest {{rate policy}} {{is one of}} the oldest and at the same time most {{controversial}} tools with which central bank affects the economy. In fact, it comes down to the central bank initiated changes in the levels of the so-called official interest rates (discount rate, rediscount rate, <b>lombard</b> <b>rate,</b> and others) or influencing the market interest rates through open market operations. A frequent paradox which appears in the historical approach to interest rates is questioning of the causative role of interest rate changes introduced by central banks with reference to dynamics of the so-called real sphere as well as frequent use of this stabilization instrument. In the last few decades, several turnabouts occurred in economic policies (especially, monetary policies) of the industrialized countries. Each time, a new interpretation of interest rate policy was responsible for that [Bednarczyk, 1990, Hubbard, 2002]. One of the trends which appeared in the discussion was an attempt to return to classical roots of the interest rate theory. The concept of the natural rate of interest became the focus of attention. This paper refers to this concept and is an attempt to present the author’s own interpretation of it. The final part of the paper presents a study case of the natural interest rate policy of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in the years 1999 - 2003. It shows that finding an optimum rate of interest in the transforming economy can be even more difficult than it appears from purely theoretical discussions...|$|E
40|$|Market {{reaction}} {{to a change in}} official interest rates will depend {{on the extent to which}} the change is anticipated, and on how it is interpreted as a signal of future policy. In this paper, a technique is developed to separate the anticipated and unanticipated components of such changes, and applied to estimate the response of euro–deutsche mark interest rates to adjustments in the Bundesbank’s <b>Lombard</b> and discount <b>rates.</b> [JEL E 43, E 47] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, financial market participants, and agents in the economy at large attach importance to official central bank interest rates. What are termed official rates typically comprise the rates applied at one or more central bank standing facilities and in some cases at which the central bank operates a regular tender. In most industrialized countries, as in a number of developing countries, the central bank determines these rates both to define the range within which it manages short-term interbank rates through on-going open market operations, and to signal its medium-term policy stance (see Borio, 1997, for a recent survey). A change in official rates can thus affect expectations that are reflected in longer-term interest rates and other financial market prices, and hence initiate the monetary policy transmission process. It is therefore important that policymakers be able to predict the market response to such changes. Yet market participants have an incentive to anticipate policy shifts, and insofar as they succeed, market prices should largely adjust in advance of the implementation of...|$|R
40|$|The National Bank of Serbia, one of {{the most}} {{important}} state institutions of the Republic of Serbia, celebrates its grand jubilee this year - 130 years since its establishment. As the 16 th central bank in the world, it was funded by equity capital from domestic sources. The Bank started its operations on 2 July 1884 pursuant to the Law on the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia, adopted on 6 January 1883 and published in 'Novine Srpske' on 19 January of the same year. Prior to the adoption of this Law, the Serbian monetary system was regulated by the Law on Minting Silver Coins, enacted in 1873, which set up the dinar as the sole legal tender in Serbia. The role of the Bank was defined by the Law on the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia, enacted in 1883, and was as follows: 'In order to improve trade and crafts in the Kingdom of Serbia using cheap capital and well-designed credit, the Royal Government is empowered to establish the National Bank in accordance with the legal provisions of this Law. ' The initial discount rate of the National Bank was low and stable at 5. 5 % and the <b>Lombard</b> <b>rate</b> amounted to 6. 5 %. In the years up to 1941 these rates were relatively stable and usually varied between 5. 5 - 8 % at the annual level. During World War I, the National Bank was evacuated to Marseilles, while holding a representative office in London during World War II. During the 130 years of its operation, the National Bank has been run by 28 governors, the first of which was Aleksa Spasić, and three of which served two terms in office. The National Bank changed its name several times to reflect the change in the name of the state and its organization, and operated in different economic, social and international environments, including times of war, trade, economic and financial sanctions, hyperinflation and different internal and international political circumstances. Nowadays the National Bank of Serbia is organized as a modern central bank pursuant to the objectives and principles applied in Europe and beyond. Its legal mandate is the implementation of monetary and foreign exchange policies with the objective of maintaining low and stable inflation and preserving financial stability in the Republic of Serbia...|$|E
