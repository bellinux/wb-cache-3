5000|$|Common flute {{sizes are}} [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C", [...] "E" [...] and [...] "F" [...] or microflute. The letter {{designation}} {{relates to the}} order that the flutes were invented, not the relative sizes. Flute size refers {{to the number of}} flutes per <b>linear</b> <b>foot,</b> although the actual flute dimensions for different corrugator manufacturers may vary slightly. Measuring the number of flutes per <b>linear</b> <b>foot</b> is a more reliable method of identifying flute size than measuring board thickness, which can vary due to manufacturing conditions.

25|$|Although CSX {{no longer}} was interested, the state has plans to restore the {{remainder}} of the line for freight service. This would include rehabilitation of the Running Track and Terminal Yard from Bay Junction to Summer Street, as well as restoring {{the end of the line}} through the Boston Marine Industrial Park. Possibilities initially raised in mid-2009 included service to Conley Terminal or the Massport Marine Terminal via new spurs from Track 61. The City of Boston applied for $84M in TIGER funds in 2009, including $14M for expansion of Track 61. The existing out-of-service track paralleling Dry Dock Avenue through Black Falcon Cruise Terminal and the International Cargo Port Boston (totalling 2,860 <b>linear</b> <b>feet)</b> would have been rehabilitated, and 5,910 <b>linear</b> <b>feet</b> of new track constructed along Tide Street and Fid Kennedy Avenue into the Massport Marine Terminal.

50|$|Electric griddles are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle {{are typically}} 4-5 kilowatt (kW) per <b>linear</b> <b>foot,</b> and made from round rod sheathed incoloy material whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate. The round elements have a tangential point of contact with the griddle plate and are commonly {{held in place by}} a clamping bracket or plate. More than one element per <b>linear</b> <b>foot</b> is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a griddle plate of any given width. Electric griddles tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most electric griddle control systems.|$|R
40|$|The Zone 7 Water Agency uses {{concrete}} V-ditches {{to manage}} stormwater runoff from access roads near creeks. We attempted {{to find a}} way to manage runoff that would filter the stormwater and cost less than concrete V-ditches. Using Tassajara Creek in Dublin, California, as a case study, we designed a low- maintenance vegetated strip that would be capable of filtering pollutants from runoff, even while conveying the expected Q 100 flow of 0. 451 cfs. Our vegetated strip would cost $ 5 -$ 10 per <b>linear</b> <b>foot,</b> compared to $ 16 per <b>linear</b> <b>foot</b> for Tassajara Creek’s Vditches. Zone 7 could adopt this design without changing any of its guidelines for managing runoff from access roads. Because Zone 7 has more confidence in the performance of concrete channels during high flows, we recommend that Zone 7 implement our design on a trial basis and monitor its performance...|$|R

50|$|The East Bloomsburg Bridge was 1150 ft long. Prior to its {{demolition}} and reconstruction, {{the bridge}} {{was made up of}} six pin-connected through-truss spans. Each of these spans is 190 ft long. Each of the spans consisted of ten panels that were each 19 ft long. The panels were made of wrought iron and steel. The pins on the bridge were made of steel. The floor of {{the bridge was}} made of 2.5-inch (6 centimeter) oak. The original design of the bridge was such that it could support a static load of 732 lb per <b>linear</b> <b>foot</b> and a rolling load of 1440 lb per <b>linear</b> <b>foot.</b> The bridge's original weight limit was 13 tons, but this was later decreased to 10 tons.

25|$|The Walter Cronkite {{papers are}} {{preserved}} at the curatorial Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin. Occupying 293 <b>linear</b> <b>feet</b> (almost 90 metres) of shelf space, the papers document Cronkite's journalism career. Amongst the collected material are Cronkite's early beginnings while he {{still lived in}} Houston. They encompass his coverage of World War II as a United Press International correspondent, where he cemented his reputation by taking on hazardous overseas assignments. During this time he also covered the Nuremberg war crimes trial serving as {{the chief of the}} United Press bureau in Moscow. The main content of the papers documents Cronkite's career with CBS News between 1950 and 1981.|$|E
25|$|The west tunnel was {{the most}} {{difficult}} of the three tunnels to excavate. It was excavated using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) that took over four years to bore its way through the mountain. The TBM was launched from the Waterman Portal and tunneled in a westerly direction toward the Devil Canyon portal at a slight uphill gradient of approximately 2inches per 100 <b>linear</b> <b>feet</b> (0.17%). Crews faced many challenges during the excavation, including the 2003 Old Fire that destroyed construction equipment at the Waterman Portal and halted tunneling for ten days. Later that year, a flash flood engulfed the Waterman Portal site and submerged the TBM. It took four months to restore operations {{in the aftermath of the}} flooding.|$|E
25|$|The first layout in {{the space}} was started in July 1962, with the framing and scenery built before the track was laid, and the first spike driven on August 30, 1962. This layout was 27 by 55 feet in size, and was of a {{double-track}} folded dogbone design, built with traditional square tabletop framing, plaster scenery, and relay control. Eventually it grew to have over 4000 <b>linear</b> <b>feet</b> of track, in both standard and 3-foot gauges, with some dual gauge mixed in. It existed through to January 1999, when it was torn down due to growing problems with accessibility and electrical characteristics. Many of the original structures and switches have been saved, for eventual inclusion on the new layout. Most notable of these is a 1940s train station model which had previously been salvaged from the layout at the PMRC location on Chestnut Street.|$|E
50|$|Gas griddles {{are by far}} {{the most}} common, due to the ready {{availability}} of natural and propane gas in commercial cooking environments, and are preferred for their rapid heat-up and more consistent temperatures. Gas burners will tend to heat the plate more evenly as a film of hot gases will cover the entire bottom plate surface. Typical griddles use between 25,000 and 30,000 BTU of energy per <b>linear</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{cost of the}} Steel belt is high. Compare {{with other}} {{materials}} ( [...] plastic belt), the steel belt is more expensive. However, the steel belt have an advantage overall because the Steel Belt are not petroleum based material. The Steel Belt making prices per <b>linear</b> <b>foot</b> is less expensive compared to plastic belt. Furthermore, the Steel Belt lead by low cost of process compared to the plastic belt.|$|R
50|$|Tradition {{holds that}} the road was called Dollarway because it cost one dollar per <b>linear</b> <b>foot</b> to construct. The final cost was closer to $1.36 per foot. In July 1913, Little Rock, Arkansas {{contractors}} Shelby and Bateman were chosen to construct the approximately 23-mile road. Construction began in November 1913, and the road was finished in October 1914. The Dollarway Road was the longest continuous concrete pavement in the United States when complete.|$|R
