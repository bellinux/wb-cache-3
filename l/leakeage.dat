40|$|Infiltration or {{in other}} words the air leakage in {{buildings}} has an important role on heat load calculations. The rate of this loss has been estimated as 20 to 30 % of the total load. The indicated important effect of infiltration on the load calculations needs a reliable method for the determination of air <b>leakeage</b> level in buildings. Meantime, the rate of infiltration has an additional importance at the area of thermal comfort studies which deals with the air quality of enclosed volumes. During this research study, first the mechanism of infiltration and the major components of the phenomena (wind pressure, temperature difference) was discussed together with the theoretical considerations. Later, several conventional engineering approachs and emprical methods was reviewed and compared among each others. At {{the last part of}} the paper, the modified DIN 4701 method which is presently used in Turkey, and some other algorithms was applied to some pilot buildings and the predictions was compared with experimental results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental, numerical and analytical {{study of the}} effect of open roof on acoustic propagation along a 3 D urban canyon. The experimental study is led by means of a street scale model. The numerical results are performed with a 2 D Finite Difference in Time Domain approach adapted {{to take into account the}} acoustic radiation losses due to the street open roof. An analytical model, based on the modal decomposition of the pressure field in a horizontal plane mixed with a 2 D image sources model to describe the attenuation along the street, is also proposed. Results are given for several frequencies in the low frequency domain (1000 - 2500 Hz). The comparison of the three approaches shows a good agreement until f= 100 Hz at full scale, the analytical model and the 2 D numerical simulation adapted to 3 D permit to modelize the acoustic propagation along a street. For higher frequency, experimental results show that the <b>leakeage,</b> due to the street open roof, is not anymore uniformly distributed on all modes of the street. The notion of leaky modes must be introduced to modelize the acoustic propagation in a street canyon...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Ten {{patients}} who underwent hydatid cyst surgery were evaluated retrospectively show {{the relationship between}} surgical technique and postoperative bile <b>leakeage.</b> Material and Methods: Ten cases with different number of cysts in different diamaeters operated for hepatic hydatid disease were evaluated retrospectively. Mean age of the patients was 52. 4 (14 - 75) with a male to female ratio of 3 / 7. Diagnosis was confirmed with serological tests, ultrasonography and computerized tomography. Results: A total number of 18 cysts were observed in 10 patients included in this study. Surgical operations applied were partial cystectomy for 11 cysts, cystotomy drainage for 3 cysts, intro-şexion for 2 cysts, and pericystectomy for 2 cysts. Of these 18 cysts, 13 cysts had clear şuid without intrabiliary rupture, and were treated by partial cystectomy or intro-şexion. After these procedures two patients had complications. External biliary fistula developed {{in one of them}} and bile peritonitis with subhepatic bilioma developed in the other. Bile fistula healed spontaneously on the tenth day. Bile peritonitis was managed by inserting a periton dialysis catheter into Douglas left for 48 hours. Subhepatic bilioma was drained percutaneously under computerized tomography and bile drainage persisted for two months, which ceased spontaneously. Conclusion: It is concluded that biliary leakage after partial cystectomy or cystotomy can be avoided by suturing or clipping cut edges of pericysts...|$|E
40|$|Urban development, as {{comprehensive}} concept, {{involves a}} wide set of components, {{and it would}} imply a reasonably well balanced growth of differents urban functions and activities. The strong spatial competition between firms and localities in metropolitan areas yields unequal spatial impacts on the growth of retail activities. An usual scenery in western suburban areas {{is the presence of}} great retail facilities dominating the surrounding market. This situation negatively affects to little and lower-medium settlements that, in this way, play a dominated role, seen as undesirable by local agents and provoking emergent policies. Grounded on this basis this paper tackles the case of a lower medium new town located near Madrid (Tres Cantos), where the local government and retail organisations have reacted against its dominated role and have promoted a set of measures to overcome the problems detected, mainly the local consumer <b>leakeage,</b> the limited success or failure of new retail firms and, in a wider sense, the underdevelopment of the local retail sector. The study describes the main findings of a wider report conducted to evaluate the implemented measures, its effectiveness and the local market agents' valuation.

40|$|There {{are several}} options for {{surgical}} treatment of large bowel obstruction caused by cancer, depending on location of obstruction, intraoperative local findings (perforation, peritonitis, bowel dilatation proximal to obstruction) and patients 2 ̆ 7 condition. Resection and anastomosis as one stage surgery would be preffered procedure. Anastomotic leakage, {{on the other}} hand, highly elevates risk of mortality and mobidity. The most important question is whether to, in resectable cases, perform primary resection with anastomosis or not. This study was retrospective and included 40 patients that have undergone emergency surgery for large bowel obstruction caused by cancer. According to whether resection and anastomosis was made at initial surgery or not, patients were grouped in group A (N= 18) and group B (N= 21), respectively. We have analysed the type of surgical procedure, days of hospitalization, mortality, anastomotic <b>leakeage,</b> wound infection and other postoperative complications. Our results {{show that there is}} no major difference in mortality and morbidity in these two groups, suggesting that for selected patients primary resection and anastomosis is a safe option of tratment with acceptable risk. Since there are no strict guidelines or scorring system which would point the tratment option the decision about the choice of procedure still remains the burden of surgeon and depends on its experience and subspeciality. Our experience recomends primary resection and anastomosis except in cases of bowel perforation on tumor site, in cases of extreme dilatation and atony of bowel proximal to obstruction site and severe hypoproteinemia and anemia...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Injection {{is one of}} {{most painful}} and common medical {{interventions}} that more than 12 billion of it are administered annually throughout the world. Pain remains {{as one of the}} unresolved health problems. The objective of this research was to investigate the pain severity utilizing the z-track air lock technique during intra muscular injection procedure. Method:This study was conducted as an unblinded cinical trial, where 90 female subjects aged between 18 - 25 years old were randomly assigned to three groups of 30. Each group received z-track air lock (Group ZTAL), air lock (AL), and z-track (Group ZT) techniques. Neurobion 5000 vitamin used as an injection substance. A Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) on 0 – 3 was used to evaluate the severity of pain during procedure. Data were analized using the SPSS version 19. Groups’ age, Body Mass Index (BMI) and pain severity were analyzed through descriptive and One Way ANOVA statistics. Results: Results showed that there were no signifi cant differences of pain severity both within and between groups (p > 0. 05). Discussion: Both Z-track and air lock method are less pain compared to traditional method according to previous studies. Noncicepti stimulus inhibited nocicepti stimulus in z-track technique while locking effect inhibit <b>leakeage</b> of substance injection to subcutaneous layer of skin which contain of nerve fi bers. However All techniques are recommended to produce less pain therefore it can be considered as a standard procedure for intra muscular injection.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was a {{comparative}} analysis between open colic surgery with fast-track protocols and laparoscopic surgery regarding postoperative results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a prospective manner in a period of 3 years (January 2009 - December 2011) and included patients with diagnosis of colon adenocarcinoma. Patients were included in 2 groups: one with open approach with fast-track protocols (OPEN-FT group) and the other, laparoscopic approach with traditional perioperative care (LAP group). RESULTS: There were no statistical {{differences between the two groups}} regarding demographic data, co-morbdities, tumor site, stage (Dukes) and type of surgery. Applicability of fast-track protocols was between 66. 6 % and 100 %. We noted the following postoperative complications: wound infection 15. 4 % (n= 6) in group OPEN-FT vs 6. 89 % (n= 3) in group LAP; hemoperitoneum 2. 6 % (n= 1) vs 0 %; anastomotic <b>leakeage</b> 0 % vs 2. 6 % (n= 1); postoperative ileus 0 % vs 2, 6 % (n= 1). The time to first gas or stool passage was 48 ± 15. 92 hours in group OPEN-FT and 32. 1 ± 16. 9 hours in group LAP as well the average length of hospital stay was 6. 1 ± 1. 5 vs 5. 6 ± 2. 1 days. The mortality rate was in first group 2. 5 % (n= 1) vs 0 % in laparoscopic group. All these results were no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Applicability of fast-track protocols in open surgery of colon cancer reduces the gap from laparoscopic surgery in terms of postoperative results...|$|E
40|$|SiGe {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistors}} (HTBs) have been fabricated using selective epitaxy for the Si collector, {{followed in the}} same growth step by nonselective epitaxy for the p+ SiGe base and n-Si emitter cap. DC electrical characteristics are compared with cross-section TEM images to identify the mechanisms and origins of leakage currents associated with the epitaxy in {{two different types of}} transistor. In the first type, the polysilicon emitter is smaller than the collector active area, so that the extrinsic base implant penetrates into the single-crystal Si and SiGe {{around the perimeter of the}} emitter and the polycrystalline Si and SiGe exrtrinsic base. In these transistors, the Bummel plots are near-ideal and there is no evidence of emitter/collector leakage. In the second type, the collector active area is smaller than the polysilicon emitter, so the extrinsic base implant only penetrates into the polysilicon extrinsic base. In these transistors, the leakage currents observed depend on the base doping level. In transistors with a low doped base, emitter/collector and emitter/base leakage is observed, whereas in transistors with a high doped base only emitter/base leakage is observed. The emitter/collector leakage is explained by punch through o fhte base caused by thinning of the SiGe base at the emitter perimeter. The emitter/base <b>leakeage</b> is shown to be due to Poole-Frenkel mechanism and is explained by penetration of the emitter/base depletion region into the p+ polysilicon extrinsic base at the emitter periphery. Variable collector/base reverse leakage currents are observed and a variety of mechanisms are observed, including Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, trap assisted tunneling, Poole Frenkel and band to band tunneling. These result s are explained by the presence of polysilicon grains on the sidewalls of the field oxide at the collector perimeter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract enviado al congresos 5 th International Conference on Multifunctional, Hybrid and Nanomaterials (6 - 10 March 2017 | Lisbon, Portugal) y poster presentado en dicho congreso. Metal-organic {{frameworks}} (MOF) offer unique {{advantages for}} many applications {{due to their}} ordered structures, high thermal stability, tunable chemical functionality, ultra-high porosity {{and the availability of}} hundreds of well characterized structures. [1] On the other hand, Ionic Liquids (IL), which are ionic salts liquid at ambient conditions, have suitable properties for many applications, such as negligible volatility, non-flammability, high thermal and chemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, their liquid nature hinders their handling, making it necessary the use solid supports. [2] The insertion of ILs into MOFs has resulted in a new generation of materials with properties of both MOF and IL. [3] The studies of potential applications of MOF@IL composite materials are still very incipient, but they point out that the properties of MOFs could be improved by the insertion of ILs. [4] In order to know whether MOF@IL could be used as new materials it is necessary to study their stability, both thermal and chemical. In this work, three MOFs were selected, CuBTC, ZIF- 8 and MOF- 74,[5] to produce MOF@IL with two ILs, [BMIM][BF 4] and [EMIM][BF 4]. Themogravimetry was used to determine the thermal stability of the composites, as well as, to quantify the IL content before and after the <b>leakeage</b> tests both in water and toluene. Other characterization techniques, such as, IR spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction were used. The insertion of ILs was successful for CuBTC and ZIF- 8, but not for MOF- 74. The thermal stability of the MOF@IL is related to the interactions established between thet MOF and the IL. However, the chemical stability of the composites in water and toluene depend on that of the MOFs and, consequently, a poor stability is observed for CuBTC@IL in water. The use of these new materials is, therefore, determined by the stability of the MOFs acting as host structures.
