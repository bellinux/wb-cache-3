Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes.

500|$|The Saturn's design {{elicited}} mixed commentary among game {{developers and}} journalists. Developers quoted by Next Generation in December 1995 described the Saturn as [...] "a real coder's machine" [...] for [...] "those who <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware", with [...] "more flexibility" [...] and [...] "more calculating power than the PlayStation". The Saturn's sound board was also widely praised. By contrast, Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly {{slower than the}} PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little {{difference between the two}} systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like C.s number crunching was handled by four serial DSPs that were way too costly to be included in any home system. Sega's consequent development of the SH-2 meant that it could also produce a Saturn-compatible arcade system.}} The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller's Tales' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier [...] "to get started on... you quickly reach [...] limits", whereas the Saturn's [...] "complicated" [...] hardware had the ability to [...] "improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly." [...] A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated [...] "Geometry Transfer Engine" [...] that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an [...] "essentially" [...] 2D system.|$|E
2500|$|The album's lyrical content {{predominantly}} touches upon {{themes of}} relationships, exploring {{what it means}} to be in <b>love,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt, to need someone, and to be true to yourself. The theme of relationships is picked up in numerous songs; [...] "Kiss It Better" [...] sees Rihanna questioning how far an ex-lover will go to get her back; in [...] "Woo", Rihanna turns spiteful, stating she does not care for her ex-partner, while [...] "Never Ending" [...] features Rihanna admitting she would like to be in love again. The album's themes were also noted as being unapologetic, with an uncaring attitude, and self-assurance.|$|E

2500|$|Following in {{the path}} of Canadian {{composer}} Colin McPhee, who had done extensive research in Indonesian music in the 1930s and wrote a number of compositions incorporating Balinese and Javanese elements, Harrison's style began to change, showing the influence of gamelan music more clearly if only in timbre: [...] "It was the sound itself that attracted me. In New York, when I changed gears out of twelve tonalism, I explored this timbre. The gamelan movements in my Suite for Violin, Piano, and Small Orchestra [...] are aural imitations of the generalized sounds of gamelan". Virgil Thomson (with whom Harrison also studied) gave him a copy of Harry Partch's book on musical tuning, Genesis of a Music, which prompted Harrison to start writing music in just intonation. He did not abandon equal temperament altogether, but often expressed a desire to do so. In an oft-quoted comment referring to the frequency ratios used in just intonation, he said, [...] "I'd long thought that I would love a time when musicians were numerate as well as literate. I'd love to be a conductor and say, 'Now, cellos, you gave me 10:9 there, please give me a 9:8 instead,' I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to the people who do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
2500|$|Future Spice Girl Emma Bunton {{auditioned for}} the role of Bianca, however, it was actress Patsy Palmer who was {{eventually}} cast. Hester Lacey of The Independent has described Palmer's casting as an [...] "accident", as she did not formally audition {{for the role}}. EastEnders casting director Jane Deitch and writer–director McHale visited her drama class at the Anna Scher Theatre looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as she was older, but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line [...] "I can't believe you just said that." [...] The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day. In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: [...] "I've been a lucky girl. I always used to say I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in EastEnders, because I used to think 'God, I'll never get a part where I have to speak really posh', – I'm not very good at accents." [...] Palmer was 21 when she first appeared on-screen as 16-year-old Bianca.|$|E
