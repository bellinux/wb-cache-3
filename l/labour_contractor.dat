40|$|In Britain, {{international}} migrants {{have very}} recently become the major workforce in labour-intensive agriculture. This paper explores {{the causes of}} the dramatic increase since the 1990 s in the employment of migrant workers in this sub-sector. It locates this major change in a general pattern of intensification in agricultural production related to an ongoing process of concentration in retailer power, and in the greater availability of migrant workers, shaped in part by state initiatives to manage immigration. However, within this narrative of change at the national scale, the paper also finds continuing diversity in agricultural workplace regimes. The paper draws on concepts developed in the US literature on agrarian capitalism. It then uses case histories from British agriculture to illustrate how growers have directly linked innovations involving intensification through labour control to their relationships with retailers. Under pressure on ‘quality’, volume and price, growers are found to have ratcheted up the effort required from workers to achieve the minimum wage through reducing the rates paid for piece work, and in some cases to have changed the type of <b>labour</b> <b>contractor</b> they use to larger, more anonymous businesses.

40|$|One {{particularly}} significant piece of labour legislation in India is the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 (CLA, 1970), which regulates labour hired by firms through {{the offices of}} a <b>labour</b> <b>contractor</b> - such labour being referred to as ?contract? labour in India. This paper seeks to examine this Act and its implication for manufacturing employment in India. While empirical evidence seems to indicate the presence of large number of ?contract? workers in the Indian manufacturing sector across a spectrum of industries, this increasing contractualisation of the workforce has not been typically discussed as a pointed labour regulation issue. It has been widely argued that Indian labour law imposes institutional rigidities inhibiting employment expansion; but note {{needs to be taken}} of a ruling by the Supreme Court in 2001 which interpreted the CLA, 1970 in the case of Steel Authority of India v. National Union Water-Front Workers. This judicial interpretation has led to increased flexibility in the Indian labour market enabling firms to employ ?contract? workers widely, often employing them in jobs where they work alongside permanent workers. Against this backdrop, we undertake a preliminary empirical exercise in an attempt to document the increase in engagement of ?contract? workers and to dissect the data to see patterns in the use of ?contract? workers in formal manufacturing. These empirical patterns help us generate hypotheses for further work on the normative consequences of large scale use of ?contract? labour ? the use of ?contract? workers no doubt brings in flexibility in labour usage and can be judged as a beneficial development for employers, however issues of investment in skills remains a hindrance in enhancing labour as well as overall welfare. publishersversio...|$|E

Evidence is presented of contractors’ precarious position {{at the tail end of}} global production networks and three conclusions are drawn. First, contractors reveal themselves to be a remarkably unrecognized source of entrepreneurship, flexibility, and skills acquisition, which facilitates manufacturers’ participation in global markets. Second, despite their resourcefulness and resilience, contractors find themselves trapped between management and the workforce, and in an overall situation of vulnerability as a result of the informal nature of their activities and the vagaries of the neoliberal market. For many of them this results in a highly fluid and unstable class experience, in which they struggle to materialize aspirations for upward mobility. Finally, neoliberal conditions tend to undermine rather than enhance contractors’ entrepreneurial success and to weaken rather than intensify their power with regard to both capital and labour...|$|R

As with railway workers on other parts of the line in the Prairies and northern Ontario, most of the Chinese workers lived in tents. These canvas tents were often unsafe, and did not provide adequate protection against falling rocks or severe weather in areas of steep terrain. Such tents were typical of working-class accommodations on the frontier for all immigrant workers although (non-Chinese) foremen, shift bosses and trained railwaymen recruited from the UK were housed in sleeping cars and railway-built houses in Yale and the other railway towns. Chinese railway workers also established transient Chinatowns along the rail line, with housing at the largest consisting of log-houses half dug into the ground, which was a common housing style for natives as well as other frontier settlers, because of the insulating effect of the ground in an area of extreme temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|Historians {{estimate}} Onderdonk {{arranged to}} bring in several thousand Chinese from China and many more thousand from California. The Chinese workers were assigned to crews separate from the white workers and often given the most dangerous jobs, including the tunnel blasting, using the highly unstable nitroglycerin explosive. Many Chinese were killed in accidents or died of scurvy during the winter. Scurvy fatalities, due to a vitamin deficiency in the diet, were high because of the workers' dietary reliance on rice. They were given rice mats {{as part of their}} pay system, and the workers had little cash to buy supplements for their food. They owed debts to the Chinese <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> who had sold their services to Onderdonk. [...] Unlike the white workers, injured Chinese workers were not provided access to the company hospital. They were left to the aid of their fellow workers. At the end of construction, the Chinese labour contracting companies abandoned their charges; thousands of workers were left stranded and living in caves without food and water in the desert heat of the mountains surrounding Spences Bridge. They were not able to leave the area until white charities in Vancouver sponsored tickets for their transport back to China or California.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{prevailing}} stagnation of the colony's economy and society {{during most of}} the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, and coconuts failed. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the gum was tapped in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar, and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} coping and {{adaptation}} processes of Bangladeshi peasants after the natural disaster of Cyclone Aila in 2009. The {{focus is on}} the experience of peasants and how they responded to the losses caused by the cyclone. Using 72 in-depth interviews with peasants, shrimp farmers, local leaders, <b>labour</b> <b>contractors,</b> engineers and NGO staff, this study analyses the aftermath of Cyclone Aila in two villages in the Satkhira district located in the Sundarban delta of Bangladesh. One of the villages, Gorkumarpur, was considerably more economically backward and poorer than the other, the village of Mollapara. This thesis discovered that peasants saw corruption and the conflict between local interest groups as one of the major obstacles to reconstruction of the damaged embankments. It also found that the peasants were able to cope with this natural calamity by taking up a range of casual jobs. Such employment was essential after the initial relief initiatives ended. A second, longer-term adaptation strategy involved some peasant families migrating to other parts of Bangladesh and to India. Distress migration after 2009 was superficially reminiscent of the migration that occurred during the Bengal Famine of 1943. However, it was not {{the poorest of the poor}} who typically migrated after 2009 but those who had access to at least some resources. Migration was costly.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry in India {{is one of}} the largest sources of employment in the country, but it is weakly regulated by labour legislation. As a consequence, construction workers are hired informally, their employment is unprotected and they do not have access to social security in cases such as unemployment, illness, injury, regency and old age. In Tamil Nadu, construction workers started to organise collectively into trade unions in the early 1980 s and demanded a comprehensive legislation to be implemented in the {{construction industry}}. The state government responded in 1982 by enacting a legislation to improve the conditions of different groups of informal workers, among them construction workers. This act, however, was never implemented. Instead, the Tamil Nadu Construction Workers Welfare Board was established in 1994 to provide welfare schemes. The Board is governed as a tripartite institution with representatives from unions, employers and the state government, but does not play any role in the regulation of employment and the welfare schemes do not contain substantial social security. Through a qualitative case study of the construction industry in Chennai, the state capital of Tamil Nadu, the aim of this thesis is to explain opportunities for – and constraints to construction workers’ agency by examining how employment arrangements and welfare provisions were regulated and negotiated. The data material consists of interviews with workers, union leaders, employers and government officials, as well as documentary sources, collected during the period 2007 - 2010. I use local labour regime as an analytic frame to approach the interaction between labour regulation, labour control and workers’ agency on different geographical scales. In dialogue with theoretical perspectives on the informal economy and literature on the politics of work and welfare in India, I develop a contextual explanation of processes that conditioned the agency of construction workers in Chennai and the ways they themselves shaped their working lives. The thesis argues that alliances between employers, certain union leaders and politicians on a regional scale have facilitated the implementation of welfare schemes, but also prevented more structural changes in labour regulation. By accommodating some of the welfare demands from the unions, labour regulation could be kept at a minimum. Another constraint to the collective agency of construction workers was the fragmented union landscape, caused by differences in political orientation and also to the proliferation of unions organising informal workers. Still, the welfare schemes worked as an organising tool for the unions, which were able to influence the state government to a certain degree. Moreover, my two case study unions played a key role as intermediaries of welfare provisions including accident compensation from employers. Hence, I identify a union-influenced labour regime in the neighbourhoods, recruitment sites and workplaces of local workers residing in Chennai on a permanent basis. In comparison, at two large construction sites within Greater Chennai, I identify a migrant-based labour regime, characterised by the absence of unions, lower wages, longer hours of work and lack of access to welfare schemes. I relate the differences between the two regimes to local and migrant workers’ varying degrees of spatial embeddedness. While it is often argued that labour market intermediaries prevent collective organising, I demonstrate that the ambiguous positionality and multiple roles of local <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> operating as intermediaries between the formal and informal spheres were important to understand the unionisation of construction workers in Chennai. Furthermore, I show that the recruitment sites of local workers were regulated by social rules and practices, and to some extent union involvement, which increased their bargaining power as compared to the migrant workers. At the same time, the asymmetrical relations between <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> and labourers also constrained the room for manoeuvre in negotiating employment arrangements, and tendencies towards hierarchy and dependence were replicated in the unions. To bring out these complexities, I argue that it is necessary to focus on regulatory processes and multiple forms of worker agency that manifest in the production and reproduction locales, both on regional and local scales...|$|R

Nine to ten percent of the respondents admitted that they did not report all of their income to the tax or social security authorities. Nevertheless, {{the decision was made to}} continue the surveys online in 2007 - 2010 for budgetary reasons. The survey included questions on the supply of hidden <b>labour</b> (<b>contractors),</b> and on the demand (customers) : house cleaning and home maintenance. The outcomes do not differ between face-to-face and online surveys: in either case the demand based estimates were 3 to 10 times higher than the supply based estimates. Moreover, the outcomes are matched by the results of other research. So ideally future survey research should focus on the demand side of the hidden labour market. About 30 percent of all respondents said that they would work off the record if they had the chance, but most did not. The people who do are mostly young, have technical skills, small jobs or regular work in agriculture, construction, sports, recreation, hotels, cafés or restaurants. Having debts affects the willingness but not the opportunity to work off the record. Perceived high probability of detection may act as a deterrent. In contrast to the mid-eighties, people on social benefits participate no more in the hidden labour market than others. Another difference is that women are as well represented as men.

Floods delayed the start of the construction season, but over 672 km of main line, as well as sidings and branch lines, were built that year.

By the end of 1883, the railway had reached the Rocky Mountains, just eight kilometres (five miles) east of Kicking Horse Pass. The construction seasons of 1884 and 1885 would be spent in the mountains of British Columbia and on the north shore of Lake Superior.Many thousands of navvies worked on the railway. Many were European immigrants. In British Columbia, government contractors hired workers from China, known as [...] "coolies". A navvy received between $1 and $2.50 per day, but had to pay for his own food, clothing, transport to the job site, mail and medical care. After 2½ months of hard labour, they could net as little as $16. Chinese labourers in British Columbia made only between 75 cents and $1.25 a day, paid in rice mats, and not including expenses, leaving barely anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs, such as working with explosives to clear tunnels through rock. The families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation, or even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China, although Chinese <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> had promised that as part of their responsibilities. Many spent years in isolated and often poor conditions. Yet the Chinese were hard working and played a key role in building the Western stretch of the railway; even some boys as young as twelve years old served as tea-boys.

60|$|Indeed, {{the burden}} of the work had fallen {{altogether}} on Findlayson and his assistant, the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs. There were <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> by the half-hundred - fitters and riveters, European, borrowed from the railway workshops, with, perhaps, twenty white and half-caste subordinates to direct, under direction, the bevies of workmen - but none knew better than these two, who trusted each other, how the underlings were not to be trusted. They had been tried many times in sudden crises - by slipping of booms, by breaking of tackle, failure of cranes, and the wrath of the river - but no stress had brought to light any man among men whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked them-selves. Findlayson thought it over from the beginning: the months of office-work destroyed at a blow when the Government of India, at the last moment, added two feet to the width of the bridge, under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper, and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculations- and Hitchcock, new to disappointment, buried his head in his arms and wept; the heart-breaking delays over the filling of the contracts in England; the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one, only one, rather doubtful consignment were passed; the war that followed the refusal; the careful, polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war, till young Hitchcock, putting one month's leave to another month, and borrowing ten days from Findlayson, spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to London, and there, as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved, put the fear of God into a man so great that he feared only Parliament and said so till Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table, and - he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name. Then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridge works; and after the cholera smote the small-pox. The fever they had always with them. Hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers, for the better government of the community, and Findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately, learning what to overlook and what to look after. It was a long, long reverie, and it covered storm, sudden freshets, death in every manner and shape, violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things; drought, sanitation, finance; birth, wedding, burial, and riot in the village of twenty warring castes; argument, expostulation, persuasion, and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon, thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the gun-case. Behind everything rose the black frame of the Kashi Bridge - plate by plate, girder by girder, span by span - and each pier of it recalled Hitchcock, the all-round man, who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{the burden}} of the work had fallen {{altogether}} on Findlayson and his assistant, the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs. There were <b>labour</b> <b>contractors</b> by the half-hundred--fitters and riveters, European, borrowed from the railway workshops, with, perhaps, twenty white and half-caste subordinates to direct, under direction, the bevies of workmen--but none knew better than these two, who trusted each other, how the underlings were not to be trusted. They had been tried many times in sudden crises--by slipping of booms, by breaking of tackle, failure of cranes, and the wrath of the river--but no stress had brought to light any man among men whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked them-selves. Findlayson thought it over from the beginning: the months of office-work destroyed at a blow when the Government of India, at the last moment, added two feet to the width of the bridge, under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper, and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculations--and Hitchcock, new to disappointment, buried his head in his arms and wept; the heart-breaking delays over the filling of the contracts in England; the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one, only one, rather doubtful consignment were passed; the war that followed the refusal; the careful, polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war, till young Hitchcock, putting one month's leave to another month, and borrowing ten days from Findlayson, spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to London, and there, as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved, put the fear of God into a man so great that he feared only Parliament and said so till Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table, and--he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name.
