500|$|Vulcanodons limbs were {{sturdy and}} column-like, and its forelimbs were already {{proportionally}} long, reaching 76% of hindlimb length. Its lower leg, metatarsus, and toes were shortened {{in comparison to}} its bipedal ancestors, but still not as short as in later sauropods. The sacrum was made out of four fused sacral vertebrae; [...] "prosauropods" [...] possessed only three sacrals. The tail vertebra bodies already showed an incipient excavation of their <b>lateral</b> <b>sides,</b> saving weight and giving them a waisted appearance when viewed from below. In later sauropods, this excavations were enlarged to form extensive perforated pockets called pleurocoels. Contrasting the many sauropod-like features of the skeleton, the pelvis was relatively primitive, reminiscent of its [...] "prosauropod" [...] ancestors. One such feature is that the brevis shelf of the ilium has a fossa, which is not found in any more derived sauropods.|$|E
2500|$|Nabarro–Herring (NH) creep {{is a form}} of {{diffusion}} creep, while dislocation glide creep {{does not}} involve atomic diffusion. [...] Nabarro-Herring creep dominates at high temperatures and low stresses. As shown in the figure on the right, the <b>lateral</b> <b>sides</b> of the crystal are subjected to a tensile stress, and the horizontal sides to a compressive stress. The atomic volume is altered by applied stress: it increases in regions under tension and decreases in regions under compression. So the activation energy for vacancy formation is changed by ±, where [...] is the atomic volume, the [...] "" [...] sign is for compressive regions and [...] "" [...] sign is for tensile regions. Since the fractional vacancy concentration is proportional to , where [...] is the vacancy-formation energy, the vacancy concentration is higher in tensile regions than in compressive regions, leading to a net flow of vacancies from the regions under tension to the regions under compression, and this is equivalent to a net atom diffusion in the opposite direction, which causes the creep deformation: the grain elongates in the tensile stress axis and contracts in the compressive stress axis.|$|E
