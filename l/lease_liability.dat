40|$|In 2013, the International Accounting Standards Board and the U. S. based Financial Accounting Standards Board {{published}} a revised exposure draft that proposes significant changes to lease accounting under U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). One change involves the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and related <b>lease</b> <b>liability</b> for all leases, including those currently classified as operating leases. This case {{requires students to}} consider the impact that the proposed leasing standard will have on a lessee’s balance sheet. In addition, the case addresses how such an accounting change creates challenges for management who operate under a plethora of contracts based on accounting numbers determined by the accounting standards. Lastly, the case introduces an ethical dilemma faced by accountants of a hypothetical public company. Students are asked to reflect on this ethical dilemma {{with the help of}} the Institute of Management Accountant’s (IMA’s) Statement of Ethical Professional Practice...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to assess the potential economic consequences of the G 4 + 1 proposed changes to lease accounting by examining companies in the UK retail sector over the 1994 - 99 period. The magnitude {{of the impact of}} lease capitalisation is assessed by examining the effect on nine key accounting ratios that are used in decision-making and in financial contracts. A 'constructive capitalisation' procedure is used to estimate the unrecorded <b>lease</b> <b>liability</b> and asset. Operating lease finance is shown to be very important in the retail sector, with a long-term liability approximately 3. 3 times higher than on-balance sheet long-term debt; by contrast, finance leases are immaterial. Operating leased assets, the major part of which is 'land and buildings' (98 %), represent a significant proportion (28 %) of reported total assets. Capitalisation of operating leases would {{have a major impact on}} all nine ratios. Further, the ranking of companies changes markedly for asset turnover, interest cover and the three capital-based gearing measures, and especially for general retailers. Using credit-risk adjusted discount rates would lessen slightly the impact of capitalisation, but would have little impact on intra-sector ranking of company performance. Anticipation of future lease rental increases would have a significant impact on the level of operating lease assets/liabilities and on profit after tax. While the use of renewable short lease contracts (or break clauses) would reduce the level of operating lease assets and liabilities, substantial amounts would remain to be reported on-balance sheet. These findings contribute to the assessment of the economic consequences of a policy change requiring operating lease capitalisation. Prior research suggests that individual users of financial statements are not efficient information processors, and also that company managers do not believe that users, even in aggregate (e. g. the stock market) are efficient processors. Consequently, the significant changes in the magnitude of key accounting ratios and the major shift in company performance rankings suggest that interested parties' economic decisions are likely to be affected...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{prominent}} accounting scandals of the past several years, investors and standard setters are demanding increased corporate transparency. Nowhere is the demand for transparency more salient than with off-balance-sheet financing, of which lease accounting plays a major role. At the end of 2004, total rental commitments by U. S. firms from off-balance-sheet operating leases exceeded $ 1 trillion. As standard setters reconsider leases as part of their broad reexamination of off-balance-sheet financing, they do so without the benefit of empirical research documenting whether capital market participants find the current leasing standard value relevant. This paper examines whether as-if capitalized operating <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities</b> and capital <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities</b> are both relevant and sufficiently reliable to be priced and explores whether equity investors value operating and capital leases differently. The results are consistent with the market viewing both operating and capital <b>leases</b> as economic <b>liabilities</b> of the firm. However, the results also indicate that capital market participants price operating and capital <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities</b> differently, consistent with the bright-line tests of the current leasing standard identifying economic differences in operating and capital leases. Thus, continuing to require lease disclosures by different lease classifications would assure that equity investors will not suffer from a loss of value relevant information in the pricing of leases.

5000|$|The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2005 {{estimated}} that companies had approximately $1.25 trillion of operating lease commitments. By 2015, estimates {{had risen to}} $2 trillion. While the FASB specified that operating <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities</b> should be considered [...] "non-debt liabilities," [...] so {{that they should not}} affect debt ratios and most loan covenants, the addition of an equal asset and liability will reduce most companies' quick ratio, while the fact that an operating lease creates a current liability but not a current asset reduces the current ratio. Companies expected to be most affected include retail chains and airlines.|$|R
40|$|Operating leases are {{estimated}} {{in the current}} paper to be approximately thirteen times larger than finance leases, on average. In recognition of this, the paper investigates the degree of substitutability between leasing and non-lease debt using a comprehensive measure of leasing, improving on the partial measures used in prior research. Operating <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities</b> {{are estimated}} using the ‘constructive capitalisation’ approach suggested by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991, Accounting Horizons 5, pp. 51 – 63), modified to incorporate company-specific and UK-relevant assumptions. The results imply that leasing and debt are partial substitutes, with £ 1 of leasing displacing approximately £ 0. 23 of non-lease debt, on average, consistent with the argument that lessors bear some risks which are not inherent in debt contracts. These findings suggest that substitution effects are not uniform across lease types...|$|R
40|$|This report informs Parliament {{about the}} Annual Financial Report of the State of Victoria, 2012 – 13 (AFR), the {{consolidated}} financial {{report of the}} state, and acquits the government’s stewardship of the state’s finances to Parliament. A clear audit opinion was issued on the AFR on 27 September 2013, providing reasonable assurance that {{the information in the}} AFR is reliable, accurate, and prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Management Act 1994 and Australian accounting standards and interpretations. The net result for the state for 2012 – 13 was a surplus of 9 525. 8 million, largely a result of gains from remeasurements of the state 2 ̆ 7 s unfunded superannuation and insurance claims liabilities, and revaluing of the state 2 ̆ 7 s financial assets and liabilities. The government achieved its fiscal target of a net surplus from transactions in the general government sector of at least 100 million. Dividends of 1 167. 5 million from state-controlled entities outside the general government sector were key contributors to the surplus of 316 million. The state’s borrowings increased by 6 799. 3 million in 2012 – 13, largely driven by the recognition of 5 332. 9 million of finance <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities</b> relating to three public private partnerships completed during the year. In December 2012, the government signalled its intention to cease disclosing budgets for major projects at the time of project announcement, citing commercial sensitivities and the potential to inflate tender prices.

50|$|For an {{operating}} <b>lease,</b> a <b>liability</b> and a right-of-use asset {{are set up}} at lease inception, at {{the present value of}} the rents plus any guaranteed residual. To the asset is added any initial direct costs and subtracted any lease incentives (such as a tenant improvement allowance). The liability is amortized using the interest method (like a mortgage). If the lease has the same rent over its life, the net asset at any point is equal to the liability, plus the unamortized balance of initial direct costs and lease incentives. If the rents change during the lease term, the difference between the cash rent and average rent is added to or subtracted from the asset as well.|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill at an offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico threatening the coast of Louisiana, Vitter introduced legislation along with Jeff Sessions of Alabama to increase the liability cap of an oil company from $75 million to its most recent annual profits (or $150 million if greater). In the case of BP, {{the owner of the}} oil <b>lease,</b> its <b>liability</b> would be $20 billion. Vitter later introduced an amendment that would remove the cap entirely for this particular spill. Competing Democratic proposals would have raised the liability to $10 billion regardless of profits or removed the cap altogether. Sessions argued that large caps unrelated to company profits would harm smaller companies.|$|R
40|$|In 2016, IASB has {{published}} a new lease accounting standard International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 to replace the previous one “IAS 17 ” and the new standard will be implemented from 1 January 2019 onwards. The new standard eliminates the distinction between operating lease and finance lease, and requires the lessee to record an asset and a liability for an operating lease in financial statements. The objective of this dissertation is to examine how IFRS 16 would change the financial position and financial performance of the lessee. The study sample comprises 31 airline companies worldwide for the period from 2013 to 2015 and adopts the constructive capitalization method developed by Imhoff et al. (1991). Results indicate that after capitalization, there will be € 1, 724. 7 million of unrecorded <b>lease</b> <b>liabilities,</b> which is 30. 68 % of the total reported liabilities for the 31 sample companies. After capitalization, both leverage ratio and profitability ratio increase. The additional test for negative and positive income effect provides a closer insight into the companies’ reform. After capitalization, positive income sub-group experiences an increase in both ROA and ROE ratios, while negative income sub-group experiences a decrease in both ratios. In addition, to estimate the change on companies, this paper ranks the companies according to the ratios before and after capitalization. The rank difference after capitalization means the company presents a positive performance may exist in higher risks and negative financial ratios under the new lease standard when comparing with peers. In general, {{the results suggest that}} IFRS 16 would have a material impact on the financial statements and financial ratios of the lessee, and this paper provides valuable information for financial statement users when transiting to the new standard...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{practice}} {{have shown that}} air rights development over highway corridors in America's cities is not only feasible, but desirable. As planners, policy makers and consumers attempt to curb the sprawling development pattern that was characteristic {{of the second half}} of the twentieth century, the development of the air space over urban highway corridors is emerging as a beneficial type of development that promotes revitalization and can be more sustainable than other types of redevelopment. As the advantages of air rights development over highway corridors become increasingly apparent, more projects and proposals are surfacing in cities nationwide. However, while this development pattern can contribute to urban revitalization, it is also unique from other types of infill and redevelopment. Air rights development is complex and requires special scrutiny and treatment from a planning and policy perspective, a distinct understanding of urban design and attention to neighborhood context, and specific development principles for construction and financial feasibility. This thesis describes these unique considerations both generically and through analysis of the Massachusetts Turnpike in Boston. It examines three cases: a completed air rights development, a planned development that has gone through the permitting phase, and a proposed air rights development as it seeks the path of least resistance for development. In this examination, a set of "best practices" and recommendations is proposed to advance the feasibility of this unique type of development. The recommendations aim to make air rights development over highway corridors more sustainable, more predictable, and more systematic in improving the urban environment. Chief among these recommendations include: the implementation of a robust and predictable regulatory framework to control the outcome of air rights development; design guidelines to ensure connectivity and contextualized development that also reflect realistic assumptions about financial feasibility and development intensity; and a systematic air rights lease negotiation process and framework that links <b>leasing</b> <b>liabilities</b> to future development revenues. by Bonnie E.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of labour {{utilization}} in assessing equity investment risk and corporate financial policy choices. Several existing models of the firm predict that labour utilization is costly to adjust in the short run. I argue that {{this leads to a}} relatively fixed obligation to pay cash to labour, in effect creating an off-balance-sheet intangible liability similar to a <b>lease.</b> The <b>liability</b> creates 'labour leverage' risk, analogous to financial leverage risk. Labour leverage is hypothesized to be positively correlated with equity investment risk as measured by characteristics of stock returns. Managers recognize this risk and adjust financial policies including debt financing and dividend policy accordingly. The main empirical results are that labour leverage is positively correlated with equity investment risk, and it plays the predicted role in regressions explaining financial structure and dividend policy. Proxies for labour leverage are simple measures based on existing disclosure. The results are consistent with the conjectures that market participants use labour disclosures to assess risk, and that managers take actions to mitigate this risk. The results are consistent across most sectors of the economy, and consistent over time. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the appraisal}} of a specialized form {{of real estate}} - data centres - that has a unique blend of locational, physical and technological characteristics that differentiate it from conventional real estate assets. Market immaturity, limited trading {{and a lack of}} pricing signals enhance levels of appraisal uncertainty and disagreement relative to conventional real estate assets. Given the problems of applying standard discounted cash flow, an approach to appraisal is proposed that uses pricing signals from traded cash flows that are similar to the cash flows generated from data centres. Based upon ‘the law of one price’, it is assumed that two assets that are expected to generate identical cash flows in the future must have the same value now. It is suggested that the expected cash flow of assets should be analysed over the life cycle of the building. Corporate bond yields are used to provide a proxy for the appropriate discount rates for <b>lease</b> income. Since <b>liabilities</b> are quite diverse, a number of proxies are suggested as discount and capitalisation rates including indexed-linked, fixed interest and zero-coupon bonds. ...|$|R
40|$|The IASB/FASB {{exposure}} draft ED 2013 on lease accounting, if introduced as a standard, will fundamentally {{change the way}} that leases are accounted for and reported in financial statements. This paper seeks to provide information on the proposed new lease accounting rules and to illustrate their impact on financial statements and financial ratios of leading Australian companies. The study follows the method of constructive capitalisation developed by Imhoff et al. (1991) to demonstrate {{the potential impact of}} the new rules on financial ratios and financial statements. The results show that financial statements will change significantly when all <b>lease</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> are capitalised. The study finds that lease capitalisation will have a material impact on the reported numbers in the balance sheet and income statement and result in significant changes to return and leverage ratios. A comparison between positive and negative income subgroups also shows significant changes in the financial ratios of both these sub- groups. This is the first Australian study that serves to provide computations of the effects on financial reporting changes in lease accounting standard. The results have practical implications for corporate managers and accounting practitioners in planning and formulating strategies to lessen the impact of this important change in lease accounting...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the TMT sector in the late 1990 s and more recent growing regulatory and corporate focus on business continuity and security have raised the profile of data centres. Data centres offer a unique blend of occupational, physical and technological characteristics compared to conventional real estate assets. Limited trading and heterogeneity of data centres also causes higher levels of appraisal uncertainty. In practice, the application of conventional discounted cash flow approaches requires information about {{a wide range of}} inputs that is difficult to derive from limited market signals or estimate analytically. This paper outlines an approach that uses pricing signals from similar traded cash flows is proposed. Based upon ‘the law of one price’, the method draws upon the premise that two identical future cash flows must have the same value now. Given the difficulties of estimating exit values, an alternative is that the expected cash flows of data centre are analysed over the life cycle of the building, with corporate bond yields used to provide a proxy for the appropriate discount rates for <b>lease</b> income. Since <b>liabilities</b> are quite diverse, a number of proxies are suggested as discount and capitalisation rates including indexed-linked, fixed interest and zero-coupon bonds. Although there are rarely assets that have identical cash flows and some approximation is necessary, the level of appraiser subjectivity is dramatically reduced. ...|$|R
