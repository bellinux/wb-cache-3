25|$|HBO on Demand is the channel's {{subscription}} video-on-demand service; {{launched on}} July 1, 2001 on Time Warner Cable's Columbia, South Carolina system, {{it was the}} first subscription VOD service offered by a premium channel in the United States. HBO on Demand offers a selection of movies, original series and specials previously seen on the network. The service is provided at no additional cost to HBO subscribers, who already regularly pay a premium fee to cable and satellite providers to receive access to the channel. HBO launched the VOD service in an effort to allow subscribers access to the channel's programming on their own schedules, thereby reducing the frequency in which viewers were unable to find a program they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> as well as limiting cancellations to the service for that same reason. HBO on Demand features a rotating selection of films, specials and series, with select new titles added each Friday alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.|$|E

She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired.

500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{negatively}} received by critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that only 20% of critics gave the film a positive review, {{with an average}} rating of 3/10, based on 5 reviews. Movies.com's Dave White compared what he considered the film's poor animation to the animation of The Wild, and criticized some dialogue of the film judged [...] "vaguely Shakespearean", satirizing the fact that [...] "children like English pronouns 15th century." [...] Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times called the film a [...] "genuine tragedy, although not in the Shakespearean sense" [...] and wrote that a [...] "comprehensive list of what's wrong with Romeo & Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss would stretch farther than the unabridged works of William S." [...] LA Weeklys Luke Y. Thompson said that the film [...] "should find its primary audience among college potheads who <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> '70s Hanna-Barbera creations on the Cartoon Network late at night." [...] Common Sense Media writer Renee Schonfeld said in his 2012 review that it was [...] "an amateurish effort with a grating villain, tired jokes, and sub-par music". He gave it 2 out of 5 stars.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal faced West Ham United in {{the first}} weekend of October. Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Overmars were rested for the match, {{replaced}} by Oleh Luzhny, Slyvinho and Davor Šuker. In spite of general dominance from Arsenal, West Ham striker Paolo di Canio scored in each half to win his team the match. Patrick Vieira was dismissed during play for a foul on Di Canio. A confrontation soon after occurred between the player and Neil Ruddock. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. Šuker scored twice against Everton at Highbury on 16 October 1999. Arsenal then travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Goals from Tore André Flo and Dan Petrescu seemed to have given the home side victory, before Kanu scored a hat-trick {{in the space of}} 15 minutes. His first involved extending his legs and stabbing the ball past goalkeeper Ed de Goey, once it fell kindly in his direction. The equaliser came in the 83rd minute: Kanu received the ball from Overmars, which took him away from goal but hit the ball to the left of De Goey’s dive. In injury time Kanu, in the downpour, chased down the ball and dribbled past the stranded Chelsea goalkeeper on the byline, before curling the ball over Frank Leboeuf and into {{the far corner of the}} goal net. Kanu's teammate Šuker described the third goal as [...] "beautiful", while Bergkamp added: [...] "The skills he has got, the moves he makes, are something you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> and learn from. I watch him in training and it is a joy." [...] The month ended with a goalless draw at home to Newcastle United, which left Arsenal fourth, three points behind league leaders Leeds United.|$|E

2500|$|The Kamen Rider {{franchise}} {{has been}} parodied {{in and outside}} Japan. One parody is of the Kamen Rider henshin (transforming) pose. In video games, Skullomania (from Street Fighter) and May Lee (from King of Fighters) are examples of Kamen Rider parodies. In anime, examples include Fair, then Partly Piggy, My-HiME (and its sequel, My Otome), Dragon Ball Z, and Franken Fran as parody or homage. In the Crayon Shin-chan series, the title character interacts with Kamen Riders in crossover specials. Detective Conan has a recurring TV series the detective boys <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> Kamen Yaiba. In One Punch Man, the C Class Hero Mumen Rider is a parody, being an ordinary man {{in a world of}} superhuman beings, riding a bicycle rather than a motorcycle. However despite his weakness he is extremely heroic and his actions form a counterpoint to his parodic character conception.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1995, the channel's name officially {{changed to}} the A Network, to reflect its declining focus on arts and entertainment. By 1996, the network had branded itself as simply A, and {{was using the}} slogans [...] "Time Well Spent" [...] and [...] "Escape the Ordinary." [...] "The word 'arts,' in regard to television, has {{associations}} such as 'sometimes elitist,' 'sometimes boring,' 'sometimes overly refined' and 'doesn't translate well to TV,'" [...] Whitney Goit, {{executive vice president for}} sales and marketing, stated. [...] "Even the arts patron often finds arts on TV not as satisfying as it should be ... And the word 'entertainment' is too vague. Therefore, much like ESPN uses its letters rather than what they stand for – Entertainment Sports (Programming) Network – we decided to go to just A" [...] Of the network's tagline, Goit said, [...] "Intellectually, 'Time well spent' defines a comparison between those who view a lot of television as a wasteland, and their acknowledgment that there are good things on TV and that they'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> more thought-provoking TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed {{appear on}} the Dragnet episode [...] "Internal Affairs: DR-20", The D.A. episode [...] "The People vs. Saydo" [...] (the {{conclusion}} to a crossover that begins on [...] "The Radical") and the Emergency! pilot movie, [...] "The Wedsworth-Townsend Act". Sergeant MacDonald appears on the Dragnet episode [...] "Personnel: The Shooting". The episode [...] "Lost And Found" [...] was set at Rampart General Hospital and featured the Emergency! cast. However, during an Emergency! episode, Adam-12 is shown as a TV show that the paramedics <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> causing somewhat of a paradox between the shows. Several years after Adam-12 was cancelled, Kent McCord was signed to appear in a planned third series of Dragnet playing Sgt. Friday's partner, but the project was cancelled due to Jack Webb's sudden death in 1982; since none of the scripts Webb wrote for the project were ever produced or released, {{it is not clear}} if he intended McCord to play a different character or to revive the Jim Reed character.|$|E

2500|$|Todd and Marty's {{relationship}} became {{based on}} a psychiatrist/patient dynamic and not something physical. When asked if romance could be a possibility, Carlivati stated, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it unfold a beat at a time, a day at a time, {{a week at a}} time and not have the audience jump to, 'Are they going to kiss? Are they going to fall in love? Are they going to sleep together?' The goal is more to take these two characters who have an unbelievable, dark history with each other and explore where it would or could go if they didn't have that obstacle [...] the rape [...] between them." [...] However, Carlivati said that this obstacle would always be there and that the audience would see close moments. These close moments include Todd helping Marty walk and physical contact between the two while he nurses her back to health. [...] "I think the thing about the two of them, the characters and the actors, is you feel a chemistry when they're just talking, so I don't necessarily categorize it as romantic," [...] stated Carlivati. [...] "They're definitely forming a relationship and it continues to grow and build through the fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E
