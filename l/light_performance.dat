40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the potential of the}} daylighting systems used in the indigenous architecture of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), located in Dubai (latitude 25 ? N longitude 55 ? E). The analysis tested the <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> of three daylighting systems under UAE climatic conditions. The purpose of this research was to investigate the daylighting performance of three of the most common daylighting systems found in the indigenous buildings of the UAE, traditional windows (Dreeshah), gypsum decorative panels and wind tower (Barjeel). The <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> of each of the three lighting systems was examined. The <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> parameters examined were illuminance level, light distribution, uniformity, and glare. IESNA standards, CIBSE guidelines and LEED 2. 2 daylighting credit and recommendations were used as the minimum recommended level for all analyzed variables. On-site measurements (illuminance and luminance) were conducted to compare measured versus simulated measurements inside the space. Desktop Radiance 2. 0 Beta was used as the <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> analysis tool under clear sky conditions. Results have shown that the gypsum decorative panel performs better than the other two systems in terms of light uniformity and distribution, regardless of a lower illuminance level. The double panel window prototype has poor <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> in terms of glare, light distribution and uniformity. Wind tower performed well under the area of the wind tower itself. Apart from that it also had a poor <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> in terms of glare, light distribution, and uniformity...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} toplighting systems in the hot and humid tropics by using Bangkok, Thailand (latitude 13. 7 ????N) as a test location. The analysis tested both the thermal and <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> of three toplighting systems. Toplighting, designed for use in one-story buildings or {{on the top floor}} of taller buildings, yields a uniformly distributed light throughout a space. However, in lower latitude locations, where there is no heating period, heat gain is a critical design issue since it significantly affects the annual energy consumption of the building. Accordingly, the decision to use toplighting in these locations needs to be carefully examined before any design considerations occur. In this study, the thermal and <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> of three toplighting systems were compared. For the thermal performance, total cooling loads, heat gains and losses, and interior temperature were evaluated. The <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> parameters examined were daylight factor, illuminance level, light distribution, and uniformity. EnergyPlus was used as the thermal analysis tool, and RADIANCE, along with a physical scale model, was used as the <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> analysis tool. The sky conditions tested were overcast, clear sky, and intermediate sky. Results have shown that, for locations with hot and humid climates with variable sky conditions such as Bangkok, Thailand, the roof monitors perform better than the other two systems in terms of the thermal and <b>lighting</b> <b>performance.</b> With similar cooling loads, the roof monitor provides better illuminance uniformity than the skylights and lightscoops, with adequate illuminance level (at mostly higher than 500 lux) ...|$|R

50|$|In the gem trade, {{the term}} <b>light</b> <b>performance</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} how well a polished diamond will return light to the viewer. There are three light properties which are described in relation to light performance: brilliance, fire, and scintillation. Brilliance refers to the white light reflections from the external and internal facet surfaces. Fire refers to the spectral colors which are produced {{as a result of}} the diamond dispersing the white light. Scintillation refers to the small flashes of light that are seen when the diamond, light source or the viewer is moved. A diamond that is cut and polished to produce a high level of these qualities is said to be high in <b>light</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Almost 100 {{years after}} Joseph {{patented}} the original Asscher cut, Edward and Joop introduced the Royal Asscher cut in 2001 (named {{for the company}} from which it hails). The Royal Asscher cut has an extra break on the diamond’s pavilion, giving the diamond 74 facets, compared to the original Asscher’s 58 facets. It is known for superior <b>light</b> <b>performance</b> {{when compared to other}} step cut diamonds (in 2009 the AGS Laboratories launched an independent <b>light</b> <b>performance</b> grading certificate for the Royal Asscher cut). The Asscher family secured an international design patent so the Royal Asscher cut could not be legally imitated; Royal Asscher is also trademarked and the company owns exclusive rights to the name. To further guarantee authenticity each diamond is laser inscribed with the Royal Asscher logo and an identification number belonging to a single diamond only. The number is logged with the Royal Asscher Diamond Company in Amsterdam and a Royal Asscher certificate accompanies the diamond.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an evaluation of three daylighting systems used in the indigenous architecture of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), located in Dubai (latitude 25 ?N longitude 55 ?E). The purpose of this research was to investigate the daylighting performance of three of the most common daylighting systems found in indigenous buildings of the UAE: Type I- Traditional double panel windows, Dreeshah; Type II- Gypsum decorative panels, Mesbah; and Type III- Wind tower, Barjeel. The <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> parameters examined were illuminance level, light distribution, uniformity and glare. These parameters were compared to the recommended light levels specified in IESNA and CIBSE standards. The RADIANCE program was used to evaluate the <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> of the three daylighting systems under clear sky conditions. On-site measurements were also conducted to validate the <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> generated by the simulations. The prototypes tested in this research showed different outcomes. From the results, the overall <b>lighting</b> <b>performance</b> of the gypsum decorative panel prototype outperforms the other prototypes under clear sky conditions. These prototypes carry an aesthetic and identity value to the culture of the UAE. Through the use of the derived values and conclusions, local public awareness can be increased on the importance of preserving indigenous buildings and the numerous lessons that can be learned from their study...|$|R

50|$|PureView Pro is an imaging {{technology}} {{used in the}} Nokia 808 PureView device. It is {{the combination of a}} large 1/1.2 in, very high-resolution 41 MP image sensor with high-performance Carl Zeiss optics. The large sensor enables pixel oversampling, which means the combination of many sensor pixels into one image pixel. PureView {{imaging technology}} delivers high image quality, lossless zoom and improved low <b>light</b> <b>performance</b> (see below). It dispenses with the usual scaling/interpolation model of digital zoom commonly used in other smartphones, as well as optical zoom used in most digital cameras, where a series of lens elements moves back and forth to vary the magnification and field of view. In both video and stills, this technique provides greater zoom levels as the output picture size reduces.|$|E
5000|$|Conrad {{began his}} light-work {{in the late}} 1960s in {{response}} to his reading of Josef Albers’ Interaction of Color while at Amherst College. His experimental film Circles (16mm, 1969) explored color afterimage. While in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1970s, he created a colored <b>light</b> <b>performance</b> instrument, derived from concepts of color perception, very different from the psychedelic light shows of that period. This color machine used multiple bulbs with color gels in housings that Conrad fabricated arranged behind a rear-projection screen and controlled by dimmers. Conrad performed in the Bay Area as a [...] "visual musician" [...] with musician Jordan de la Sierra and played in poet Daniel Moore's Floating Lotus Magic Opera Company. Later in the 70s, having returned to Baltimore County, Maryland, Conrad studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art, where he earned an MFA from The Hoffberger School of Painting under Grace Hartigan in 1981.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{different}} types of solar shading devices have been proposed, depending on building orientation, location, window characteristics, etc. They can contribute to improve or worsen building thermal and <b>lighting</b> <b>performances</b> both from an energy and comfort point of view. The present paper reports a critical analysis of some studies that investigate shading devices’ effects on building thermal and/or <b>lighting</b> <b>performances.</b> This article points out the difficulty in comparing the different results {{given the lack of}} uniformity between the studies, since they analysed buildings with different characteristics, locations and using various indices. Therefore a protocol to carry out this type of studies should be developed in order to allow the comparison of the different research investigations performed all over the world. Moreover, this paper shows that thermal comfort, economic and environmental aspects related to the use of shading devices were rarely analysed...|$|R
