5|$|The {{previous}} year's {{film about}} nude dancers, Showgirls, was generally disliked, so filmmakers feared audiences would pre-judge Striptease on this basis.

Besides the subject matter, Striptease and Showgirls did have two notable connections. The choreography in these films was by the same person, Marguerite Derricks. Both also featured performances by Rena Riffel, who plays a dancer in each. To promote the film, Moore appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and a Barbara Walters special. In both cases, she danced or otherwise exhibited her body.|$|E
