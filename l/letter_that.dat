50|$|Vowels {{are also}} called the 'life' (uyir) or 'soul' letters. Together with the consonants (mei, which are called 'body' letters), they form compound, syllabic (abugida) <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> are called 'living' letters (uyir mei, i.e. <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> have both 'body' and 'soul').|$|R
40|$|Type Object is an {{intriguing}} collection of letters, {{but not as}} we know them; this collection takes letters into the third dimension using three dimensional design to re-define and re-interpret the meaning of <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> create words. These are interactive <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> crave your attention and challenge your perception, letters {{not just as a}} tool but as characters in their own right; <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> are tactile, bold, letters to hold, to think about, <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> want to come out and play! Words are the vehicle here for the <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> visually convey their meaning; for example a garden of letters growing out of the soil, entwined with ivy used to spell the word, 'earth' or a beautifully constructed ball of letters surrounded by butterflies and the word is naphthalene, the main ingredient of mothballs. Thought-provoking and exciting,letters to inspire discussion and create an emotional response; no longer the passive characters on the keyboard but personalities in their own right...|$|R
5|$|A warrant {{was sworn}} out for Waring's arrest, but {{officials}} {{soon learned that}} he was incapacitated, after being shot through both hips the day before Sharp's death. When Darby discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to Simpson County where he met Captain John F. Lowe, who told Darby that Beauchamp had related to him detailed plans for the assassination. He also furnished Darby with a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> contained damaging admissions against Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> is not in the puzzle, calls a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E

50|$|During {{the memory}} span experiment, each subject is {{presented}} with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> sound similar, and <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order {{in which it was}} given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> sound similar and longer words.|$|R
40|$|The Snellen Chart {{which has}} not changed since it was {{designed}} in 1862 is the only visual screening test used in practically all schools.

5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E

On her eighth birthday, Anjali reads the last and most important <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> her mother left her; it {{tells the story of}} Rahul, Tina and Anjali.|$|E
5|$|HISD paid around $200,000 USD {{to lease}} the Las Américas units. In October 2006, Michael Marquez, {{president}} of the Hispanic Housing and Education Corporation, which operated Las Américas, announced to HISD in a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> the organization would terminate the lease agreement because of issues related to maintenance and management. The district decided to vacate the property instead of appealing the decision. In summer 2007, the former Las Américas Education Center closed. The early childhood center merged with Mistral and the middle schools moved to the Long Middle School campus.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in defiance of the earlier <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the {{sectional}} {{differences that}} eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Monteverdi {{recorded}} {{no apparent}} {{interest in the}} performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> he wrote to Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative generosity of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.|$|E
5|$|Northerners {{assumed that}} Fillmore, hailing from a free state, was an {{opponent}} of the spread of slavery. Southerners {{accused him of being}} an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely published <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> slavery was an evil, but one that the federal government had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis over the South Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket looked good, especially in the Northeast.|$|E

On March 24, 1899, Mint Director George E. Roberts wrote in a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> the Lafayette Memorial Commission was contemplating having, {{on one side of}} the coin, a representation of the new monument. Barber responded the following day to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Henry Boyer, referencing that letter and asking for a sketch of the monument.|$|E

Although Parker claimed in a <b>letter</b> <b>that</b> he was the author, it is likely that at the very least Joscelyn did most of the research, and the manuscript of the work, which is now Vitellius E xiv, is largely in his handwriting. Further, Parker's son, after the archbishop's death, noted beside the bequest notation for Joscelyn's brother Thomas that John Joscelyn was the author of the work.|$|E
