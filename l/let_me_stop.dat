I'm sure the thought of another top ten hit might cheer her up!" [...] Scott Juba of The Trades {{considered}} [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as {{the highlight of the}} album, writing [...] "Now that [...] {{a few years older than}} she was when she recorded her first album, she brings more authenticity to relationship songs." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Stop</b> You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to live or die on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness." [...] Joe Cross of Cox Communications thought that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was a decent follow-up to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying [...] "It's no [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." [...] He also listed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005. The same sentiment was echoed by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy who considered the song as Clarkson's second best single after [...] "Since U Been Gone", writing [...] "It proved a slow burner at the time of release, but this track's greatness continues to be realised over time." ...|$|E

40|$|Throughout my life, {{many people}} have always {{encouraged}} me to continue my education until I have reached the highest degree possible. Although the comple-tion of my master's degree in mathematical statistics still falls short of that goal, it {{has been one of}} the toughest, if not the toughest, challenges of my life. The following paper and more importantly the degree for which it was written would never have been possible without the love, support, and encouragement of certain people. First and foremost, I am grateful to my parents, Robert W. and Norma Smith. None of my education would have been possible without them. From the very beginning of my education, their love, guidance, and financial support drove me and allowed me to never be satisfied with less than my capabilities. I am also grateful to Melanie Hart, a former high school mathematics and computer science teacher of mine and a very close friend, for never <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> believing in myself and in my mathematical potential no matter how tough the road ahead became.

500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} title in August 2010 to UK urban writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Shontelle explained: [...] "'No Gravity' became almost like this mantra that I adopted {{to my life}} and to the whole project... I {{basically}} thought 'I really can't let anything stand in my way; I can't <b>let</b> anything <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from rising to the top; I can't have anything holding me down or holding me back. There has to be no gravity, so I can float higher and higher!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> you." [...] I was impudently suave. [...] "Kick {{as hard as}} you please, and I'll {{still have}} enough face left with which to smile. In the meantime, while you are hesitating, suppose you accept my {{original}} proposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{every time}} that I want {{to come and see}} my grandfather," [...] replied Cyrus, [...] "this teazing man always <b>stops</b> <b>me,</b> and will not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> come in.

5000|$|What {{is known}} for certain is that Michel Petrucciani was {{fiercely}} determined {{to take all the}} joy and satisfaction from life that he could. [...] "I'm a brat," [...] he said. [...] "My philosophy is to have a really good time and never <b>let</b> anything <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from doing what I want to do. It's like driving a car, waiting for an accident. That's no way to drive a car. If you have an accident, you have an accident—c'est la vie." [...] He certainly lived true to his maxim. Just one week before he died of a pulmonary infection, he was up all night celebrating the new year with his friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} thought," [...] went on Robina, [...] "that she was {{dressing}} {{for her own}} funeral. She said {{she knew she was}} going to catch her death of cold, sitting on the wet grass. Something told her. I reminded her it hadn't rained for three weeks, and that everything was as dry as a bone, but she said that made no difference to grass. There is always a moisture in grass, and that cushions and all that only helped to draw it out. Not that it mattered. The end had to come, and so long as the others were happy--you know her style. Nobody ever thought of her. She was to be dragged here, dragged there. She talked about herself as if she were some sacred image. It got upon my nerves at last, so that I persuaded Janie to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> offer to <b>stop</b> at home with her. I wasn't too keen about going myself; not by that time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't want to," [...] said Benita feebly. [...] "Father, I am {{more afraid}} of him now than ever. Oh! why did you not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> down below, among the Makalanga, instead of {{carrying}} me up here again, where we must live alone with that terrible Jew?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} the collaborations, Williams {{said it was}} [...] "no problem" [...] {{to connect with the}} featured artists on the album, saying [...] "a phone call was made and we were already cool with one another. It kinda wasn't even a business thing. It was like 'that's my girl', you know, and I personally asked them myself. So that's how that went." [...] She also revealed she was [...] "initially uncertain about boldly referencing Jesus on the project". Whilst {{discussing the}} lyrical content she stated, [...] "at first I was like, 'should I say Jesus', but before I knew it, I couldn't help but to [...] I wasn't going to <b>let</b> anybody <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from doing that...not that anybody really was, you know?".|$|R

He staged shows at the famed Cotton Club and later managed the Apollo Theater, where he also served as master of ceremonies for 20 years. He also {{developed}} his talents as a songwriter, arranger, bandleader and comedian. [...] "Dancing has been my only love", he said in a Fort Worth Star-Telegram interview, adding, [...] "But I didn't <b>let</b> dancing <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from doing other things. I have the ability to be multitalented." [...] In 1937, he was injured in a car accident and so was unfit for service during the Second World War, which he spent entertaining troops.|$|R
