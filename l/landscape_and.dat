5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles.

Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|The {{scale of}} {{ecological}} dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating {{on a single}} tree, {{while at the same}} time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, <b>landscape,</b> <b>and</b> chronological scales.|$|E
