25|$|Bennis (2004) {{emphasizes}} that corporate <b>leaders</b> <b>must</b> promise their followers {{that they will}} never be devalued or punished because they express dissent. All too often in the past, organizations would marginalize or terminate any employee who voiced an opposing view. Additionally, leaders should reward dissent and punish conflict avoiders. Anyone who clearly withholds a dissenting view only to obstruct the implementation later should be held responsible.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{conditions}} of Marshall Aid was that the nations' <b>leaders</b> <b>must</b> co-ordinate economic efforts and pool the supply of raw materials. By far the most critical commodities in driving growth were coal and steel. France assumed it would receive large amounts of high-quality German coal from the Ruhr as reparations for the war, but the US refused to allow this, fearing a repetition of the bitterness after the Treaty of Versailles which partly caused World War II.|$|E
25|$|Rephrasing {{refers to}} skills in which leader repeats what others are saying for more {{clarification}} during a group discussion. The focus group leader typically asks group members for more in-depth opinions after rephrasing. It allows group members {{to have a}} broad perspective in order to view topics from different angles and interpretations. Emotional Control refers to the group leader’s ability to control his or her emotions {{in order for the}} discussion to be effective. It requires developing a tough skin {{to be able to take}} on the lead in the discussion when people lose their tempers. <b>Leaders</b> <b>must</b> aim to diffuse anger and redirect the emotions with constructive analysis and suggestions.

25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants. The role of the Squad Leaders {{is to make sure}} their respective rows are at rehearsal on time, take attendance for the row, and make sure all members in the row are striving for their best during each rehearsal and performance. Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row challenges on Mondays. The Squad <b>Leaders</b> <b>must</b> also try out for the band, typically during the week before the rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad Leaders have been cut from the band in past years. In this case, the Assistant would become Head Squad Leader, and one of the highest scoring returning band members would be offered the position of Assistant.|$|E
25|$|Fiedler's Contingency Theory {{holds that}} a leader's {{effectiveness}} {{depends on the}} interaction between their characteristics and {{the characteristics of the}} situation. Path–Goal Theory asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, <b>leaders</b> <b>must</b> skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet the situational factors. The situational factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Model focuses on how leader–subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole. Vroom-Yetton-Jago Model focuses on decision making with respect to a feasibility set which is composed of the situational attributes.|$|E
25|$|At the plenary sessions, {{addresses}} {{were made}} by the chairman of the year's annual meetings, as well as the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at SSICEC. The three parties stressed the need for the World Trade Organization's Doha Round talks to resume. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the impasse in the Doha Round of trade negotiations carries a heavy cost and a high risk, and will extend beyond economics. Lee added that good governance is the key to help economies to open up in the era of globalisation and improve the lives for the people. He also outlined the roles of a good government in managing the process of changes. Lee said that governments must win the support of globalisation from the people and give them better opportunities. At the opening speech of IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato said the world <b>leaders</b> <b>must</b> quickly revive the Doha Round of trade talks to prevent a damaging shift towards protectionism. De Rato also said that the world is having a period of high growth and low inflation unseen since the 1960s, and a solid growth in the economy could be expected in the following year. He added that the global growth cycle may turn and the best hope for good performance lies in further increase in international trade. The three risks to world economic prospects include rising oil prices, disorderly unwinding of global payments imbalances, and the prevention of trade. World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz told donor countries to increase aid to poor nations, and wealthy nations to put Africa as the top of the priority list of poverty fighting.|$|E

500|$|The {{attention}} of the Western and especially the British press thrilled Goebbels, who wrote in his diary in early 1942: [...] "Rommel {{continues to be the}} recognised darling of even the enemies' news agencies". Rommel was pleased by the media attention, both domestic and foreign, often discussing it in letters to his wife. Hitler took note of the British propaganda as well, commenting in the summer of 1942 that Britain's <b>leaders</b> <b>must</b> have hoped [...] "to be able to explain their defeat to their own nation more easily by focusing on Rommel".|$|E
500|$|Rep. Jeff Miller. Republican of Florida, {{chairs the}} House Veterans Affairs Committee. He {{said that the}} new VA law gives agency {{officials}} five days to respond to notices of intent to fire them. The director of the Georgia VA retired four days in advance of VA's announcement {{that he would be}} fired, and the procurement official also retired in advance of her firing. The procurement official was nearly hired by the U.S. Department of Energy before that department learned of the findings against her at the VA. Miller said that [...] "If any current laws or regulations are impeding the (VA)’s ability to swiftly hold employees accountable, VA <b>leaders</b> <b>must</b> work with Congress so those laws and regulations can be changed", and “VA appears to be giving failing executives an opportunity to quit, retire or find new jobs without consequence."
