40|$|Volatile-bearing {{minerals}} (e. g., Fe-oxyhydroxides, phyllosilicates, carbonates, and sulfates) may {{be important}} phases {{on the surface of}} Mars. In order to characterize these potential phases the Thermal Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA), which was onboard the Mars Polar Lander, was to have performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and evolved-gas analysis of soil samples collected from the surface. The sample chamber in TEGA operates at about 100 mbar (approximately 76 torr) with a N 2, carrier gas flow of 0. 4 seem. Essentially, no information exists on the effects of reduced pressure on the thermal properties of volatile-bearing minerals. In support of TEGA, we have constructed a laboratory analog for TEGA from commercial instrumentation. We connected together a commercial differential scanning calorimeter, a quadruple mass spectrometer, a vacuum pump, digital pressure gauge, electronic mass flow meter, gas "K" bottles, gas dryers, and high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> using a collection of shut off and needle valves. Our arrangement allows us to vary and control the pressure and carrier gas flow rate inside the calorimeter oven chamber...|$|R
25|$|Most {{regulators}} have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases {{gas from the}} cylinder at a constant intermediate pressure, despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This {{is similar to the}} first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the <b>regulator</b> controls the <b>pressure</b> reduction from the intermediate <b>pressure</b> to the <b>low</b> outlet <b>pressure.</b> The <b>regulator</b> has two <b>pressure</b> gauges, one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.|$|R
40|$|A {{self-contained}} {{breathing apparatus}} with automatic redundant fluid pressure controls and a facemask mounted <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> whistle alarm is described. The first stage of the system includes pair of <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> connected in parallel with different outlet pressures, both of which reduce {{the pressure of the}} stored supply gas to pressures compatible with the second stage breathing demand regulator. A primary regulator in the first stage delivers a <b>low</b> output <b>pressure</b> to the demand regulator. In the event of a failure closed condition of the primary regulator an automatic transfer valve switches on the backup regulator. A warning that the supply pressure has been depleted is also provided by a supply pressure actuated transfer valve which transfers the output of the first stage <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> from the primary to the backup regulator. The alarm is activated in either the failure closed condition or if the supply pressure is reduced to a dangerously low level...|$|R
5000|$|In the Autococker, a {{pneumatic}} system replaces the pump handle to automatically re-cock the marker (hence the name, [...] "auto cocker"). The pneumatics {{are composed of}} three components: the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> (LPR), the 3-way valve, and the ram. All three are grouped together {{at the front of}} the marker on what is known as the front block.|$|E
5000|$|The Bushmaster is {{designed}} with tournament-style speedball in mind, being capable of shooting more than 20 paintballs per second. The marker uses two regulators to control airflow; a high-pressure regulator normally set at 200-275psi and a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> normally set to 75-90psi. The Bushmaster operates using a ram-actuated poppet valve. Commonly the Bushmaster 2000 {{is referred to}} as a [...] "B2K" [...] or a [...] "B2KX", where the X indicates the year of that particular model. The most recent 2004 model {{is referred to as}} the B2K4. The marker was recently discontinued and has been replaced by the similar, but improved, Promaster. Unfortunately Indian Creek Designs has recently decided to leave the marker manufacturing market to concentrate on other business and no longer produces either marker.|$|E
5000|$|The FS uses a spool system {{similar to}} an Automag, {{but instead of}} {{incorporating}} a shut-off valve, and using a sear/spring arrangement to return the bolt from its blow-forward operation, it uses air pressure. The system has full-pressure supply air stored in a dump chamber {{in the rear of}} the marker. This pressure is applied to the center pin {{in the rear of the}} bolt, which is biased to push it open. The regulated air supplied by a front <b>Low</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Regulator</b> (LPR) is run through a 2/3-way solenoid valve that is designed to be [...] "Normally On" [...] when it is not energized. This lower pressure air is supplied to the front of the bolt, and the regulator is adjusted to supply enough force to push the bolt back against the supply pressure.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} in vivo patch {{clamping}} was shown by Kodandaramaiah, et al. In {{this case the}} pressure control consisted {{of a set of}} electronic valves and electronic <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> to provide three pressures that were previously provided by a technician (high <b>pressure</b> 800-1000mbar, <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> 20-30mbar, and a small vacuum 15-150mbar). Three electronic valves switched between the three pressures and atmospheric pressure. The high pressure was used to prevent clogging the pipette, the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> was used when searching for cells, and the vacuum was used to help the gigasealing process. These were all controlled by a computer, to select among the pressures as the resistance {{at the tip of the}} pipette changed.|$|R
30|$|The cell {{can sustain}} {{pressures}} up to 20  MPa. Oil was carefully {{introduced into the}} cell using a precision syringe pump to avoid oil droplets {{on the wall of}} the cell. Thermocouples, cartridge heaters, and a temperature controller were used to control the temperature of the cell. CO 2 was injected into the cell using a precision <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> at <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> (0.07  MPa) and using a high-pressure syringe pump (Model 500 D, ISCO Inc., USA) and pump controller (Series D, ISCO Inc., USA) at high pressure (2.8 and 5.6  MPa).|$|R
30|$|The back <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> is dome-loaded back <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> {{controlled}} by a flexible diaphragm with pilot pressure acting {{on the back side}} of the diaphragm. Pilot pressure on the back of the diaphragm is generated by an air-driven, high pressure pump. The back <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> could allow reservoir pressure condition up to 5000  psi.|$|R
5000|$|Tournament markers {{usually are}} {{equipped}} with two regulators, and another on the tank, each with a specific function. The tank regulator decreases the pressure of air from [...] to [...] A second regulator is used to further reduce this pressure to near the firing pressure. This reduction allows for greater consistency. The air is then supplied to a regulator on the marker body, where the final output pressure is selected. This can be between [...] for entirely unregulated carbon dioxide markers to approximately [...] for extremely low pressure markers. After the firing pressure is decided, tournament-oriented markers use another regulator to supply gas to a separate pneumatic system, to power any other functions, such as bolt movement. This is an extremely low volume, extremely <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> usually under [...]|$|E
50|$|The Matrix uses a {{spool valve}} system to propel a paintball. The spool valve {{utilizes}} an airspace with a fixed volume and a regulated air source {{to deliver a}} consistent amount of force to each ball that is shot. The valve works {{in the matter of}} a spool that slides back and forth much like a piston. In one position the spool allows the fixed air chamber to be filled. In the firing position the spool moves forward and dumps the contents of the fixed air chamber into the breech of the marker, which in turn fires the paintball. The movement of the spool is controlled by the flow of air to it. This flow of air is controlled by a solenoid (electronically actuated valve). The Matrix has a sleek look and lacks external hoses that can become damaged over time. The gas is instead routed through passages inside the body of the marker and plugs in the front and rear of the marker keep these passages airtight. A <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> can also be attached {{to the front of the}} marker to help the consistency and help lower the force of the air hitting the ball.|$|E
5000|$|Indian Creek Designs {{also made}} a variant of this marker known as the Lasoya Promaster. The Lasoya version has {{slightly}} different milling which is more simplistic and comes in a dust finish two tone fade colour. The aggressive [...] "tail" [...] has been removed, perhaps to decrease {{the weight of the}} marker. The high pressure regulator is different from the standard ProMaster. It is a clone of the well-known Air America Vigilante regulator. Instead of the standard ProMaster blade trigger, a new trigger with two finger groves has been added. The bolt is also different as it is made of teflon, instead of delrin and has a small [...] "ramp" [...] on the top to reduce ball breakage. It also comes with a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> gauge so the user can see exactly what the LPR is set at. Another change from the regular ProMaster is the feed neck. While it is still not a clamping feed neck, it has a lower profile, resulting in less hopper hits. The board in the Lasoya Promaster was made by Kila products for ICD and is a less adjustable version of their ProMaster Drive board. Hence it has been nicknamed the [...] "Kila Lite" [...] board. It features more firing modes than the original ProMaster board and an adjustable [...] "debounce" [...] setting.|$|E

40|$|Large mobile {{irrigation}} {{machines are}} becoming a common sight in Australian broadacre irrigation, replacing traditional surface methods. These machines give the potential of irrigating large areas with high efficiency and with a uniformity of above 80 % when designed correctly. A major component of the large mobile irrigation machine is the sprinkler application package commissioned with the machine. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> {{are becoming a}} common {{part of the package}} when large mobile irrigation machines are commissioned. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> are installed upstream of the nozzle and provide a constant output pressure regardless of the input pressure into the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The device acts as a variable headloss. Input pressure changes are a common occurrence on large mobile irrigation machines and typically are from topographic changes as the machines travel through the field. The application rate is directly influenced by the output pressure from the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> thus this shows the importance of accurately understanding to performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Reviewing previous literature it was known that the methodology development was a crucial part in understanding the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> performance. The development of a solid robust methodology was the primary objective of this dissertation. Eight stages of testing occurred each with incremental changes to develop the methodology for testing. The way the testing was undertaking proved to influence the results of the test. A statistical analysis in terms of an ANOVA and sample size calculations was undertaken on a limited set of data. It was found the for the 16 <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> tested the means were not equal. 88 <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> were found to be tested to understand manufacturing variation based on the normal model. The methodology by which the test was carried out was found to influence the outcome of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Each result needs to be interpreted with reference to the methodology. Much more testing is needed to fully understand the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> performance and how they function on large mobile irrigation machines. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the Autococker quickly rose {{to become one}} of the most popular markers used by top {{professional}} teams, used by such teams as Bob Long's original Ironmen. Although heavily criticized for reliability and a number of design defects, it proved to be an easy platform to work off and aftermarket parts soon appeared shortly after its inception. One of the most fundamental and important upgrades was the Palmer [...] "Rock" [...] <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> (LPR) to replace the troublesome stock LPR. With a variety of options appearing for parts, Belsales in the UK became the first company to build WGP-certified aftermarket cockers, called [...] "Evolution" [...] in 1993. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s, dozens of shops ranging from large notables such as Dave Youngblood Enterprises (Dye), Shocktech, Planet Eclipse, Belsales and FreeFlow down to small one man pro-shop operations made a business of servicing and customizing Autocockers with price tags of nearly $2000 for high-end models. A combination of performance, upgradeability and cosmetic options made it one of the top tournament markers of the 90's. Only the Automag rivaled it in popularity until electronic markers appeared. Indeed, the autococker was so ubiquitous that its barrel threading became one of the most commonly used standards on high-end markers (akin to how firearm cartridge sizes are often named for the first popular gun model or manufacturer to use them). To this day, most high-end markers, and many entry-level as well, accept barrels with [...] "autococker threads".|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{upgrades}} {{available for the}} ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, {{the most popular of}} these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster-style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new cylinder and ram unit as well as a Quick Exhaust Valve, or QEV and hose barb. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed {{out of the back of}} the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt link pin, which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com ...|$|E
50|$|The last type of {{pneumatic}} airgun is the precharged pneumatic. This {{is both an}} old and a new design; some of {{the earliest}} airguns, such as the model carried by Lewis and Clark, were of this type, as are many new cutting edge models. The precharged pneumatic uses an external source of compressed air, either an external pump or a high pressure reservoir such as a SCUBA tank, to fill a reservoir. The reservoir can be a small, single-shot one, such as in the Brocock Air Cartridge system, or a large, multi-shot tank. The key to top accuracy in a precharged pneumatic is a consistent pressure. With multishot systems (as are most), the pressure in the reservoir will drop with each shot fired, so the best way to achieve consistency is with a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> which provides a steady, but lower, pressure at the valve, {{for as long as the}} reservoir pressure remains higher than the regulated <b>pressure.</b> <b>Regulators</b> are also generally adjustable, so a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> setting will provide many shots of lower power, while a high pressure setting will provide a few high power shots.|$|R

50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> valve and a pressure relief valve as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> valve fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a safety release valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a <b>low</b> and high <b>pressure</b> setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow excess pressure to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a spring-loaded valve that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> valve that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|R
