40|$|This project {{investigated}} the measured <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> and observed canal lining conditions by the Texas AgriLife Extension Service {{to evaluate the}} Davis-Wilson empirical formula and to further develop a canal condition rating system for predicting <b>loss</b> <b>rates.</b> This research is to help irrigation districts of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas to identify and prioritize the high loss deteriorated lined canals for rehabilitation and management. The ponding test method was used to estimate the <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> on 32 canal sections. The condition rating scores were evaluated for 26 of these canals. Test calculation revisions and testing errors were first evaluated to understand the potential impacts to the seepage <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> and condition rating system. The condition rating system had good results for canals with a ranking of 1, predicting losses less than 0. 38 (ft^(3) /ft^(2) /day). Canals with rankings of 2 and 3 had a larger range in <b>loss</b> <b>rates.</b> This {{could be attributed to}} either the subsoil types having more influence as the lining conditions become more deteriorated or errors in the rating system. The Davis-Wilson empirical formula had poor results at predicting <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> for the local lining conditions. The seepage <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> were used to calibrate the formula and derive new coefficients (Cvalues). The C-values were correlated with the scores of the condition rating system (i. e. Ranking 1 = C-values 1 - 11). Relationships were also found between the canal dimensions, water <b>loss</b> <b>rates,</b> and conditions ratings. In general, larger, deeper canals were in better condition and had lower <b>loss</b> <b>rates.</b> Smaller canals had more variability in both <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> and condition ratings...|$|R

40|$|Author’s Abstract 1 We {{address the}} problem of calculating link <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> from end-toend measurements. Contrary to {{existing}} works that use only the average end-to-end <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> or strict temporal correlation between probes, we exploit 2 nd order moments of end-to-end flows. We first prove that the variance of link <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> can be uniquely calculated from covariance of the measured end-to-end <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> in any realistic topology. After calculating the link variance, we remove the un-congested links with small variance from the 1 st order moment equations to obtain a full rank linear system of equations, from which we can calculate precisely the <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> of the remaining congested links. This operation is possible because losses due to congestion occur in bursts and hence the <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> of congested links have high variances. On the contrary, most links on the Internet are uncongested, and hence the averages and variances of their <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> are virtually zero. Our proposed solution uses only regular unicast probes and thus is applicable in today’s Internet. Is is accurate and scalable, as shown in our simulations and experiments in PlanetLab...|$|R

5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus.

5|$|The {{logistical}} haul discovered, removed, {{or destroyed}} in eastern Cambodia during the operations was indeed prodigious: 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 to 8,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of ammunition (including 143,000 mortar shells, rockets, and recoilless rifle rounds); 29 tons of communications equipment; 431 vehicles; and 55 tons of medical supplies. MACV intelligence estimated that PAVN/NLF forces in southern Vietnam required 1,222 tons of all supplies each month {{to keep up}} a normal pace of operations.

5|$|For 100 months, the U.S. Air Force, the CIA, and the Thai {{government}} had assisted the Royal Lao government in staving off defeat {{at the hands}} of its enemies. If one measures the success of Barrel Roll by the priorities assigned to it by the U.S. government and military, it was a success. It had allowed the continuous prosecution of the Steel Tiger (and, post-1968, Operation Commando Hunt) interdiction campaigns against the Ho Chi Minh trail by keeping the neutralists in power. At the time of the cease-fire, communist forces controlled two-thirds of the land area and one-third of the population of Laos, approximately the same amounts that they had under their control in 1961. The imposition of a strategic stalemate had prevented the fall of the Vientiane government, which accomplished the secondary goal of the operation, protecting Thailand from communist attack (however unrealistic that threat appears today). This stalemate had been achieved with the loss of 131 U.S. aircraft between 1964 and 1973, a very low <b>loss</b> <b>rate</b> when compared to the operations discussed above.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{believed}} they had struck a mortal blow against the ALA. German post-operation analysis indicated a resounding success. It suggested {{a long list of}} wrecked French factories and destroyed aircraft on the ground and in the air. The Germans claimed to have destroyed 75 French aircraft in the air and 400 on the ground. Such was the perceived success, the Luftwaffe concentrated against ports on the northern French coast thereafter. The damage inflicted by the Luftwaffe was far less than the Germans thought. Only 20 French aircraft (16 of them fighters) were destroyed on the ground and 15 of their fighters were shot down in aerial combat, a <b>loss</b> <b>rate</b> of 19 percent, suggesting German over claiming of over 4:1 in the air and 16:1 on the ground. Six of the sixteen airfields hit reported serious damage, while fifteen factories reported slight damage. French casualties on the ground were heavy, including 254 dead and 652 injured. The French shot down 10 German aircraft, including four bombers. They claimed 16, suggesting mutual over claiming. A further 21 vehicles were destroyed. All the French airfields were back in operation 48 hours later.|$|E
5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment in August 1941 {{and it was}} {{initially}} committed to the ground attack and escort roles after retraining through September. It was redesignated as the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment on 25 September and assigned to the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps of the PVO defending Moscow. A few days later six Pe-3s escorted C-47s carrying a British military delegation flying from Vologda to Moscow and successfully defended against several German attacks on the transports. Pe-3s strafed German troop columns as they approached Moscow during Operation Typhoon. On 24 October the 95th and 208th Fighter Aviation Regiments, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven Pe-3s between them, attacked the German airfield at Kalinin, claiming thirty German aircraft destroyed for the loss of five Soviet aircraft and pilots, including the commander of the 208th Regiment, Major S. Kibirinym. The 9th, 40th, 54th and 511th Bomber Aviation Regiments also received Pe-3s during September and performed similar missions. Approximately 50 aircraft were lost during the Pe-3's first three months of combat, about 25% of the aircraft produced thus far. This was a very high <b>loss</b> <b>rate</b> and a number of units began to conduct less risky reconnaissance missions to minimize casualties.

5|$|The first attacks {{conducted}} under LeMay's leadership achieved mixed results. XXIBomber Command flew {{six major}} missions between 23January and 19February with little success, though an incendiary raid against Kobe on 4February caused significant {{damage to the}} city and its main factories. Moreover, while improved maintenance procedures implemented by LeMay reduced the number of B-29s that had to return to base during raids due to technical problems, the Command suffered a <b>loss</b> <b>rate</b> of 5.1% in these operations. From 19February to 3March, XXI Bomber Command conducted a series of precision bombing raids on aircraft factories that sought to tie down Japanese air units so they could not participate in the Battle of Iwo Jima. However, these attacks were frustrated by high winds and cloud cover and little damage was inflicted. A firebombing raid conducted against Tokyo by 172 B-29s on 25February was considered successful as it burnt or damaged approximately one square mile of the city's urban area. This attack was a large-scale test of the effectiveness of firebombing.|$|E
