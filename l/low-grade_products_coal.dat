The re-combined composite <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> size fractions are then stockpiled prior to use or transport to the port for export. On the stockpile, the <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> undergoes drainage under gravity, cycles of atmospheric drying and wetting, and wetting up due to the spraying {{of water on the}} stockpile to suppress dust. In this paper, the results of laboratory characterisation testing, atmospheric drying, and laboratory simulated wetting of stockpiled <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> are presented and discussed, leading to an improved understanding of the ex-plant drying and wetting process involved. This improved understanding can be used to optimise the design and management of <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> stockpiles to ensure the required moisture state...|$|R
40|$|Australian <b>product</b> <b>coals</b> are {{becoming}} finer-grained, mainly due to {{improvements in the}} performance of ultra-fine coal recovery methods. The finer the <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> size fraction, the more capacity it has to store water during beneficiation and the higher the pressure required to facilitate dewatering to meet the specified moisture. Following the removal of the pressure applied to facilitate dewatering, the particular <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> size fraction is left under a suction equivalent to that applied pressure, providing it with the potential to re-wet on the stockpile under moist conditions. During the dewatering process, the <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> is unsaturated. The relationship between applied pressure (or the equivalent suction felt on the removal of this pressure) and moisture content for a particular <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> size fraction is described by the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) of the material, based on unsaturated soil mechanics principles. Such curves have been obtained for different <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> size fractions, from which the effectiveness of dewatering under a range of applied pressures can be estimated. Moisture content versus time data for ultra-fine and fine <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> samples under a constant applied suction have also been obtained for use in estimating the extent of dewatering achievable for a given residence time in a particular piece of dewatering equipment. The SWCCs can be used to supplement conventional methods in deciding the most appropriate dewatering equipment required to obtain a given moisture content for a particular <b>product</b> <b>coal</b> size fraction...|$|R
