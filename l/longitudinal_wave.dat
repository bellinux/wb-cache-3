25|$|A basic {{principle}} of Huygens {{is that the}} speed of light is finite, a point which had been the subject of an experimental demonstration by Olaus Roemer (1679 at the Paris Observatory), but which Huygens is presumed to have believed already. The theory is kinematic and its scope largely restricted to geometric optics. It covers little of what would now be termed physical optics. It deals with wave fronts and their normal rays, with propagation conceived by means of spherical waves emitted along the wave front (see also Huygens–Fresnel principle). It was justified as an ether theory, involving transmission via perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} through gases, plasma, and liquids as <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves,</b> also called compression waves. It requires a medium to propagate.

One {{of the most critical}} situations is generated when the ship moves on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves,</b> at parametric resonance condition. In this paper, the theoretical and experimental investigations on transverse stability of a cargo ship on regular <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves</b> are considered. During the seakeeping model tests on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves,</b> the occurrence of induced roll motions were observed and measured. The restoring moment on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves</b> was determined based on theoretical and experimental methods. A computer code has been implemented in order to calculate the main parts of the restoring moment i. e. Froude-Krylov, diffraction and radiation components. In order to reproduce the real physical phenomenon, captive and semi-captive model tests were correlated. The radiation and diffraction forces and moments and the restoring moment on regular <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves</b> were measured.

2500|$|An {{isotropic}} radiator is a theoretical point source of electromagnetic or sound waves which radiates the same {{intensity of radiation}} in all directions. [...] It has no preferred direction of radiation. [...] It radiates uniformly in all directions over a sphere centred on the source. [...] Isotropic radiators are used as reference radiators with which other sources are compared, for example in determining the gain of antennas. [...] A coherent {{isotropic radiator}} of electromagnetic waves is theoretically impossible, but incoherent radiators can be built. [...] An isotropic sound radiator is possible because sound is a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In a gas or liquid, sound {{consists}} of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> {{is associated with}} compression and decompression {{in the direction of}} travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the transverse wave, also called a shear wave, occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the [...] "polarization" [...] of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of orthogonal polarizations.|$|E
2500|$|Before Newton, Christiaan Huygens had {{hypothesized}} that light was a wave propagating through an aether. Newton rejected this idea, {{mainly on the}} ground that both men apparently could only envision light as a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> like sound and other mechanical waves in fluids. However, longitudinal waves necessarily have only one form for a given propagation direction, rather than two polarizations like transverse wave. Thus, longitudinal waves could not explain birefringence, in which two polarizations of light are refracted differently by a crystal. [...] Instead, Newton preferred to imagine non-spherical particles, or [...] "corpuscles", of light with different [...] "sides" [...] that give rise to birefringence. [...] In addition, Newton rejected light as waves in a medium because such a medium would have to extend everywhere in space, and would thereby [...] "disturb and retard the Motions of those great Bodies" [...] (the planets and comets) and thus [...] "as it [...] is of no use, and hinders the Operation of Nature, and makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its Existence, and therefore it ought to be rejected".|$|E

2500|$|As {{explained}} above, a set {{of three}} orthonormal polarizations (...) of the particle motion exist for a given propagation direction [...] in a solid. For measurement setups where the transducers can be fixated directly to the sample under investigation {{it is possible to}} create these three polarizations (one longitudinal, and two orthogonal transverse waves) by applying different types of transducers exciting the desired polarization (e.g. piezoelectric transducers with the needed oscillation mode). Thus it is possible to measure the sound velocity of waves with all three polarizations through either time dependent or frequency dependent measurement setups depending on the selection of transducer types. However, if the transducer can not be fixated to the test specimen a coupling medium is needed to transmit the acoustic energy from the transducer to the specimen. Water or gels are often used as this coupling medium. For measurement of the longitudinal sound velocity this is sufficient, however fluids do not carry shear waves, and thus to be able to generate and measure the velocity of shear waves in the test specimen the incident <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> must interact at an oblique angle at the fluid/solid surface to generate shear waves through mode conversion. Such shear waves are then converted back to longitudinal waves at the solid/fluid surface propagating back through the fluid to the recording transducer enabling the measurement of shear wave velocities as well through a coupling medium.|$|E
50|$|Longitudinal waves {{cause the}} medium to vibrate {{parallel}} to {{the direction of the}} wave. It consists of multiple compressions and rarefactions. The rarefaction is the farthest distance apart in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> and the compression is the closest distance together. The speed of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> is increased in higher index of refraction, due to the closer proximity of the atoms in the medium that is being compressed.
