5|$|Their {{answer was}} {{surprising}} in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and {{more important for}} AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.|$|E

[...] In the 1850s, two events took place that led to the development of the Emory Place area. [...] The first was the establishment of Old Gray Cemetery in 1850, which served as a de facto public park, and drew pedestrians to the area. [...] The second event was the construction of the railroad, which reached Knoxville in 1855, pushing the city's northern <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is now the Southern Railway tracks.

2500|$|The inquiry was {{critical}} of the operator and the Department of Civil Aviation. In particular, it {{was critical}} of the operator's poor standards of maintenance of aircraft instruments. [...] For this reason, the inquiry recommended the operator's airline licence should be suspended or cancelled. [...] It also considered the Department should have made more checks of the operator's methods and record keeping. [...] The Minister declined {{to take action against}} the operator, saying its maintenance record keeping had improved significantly since the accident. [...] He also cited the hardship that would be inflicted on many remote communities in Western Australia if the operator's airline licence were to be suspended or cancelled.

2500|$|On August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service {{provider}} reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly {{announced it was}} shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather {{go out of business}} than [...] "become complicit in crimes against the American people." [...] He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to [...] "prevent spying". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, [...] "Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts have forgotten that the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, and it is our job to remind them that there are <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we will pay." [...] He said that [...] "internet titans" [...] like Google should ask themselves why they weren't [...] "fighting for our interests the same way small businesses are." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second measures, which {{originally}} {{came from}} the common law but also went into the Second Company Law Directive, were to regulate what was paid for shares. Initial subscribers to a memorandum for public companies must buy their shares with cash, though afterwards {{it is possible to}} give a company services or assets in return for shares. The problem was whether the services or assets accepted were in fact as valuable to the company as the cash share price otherwise would be. At common law, In re Wragg Ltd said that any exchange that was [...] "honestly and not colourably" [...] agreed to, between the company and the purchaser of shares, would be presumed legitimate. Later on it was also held that if the assets given were probably understood by both parties to have been insufficient, then this would count as a [...] "colourable" [...] taint, and the shares could be treated as being not properly paid for. The shareholder would have to pay again. This laissez faire approach was changed for public companies. Shares cannot be issued in return for services that will only be provided at a later date. Shares can be issued in return for assets, but a public company must pay for an independent valuation. There are also absolute <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> a share can be bought for in cash, based on a share's [...] "nominal value" [...] or [...] "par value". This refers to a figure chosen by a company when it begins to sell shares, and it can be anything from 1 penny up to the market price. UK law always required that some nominal value be set, because it was thought that a lower limit of some kind should be in place for how much shares could be sold, even though this very figure was chosen by the company itself. Every share, therefore, is still required to have a nominal value and shares cannot be sold at a price lower. In practice this has meant companies always set nominal values so low below the issue price, that the actual market price at which a share ends up being traded is very unlikely to plummet so far. This has led to the criticism for at least 60 years that the rule is useless and best abolished.|$|E
