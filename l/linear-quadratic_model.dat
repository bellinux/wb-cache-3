The <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model</b> is less {{studied in the}} literature than the linear one. In this paper, we propose original methods {{that are based on}} Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This class of methods is well suited to many applications where the data are non-negative.

The originality of our work is that we developed extensions of NMF, which is initially suited to the linear model, for the <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model.</b> The proposed algo-rithms are tested with simulated hyperspectral images using real reflectance spectra and the obtained results are very satisfactory.

To reconcile some puzzles {{in the recent}} literature {{on the nature of}} policy interactions among nations, we prove that games characterized by different commitment and cooperation schemes can admit the same equilibrium outcome if certain spillover effects vanish at the common solution of these games. We provide a detailed discussion of these spillovers, showing that, in general, commitment and cooperation are nontrivial issues. Yet in <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>models</b> with multiple policymakers, commitment and cooperation schemes are shown to become irrelevant under certain assumptions.

40|$|The US {{government}} regulates allowable radiation exposures relying, {{in large}} part, {{on the seventh}} report from the committee to estimate the Biological Effect of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII), which estimated that most contemporary exposures- protracted or low-dose, carry 1. 5 fold less risk of carcinogenesis and mortality per Gy than acute exposures of atomic bomb survivors. This correction {{is known as the}} dose and dose rate effectiveness factor for the life span study of atomic bomb survivors (DDREFLSS). It was calculated by applying a linear-quadratic dose response model to data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and a limited number of animal studies. We argue that the <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model</b> does not provide appropriate support to estimate the risk of contemporary exposures. In this work, we re-estimated DDREFLSS using 15 animal studies that were not included in BEIR VII's original analysis. Acute exposure data led to a DDREFLSS estimate from 0. 9 to 3. 0. By contrast, data that included both acute and protracted exposures led to a DDREFLSS estimate from 4. 8 to infinity. These two estimates are significantly different, violating the assumptions of the <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model,</b> which predicts that DDREFLSS values calculated in either way should be the same. Therefore, we propose that future estimates of the risk of protracted exposures should be based on direct comparisons of data from acute and protracted exposures, rather than from extrapolations from a <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model.</b> The risk of low dose exposures may be extrapolated from these protracted estimates, though we encourage ongoing debate as to whether this is the most valid approach. We also encourage efforts to enlarge the datasets used to estimate the risk of protracted exposures by including both human and animal data, carcinogenesis outcomes, a wider range of exposures, and by making more radiobiology data publicly accessible. We believe that these steps will contribute to better estimates of the risks of contemporary radiation exposures...|$|E

40|$|Multi-Stage Model (under the {{direction}} of DAVID G. HOEl). ABSTRACT: Laboratory based clinical trials are conducted to assess the toxicological effect of chronic exposure to a substance. Two distinct functions are generally addressed via this chronic animal bioassay; qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. The design of the chronic animal bioassay {{is an important issue}} which should be given careful consideration. Optimal designs aimed at quantitative risk assessment and satisfying standards for qualitative risk assessment are derived under the assumption that carcinogenesis can be modeled by the mu 1 tistage theory of Armitage and Doll. The distribution of the estimate of the virtually safe dose is derived using large sample theory. Designs are derived which minimize the asymptotic mean-squared-error of the estimate of the virtually safe dose.

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} body of evidence {{to the effect that}} output is more volatile than sales among manufacturing industries. Numerous explanations have been advanced to account for this excess output volatility. Some examples are pro-cyclical inventory movements induced by a stockout-avoidance motive, cost and technology shocks and decreasing marginal costs. This article assesses the contribution of these different motives to output volatility for six different manufacturing industries. <b>Linear-quadratic</b> <b>models</b> are estimated for each of the industries and then dynamic simulations are employed to determine the volatility of output when {{one or more of the}} factors are removed from the model. Technology shocks provide the most significant contribution to output volatility. The stockout-avoidance motive is also important. Cost shocks provide a very small contribution and marginal production costs are increasing at the margin and thus stabilize output. It is also shown that output volatility declines when current values of sales and material costs are assumed known rather than forecasted from prior periods' values. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE:Hypofractionated {{irradiation}} {{is often}} used in precise radiotherapy instead of conventional multifractionated irradiation. We propose a novel mathematical method for selecting a hypofractionated or multifractionated irradiation regimen based on physical dose distribution adding to biologic consideration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model</b> {{was used for the}} radiation effects on tumor and normal tissues, especially organs at risk (OARs). On the basis of the assumption that the OAR receives a fraction of the dose intended for the tumor, the minimization problem for the damage effect on the OAR was treated under the constraint that the radiation effect on the tumor is fixed. RESULTS: For an N-time fractionated irradiation regimen, the constraint of tumor lethality was described by an N-dimensional hypersphere. The total dose of the fractionated irradiations was considered for minimizing the damage effect on the OAR under the hypersphere condition. It was found that the advantage of hypofractionated or multifractionated irradiation therapies depends on the magnitude of the ratio of α/β parameters for the OAR and tumor in the <b>linear-quadratic</b> <b>model</b> and the ratio of the dose for the OAR and tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Our mathematical method shows that multifractionated irradiation with a constant dose is better if the ratio of α/β for the OAR and tumor is less than the ratio of the dose for the OAR and tumor, whereas hypofractionated irradiation is better otherwise...|$|E
