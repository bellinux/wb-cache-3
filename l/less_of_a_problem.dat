40|$|Public {{concern on}} issues such as animal welfare or the {{scientific}} validity and clinical value of animal research is growing, resulting in increasing regulatory demands for animal research. Abiding to the most stringent animal welfare standards, while having scientific objectives as the main priority, is often challenging. To do so, endpoints of studies involving severe, progressive diseases need to be established considering how early in the disease process the scientific objectives can be achieved. We present here experimental studies of tuberculosis (TB) in mice as a case study for <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> present practice and <b>a</b> discussion <b>of</b> how more refined science-based endpoints can be developed. <b>A</b> considerable proportion <b>of</b> studies in this field involve lethal stages, and the establishment of earlier, reliable indicators of disease severity will {{have a significant impact on}} animal welfare. While there is an increasing interest from scientists and industry in moving research in this direction, this is still far from being reflected in actual practice. We argue that a major limiting factor is the absence of data on biomarkers that can be used as indicators of disease severity. We discuss the possibility of complementing the widely used weight loss with other relevant biomarkers and the need for validation of these parameters as endpoints. Promotion of ethical guidelines needs to be coupled with systematic research in order to develop humane endpoints beyond the present euthanasia of moribund animals. Such research, as we propose here for chronic infection, can show the way for the development and promotion of welfare policies in other fields of research. Research on chronic infection relies heavily on the use of animals, as only the integral animal body can model the full aspect <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infection. That animals are generally made to develop a disease in infection studies exacerbates the tension between human benefit and animal well-being, which characterizes all biomedical research with animals. Scientists typically justify animal research with reference to potential human benefits, but if accepting the assumption that human benefits can offset animal suffering, it still needs to be argued that the same benefits could not be achieved with less negative effects on animal welfare. Reducing the animal welfare problems associated with research (“refinement” [1]) is therefore crucial in order to render animal-based research <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ethical <b>problem</b> and to assure public trust in research. Studies that are designed to measure time of death or survival percentages present a particularly challenging situation in which at least some of the animals are made to die from the disease. These studies are frequent in experimental research on severe infections. The scientific community, industry, and regulatory authorities have responded to the ethical concerns over studies in which animals die from severe disease by developing new policies and guidelines for the implementation of humane endpoints as a key refinement measure (e. g., [2]–[4]). The most widely used definition considers a humane endpoint to be the earliest indicator in <b>an</b> animal experiment <b>of</b> severe pain, severe distress, suffering, or impending death [5], underlining that ideally such indicators should be identified before the onset of the most severe effects. Euthanizing animals, rather than awaiting their “spontaneous” death, is important to avoid unnecessary suffering in studies in which data on survival is thought to be required for scientific or legal reasons. However, several questions remain open regarding how humane endpoints are to be applied to address real animal welfare problems. We used TB experiments in mice as a case study to highlight the potential to establish biomarkers of disease progress that can replace survival time as <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> disease severity.

40|$|During the mid 1990 s, the ROSAT {{satellite}} {{provided the}} highest resolution X-ray imaging, with useful X-ray spectroscopy, and excellent sensitivity. ROSAT"s PSPC and HRI instruments gave us our first high-quality {{data on the}} AGN phenomenon in nearby galaxies - the central theme of this research project. Initially this project concentrated on separating the AGN-related component of the X-ray emission from thermal radiation from the surrounding atmospheres in radio galaxies. There was ample {{reason to believe that}} this separation would be possible, although earlier work had taken the view that the X-ray emission from radio galaxies is either wholly AGN-related (and hence of sub-arcsec scale), or wholly from the galaxy and cluster atmospheres (and hence of scales - 10 arcsec or more in the low-redshift radio galaxies that we chose to study). First with the PSPC, and then with the HRI, we proved that <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> AGN core X ray emissivities could be found, and that the generic radio galaxy produces both AGN-related and atmosphere-related X-radiation. We demonstrated that there is a close relationship between the core X-ray power and the core radio power, and found instances in which the hot atmospheres of the galaxies must be participating in cooling flows, and other cases where those atmospheres are relatively stable. In some cases, there is a clear active relationship between the extended radio emission and the X-ray atmospheres: thus in NGC 326, we interpret the distorted radio structure as evidence of buoyancy as the radio plasma rises through the cluster atmosphere. In 3 C 449, we can see that the radio plasma is displacing the X-ray emitting gas. In a further case (NGC 1265), we hoped that the motion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> radio galaxy through a cluster atmosphere would be apparent though the wake that it might establish - unfortunately, other structure in the atmosphere of the Perseus cluster tends to dominate our X-ray image, and no useful limits could be placed on the strength of the wake. In the light of so-called "unified" models of AGN, it is expected that the low-power radio galaxies studied under these programmes are the unbeamed counterparts of BL Lac objects. Accordingly, we predicted that BL Lac objects, as a class, should show X-ray halos from atmospheres similar to those associated with radio galaxies. The difficulty with studying this is that BL Lac objects tend to be X-ray bright, and the halos then vanish under the wings of the point response function. We found a BL Lac with <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dynamic range <b>problem,</b> mapped it with the ROSAT HRI, and duly found an atmosphere (Hardcastle et al. 1999). Unfortunately for unification models, this atmosphere is exceptionally dense, so that it must be participating in an intense cooling flow. The implications of this for unification models are far from clear, and further work is under way...|$|R
