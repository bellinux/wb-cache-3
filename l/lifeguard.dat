5|$|After {{moving through}} the Tongan islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every <b>lifeguard</b> in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 {{people out of the}} water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} into {{a remnant}} low, Felicia continued {{to approach the}} Hawaiian Islands and on August12, the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded on Oahu at , causing isolated mudslides and flooding. In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs. In addition, river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several <b>lifeguard</b> rescues at island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia.|$|E

50|$|The rip {{currents}} {{along this}} section of coast are very unpredictable and can shift with little warning. They claim many lives {{despite the efforts of}} surf life-savers. Most of these drownings, however, occur after <b>lifeguards</b> are off duty or after rock fisherman wearing heavy clothing are washed off rocks, {{out of sight of the}} <b>lifeguards.</b> <b>Lifeguards</b> advise swimming between the red and yellow flags, during patrol hours.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the marginal benefits of increasing lifesavers and <b>lifeguards</b> for beach users in Australia and the United States. Visits, income, education, age, distance from a patrol, {{and willingness to}} swim on an unpatrolled beach explain willingness to pay but rivalry does not; snob and bandwagon effects prevail. By comparing benefits with costs, the levels of <b>lifeguards</b> and lifesavers in Australia {{were found to be}} underprovided, consistent with shared good theory. Increasing services provides greater net benefits to users but replacing volunteer lifesavers with paid <b>lifeguards</b> may not because volunteering brings broader social benefits. willingness to pay, lifesaving, <b>lifeguarding,</b> rivalry, shared goods...|$|R

5|$|Impact {{throughout}} the season was minimal and no deaths were recorded. In early August, the remnants of Hurricane Darby aided in localized heavy rainfall in Hawaii, causing minor street and stream flooding; coffee and macadamia trees were damaged as well. In early September, Hurricane Howard resulted in significant flooding across Baja California Peninsula that damaged agricultural land and 393 homes. Large swells also resulted in about 1,000 <b>lifeguard</b> rescues in California. In mid-September, Javier caused three fishermen to go missing and helped alleviate a multi-year drought across the Southwest United States. It produced record rainfall {{in the state of}} Wyoming. In mid- to late October, Tropical Storm Lester and Tropical Depression Sixteen-E caused localized flooding; the latter may have produced a tornado near Culiacán, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by <b>lifeguard</b> Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
2500|$|The acronym RID was {{originated}} by Frank Pia {{to summarize}} important reasons why <b>lifeguards</b> may {{be unaware of}} a drowning. The term stands for [...] "failure to recognize the struggle, the intrusion of non-lifeguard duties upon lifeguards' primary task-preventive <b>lifeguarding,</b> and the distraction from surveillance duties". [...] In his paper on the RID factors, Pia makes a number of observations on the role, and the required behavior and training of <b>lifeguards,</b> {{as well as the}} importance of administrators directing <b>lifeguards</b> to this role and avoiding double tasking them (due to the very brief time of 20 – 60 seconds required for drowning to occur). He ended by summarizing the role of <b>lifeguards</b> as guardians of life, and that they should be directed exclusively to this duty and none other, while on surveillance, due to the high value placed on human life.|$|R
