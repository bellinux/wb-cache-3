5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} renowned works he ordered was the raising of the Sigismund's Column in Warsaw. The column, {{dedicated}} to his father, was designed by the Italian-born architect Constantino Tencalla and the sculptor Clemente Molli, and cast by Daniel Tym. He was <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> decorative architecture; he supported the construction of two palaces in Warsaw – Kazanowski Palace and Villa Regia. Among other works sponsored by or dedicated to him is Guido Reni's The Rape of Europa.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted the translation {{of the works of}} persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Reitz was an {{important}} figure in Afrikaner cultural life. He was a poet, and published many poems in Afrikaans, making him a progenitor {{of the development of}} Afrikaans as a cultural language. As such he sympathised with the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of Real Afrikaners), established in the Cape Colony in 1875. Although he never became a member himself, he was an active contributor to the society's journal, Die Suid-Afrikaansche Patriot. With his literary work, Reitz was solidly anchored in the so-called First Afrikaans Language Movement, although he was <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the didactic drive of that movement than in writing in Afrikaans as a purely cultural activity. Much of his work was based on English texts, which he translated, edited, and adapted. In the process he produced completely new works of art.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E

5|$|Much of Galveston's {{success as}} a tourist {{destination}} {{was the result of}} E. Sid Holliday, who became the publicity and convention director of the Galveston Chamber of Commerce in 1925 and later became its head. The Chamber helped promote the legitimate face of Galveston's tourism and business community (though it cooperated heavily with the criminal enterprises). Legitimate amusements such as an amusement park that included a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster (the Mountain Speedway), in addition to the beaches and up-scale shopping districts (notably the Strand) drew visitors, including those <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the city's illegal attractions. One of the most spectacular efforts by the Chamber, though not one of the city's greatest successes, was the Pleasure Pier (originally known as the Brantly Harris Recreational Pier). This huge pier (later converted to the Flagship Hotel), built in the 1940s and used by the military {{until the end of the}} war, featured restaurants, rides, and an amphitheater.|$|E

25|$|The United Provinces {{were much}} <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{a war with}} Russia, as Russia had {{significant}} debts to Dutch bankers, which the war could jeopardize.

25|$|An {{interesting}} feature, {{compared to}} other Danish parties, is that the Danish People's Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in opinion polls.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, as {{attitudes toward}} women's role in American society changed, Lois' {{character}} changed as well. In Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane issue #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look. Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more adventures without Superman being involved and was much <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> discovering Superman's secret identity.|$|E
25|$|After he {{made his}} {{earliest}} feature films in 1969, Fassbinder centered his efforts in his career as film director, but he maintained an intermittent foothold in the theater until his death. He worked in various productions throughout Germany and {{made a number of}} radio plays in the early 1970s. In 1974 Fassbinder took directorial control over the Theater am Turm (TAT) of Frankfurt; when this project ended in failure and controversy, Fassbinder became <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> theater.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{the concept}} of {{governmental}} interest analysis was developed by Brainerd Currie and is preferred by many American conflicts writers. Currie focused on each state's substantive rules, rather than on a metaphorical test, for {{the seat of the}} legal relationships and assumed that governments are <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> what happens within their territorial boundaries than in the well-being of their subjects. The methodology that he proposed relies almost entirely on the personal nexus between the litigants and the states.|$|E

30|$|These {{results are}} robust to {{controlling}} for two relevant variables. As expected, those individuals that regard {{the state as}} efficient think that the state should play {{a greater role in}} reducing economic and social risks. 8 The impact of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics operates according to the theory. Those that have <b>less</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics tend to endorse the view that the state should play a secondary role in its social functions. However, respondents with <b>less</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics also think that the state should provide jobs and this holds after controlling for their employment status and other socio-demographic characteristics. There are other consistent patterns that show in the results, all in the expected direction. Respondents who enjoy a higher socioeconomic status think that the state should play a less important role in the economy and in the provision of social welfare. The same occurs among more educated individuals.|$|R
25|$|Eunuchs {{supposedly}} did {{not generally}} have loyalties to the military, the aristocracy, or {{to a family}} of their own (having neither offspring nor in-laws, at the very least), and were thus seen as more trustworthy and <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> establishing a private 'dynasty'. Because their condition usually lowered their social status, they could also be easily replaced or killed without repercussion. In cultures that had both harems and eunuchs, eunuchs were sometimes used as harem servants (compare the female odalisque) or seraglio guards.|$|E
25|$|Portugal's king Manuel I in 1517 {{commissioned}} a diplomatic and trade mission to Guangzhou headed by Tomé Pires and Fernão Pires de Andrade. The embassy lasted until {{the death of}} the Zhengde Emperor in Nanjing. The embassy was further rejected by the Chinese Ming court, which now became <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> new foreign contacts. The Ming Court was also influenced by reports of misbehaviour of Portuguese elsewhere in China, and by the deposed Sultan of Malacca seeking Chinese assistance to drive the Portuguese out of Malacca.|$|E
25|$|The Rewolucyjni Mściciele {{group was}} formed in Łódź in fall of 1910. Its members came from small anarchist groups (such as Grupa Rewolucjonistów Terrorystów) and radical members of the Polish Socialist Party. Two direct founders were Edward Dłużewski and Józef Piątek. As a teenager, Dłużewski had focused on {{stealing}} from the rich. Piątek was {{a former member of}} the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, disillusioned with PPS, and <b>less</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> fighting for Poland's independence (increasingly a major item for that organization) than in improving workers' condition.|$|E

30|$|There {{has been}} <b>less</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the {{external}} {{effects of processing}} trade.
