40|$|International audienceBio-acrylic acid (AA) is {{produced}} from glycerol, {{a by-product of}} biodiesel production and oleochemistry. However, conventional purification techniques cannot purify this biobased AA owing to its impurity profile and the significant content of propionic acid (PA). The liquid–-solid phase diagram of the binary AA + PA shows that acrylic acid crystallizes ais a pure form from melts containing between 50 and 100 % (mol/mol) of AA. Thus, a new falling film melt crystallization device has been developed and tested in which: – supercooling {{is limited by the}} use of a crystallization surface made of 316 L stainless steel, – melt is thermostated, – visual observation of the crystal layer is possible, and – morphology of the crystal layer limits the retention of impure <b>liquid.</b> <b>Purification</b> tests in this falling film device show that AA is separated from the PA in reduced crystallization cycle times and high crystallization yields...|$|E

30|$|Porous {{supports}} bearing cationic lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan {{assembled in}} nanoscale adsorb LPS selectively from HSA solution at pH  4.3 to 8.0 with the ionic strength of 0.05 to 0.1. LPS was removed to {{as low as}} a detection limit of 0.020  ng mL- 1 by a column-wise adsorption with a quantitative recovery of HSA. Since LPS includes a terminal diglucosamine which is negatively charged and highly substituted with long-chain fatty acids, LPS is adsorbed by both an ionic interaction and a hydrophobic one. In addition, the low pKa of the chitosan-based material {{as well as the}} rigid gel phase of lipid membranes leads to a relatively weak interaction between HSA and results in the selective adsorption of LPS. For a practical use in separation, especially such as <b>liquid</b> <b>purification</b> for the pharmaceutical industry, a lower elution property of the separation medium is a key issue. Considering the excellent selectivity and the chemical stability of the supports bearing cationic lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan, their practical use as separation media in pharmaceutical manufacturing can be expected.|$|E

CVCs have historically been extensively used in hemodynamic monitoring, tumor therapy, blood <b>liquid</b> <b>purification,</b> infusion and parenteral nutrition support. However, CVC use can cause a variety of complications. The most common complication is catheter-related blood-stream infections (CRBSIs) [1]. The International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) studied medical-surgical ICUs and found that the pooled rate of CRBSIs in China was 4.1 / 1000 central line-days, which was approximately 5 times higher than the rate of 0.8 / 1000 central line-days found in comparable US ICUs [2]. However, in 2631 cases across 7 ICUs, the estimated CRBSI rate was 7.66 / 1000 in August 2008 and July 2010 in four Chinese hospitals [3]. The cost per infection has been estimated to range from $ 34, 508 to $ 56, 000, and the annual cost of caring for patients with CRBSIs is $ 296 million to $ 2.3 billion in Spain [4]. Moreover, CRBSIs can increase the length of hospitalization and the amount of resources used and affect mortality.|$|E
30|$|The elution {{property}} of separation medium {{is a key}} issue in <b>liquid</b> <b>purification</b> for the pharmaceutical industry. Elution from porous supports bearing lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon content in an eluent from a column packed with 20  mL of supports. The total organic carbon in the recovered water described in the experimental section was 400  μg L- 1 [10]. Even assuming {{that all of the}} organic carbons are due to eluted N-octadecylchitosan, the eluted N-octadecylchitosan (C, 65.7 %) is calculated as 3.0 [*]×[*] 10 - 5  g. This amount is 0.038 % of the N-octadecylchitosan immobilized on the 20 -mL supports. This stability for alkali is attributable to the stability of the amide linkage used for the immobilization of N-octadecylchitosan as well as the stability of the support material. Any substantial change was not observed in the IR spectra of the porous supports bearing lipid membranes after immersion in 0.5  M NaOH or 0.1  M HCl overnight at ambient temperature. This chemical stability, especially to 0.5  M NaOH immersion which is used as a standard depyrogenation procedure, is robust enough for a practical application in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E

The combined treatments increased immunoreactive AP and AP mRNA more than either treatment alone. In {{the animals in}} which cardiac hypertrophy had been produced by abdominal aortic constriction, there was a decrease in atrial levels of AP {{and an increase in}} plasma levels of immunoreactive AP. The increase in left ventricular immunoreactive AP was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue from hypertrophied and/or dexamethasone-treated rats. The mRNA accumulated in the left ventricle was identical to atrial AP mRNA, as judged by transcriptional start site and by size on Northern blots. Because the mass of ventricular tissue is substantially greater than that of atrial tissue, the induced mRNA levels may represent a total abundance approaching one third of the total AP mRNA in the atria. High performance <b>liquid</b> chromatographic <b>purification</b> of ventricular extracts primarily demonstrated the presence of the high molecular precursor and small amounts of C-terminal peptide AP.
