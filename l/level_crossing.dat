5|$|Adelaide's first {{experiment}} with electric powered trams was a demonstration {{run on the}} Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line. A battery powered tram fitted with Julien's Patent Electric Traction ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> accident shortly after precluded further experiments.|$|E
5|$|All tracks {{except the}} few yards {{embedded}} in the quayside at Watchet were removed by 1920, but other features were removed or altered piecemeal over time. By 1940, for example, no trace remained of Washford station, but both sets of <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> gates remained in place.|$|E

5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in the steep road named Borgestadveien, that passed the station in a <b>level</b> <b>crossing.</b> The station served the local senior center named Nordberghjemmet, and was the most used of all {{stations}} among residents living in Nordberg. After the 1992 closure, very little remains from the station, aside from a pedestrians' underpass.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} no signals or {{automatic}} points {{to control the}} switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the sidings. On the approach to a <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> the fireman ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also manually operated the points.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} single tracked between Appledore and Ore on 1 October 1979, leaving a passing loop at Rye. At Winchelsea, the down {{platform}} was removed; trains {{in both directions}} now stop on the former up platform. Line speed was reduced from 85mph to 60mph, but there are additional long term speed restrictions in place, including 40mph between Doleham and Ore and 20mph across a half barrier <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> at Winchelsea.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{positioned}} {{on the southern}} edge of Rushbeds Wood, a surviving part of the Bernwood Forest. It was on the western side of the <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> over Kingswood Lane. Intended primarily for goods use, Wood Siding initially had no facilities for passengers, and the platform was simply a raised earth bank.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E

5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> and runs beside an {{industrial}} estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury and Street {{railway station}} {{was the biggest}} station on the {{original}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services {{and one for the}} branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a signal box. The site is now a timber yard for a local company. Replica <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> gates have been placed at the entrance.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg was {{a station}} on the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro in Oslo, Norway. It was opened on 10 October 1934, and was located between Østhorn and Holstein stations, in a <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> with the steep road Borgestadveien. The station saw several accidents, and was closed on 5 May 1992 when the Sognsvann Line was {{upgraded}} to rapid transit standard. An underpass was constructed to allow pedestrians pass under the tracks.|$|E

5|$|On December 12, 1975, a {{westbound}} GO train {{collided with}} a Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus that was stalled on a crossing at St. Clair and Midland Avenue. Nine passengers on the bus were killed and 20 others were injured. This was the worst accident in terms of loss {{of life in the}} history of the TTC and GO Transit systems. The <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> was replaced by an overpass a few years later.|$|E
5|$|The Kingswood branch {{was again}} not upgraded, and still {{retained}} its 1871 track. It was abandoned {{at the end}} of 1915, and the track removed in 1920. In 1911 Brill Brick and Tile Works closed, and the siding to the brickworks was removed, {{with the exception of the}} rails on the <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> which in 1984 were still in place, albeit tarmacked over. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Brill became a centre for training cadets, who were housed in Wotton House and ferried in trains of five passenger coaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{new line}} was {{initially}} not profitable, because Schøyens Bilcentraler had kept its concession to operate buses in the area. Not until World War II was the bus route terminated. The Røa Line and the Sognsvann Line were both upgraded in 1939. On 6 July, the section from Makrellbekken to Røa was upgraded to double track, and later Volvat was moved and placed inside a tunnel. A <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> was {{built at the}} intersection with Sørkedalsveien, and was completed on 15 December.|$|E

40|$|During the {{adiabatic}} time evolution <b>levels</b> <b>crossing</b> {{violates the}} adiabaticity and makes transitions between levels possible. Conventionally only two energy <b>levels</b> <b>cross</b> simultaneously. The transition probabilities for this case were found by Landau and Zener. However, the multilevel crossing happens systematically rather than occasionally if the Hamiltonian possesses a special symmetry. The simplest physical {{realization of the}} multilevel crossing are the Zeeman multiplet in a varying magnetic field and an electron in one-dimensional chain driven by the time-dependent electric field. We present asymptotics of the transition amplitudes {{for these kinds of}} the multilevel crossing. They are based on an exact solution for a model n-state, time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

50|$|In 1980, US 220 {{was moved}} onto new freeway between Steeds and Emery, its old {{alignment}} became US 220 Alternate. Between 1981-1983, US 220 moved onto new freeway from <b>Level</b> <b>Cross</b> to Interstate 85, leaving an unnumbered Randleman Road.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} on an {{alignment}} of approximately 160 degrees, curving towards the south. There is a single -long platform which serves trains in both directions, situated {{on the east side}} of the track. The station's western platform was abandoned in 1970 and is overgrown. A user-worked <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> at the north end of the station allows vehicles and pedestrians to cross the railway, alternatively pedestrians may cross the line using a footpath which goes under the bridge over the River Trym.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish <b>level</b> <b>crossing</b> on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E
