5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> {{of the city in}} a postwar style, often at variance with the Georgian style of the city. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into Bath to enable the development of further housing, much of it council housing such as the Whiteway estate.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. <b>Large</b> <b>areas</b> of open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E

5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> of shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues {{and the end}} products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E

Manou injured 85 and killed 89people throughout Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{has been}} a problem along the Scarborough Bluffs. Properties located near the brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears back away from the lake. Since the 1980s, <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> of beach {{at the base of the}} Bluffs have been {{reinforced}} with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> in Northern Norway {{needed to be}} rebuilt.
