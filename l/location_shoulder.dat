40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the severity of deformities in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis contributes to patients&# 8217; decision regarding whether to undergo an operation. METHODS: We evaluated body image factors in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. We evaluated the magnitude of the main scoliotic curve, gibbosity (magnitude and <b>location),</b> <b>shoulder</b> height asymmetry and patient&# 8217;s age. We analyzed the correlation of these data with the number of years the patient was willing to trade for surgery, as measured by the time-trade-off method. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were studied. We did not find a correlation between any of the parameters that were studied and the number of years that the patient would trade for the surgery.

40|$|Recent {{research}} studies have investigated increases in accident rates related to high occupancy vehicle (HOV) freeway lanes. Accidents {{were found to}} be concentrated at ingress/egress locations for barrier- or buffer-separated HOV lanes. However, in Northern California, HOV lanes on freeways are contiguous. That is, the HOV lane is immediately adjacent to the other lanes of traffic so that entering and exiting the HOV lane occurs at the driver’s discretion along its entire length. Given the different operational characteristics, changes to accident rates with the addition of contiguous HOV lanes may be different than those reported for barrier- or buffer-separated HOV lanes. To determine the changes to accident rates {{with the addition of a}} contiguous HOV lane, accident data from before and after the construction of HOV lanes were compared for two freeway corridors in the Sacramento area.

40|$|International audienceSeven female elite gymnasts {{performed}} backward giant {{circles on}} the high bar under different conditions of loading. The magnitude (2 or 4 kg) and <b>location</b> (<b>shoulders,</b> waist, and ankles) of load systematically influenced the overall swing duration {{as well as the}} relative timing of movements at the joints. An analysis of the mechanical constraints operating suggested that the gymnast should be considered as a pendulum of variable length. Increasing and decreasing pendulum length at appropriate phases of the swing effectively allows energy to be injected into the system, thereby compensating the energy lost to friction. A sharp negative peak in the relative rate of change of pendulum length, characteristic of the upward swing phase of all gymnasts, was found to invariably occur at a particular value of the first-order time-to-closure of the body orientation gap with respect to the vertical. The presence of this invariant suggested that the gymnasts organize their behavior on the basis of such a first-order temporal relation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Within an area, {{habituation}} and sensitization represent well-established modulatory {{effects to}} repetitive noxious input. Less is known regarding the nociceptive conditioning effects between body sites – i. e., how stimulating one site may affect another. Therefore, we investigated {{the effects of}} nociceptive stimulation of anatomically distinct <b>locations</b> (<b>shoulder</b> and hand) on pain rating and evoked potentials (i. e., contact heat-evoked potentials). Methods: The effect of stimulation order was assessed in eight healthy subjects. The shoulder was examined before the hand or the hand before the shoulder. All subjects underwent both conditions (shoulder before hand and hand before shoulder) on separate days. In an additional 30 subjects (total n[*]=[*] 38), between retesting the shoulder or the hand, conditioning stimulation in the respective other location (i. e., hand or shoulder) was applied. Both analyses focused upon changes in the magnitude of evoked pain responses {{in relation to the}} respective area being conditioned by heterotopic stimulation. Results: When the shoulder was stimulated before the hand, N 2 P 2 amplitude was significantly reduced. In contrast, stimulating the hand before the shoulder resulted in significant response increments (shorter N 2 latency). Additionally, conditioning stimulation of the hand resulted in increased pain rating to shoulder stimulation. Conclusions: Overall, these findings indicate that response modulation to noxious contact heat stimulation depends upon conditioning stimulus location. These effects represent changes beyond conventional habituation due to repeated stimulation in the same area...|$|R

Methods: Ten people with a history of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation and 15 with healthy shoulders volunteered for this study. After viewing targets in space, participants pointed with the unconstrained arm to remembered target locations in space without visual guidance. Nine different targets were located in various planes and heights. Endpoint reaching errors were determined by comparing the finger endpoint position without visual guidance to the target <b>location.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> rotation angle at the endpoint was also compared between groups. Results: Participants with injured shoulders were able to point voluntarily to visually specified targets as accurately as participants with healthy shoulders (1 cm difference). However, participants with injured shoulders showed less shoulder external rotation (average 12 ° difference) at the target location when compared with healthy shoulders. This difference was consistent over a large range of target locations. Conclusion: Individuals with a history of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation have sufficient kinesthetic information about their upper limb orientation to point accurately to visually specified targets in space. However, individuals with injured shoulders acquired a new motor strategy to reach with less shoulder external rotation, presumably to protect the injured shoulder from recurrent injuries.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to suggest {{appropriate}} human model for ergonomic evaluation considering working postures on 3 D space. Background: Traditionally extreme design rules have been widely utilized at the stage of designing products. Body size of 5 th percentile and 95 th percentile in stature has been generally selected for controllability and clearance evaluation, respectively. However, these rules had limitations in reflecting working posture in ergonomic evaluation. Method: In order to define working posture on 3 D space, not only sagittal plane but also lateral plane was considered. Kinematic linkage body model was utilized for representation of working posture. By utilizing the anthropometric data of 2, 836 South Korean male populations, the point cloud for end points of linkage models was derived. The individuals who were lacking in certain controllability were selected as human models for the evaluation. Result: In case of standing posture it was found that conventional approach is proper for all controllability evaluations. Contrary to standing posture, tall people had less controllability on control <b>location</b> below <b>shoulder</b> point in sitting posture. Conclusion: From the derived proper range on controllability, ergonomic evaluation rule was suggested according to working posture especially in standing and sitting.

40|$|Many studies {{report a}} female {{predominance}} in {{the prevalence of}} chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) but the mechanisms explaining these sex differences are poorly understood. Data from a random postal questionnaire survey in the Dutch general population were used to examine whether sex differences in the prevalences of CMP are due to sex differences {{in the distribution of}} known potential risk factors for CMP (exposure model) and/or to the different importance of risk factors for CMP (i. e. show different strength of association) in men and women (vulnerability model). In the present analyses, 909 men and 1178 women aged 25 - 65 were included. CMP was defined as pain lasting longer than 3 months and was assessed for 10 anatomical <b>locations</b> (neck, <b>shoulder,</b> higher back, elbow, wrist/hand, lower back, hip, knee, ankle, foot). Sex differences in CMP could not be explained by a different distribution of age, educational level, smoking status, overweight, physical activity, and pain catastrophizing. Having no paid job was associated with CMP, explaining part of the sex differences, but its role seems complex. Risk factors with a sex-specific association were: overweight (all pain locations) and older age (lower extremities) - both having only an effect among women - and pain catastrophizing (upper extremities), which was stronger associated with CMP among men than among women. In conclusion, sex differences in prevalence of CMP may partly be explained by sex differences in vulnerability to risk factors for CMP. Future research towards sex-specific identification of risk factors for CMP is warranted. Eventually this may lead to sex-specific prevention and management of CMP...|$|R

The flattened forelimbs {{would likely}} have acted as hydrofoils. The hindlimbs show less specialization, and may therefore have acted as stabilizers and control surfaces, such as is seen in extant sea turtles. The intermediate nature of the limb morphology implies that there was also, to some extent, the kind of 'crawling through the water' seen in small freshwater turtles. The powerfully built pectoral girdle allowed for the attachment of strong muscles, but their <b>location</b> beneath the <b>shoulder</b> favours the underwater flight model. Despite the specialization of the limbs, the tail also shows adaptations to an aquatic existence. Lateral transverse processes of the anterior caudal vertebrae show that powerful muscles enabled the tail to beat or at least undulate from side to side.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{epidemiology}} {{of acute}} orthopedic dislocations is poorly understood. A nationwide database provides {{a valuable resource}} for examining this issue in the Taiwanese population. Methods A 6 -year retrospective cohort study of 1, 000, 000 randomly-sampled beneficiaries from the year 2005 {{was used as the}} original population. Based on the hospitalized and ambulatory data, the concomitant ICD 9 -CM diagnosis codes and treatment codes were evaluated and classified into 8 and 3 major categories, respectively. The cases matching both inclusive criteria of dislocation-related diagnosis codes and treatment codes were defined as incident cases. Results During 2000 - 2005, the estimated annual incidence (per 100, 000 population) of total orthopedic dislocations in Taiwan was 42. 1 (95 %CI: 38. 1 - 46. 1). The major cause of these orthopedic dislocations was traffic accidents (57. 4 %), followed by accident falls (27. 5 %). The annual incidence dislocation by <b>location</b> was <b>shoulder,</b> 15. 3; elbow, 7. 7; wrist, 3. 5; finger, 4. 6; hip, 5. 2; knee, 1. 4; ankle, 2. 0; and foot, 2. 4. Approximately 16 % of shoulder dislocations occurred with other concomitant fractures, compared with 17 %, 53 %, 16 %, 76 % and 52 %, respectively, of dislocated elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle cases. Including both simple and complex dislocated cases, the mean medical cost was US$ 612 for treatment of a shoulder dislocation, $ 504 for the elbow, $ 1, 232 for the wrist, $ 1, 103 for the hip, $ 1, 888 for the knee, and $ 1, 248 for the ankle. Conclusions In Taiwan, three-quarters of all orthopedic dislocations were of the upper limbs. The most common complex fracture-dislocation was of the knee, followed by the wrist and the ankle. Those usually needed a treatment combined with open reduction of fractures and resulted in a higher direct medical expenditure. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel kinematic {{reconstruction of the}} human arm chain with five degrees of freedom and the estimation of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>location</b> during rehabilitation therapy assisted by end-effector robotic devices. This algorithm {{is based on the}} pseudoinverse of the Jacobian through the acceleration of the upper arm, measured using an accelerometer, and the orientation of the shoulder, estimated with a magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) device. The results show a high accuracy in terms of arm joints and shoulder movement with respect to the real arm measured through an optoelectronic system. Furthermore, the range of motion (ROM) of 50 healthy subjects is studied from two different trials, one trying to avoid shoulder movements and the second one forcing them. Moreover, the shoulder movement in the second trial is also estimated accurately. Besides the fact that the posture of the patient can be corrected during the exercise, the therapist could use the presented algorithm as an objective assessment tool. In conclusion, the joints’ estimation enables a better adjustment of the therapy, taking into account the needs of the patient, and consequently, the arm motion improves faster...|$|R

40|$|Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) {{typically}} affects relatively young, active {{patients and}} frequently follows an unrelenting course resulting in considerable loss of function. In human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, ONFH {{is a growing}} problem. Etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of ONFH in these patients remain controversial. We analyzed retrospectively patients with ONFH {{in a series of}} 815 patients followed in our AIDS reference center. Six patients out of the 815 were affected by ONFH (0. 74 %). The sex ratio was 1. Two of the six patients (33. 3 %) had no evidence of risk factor, whereas four patients (66. 6 %) had risk factors. One patient had three cumulated risk factors which were corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. For this patient, the onset time for ONFH was shorter (36 months). It is difficult to attribute the effect to any single class of antiretroviral agents because combination therapy is standard of care, and a change in therapies is common. All classes of antiretroviral drugs have been used: protease inhibitors (mean use duration of 15. 2 months before the ONFH onset), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (12 months), and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (40. 5 months). ONFH was bilateral in four cases (66. 6 %) and unilateral in two cases (33. 3 %). One patient had other osteonecrosis <b>location</b> (both <b>shoulders).</b> ONFH was classified on plain radiography stage IV in five patients and stage III in one patient.

HypothesisComplete coracoacromial ligament section can be performed under ultrasound, without lesion to surrounding structures. Materials and methodsThe coracoacromial ligament was sectioned on the coracoid side, under ultrasound navigation, in 10 cadavers donated to science: i. e. 20 <b>shoulders.</b> After ultrasound <b>location</b> of the <b>shoulder</b> structures, sectioning was performed with a skin incision {{at the level of the}} deltopectoral sulcus. Secondary surgical control checked conservation of the acromial branch of the thoracoacromial artery, and the quality of the procedure. ResultsMean surgery duration was 18. 5 minutes (± 5 min). Seventeen sections were complete (85 %). Artery location was hampered by the impossibility of using Doppler on these cadavers, yet even so there were only 2 vascular lesions. There were no accidental rotator cuff or cartilaginous lesions. ConclusionThis relatively non-invasive technique is quick and less heavy than open surgery, opening up new treatment perspectives. It could be indicated in coracoid and subacromial impingement before opting for surgery, or as a complement to surgery. It does, however, involve a learning curve and requires solid ultrasound skills...|$|R

Methods: Between July 1982 and September 1997, 202 adult patients with primary high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity {{were treated with}} limb-sparing surgery and adjuvant brachytherapy. All patients underwent complete gross resection, but the margin of resection was microscopically positive in 18 % of patients. The median dose of brachytherapy was 45 Gy delivered over 5 days. Tumors located in the shoulder or groin were defined as central location. Complications were assessed in terms of wound complications, bone fracture, and peripheral nerve damage. Results: With a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5 -year local control, distant relapse–free survival, and overall survival rates were 84 %, 63 %, and 70 %, respectively. On multivariate analysis, poor local control correlated with <b>shoulder</b> <b>location,</b> positive microscopic margins of resection, and nonshoulder upper extremity site.

Various forms of proximal anchor and intra–articular route, important for the correct interpretation of its contribution to the pathology of the shoulder {{as well as the}} treatment methodology, are described. Knowledge of its biomechanics results mainly from cadaveric studies that contradict each other. Already the few studies in vivo indicate a depressant and stabilizing action, anterior, for the humeral head. Its pathology is rarely isolated because it is almost always correlated with rotator cuff or labrum pathology. It can be divided into 3 major groups (inflammatory, instability and traumatic) and subdivided according to its <b>location.</b> The anterior <b>shoulder</b> pain is the initial symptom of pathology of LHB Its perfect characterization is dependent on the associated injuries.

40|$|Freeways are {{arterial}} highways {{characterized by}} {{high levels of}} safety and high speed vehicular traffic. Access {{to and from the}} freeways is provided through ramps. Geometric elements making up freeway facilities include the roadway, median shoulders, grades, and ramps to and from the traveled way at selected <b>locations,</b> <b>shoulders,</b> radius of curvature, lane width, and speed-change lanes. With the increase of traffic using the freeway systems, there arises more traffic weaving movements within the elements making up the freeway systems. This causes traffic flow to compete at the limited spaces available and reduces safety performance of freeway system. In studies on safety issues of freeway systems, geometric elements of freeways have been evaluated for their safety effects on crashes occurring on the freeways. These studies have included interchange spacing, number of through lanes, median shoulder width and type, ramp spacing, length of segment, speed change lanes, and lengths for limited and extended lanes. Their findings revealed that freeway safety issues are associated with freeway geometric characteristics. However, the previous studies did not consider the safety impact of all segment types on the crash frequency on freeways. This study observed four types of segments when a freeway is divided into segments with Exit and Entry terminals. These segments were defined as EN-EN, EX-EX, EN-EX, EX-EN segments where 2 ̆ 2 EX 2 ̆ 2 stands for Exit from the freeway and 2 ̆ 2 EN 2 ̆ 2 stands for Entrance to the freeway. The study also extends types of weaving movements taking place in weaving segments. Crash rate and severity models were developed in this study based on the data collected for every freeway segment type. A complete set of geometric data was included in the data for each freeway segment type. Models for individual freeway segment type (EN-EN, EX-EX, EN-EX, and EX-EN) were developed. The results indicated that for EN-EN segment type; only two freeway characteristics had an impact: median width and segment length. Wider median and long segments both reduced crash while they were insignificant for severity model. For EX-EX segment type, the number of through lanes, median width, and AADT had an impact on average crash rate while for a severity model, only the number of through lanes had an impact. Specifically, it was found that, the number of through lanes reduced both average crash rate and high severity crashes when all through lanes were combined together. However, on individual segment type in a specific freeway, it was found that, the number of through lanes on I- 15 increased average crash rate while they reduced average crash rate on I- 215. Wider median reduced average crash rate while it increased high severity crashes. Traffic volume increased average crash rate while it was found insignificant on severity model. At a freeway level, EX-EX segment type reduced average crash rate compared to both I- 215 and US 95 while it reduced average crash rate for I- 215 compared to I- 15 and US 95. For EN-EX segment type, shoulder width {{had a significant impact on}} average crash rates while the number of through lanes, median width, length of segment, and curve radius indicated significant impact on severity crashes. Wider shoulders on I- 15 reduced average crash rate. The number of through lanes increased high severity crashes when all number of lanes were combined together. However, on individual freeways, the number of through lanes on reduced high severity crashes while they were insignificant on I- 215 and US 95. Wider median increased high severity crashes when all freeways were combined together while they reduced high severity crashes on I- 15. Long segment increased high severity crashes when all EN-EX segment type from all freeways was combined together. Segments with large radius of curvature reduced high severity crashes when all for combined freeways while they increased high severity crashes for I- 15. At a freeway level, I- 15 increased both average crash rate and high severity crashes compared to I- 215 and US 95. For EX-EN segments, shoulder and AADT had a significant impact on average crash rate while the number of through lanes, median width, radius curvature and lane changes from ramp-to-freeway had a significant impact on severity crashes. Wider shoulder reduced average crash rate for combined data from all freeways but increased crash rate on I- 215. Wider median increased high severity crashes for combined data from all freeways while they were insignificant on average crash rate models. Segments with large radius of curvature increased high severity crashes while it was insignificant on average crash rate model. Lane changes from ramp-to-freeway increased high severity crashes.

The aim of this study is to describe the global percutaneous shuttling (GPS) technique and report our results using this method. The GPS technique can be used for any full thickness rotator cuff tear and is particularly useful for massive cuff tears with poor tissue quality. We recently followed up 22 patients with an average follow up of 32 months to validate its usefulness. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved significantly from 37 preoperatively to 90 postoperatively (P< 0. 0001). This data supports the use of the GPS technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Further biomechanical studies are currently being performed to assess the improvements in tendon footprint area with this technique...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{osteochondromatosis}} {{is a rare}} {{synovial tissue}} metaplasia. The <b>location</b> at the <b>shoulder</b> is very rare. Bursal affection is exceptional. Case presentationWe report {{a case of a}} male, 41 years old living in north Morocco and presenting to the rheumatology outpatient clinic at Fes Hassan II University Hospital with a swelling of the right shoulder that had been evolving for two years, without any history of trauma, gradually increasing in size, without fever or alteration of the general state. Clinical examination revealed a 5 cm soft, non-tender oval mass on the anterior surface of the right shoulder with no signs of inflammation but limited range of motion. Plain X-ray was normal and diagnostic ultrasonography revealed an avascular multilocular cystic mass. A differential diagnosis was considered and other conditions with comparable pictures were ruled out. The diagnosis was confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging showing synovitis and distension of the sub acromiodeltoid bursa with many rounded bodies, few millimeters in size of intermediate signal in T 1 and T 2 without enhancement after intravenous gadolinium. A diagnosis of osteochondromatosis of the subacromiodeltoid bursa (third stage) was made. The patient underwent an open bursectomy and histological examination further verified the diagnosis. ConclusionPresenting such rare cases could help in raising the awareness of rheumatologists regarding such conditions when considering a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with monoarticluar shoulder swelling. Excision of the tumor has a remarkably better prognosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis is to design an integrated system for the automatic acquisition of a human body model, using input images from mutually orthogonal views. The model consists of two sets of free-form surface patches: the torso and its arms. We determine a neck joint on the torso and six joint positions on the arms (i. e., one <b>location</b> for each <b>shoulder,</b> elbow and wrist). A conventional three-dimensional reconstruction technique called “shape from silhouettes ” is applied in the project. However, {{one of the challenges}} of the project is to automatically separate the body segments during the reconstruc-tion of the model from occluded silhouettes. The system suggests a body part localization procedure to determine the joint positions through the analysis of a feature view of body poses. Furthermore, this virtual human model is capable of simulating the motion of a real person using a-priori knowledge of the body. The human model will be specified using Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) and visualized and rendered in a scene graph system, OpenSG. i Acknowledgments I would like to give my thanks to all of those people who supported me through my research. I wish to thank Alistair Niall for his technical support. Especially, I wish to thank my supervisors: Dr. Bodo Rosenhahn and Prof. Reinhard Klette for their guidance, encouragement and patience during the development of this thesis. i...|$|R
40|$|We present {{three-dimensional}} hydrodynamic {{simulations of}} jets {{as a model}} for protostellar outflows. We investigate molecular jets which are initially heavier, equal or lighter than a uniform ambient molecular medium, as well as a ballistic atomic jet, with the aim of distinguishing the resulting structures and relating them to various proposed protostellar evolutionary stages. We modify the ZEUS numerical code, to include time-dependent molecular hydrogen chemistry, a limited equilibrium C and O chemistry, and a detailed cooling function. We find highly focussed and accelerated flow patterns for outflows driven by molecular jets, caused by the combined strong cooling, small imposed jet shear and precession. We also find shoulders in the interface with associated shocks visible in our simulated near-infrared H 2 images. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>location</b> relative {{to the front of the}} bow shock distinguishes the relative density. Apart from this, the outflow structures are quite similar provided the jet is molecular. The ratio of jet power to H 2 1 - 0 S(1) line luminosity (increasingly required to interpret observations), is generally in the range 80 - 600. Sub-millimetre CO properties, including a velocity-position and velocity-channel diagram; are presented. We compare mass-velocity relationships derived directly and via the simulated CO data: significant systematic differences are uncovered. For the future, we identify fine-scale structure in the rotational CO 2 - 1 and CO 14 - 13 rotational lines which can be resolved with the millimetre array ALMA and the Herschel (FIRST) Observatory. We identify highly collimated outflows in the near-infrared that can be interpreted by this model...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{authors have}} {{analyzed}} {{the incidence of}} injuries in team handball, {{but there is a}} lack of knowledge concerning professional handball and especially for men. The aim of this study is to review the literature and analyze the incidence, circumstances and characteristics of handball injuries in men’s elite handball. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed is used. In general only results from men’s elite handball are included, but a few exceptions are made when it comes to studies where the results are not separated between the different groups. When comparing studies one must be aware that the definition of an injury might differ. Results: The highest incidence of injuries is reported in major international tournaments with 1. 2 - 2. 7 injuries/match and 89 - 129 injuries/ 1000 match hours. ACL injuries specifically have an incidence of 0. 24 ± 0. 09 injuries/ 1000 match hours. About 40 % of all injuries that need medical treatment are caused by overuse and the most common <b>locations</b> are the <b>shoulder</b> and knee. Some studies have showed that up to 30 % of all injuries were classified as major with a time loss over 28 days. Discussion: There is a larger risk of sustaining an injury during matches than training and there are more injuries as the performance level increases. However, more research is needed in elite male handball and especially concerning overuse injuries and injuries to the head. With sufficient information about the total burden, injury types and mechanisms, it has been shown that prevention programs based on this information can reduce the injury incidence...|$|R
40|$|Participation in {{whitewater}} kayaking {{is growing}} faster than any other outdoor recreational pursuit. With increases in participation, {{an increase in the}} number of injuries associated with whitewater kayaking may also become apparent. Overuse injuries are the most prevalent type of injury found in whitewater kayakers. Due the large range of motion and forces that occur through the shoulder while kayaking, the most common injury <b>location</b> is the <b>shoulder.</b> Little scientific inquiry has been performed assessing the kinematics of kayaking and the musculoskeletal attributes of these athletes. Sixteen whitewater kayakers with shoulder pain and sixteen whitewater kayakers without shoulder pain participated in this study. Each subject underwent kinematic and electromyographic analysis of the forward kayak stroke. Additionally, participants underwent clinical examination of shoulder injury, clinical assessment of shoulder and torso range of motion, posterior shoulder tightness assessment, isokinetic strength testing at the shoulder, and a scapular kinematic evaluation during a standardized humeral elevation task. The most common type of injury found was related to overuse. Statistical comparisons occurred between the involved and uninvolved limb in the shoulder pain group and between the involved and uninvolved and matching shoulders in the control group, respectively. Significant differences were found between in involved and uninvolved shoulder for shoulder internal rotation and abduction range of motion. Additional differences were found for these variables between the involved shoulder in the pain group and the matching shoulder in the control group. Kayakers with shoulder pain present with decreased shoulder range of motion on their involved shoulder. Assessment of the specific types of injuries seen in whitewater kayakers should be further evaluated. Additionally, the role of increasing range of motion through injury prevention programs in whitewater kayakers with shoulder pain should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Classically, studies {{adopting}} non-invasive transcranial {{electrical stimulation}} have placed greater importance on {{the position of}} the primary "stimulating" electrode than the secondary "reference" electrode. However, recent current density modeling suggests that ascribing a neutral role to the reference electrode may prove an inappropriate oversimplification. HYPOTHESIS: We set out to test the hypothesis that the behavioral effects of transcranial electrical stimulation are critically dependent on {{the position of the}} return ("reference") electrode. METHODS: We examined the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation (sinusoidal waveform with no direct current offset at a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2000  μA and a frequency matched to each participant's peak tremor frequency) on physiological tremor in a group of healthy volunteers (N =  12). We implemented a sham-controlled experimental protocol where the position of the stimulating electrode remained fixed, overlying primary motor cortex, whilst the position of the return electrode varied between two cephalic (fronto-orbital and contralateral primary motor cortex) and two extracephalic (ipsilateral and contralateral <b>shoulder)</b> <b>locations.</b> We additionally controlled for the role of phosphenes in influencing motor output by assessing the response of tremor to photic stimulation, through self-reported phosphene ratings. RESULTS: Altering only the position of the return electrode had a profound behavioral effect: only the montage with extracephalic return contralateral to the primary stimulating electrode significantly entrained physiological tremor (15. 9 % ±  6. 1 % increase in phase stability, 1  S. E. M.). Photic stimulation also entrained tremor (11. 7 % ±  5. 1 % increase in phase stability). Furthermore, the effects of electrical stimulation are distinct from those produced from direct phosphene induction, in that the latter were only seen with the fronto-orbital montage that did not affect the tremor. CONCLUSION: The behavioral effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation appear to be critically dependent on the position of the reference electrode, highlighting the importance of electrode montage when designing experimental and therapeutic protocols...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} paleogeographic {{database of}} the African plate during MesoCenozoic times. Our {{objective is to}} quantify the paleoelevations, and then uplift variations on the continental domain. We first map the shoreline, the bayline, the type of continental systems. We also compile the paleocurrents data available on the fluvial deposits. We define the main river catchments and their divides, based on the paleocurrents data {{and the location of}} the river mouths on both lakes and seas. We integrate the boundary conditions such as plate kinematics and magmatism (a magmatism database is also compiled). We define the <b>location</b> of rift <b>shoulders,</b> highs of volcanic arcs, mountain belts, and plateau associated with flood basalts or any other magmatic activity (alkaline small province, kimberlites [...] .). The main tectonic events responsible of relief creations were during: (1) the Late Kimmeridgian-Early Tithonian (155 - 150 My), (2) the intra Berriasian (145 - 140 My?), (3) the Austrian deformations (e. g. 130 - 125 My), (4) the Late Albian to Cenomanian (100 - 94 My), (5) the Turonian to Maastrichtian (90 - 65 My) with a paroxysm at the Santonian/Campanian boundary (84 My), (6) the Oligocene-Early Miocene (34 - 16 My). The topography of Africa during Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous is mainly controlled by a very long wavelength deformation (x 1000 km) showing a maximum in the middle part of North Africa (Mauritania to Sudan) and South Africa and a minimum along the Congo "trough" corresponding to a large lake base-level. This pattern is strongly modified during the Late Cretaceous time by the uplift of the Congo "trough" (Senonian deformations). The last period of uplift occurred during Oligocene and Early Miocene times. These very long wavelength deformations are directly related to the mantle dynamics beneath Africa...|$|R
