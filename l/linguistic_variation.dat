Ojibwe is an indigenous language of the Algonquian language family spoken in Canada and the United States in the areas surrounding the Great Lakes, and westward onto the northern plains in both countries, as well as in northeastern Ontario and northwestern Quebec. The article on Ojibwe dialects discusses <b>linguistic</b> <b>variation</b> in more detail, and contains links to separate articles on each dialect. There is no standard language and no dialect that is accepted as representing a standard. [...] Ojibwe words in this article are written in the practical orthography commonly known as [...] the Double vowel system.|$|E

40|$|STUDENT NO: 9811739 R MASTERS HUMANITIESABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate how <b>linguistic</b> <b>variations</b> in a literary text can be translated by analysing and comparing the strategies employed by two different French translators when dealing with the works of the Italian author, Andrea Camilleri. Much has been written about the possibility/ impossibility of translation itself, with many writers and critics taking opposing sides on the issue. The intention of this study is not to fuel or further this, in our view, sterile discussion. The point is that translations do exist and have existed for thousands of years: that is, texts in one (source) language have in some way been recreated and rewritten into another (target) language 1. By contrast, what has been explored only superficially is how <b>linguistic</b> <b>variations</b> and dialects present in literary texts have been reproduced in the target language. Textual analyses relative to this study will be carried out on selected passages of two different novels (one for each translator). 1 The abbreviations SL and TL will be used to indicate ‘source language’ and ‘target language’ respectively, while ST and TT will be used to indicate ‘target text’ and ‘source text’...|$|R

This paper presents the first study towards Turkish paraphrase alignment. We perform an analysis of different types of paraphrases on a modest Turkish paraphrase corpus and present preliminary results on that analysis from different standpoints. We also explore the impact of human interpretation of paraphrasing on the alignment of paraphrase sentence pairs. ...|$|R

Due to the research of Lai experts in the Chin State, a very interesting flow of adjectives and adverbs has been discovered, {{paving the way for}} a better understanding of Lai grammar. Despite this, much of the structure of these languages is still unknown, and they are still under debate by linguistic experts.|$|R
