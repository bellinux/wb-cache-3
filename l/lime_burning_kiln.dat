50|$|The name Penruddock is Cumbric. With both red {{soil and}} red {{sandstone}} {{in the area}} to the south, the word Penruddock is likely derived from the word Pen (hill) and a derivative of the word rhudd (red). Red Hill is also believed to be the translation of the word Penrith and an area called Redhills now lies between the two. The village of Penruddock itself is situated over limestone which is visible in many places, with craggy outcrops and a limestone pavement on the eastern boundary, and the remains of an ancient <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> <b>kiln</b> on the north western boundary. The soil over the limestone is a fairly heavy clay which retains water, with the result that it helps keep vegetation alive during times of drought, but creates very wet conditions for long periods during the winter months.|$|E
50|$|Haltwhistle was {{a market}} {{town for the}} {{exchange}} of local goods. In the 18th century two Quakers set up a baize manufactury {{and there was a}} weaving establishment. On the Haltwhistle Burn were fulling mills, dyeing and spinning mills. A walk along this stream to the Roman Wall, shows that {{it must have been a}} hive of industry with quarries, coal mining and <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> <b>kilns.</b> The Directory of 1822 (Pigot) gives a whole range of craftsmen, shopkeepers and traders—60 in number, including makers of clogs. The weekly market was held on Thursdays and there were fairs on 14 May and 22 November for cattle and sheep.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1838, Hawthorne had visited North Adams, Massachusetts and climbed Mount Greylock several times. His {{experiences}} there, specifically a walk he took at midnight where he saw a <b>burning</b> <b>lime</b> <b>kiln,</b> inspired his story, originally titled [...] "The Unpardonable Sin". Hawthorne had not written tales since 1844 when he wrote [...] "Ethan Brand" [...] {{in the winter of}} 1848-1849.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rocks at}} the {{entrance}} to Solva Harbour made {{it one of the most}} sheltered anchorages between Fishguard and Milford Haven. [...] Solva became the main trading centre of St Bride's Bay in the medieval period, and was important for <b>lime</b> <b>burning.</b> Several <b>lime</b> <b>kilns</b> are preserved in the harbour area. In the 19th century, Solva had around 30 registered trading ships. [...] The fading coastal trade has been replaced by tourism, and the harbour is now a popular boating centre.|$|R
40|$|Lime is a {{fundamental}} component in many industrial, agricultural and chemical processes, and is itself produced by an industrial process, namely, the heating in kilns (calcining, or more colloquially ‘burning’) of calcium carbonate rock or other carbonate material. Research and literature on <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> in Scotland, based largely on lime production in Scotland's eastern Central Belt, are dominated by the view that <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> in draw <b>kilns</b> is the paradigm for Scottish lime production. Other parts of Scotland, however, largely or completely ignored, draw kilns in favour of simpler clamp kilns, even in major industrial sites of lime production. This paper reports our map- and field-based surveys in Scotland's western Central Belt, which clearly point to the enduring importance and almost exclusive use of clamp kilns in that area's historical lime-burning industry...|$|R

His {{experiences}} here, especially a walk he took at midnight where he saw a <b>burning</b> <b>lime</b> <b>kiln,</b> inspired this story, originally titled [...] "The Unpardonable Sin". Hawthorne had not written tales since 1844 when he wrote [...] "Ethan Brand" [...] {{in the winter of}} 1848-1849. He admitted he had difficulty writing it. He wrote: I have wrenched and torn an idea out of my miserable brain, or rather, the fragment of an idea, like a tooth ill-drawn and leaving the roots to torture me. [...] Hawthorne had planned a lengthy tale about Brand's life and his travels in search of the [...] "Unpardonable Sin" [...] but published only this, most of which would have formed the climactic chapter.|$|R
2500|$|Clay {{had some}} success against privateers during his time in command, {{capturing}} the 2-gun Danish privateer Norwegian Girl on 26 October 1810. Clay then returned to Leith in December 1810 after a month cruising off the Norwegian coast, in company with the 32-gun [...] Returning at night the two frigates had difficulty distinguishing their exact location, and the pilot aboard Nymphe mistook {{the light of a}} <b>lime</b> <b>kiln</b> <b>burning</b> at Broxmouth, for the signal light marking the Isle of May. Though the May light was visible, it was instead mistaken for the Bell Rock light. The master of Nymphe agreed with the pilot, with the consequence that both frigates ran aground {{at the entrance to the}} Firth of Forth on the night of 18 December, with the Nymphe striking a rock known as the Devil's Ark, near Skethard. Both Pallas and Nymphe had to be abandoned. The crew of Nymphe were taken off without loss of life. [...] Clay received the customary court martial for the loss of his ship. The court acquitted Clay and his officers of blame for the loss, instead placing responsibility on the master, Mr G. Scott and the pilot, Mr C. Gascoigne, determining that they had been 'very incautious', and severely reprimanding both.|$|R
50|$|Brockram {{has been}} used as a {{building}} material in Kirkby Stephen and the rest of the Vale of Eden where it has also been quarried for <b>lime</b> <b>burning.</b>|$|R
40|$|During the {{operation}} of certain older types of annular shaft <b>kilns</b> used for <b>lime</b> <b>burning,</b> one may encounter the dilemma of how to operate the kiln at an optimal air excess ratio. Due to excessively high temperatures in the combustion chambers at optimal air excess ratio, the flame must be cooled witha greater amount of relatively cold secondary air. This results in greaterheat loss with the exhaust kiln gas (stack losses), greater fuel consumption and lower kiln efficiency. The effects of increasing air excess ratio {{during the process of}} <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> in an annular shaft kiln are specifically analysed. The paper presents a case of a remodelled annular shaftkiln, in which the air excess ratio can be reduced to its optimal level by recirculation of recuperator waste gas and its injection into the combustion chambers. This also reduces stack losses, while the temperatures inthe combustion chambers remain within the permissible range, which means that the specific energy consumption for <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> is reduced...|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{is mostly}} lower Lias Group clays and limestone. In {{the second half}} of the 19th century an extensive <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> industry was based around the Bishopswood area.|$|R
50|$|The pottery {{was made}} from local clay with a red slip and fired in wood <b>burning</b> <b>kilns</b> which could hold up to 40 {{thousand}} items. More than six hundred pottery workshops {{are known to have}} been in operation, although a few dozen were prominent.|$|R
50|$|Stone {{has been}} quarried for <b>lime</b> <b>burning,</b> {{as well as}} for {{building}} and road making. There was an iron foundry in the 19th century and coal mines — the Bedminster-Ashton coalfield finally closed in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was then}} {{abandoned}} {{and allowed to}} decay. Much of the structure was looted for building stone and for <b>lime</b> <b>burning.</b> Since 1984 Cadw has funded {{a substantial amount of}} restoration performed by the Pembrokeshire National Park Authority.|$|R
25|$|The western plateau, {{also called}} Gerolfinger mountain, has an {{especially}} unspoilt appearance with its sinkhole-like depressions, hedges and shrubs. The depressions were, however, not formed naturally, {{they are the}} result of mining of material for road construction and <b>lime</b> <b>burning.</b>|$|R
25|$|The main use {{of calcium}} {{carbonate}} {{is in the}} construction industry, either as a building material or limestone aggregate for road building or as an ingredient of cement or as the starting material for the preparation of builder's <b>lime</b> by <b>burning</b> in a <b>kiln.</b> However, because of weathering mainly caused by acid rain, calcium carbonate (in limestone form) is no longer used for building purposes on its own, but only as a raw/primary substance for building materials.|$|R
50|$|Born at Disley in Cheshire, he had {{interests}} in coal-mining, {{particularly in the}} Haughton and Hyde areas of Greater Manchester, as well as <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> and mineral extraction interests. He owned land at Disley, Manchester and Heaton Norris and he lived at Ardwick Green, Manchester.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} {{home to one of}} only three {{remaining}} Hoffmann kilns in the British Isles, and the only one with a chimney. The kiln at Llanymynech was used for <b>lime</b> <b>burning.</b> The area around the kiln is designated as the Llanymynech Heritage Area.|$|R
25|$|The Advance was {{originally}} employed between the Tweed River and Sydney {{but when she}} was purchased by Messrs, David Cairncross and William Rooke, she {{was placed in the}} trade between Port Stephens and Botany Bay carrying shells for <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> purposes in which she remained till she has wrecked.|$|R
50|$|The {{stonework}} of Goslar's Zwinger was predominantly made of sandstone quarried {{from the}} Sudmerberg northeast of Goslar and mortared with burnt <b>lime.</b> Because <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> {{was still in}} not fully developed, the builders mixed the mortar with horsehair, quark, goat's milk and ox blood to harden it fully.|$|R
50|$|In 1860, the quay {{was built}} {{and a new}} fish market was opened on 2 August 1862. During the 18th century, the harbour was {{importing}} coal, timber and ice, being unloaded in the inner harbour. Chalk (for <b>lime</b> <b>burning)</b> was being exported. Many of the ships in this export/import trade were registered in Folkestone.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} human {{interaction}} with the reef was in 1838, when Joseph Higgins identified it {{as a source of}} <b>lime.</b> <b>Lime</b> <b>burning</b> at the reef may have first occurred five years earlier. Silas Brown constructed lime kilns in the 1840s which remained in use until 1857. Increase A. Lapham first identified the reef as an area of geological interest in 1844.|$|R
50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{materials}} used to construct an 'original' grouted roof. Clearly Portland and modern cement-based renders have been used most commonly in the last century. Portland cement {{first appeared in the}} 1820s. Before this, lime plasters would have been used, particularly in rural areas where <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> was a local industry through much of the country.|$|R
50|$|Although by {{no means}} {{evidence}} of the earliest <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> undertaken at Moreton Bay, they are rare surviving 19th century lime kiln remains which provide important information about the process and role of lime manufacture in Queensland, and {{have the potential to}} contribute to more exhaustive studies on these topics, to the analysis of kiln type, and to our general understanding of Queensland history.|$|R
50|$|A {{cement and}} lime works {{was at the}} western end of the Polden Hills, at Dunball. It used Blue Lias stone quarried at several {{locations}} in the village, transported to the works on narrow-gauge railways. This area of the Polden Hills was used for quarrying stone and <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> from 1888 until 1973. Quarrying may have taken place on the hillside as early as the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|This {{very small}} site has geological, botanical and archaeological interest. It was disused {{for almost a}} century before being {{opened to the public}} in 1993. It had lime kilns in the Roman period, and was used for {{quarrying}} building stone and rock for <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> {{until the end of the}} nineteenth century. It exposes Jurassic Blisworth Clay, probably laid down in shallow brackish water.|$|R
5000|$|By Slependen station it is a {{lime kiln}} for {{calcination}} from 1914. The ovens exterier was restored in 1982 {{and the interior}} in 1994. The oven is open for tours and exhibition, [...] "Lime Burning in Asker and Bærum". <b>Lime</b> <b>burning</b> was {{a significant source of}} income in Bærum and Asker in the past, and a lime kiln are therefore illustrated in Bærums coat of arms.|$|R
60|$|But I must return, {{and tell}} my readers, {{in a few}} words, the {{chemical}} history of mortar. If limestone be burnt, or rather roasted, in a kiln, the carbonic acid is given off--as you may discover by your own nose; as many a poor tramp has discovered too late, when, on a cold winter night, he has lain down {{by the side of}} the <b>burning</b> <b>kiln</b> to keep himself warm, and woke in the other world, stifled to death by the poisonous fumes.|$|R
50|$|Agricultural lime, {{also called}} aglime, {{agricultural}} limestone, garden lime or liming, is a soil additive made from pulverized limestone or chalk. The primary active component is calcium carbonate. Additional chemicals {{vary depending on}} the mineral source and may include calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and magnesium carbonate. Unlike the types of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide) and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), powdered limestone does not require <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> in a <b>lime</b> kiln; it only requires milling.|$|R
50|$|The canal vastly {{increased}} the facility of bringing lime and sea sand to the agricultural hinterland above Liskeard; in addition coal was brought for <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> and for domestic use. Prices of these commodities fell considerably; however other traffics—particularly downstream traffic {{which would have}} generated return loads—were disappointing. Lime was burnt at Moorswater and elsewhere on the higher reaches of the canal, leading {{to the failure of}} kilns at Sandplace, which lost trade.|$|R
5000|$|The Minera Lime Company {{became a}} limited company in 1865, and this {{prompted}} some heavy cash injection into the works. Using this money, the company erected a [...] "Hoffmann kiln". Originally destined for brickmaking, {{it was soon}} converted to limeburning. This kiln still exists {{and is one of}} three that were purpose-built for <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> left in the UK: another is located at Langcliffe in Yorkshire, another is located at Llanymynech Limeworks.|$|R
5000|$|Rotary kilns of {{the cement}} {{industry}} and classic incineration plants mainly differ {{in terms of}} the combustion conditions prevailing during clinker <b>burning.</b> <b>Kiln</b> feed and rotary kiln exhaust gases are conveyed in counter-flow and mixed thoroughly. Thus, temperature distribution and residence time in rotary kilns afford particularly favourable conditions for organic compounds, introduced either via fuels or derived from them, to be completely destroyed. For that reason, only very low concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (colloquially [...] "dioxins and furans") {{can be found in the}} exhaust gas from cement rotary kilns.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the village, there is a disused quarry marked on Ordnance Survey maps but barely visible due to a copse of trees. This was used for <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> up until 1924/25. The stream running from Horton to Preston Deanery very close to the village on the north side was once the divide between the hamlet of Hackleton and Piddington but in 1935 the {{amalgamation}} of the parishes created the civil parish of Hackleton.|$|R
5000|$|The first land grants {{along the}} river tended to be fairly large and used mostly for grazing and timber with some fishing and <b>lime</b> <b>burning</b> at Botany Bay. Governor Macquarie makes {{reference}} to a slender bridge in his 1810 diary, adding that [...] "the soil is bad and neither good for tillage or pasturage". Nevertheless, some farmers did find they could till the land and settlement {{along the river}} spread, and roads and crossings were made in several places.|$|R
50|$|Marstal is a {{shipping}} town {{founded in the}} 16th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries its living depended predominantly on the building and sailing of wooden ships. In the harbour is a small island Frederiksøen, which today is called the Lime Kiln (Kalkovnen). The impressive fieldstone pier at the island was built in 1825 by local seamen on a voluntary basis. The island was in use as a repair yard for ships, until in 1863 it was rented out for <b>lime</b> <b>burning.</b>|$|R
