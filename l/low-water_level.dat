40|$|The {{potential}} effect of mangrove clearance on nematode assemblage biomass, biomass size spectra (NBSS) and abundance/biomass curves (ABC) {{was investigated in}} three sites representing a varying degree of mangrove clearance {{as well as in}} three stations established at each sites representing high-, mid- and <b>low-water</b> <b>levels.</b> Results revealed significant differences in sediment and nematode characteristics between the three sites. Although both the cleared and the intact mangrove had comparable biomass values, clear differences in biomass size spectra and abundance biomass curves were observed. The results suggested that the variation in the silt fraction and the food quality positively affected the total biomass. Mangrove clearance has caused a shift from a unimodal to a bimodal biomass size spectrum at all water levels, owing to an increase in smaller-bodied opportunistic non-selective deposit feeding nematodes. The ABC further confirmed the effect of clearance by classifying the cleared mangrove as moderately to grossly disturbed...|$|R

To {{better understand the}} influence of mangrove clearance on the intertidal benthic community, we investigated the composition, biodiversity and standing stock of the macrofauna communities at high-, mid- and <b>low-water</b> <b>levels</b> in three contrasting habitats: a bare sand flat, a cleared mangrove and an intact mangrove. In addition, a community-wide metric approach based on taxon-specific carbon and nitrogen isotope values {{was used to compare}} the trophic structure between the three habitats. The habitats differed significantly in terms of macrofaunal standing stock, community composition and trophic structure. The high- and mid-water levels of the intact mangroves showed a distinct macrofaunal community characterized by elevated densities and biomass, largely governed by higher decapod and gastropod abundances. Diversity was similar for cleared and intact mangroves, but much lower for the bare sand flat. Community-wide metrics indicated highest trophic diversity and community niche breadth in the intact mangroves. Differences between the cleared and intact mangroves can be partly attributed to differences in sediment characteristics resulting from mangrove clearance. These results suggest a significant impact of mangrove clearance on the macrofaunal community and trophic structure. This study calls for further investigations and management actions to protect and restore these habitats, and ensure the survival of this ecologically valuable coastal ecosystem...|$|R

The Geo-information and ICT department of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management gathered many experiences in this field during the recent years. The topic {{of this paper is to}} give an overview of the use of laser altimetry for different river management applications. The first subject is floodplain vegetation classification for hydraulic modelling. Laser data adds useful structure information on spectral information for vegetation classification. Furthermore, the potential of laser altimetry for soil volume determination concerning costs and accuracy is discussed. Laser altimetry also offers new possibilities for monitoring of groynes and realistic visualizations of innovative river structures. In addition, the benefit of laser altimetry for the acquisition of detailed DEM’s of the shallow parts of the riverbed in case of extreme <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> is shown. Finally, laser altimetry has been investigated for measuring continuous water levels and wave characteristics such as amplitudes and wavelengths. 1...|$|E
40|$|The tilapia {{fishery in}} a large Mexican {{reservoir}} has declined in recent years, promoting efforts to enhance stock quality in conjunction with feasibility studies for cage aquaculture. Spatial models to optimize cage location have been developed, incorporating aspects of topography, climate, hydrography, water quality and quantity, land use, infrastructure and socioeconomics. Three cage sizes were modelled, 5, 10 and 15 m diameter, for both high- and low-water levels. When full the, reservoir has a total area of 312 km 2 but a reduction in water level of 13 m was recorded between wet and dry seasons, significantly reducing the surface area available for cages to 265 km 2. The results indicate {{a significant difference in}} the availability of sites between seasons. For the small, medium and large cages at high water level, the areas classified as highly suitable or suitable were 151, 184 and 146 km 2, respectively, while at <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> these areas reduced to 113, 88 and 62 km 2.

40|$|In Thornton’s Cave, an estavelle in west-central Florida, SEM, EDS, and XRD data reveal biofilms {{that are}} {{predominantly}} comprised of FeOOH-encrusted hollow sheaths that are overgrown and intercalated with calcite. Fragments of this crystalline biofilm {{adhere to the}} walls and ceiling as water levels vary within the cave. Those on the wall have a ‘cornflake’ appearance and those affixed to the ceiling hang as fibrous membranes. PCR of DNA in the active biofilm, combined with morphologic data from the tubes in SEM micrographs, point to Leptothrix sp., a common Fe-oxidizing bacteria, as the primary organism in the biofilm. Recent discoveries of ‘rusticles’ in other Florida caves suggest that Fe-oxidizing bacteria may reside elsewhere in Florida groundwater and {{may play a role in}} the mobility of trace metals in the Upper Florida aquifer. SEM micrographs from two marble tablets submerged for five months, one exposed to microbial activity and a second isolated from microbial action, revealed no visible etchings or borings and very limited loss of mass. EDS data from the electron micrographs of the unfiltered tablet document the same FeOOH-encrusted hollow sheaths and similar deposits of calcite as seen in the ‘cornflakes’.

Many species of algal epiphytes were early colonizers of canopy removal areas suggesting that competition from canopy algae usually restricts them to an epiphytic habit.

40|$|The {{availability}} of water shapes {{life in the}} western United States, {{and much of the}} water in the region originates in the Rocky Mountains. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the history of water levels in the Rocky Mountains during the Holocene. Here, we examine the past levels of three lakes near the Continental Divide in Montana and Colorado to reconstruct Holocene moisture trends. Using transects of sediment cores and sub-surface geophysical profiles from each lake, we find that mid-Holocene shorelines in the small lakes (4 – 110 ha) were as much as ~ 10 m below the modern lake surfaces. Our results are consistent with existing evidence from other lakes and show that a wide range of settings in the region were much drier than today before 3000 – 2000 years ago. We also discuss evidence for millennial-scale moisture variation, including an abruptly-initiated and -terminated wet period in Colorado from 4400 to 3700 cal yr BP, and find only limited evidence for low-lake stands during the past millennium. The extent of <b>low-water</b> <b>levels</b> during the mid-Holocene, which were most severe and widespread ca. 7000 – 4500 cal yr BP, is consistent with the extent of insolation-induced aridity in previously published regional climate model simulations. Like the simulations, the lake data provide no evidence for enhanced zonal flow during the mid-Holocene, which has been invoked to explain enhanced mid-continent aridity at the time. The data, including widespread evidence for large changes on orbital time scales and for more limited changes during the last millennium, confirm the ability of large boundary-condition changes to push western water supplies beyond the range of recent natural variability...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the paradox of}} why Amazonian manatees Trichechus inunguis undergo seasonal migrations to a habitat where they apparently fast. Ten males were tracked using VHF telemetry between 1994 and 2006 in the Mamirauá and Amanã Sustainable Development Reserves, constituting the only long-term dataset on Amazonian manatee movements in the wild. Their habitat was characterized by analysing aquatic space and macrophyte coverage dynamics associated with the annual flood-pulse cycle of the River Solimões. Habitat information came from fieldwork, two hydrographs, a three-dimensional model of the water bodies and classifications of Landsat-TM/ETM+ images. We show that during high-water season (mid-May to end-June), males stay in várzea lakes in association with macrophytes, which they select. We then show that, during low-water (October–November), the drastic reduction in aquatic space in the várzea leads {{to the risk of}} their habitat drying out and increases the manatees' vulnerability to predators such as caimans, jaguars and humans. This explains why males migrate to Ria Amanã. Based on data on illegal hunting, we argue that this habitat variability influences females to migrate too. We then use published knowledge of the environment's dynamics to argue that when water levels are high, the habitats that can support the largest manatee populations are the várzeas of white-water rivers, and we conjecture that rias are the species' main low-water refuges throughout Western Amazonia. Finally, we warn that the species may be at greater risk than previously thought, because migration and <b>low-water</b> <b>levels</b> make manatees particularly vulnerable to hunters. Moreover, because the flooding regime of Amazonian rivers is strongly related to large-scale climatic phenomena, there might be a perilous connection between climate change and the future prospects for the species. Our experience reveals that the success of research and conservation of wild Amazonian manatees depends on close working relationships with local inhabitant...|$|R
40|$|Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in {{the southeastern}} United States are found {{predominantly}} in the intertidal zone. In this study, mesh bags (3 and 6 mm) were deployed over collecting frames, and the patterns of oyster settlement on these collectors were compared against unmeshed controls at three tidal heights (intertidal, low water, and subtidal) over three sampling regimes (biweekly, monthly, and seasonal) at two sites. Within the biweekly sampling regime, the meshed collectors and controls had similar patterns of settlement at the respective tidal heights. For monthly samplers, mesh treatments maintained higher settlement subtidally whereas controls had highest settlement on the collectors at mean <b>low-water</b> <b>level.</b> Controls had highest recruitment intertidally for seasonal collectors, whereas mesh treatments had higher recruitment lower in the intertidal zone. Conclusions from this experiment were {{that the use of}} mesh-covered collectors enhanced subtidal oyster recruitment. Causes of observed increases in subtidal settlement in mesh collectors over unmeshed controls over time could be the result of a combination of factors: predator exclusion, larval entrainment, or reduced desiccation, which seemed to overcome the detrimental effects of increased fouling, resulting in reduced flow and possible hypoxic conditions within the mesh bags. Given the degree of recruitment and the sizes of the recruits attained within the mesh bags, the use of these methods to attain juveniles for commercial purposes would appear to be both feasible and viable, particularly for long periods (up to 6 1110) of deployment.

40|$|The Holocene {{coastal plain}} of Suriname is a chenier plain. Its actual sedimentological {{development}} has been studied during three field-work periods (1966, 1967 / 1968, 1972). Clay is the predominant sediment in this low- to medium-energy environment. It accumulates in extensive shoreface-attached mudflats (sometimes considered as giant mudwaves), which migrate continuously to the west due to deposition of slingmud at their west side and simultaneous erosion of the east side. In between the mudflats cheniers may develop. Thin-section analysis of the clay deposits revealed that they are built up of an alternation of thick clayey laminae and thin laminae of silt and fine sand. The clayey laminae chiefly show a unistrial plasmic fabric. Disturbaces in the upper zone are caused by bioturbation. Two types of cheniers can be distinguished. One type contains fine sand which has been winnowed out of the pelite deposits. Since this sand is brought from the shelf the chenier formation begins at approximately mean <b>low-water</b> <b>level.</b> Longshore bars are formed and these are driven shoreward by wave action. The other type is built up of medium to coarse sand supplied by a local river. It is transported westward by beachdrift in a narrow zone around the mean high-water line. These cheniers develop therefore at or just above the mean high-tide level. The sedimentary structures of both types of cheniers have many characteristics in common. However, each type also has its own distinct features...|$|E
40|$|The Taoussa Project is a {{component}} of a large development scheme of the Niger River in the north-eastern part of Mali aiming at reducing desertification and improving socio-economic activity. It is mainly made of a rockfill dam with central core around 18 m high and 1, 000 m long across {{the valley of the}} Niger River, 130 km upstream of the town of Gao {{in the eastern part of}} Mali. The dam is equipped with a 25 MW hydroelectric power plant, a lock, a dock and a spillway. The spillway is made of a gated ogee crested weir divided into 10 bays and a downstream stilling basin, with a maximum discharge capacity of 3, 100 m³/s. 210 km of high tension overhead cables and a 130 km long road complete the Project. The multipurpose Taoussa dam will enable the sustainable development of the Project area by securing water resources, increasing <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> discharges downstream, creating a link between road and fluvial transports (dock) and producing electricity. The Ministère de l’Energie, des Mines et de l’Eau du Mali - Autorité pour l’Aménagement de Taoussa -commissioned Coyne et Bellier – Tractebel Engineering in 2006 to perform the detailed studies for the Project. In this framework, the hydraulic studies have been performed by the Laboratory of Engineering Hydraulics (HECE) of the University of Liege. These hydraulic studies, depicted in details in the paper, have been carried out successively by two complementary approaches: a first step realized on the basis of numerical modelling to study the flows at the scale of the reservoir and the river, and a second experimental investigation, using a scale model, to analyse in details the spillway operation conditions. They consider varied problems from large scale flow conditions in the reservoir during the spillway operation and hydrodynamic interactions between the dam, the lock and the hydroelectric power plant to validation and optimization of the hydraulic design and dimensions of the gated spillway and the stilling basin or release conditions downstream of the project structures, including the temporary derivation stage...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn southwestern France, {{groundwater}} {{resources are}} withdrawn for various uses (drinkable water, irrigation, industry, geothermal energy, forestry, conservation of wetlands, shellfish breeding among others) which can sometimes cause conflicts between users. To help {{the management of}} these resources, regional hydrodynamic models have been developed. These models have been a support to the public policies for over 20 years. In the northern region, groundwater is in close relation with rivers, especially during periods of <b>low-water</b> <b>levels.</b> Indeed, groundwater used for irrigation impact not only the stream flows, but also the water supply for the second large wetland of France: the Marais Poitevin. The developed models have permitted to test the impact of several scenarios of water withdrawals. These tests help to determinate {{the amount of water}} that can be pumped to respect defined objectives as water levels in piezometer and river flows. These models were also used to test the impact of the eventual implementation of water tanks (400, 000 to 800, 000 m 3). Further south, the major problem is the important reduction of the level of the Eocene aquifer in the department of Gironde. In this area, the regional hydrodynamic model has been developed since 1990. Its development allows the management of deep groundwater resources and contributes to validate strategies of exploitation based on different simulations. This model also allows to answer problems of overexploitation and to analyse areas where water savings could be done to avoid this overexploitation, and to estimate the impact of new resources. The extreme southern region has a significant particularity: on two different sites, groundwater is used for the storage of gas. The cyclic injection and withdrawal of gas impacts significantly the aquifer level. The proposed model is adapted for the groundwater resources knowledge and management of this case. Finally, these models were used to evaluate impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in order to allow authorities to evaluate strategies to adapt to this change (Project Explore 2070 for example) ...|$|R
40|$|Aesop’s Fable tasks—in which {{subjects}} drop objects into a water-filled tube {{to raise}} the water level and obtain out-of-reach floating rewards —have been used to test for causal understanding of water displacement in both young children and non-human animals. However, a number of alternative explanations for success on these tasks have yet to be ruled out. One hypothesis is that subjects may respond to perceptual-motor feedback: repeating those actions that bring the reward incrementally closer. Here, we devised a novel, forced-choice version of the Aesop’s Fable task to assess whether subjects can solve water displacement tasks when this type of feedback is removed. Subjects had to select only one set of objects, or one type of tube, into which all objects were dropped at once, and the effect the objects had on the water level was visually concealed. In the current experiment, fifty-five 5 – 9 year old children were tested in six different conditions in which we either varied object properties (floating vs. sinking, hollow vs. solid, large vs. small and too large vs. small objects), the water level (high vs. low) and/or the tube size (narrow vs. wide). We found that children aged 8 – 9 years old were able to solve most of the water displacement tasks on their first trial, without any opportunity for feedback, suggesting that they mentally simulated the results of their actions before making a choice. Children aged 5 – 7 years solved two conditions on their first trial (large vs. small objects and high- vs. <b>low-water</b> <b>levels),</b> and learnt to solve most of the remaining conditions over five trials. The developmental pattern shown here is comparable to previous studies using the standard Aesop’s Fable task, where eight year olds are typically successful from their first trial and 5 – 7 year olds learn to pass over five trials. Thus, our results indicate that children do not depend on perceptual-motor feedback to solve these water displacement tasks. The forced-choice paradigm we describe could be used comparatively to test whether or not non-human animals require visual feedback to solve water displacement tasks...|$|R

The {{percentage}} cover of substratum ranged from 0 to 100 % and the colonising communities included representatives of ten phyla. The zone from mean <b>low-water</b> neap <b>level</b> to 1. 5 m depth was mostly devoid of organisms {{as a result}} of the seasonal formation of the encrusting ice foot.

Within the bryozoans a succession of colonisation of different species was observed, the most abundant two of which occupied > 80 % of substratum in places. Substratum type seemed to be the main factor influencing community development in the shallow sublittoral at Signy Island, although ice impact prevents community development in the top 1. 5 m and limits it over the rest of the transect down to 5. 5 m.

40|$|The Cávado estuary inlet is {{situated}} in the coastal zone of Esposende (NW Portugal) where sandy beaches have migrated inland and thinned, and cliffs have retreated rapidly over the last years. The coastal zone of Esposende extends over 15 km from the Neiva River until Apúlia. The coastal segment of Esposende can be considered of mixed energy and wave-dominated type, according to DAVIS and HAYES (1984). The local tide is mesotidal and semidiurnal, with a maximum equinoctial spring tide high-water level of 3. 9 m, a minimum <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> of 0. 2 m, and a mean spring tide of 3. 49 m (data from Instituto Hidrográfico da Marinha). The inlet is a natural feature of the Cávado estuary, subject to silting up, and enclosed between a breakwater on the northern side {{and the end of}} a migrant sandy spit on the southern side. Recently, it was suggested that the best option for decreasing silting-up and increasing navigability, would be to build two breakwaters and artificially manage the inlet. This proposal was not accepted by all concerned and is presently frozen. Behind the spit lies the town of Esposende, and so it is crucial as its natural defence against sea incursions. Several times the sea overwashed the spit, and broke through twice during the last twenty years. The present study concerns the period between 1991 and 2003. Using the hydrographical maps of 1991, 1992 and 2001, and topo-hydrographic surveys of 2002 and 2003, the sedimentary budget of the inlet, and the morphological changes of the flood and ebb tidal deltas were calculated. Moreover, two hydrodynamic mathematical models and a sediment transport mathematical model were implemented, in order to assess the bottom morphodynamic behaviour at the inlet. The first one is a two-dimensional hydrodynamic (2 DH) model that was created using the RMA 2 software (WES-HL, 1996). The river stretch considered in this finite elements model begins downstream of the Angelino weir and ends in the Atlantic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{dynamics}} {{in the vicinity}} of river mouths reveal complex patterns due to the joined effect of river discharges, tides and waves. These phenomena underlie current mathematical and simulation models, which constitute powerful tools that {{can be used as a}} complement to monitoring field work for the characterization of morphodynamical patterns in these complex coastal environments. The Cávado estuary inlet is situated near Esposende and the Douro Estuary about 50 km south of it, next to Porto. During the last years, inland beach migration, sand loss and cliff retreat have been recurrent in this North Portuguese, Atlantic coastal areas, which can be considered to be of the mixed energy and wave-dominated type. Local tides are mesotidal and semidiurnal, with a maximum equinoctial spring tide high-water level of about 3. 9 m and 4. 0 m and a minimum <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> of 0. 2 m and 0. 1 m, for the Esposende and Porto regions, respectively. Mean spring tides are about 3. 5 m. The Cávado estuary inlet, enclosed between a breakwater on the northern side and the end of a migrant sandy spit on the southern side, has been subject to silting up. The spit’s resilience is crucial as a natural defense against sea incursions for the town of Esposende which lies behind the spit. During the last twenty years the sea has repeatedly flooded and twice ruptured the spit. To decrease silting-up and increase navigability, the building of two breakwaters and an artificial inlet management has been suggested. The Douro Estuary inlet is also protected by a northern breakwater and has a protective estuarine barrier sand spit, though in a more inland position than the Cávado spit. This spit protects Douro harbor facilities and the heavily populated river banks against wave and tide actions. Facing similar problems as in the Cávado (silting-up of the navigation channel that runs north of the spit and spit vulnerability to wave and wind action and, particularly to the recurrent river floods) the northern breakwater was extended and an additional breakwater was built (between 2004 and 2008) attached to the spit, to protect it. The present work discusses and synthesizes results from an integrated approach, involving monitoring field surveys and the application of mathematical models, to describe the main features of these two coastal inlets and adjacent costal zones, considering the 15 km from the Neiva River to Apúlia for the Cávado river and the 22 km from Crestuma dam to Porto for the Douro river. The influence of river and tidal characteristics are discussed for both cases...|$|E
40|$|Les régions tropicales subissent une déforestation importante. En Amérique du Sud,la forêt est généralement remplacée par une prairie, C'est pourquoi nous avons étudié le {{comportement}} hydrologique de 2 petits (1, 5 ha) bassins versants. Un bassin (bassin B) est recouvert par une forêt primaire, {{tandis que}} le second (bassin A) a été défriché et transformé en prairie (Digitaria swazilandensis, programme ÉCÉREX, ORSTOM/CTFT). Ces bassins, situés en Guyane Française, sont proches (500 m), escarpés et principalement constitués par des sols à drainage vertical ralenti. Le climat est de type tmpical humide avec une température moyenne (26 °C) et des précipitations moyennes annuelles (3500 à 3900 mm/an) élevées. L'évapotranspiration réelle et potentielle de la forêt primaire sont respectivement égales à 1470 mm/an et 1565 mm/an, En période d'étiage, nous avons observé un écoulement permanent à l'exutoire du bassin A, alors que le bassin B en est dépourvu. Deux crues (24 mai 1992 et 15 mai 1993) ont été étudiées, simultanément sur les 2 bassins. Pendant les crues, nous avons prélevé des échantillons d'eau des précipitations (pluie et pluviolessivat), des ruisseaux et du sol. Sur ces sites, l'eau circulant dans les couches peu profondes du sol présente une concentration élevée en K+ et faible en Cl-. Une signature opposée caractérise l'eau des couches pmfondes du sol. L'analyse des relations existant entre les traceurs chimiques (K+, Cl-) et isotopique l 80) ainsi l'étude des propriétés hydrodynamiques du sol permet de décomposer qualitativement l'hydrogramme de crue en 3 réservoirs: sol superficiel (écoulement hypodermique), sol intermédiaire (de 0 à - 0, 4 m), sol profond (bassin B) ou nappe (bassin A). Une décomposition quantitative a été effectuée en utilisant des traceurs chimique (Cl-) et isotopique l 80). Nous avons ainsi montré que les crues sur les 2 bassins sont dominées par l'écoulement issu des couches intermédiaires du sol qui représente environ la moitié de l'écoulement total de crue. Cependant,les mécanismes de génération des crues diffèrent sur les 2 bassins. Sur le bassin A, les couches profondes du sol sont saturées avant la crue et participent donc à la totalité de la crue. Au contraire, sur le bassin B, les couches profondes de sol atteignent la saturation peu de temps avant le pic de crue et participent donc essentiellement aux écoulement pendant la décrue. Ces résultats confirment les études hydrologiques réalisées précédemment (FRITSCH, 199 Ù) et permettent d'identifier les mécanismes de genèse des crues et ainsi de mettre en évidence l'effet de la déforestation. The tropical regions {{are subjected to}} fast deforestation. In South America, the tropical rain forest is being replaced by grassland. Thus, we have studied the hydrological behaviour of two small (1. 5 ha) watersheds. One basin (hereafter named "B" basin) is still covered by primary forest while the second one (hereafter named "A" basin) was cleared and transformed to grassland (Digitaria swazilandensis, ÉCÉREX program, supported by ORSTOM/CTFT). These basins, located in French Guyana, are close to one another (500 m), steep, and are principally constituted of soils showing lateral drainage. The tropical humid climate {{is characterized by a}} high mean interannual temperature (26 ¡C), which varies slightly from month to month, and by a high mean annual precipitation (3500 to 3900 mm yr- 1). Precipitation mainly occurs during the main wet season from May to June and during a secondary wet season from December to January. Real evapotranspiration of the natural forest is 1470 mm yr- 1 and potential evapotranspiration is 1565 mm yr- 1. During the <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> period, we have observed perennial runoff at the outlet at the "A" basin while the "B" basin is without permanent flow. We have studied two runoff events (24 May 1992 and 15 May 1993) in both basins. On 24 May 1992, the runoff event was caused by a rainfall lasting for about 10 hours. Total precipitation was 53. 8 mm. The main event amounted to 32 mm. The main peak of the hydrograph corresponded to the heaviest rainfalls. On 15 May 1993, the runoff event was caused by a rain lasting for about 13 hours. Total precipitation was 64. 0 mm. The main peak of the hydrograph (86. 2 L s- 1) corresponded again to the heaviest rainfalls. Spatial variability of the precipitation amount was high, especially for the most intense events that have the largest standard deviations. Interception by the canopy amounted to 5. 3 % of the rainfall in 1992 and 4. 3 % in 1993. High rapid runoff coefficients were observed, i. e., 0. 28 for 24 May 1992 and 0. 43 for 15 May 1993. No overland flow was observed in the watershed. Samples of rainwater, throughfall, stream water, and soil water were regularly collected in both watersheds during the runoff events. Temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the stream water at the outlet of the watershed paralleled variations in rainwater but with a distinct shift. The difference between the two signatures could be due to a mixture between:- Rainwater and water present in the watershed before the event and whose isotopic composition is different and variable over space. - Rainwater and water originating from various reservoirs whose contribution to the stream varies with time. The analysis of runoff events using the isotope tracer method revealed the existence in the stream of a mixture of water originating from rain and from one or several other reservoirs in the watershed. Isotope tracers alone were not sufficient to estimate the depth of the soil water contributing to the runoff event. On one hand, temporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainwater was very similar to the vertical spatial variability in the isotopic composition of soil water. On the other hand, surface evaporation in the watershed was negligible: the isotopic signature of water originating from soil during runoff events was the consequence of successive infiltrated rain events. Oxygen- 18 content in rain water strongly varied with time but only slightly with space because of the small area of the watershed. Because of this temporal variability, an average isotope content of rainwater could not be used when calculating the contribution of "new water" at the outlet of the watershed. Using chemical and isotope tracers is a way to identify and quantify the contribution of the various water reservoirs to runoff. We were thus able to separate runoff hydrographs into simple components (water from superficial layer, intermediate layer and deep layer). In these watersheds, shallow water was characterized by relatively high concentration in potassium and very low concentration in chloride. An opposite signature characterized deep waterA "deep water" chemical tracer (chloride) - isotope tracer (18 O) diagram shows the evidence of a hysteresis relationship: 1. The decreasing limb of this relationship (rising segment of the hydrograph) is due to a decrease in heavy isotope content resulting from the decrease of oxygen- 18 content in the precipitation and from the arrival of water from upper soil layers with low concentrations of chloride. 2. The increasing limb (falling segment of the hydrograph and recession) is associated with the arrival at the outlet of deep waters containing relatively high concentrations of chloride and heavy isotopes. Using chemical (Cl-) and isotope (18 O) tracers, quantitative hydrograph separation was achieved with a simple 2 - or 3 - component conservative-mixing model. This information allowed qualitative hydrograph separation into 3 reservoirs: superficial soil layers, intermediate soil layers (0 to - 0. 4 m), deep soil layers ("B" watershed) or ground water ("A" watershed). Thus, the runoff event of both basins was dominated by the intermediate soil layers reservoir, which represents half of the total flow for both basins. However, the processes of runoff generation differ: in the "A" watershed, the deep soil layers were saturated before the rain: the contribution is significant throughout the runoff. In the "B" watershed, the deep soil layers become saturated a few times before the peak flow: their contribution dominates during the recession. These results confirm previous hydrological studies (Fritsch, 1990), which showed the high reactivity of the watershed, and give a better insight into the mechanisms involved. Some of these observations can also be used at a larger scale: 1. Identification of the reservoirs contributing to the runoff event by analyzing the relationships between oxygen- 18 content and the flow rate, and between isotope and chemical tracers. 2. Simultaneous samplings along the stream in order to detect a possible zonation of the watershed. These samples must be taken during a runoff event as well as during a <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> period to check whether the tracer concentrations in the continuous or discontinuous water table supplying the stream are heterogeneous. If the signature of the water table is heterogeneous or if the stream is supplied by several water tables with different chemical concentrations, the watershed must be divided into several homogeneous sub-watersheds...|$|E

Spectral analysis of the A. D 622 - 1470 data set yields several statistically significant periodicities, for both low-water (256; 75. 9; 52. 6; 38; 28. 9; 20. 9; 18. 5 and 13. 4 yr) and flood levels (75. 9; 33. 6; 21. 4; 14. 7; 13. 7; 9. 7 and 8. 1 yr). Evolutionary Multi Taper Method analysis suggests that shifts or disappearances of spectral peaks occur in sub-intervals of the studied time span. This is noticeable for the low frequency peaks in the sub-interval A. D. similar to 950 -similar to 1250 which corresponds to the Medieval Warm Period in Europe. By contrast, a remarkable time stability is observed for the 5 yr period, that could confirm the existence of a robust ENSO-like forcing during the studied period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two {{different}} coral {{framework structures}} {{located in a}} shallow subtidal area {{on the east coast}} of Bali are described in this study. One structure is a typical coral carpet with a distinct internal succession of coral taxa and growth forms. It starts with a variety of coral species exhibiting massive, tabular, branching, and platy growth forms settling on volcanic boulders and cobbles. The main body of the coral carpet is composed almost monospecifically of Acropora cf. vaughani, which has filled all accommodating spaces up to the <b>low-water</b> sea <b>level.</b> Mostof this carpet died during the bleaching event of 1998 and the resultant dead Acropora framework is now capped by a platy Montipora assemblage. Some of the Acropora branches within the dead carpet, however, are still alive and display active growth. The Montipora cover protects the dead Acropora framework against mechanical and biological destruction. The few still growing Acropora branches may also contribute to the strength of the framework. The second coral framework is made up almost monogenerically of Montipora. One species of Montipora is of a laminar growth form and produces whorl-like colonies. Within this framework, only part of the Montipora colonies are dead; however, these are intensively fragmented. The fragments have been rapidly settled by a platy Montipora species, which has stabilized the fragments. In this case, the fragment shedding of the Montipora offers the opportunity for progradation of the framework on these fragments. Concerning the Acropora carpet, similar examples from the fossil record of the Miocene era of Spain and Austria have been reported...|$|R
40|$|Stauromedusae are cnidarians {{that have}} {{attracted}} relatively little ecological study, {{especially in the}} southern hemisphere. They are Scyphozoa that develop directly from the scyphistoma, and each consists of a calyx and {{a more or less}} distinct aboral peduncle that attaches to the substratum by an adhesive disc. The animals are mobile on the substratum, but have no pelagic phase. The present note originates from observations made on stauromedusae living in intertidal and shallow subtidal waters at Husvik Harbour, South Georgia (54 ° 11 ′S 38 ° 40 ′W) in early 1994. The species concerned was identified from Kramp (1961), Carlgren (1930) and Pfeffer (1889) as Haliclystus antarcticus Pfeffer, 1889. This species has attracted little previous study. The most detailed anatomical description was given by Carlgen (1930), while distributional details are given in O'Sullivan (1982) who followed Pfeffer (1889); at present {{there is no evidence that}} the species occurs other than at South Georgia. Medusae were found on two substrata. Large animals (30 mm high, inconspicuous dark brown in colour) were found on the underside of boulders at extreme low spring tide level in a bay on the north of Husvik Harbour about 1 · 2 km from the whaling station and close to Brain Island. Locally they were common, often being close enough to touch one another. Smaller animals (pink-orange in colour; cryptic on the macroalga) were found attached to the brown macroalga Desmarestia menziesii J. Aghardh (Phaeophyceae) collected at <b>low-water</b> spring tide <b>level</b> from Kanin Point on the southern shore of the harbour. Medusae on boulders were briefly emersed on particularly low tides: they collapsed, hanging from the peduncle, when out of water, but did not risk desiccation as their habitat was wet and not exposed to the sun. ...|$|R

It {{is important to}} have complete understanding of the critical factors influencing population change (e. g., duckling survival, nesting success, and health) to advance our understanding of population dynamics and improving species conservation. Duckling survival is a primary driver of scaup demography. I conducted a capture-mark-recapture study using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models in Program MARK to compute apparent daily survival and recapture probabilities for 3256 individually marked ducklings with 620 recaptures during 2010 to 2013. The most parsimonious survival model based on a priori hypotheses found that Julian hatch date squared was the most significant predictor of survival and consistent through all four years. Mass at hatch also was significant as a quadratic effect. Duckling survival to 30 days ranged from 29. 0 to 80. 0. During this study, stabilizing selection {{played a significant role in}} duckling survival, which indicates that there was trade-offs for selection of an optimal timing of hatch on survival and a cost associated with hatching too early or too late and being too heavy or to light. Abstract–Nest-Site Selection There is a hierarchical process of behavioral and environmental processes that influence habitat selection, which inherently influences the survival and fitness of that individual and contributes to population growth. I investigated nest fate, spatial attributes, and all relationships between high and low-water levels with habitat attributes (distance to upland, distance to open water, nearest neighbor distance) of located nests using general linear models in SAS, t-tests in R, and Hot Spot Analysis in ArcGIS of 481 nests over eight years. In low-water years, successful nests (X̅ = 1153 m) were located 22. 0 % farther from upland than unsuccessful nests (X̅ = 944 m), but support for a similar relationship was lacking in high-water years. Successful nests were located 21. 0 % and 23. 0 % (i. e., 49 and 50 m) closer to conspecific nests than unsuccessful nests in low and high-water levels, respectively. In both high and <b>low-water</b> <b>level</b> years, clusters of nests initiated later in the season coincided with Hot Spots for nest fate (i. e., high-quality habitat patches, clusters of successful nests), whereas areas that tended to be selected first, evidenced by clusters of nests initiated earlier, tended to overlap with clusters of Cold Spots for nest fate. The core Hot Spot for nest fate was in the same spot in both water level conditions and located in flooded emergent vegetation in the heart of Lower Red Rock Lake furthest from any upland habitat. Three out of six Cold Spots for nest fate both in high and low-water years were located in emergent vegetation on the perimeter of Lower Red Rock Lake adjacent to uplands. Density-dependence seems to be a factor affecting late-nesting scaup females that are apparently cuing in on the reproductive performance of conspecifics when determining where to nest. Therefore, management actions focused on survival and reproductive success of scaup should consider managing water levels and habitat for later nesting scaup to increase adult survival and ultimately recruitment of ducklings. Abstract – Blood Parasite Prevalence Blood parasites, per se, do not lead to direct mortality, but instead reduce the health of individual birds, which may ultimately lead to decreased reproductive success. Evidence has shown that presence of blood parasites can reduce fitness, body condition, and reproductive success of waterfowl. For many avian species, the cost of reproduction is manifested as a negative relationship between female breeding effort and breeding season survival, with trade-offs occurring when these adaptive choices become detrimental to future reproductive performance. Blood was drawn for parasite load determination from 112 individual adult scaup captured from 2011 to 2012 via spotlighting and drive-trapping. Parasite prevalence was determined through blood assays that were created using a two-slide wedge technique. Relationships among seasonal heterophile:lymphocyte ratio (a proxy for health), body mass at time of capture (throughout pre-, during, and post-breeding periods), breeding status (females only), and Julian date of capture (date of capture) of capture with parasite prevalence were analyzed using linear (lm) regression models in R 2. 15. 2. The blood parasite infection rate was 5. 0 %, with prevalence differing by gender with 33. 3 % of males positive for blood parasites compared to 1. 0 % of females. The presence of blood parasites did not affect health, fitness, or breeding status of scaup. A quadratic relationship was found with body mass and date of capture, indicating that body mass increased from pre-breeding period to the breeding period and decreased significantly at the end of the summer during molt. A negative relationship between the heterophile:lymphocyte ratio of female scaup and date of capture (i. e., the health of scaup females was greatest during the pre-breeding period after which it consistently decreased until the molting period). A strong negative correlation between heterophile:lymphocyte ratio and body mass was found in both genders, which indicated that scaup in poor body condition were also in poor health at the end of the breeding season...|$|E
