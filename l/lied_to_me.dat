2500|$|The game {{begins in}} a {{ceremonial}} chamber, with Ray and Thomas pointing their guns at one another, as Marisa stands alongside Thomas. Ray says [...] "I loved you, and you <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Both of you. You betrayed me." [...] From nearby, William laments to himself how {{the family has}} been destroyed by lust for a woman and greed for gold. There is a cut to black, a gunshot, and Marisa screams.|$|E
2500|$|Act three {{takes place}} in the {{courtyard}} of castle of the Wittenstein. Five years have passed. Hans has deceived Ondine with Bertha, and Ondine has long since vanished. It is the morning of the day of the marriage of Bertha and Hans. But Hans is troubled. He tells Bertha, that she should have married a man full of pride and joy. [...] He complains, [...] "Oh Bertha, how she <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that woman!" [...] Bertha points out that Ondine was no woman, [...] "you married a creature of another world. You must forget her." [...] Hans remembers the day that Ondine left and asks, [...] "But why does she proclaim to the world that she deceived me with Bertram?" [...] In addition to being preoccupied with Ondine, Hans is worried because the servants are starting to speak in poetry and there is a Wittenstein legend that this always happens just before misfortune strikes. Two fishermen arrive. The second fisherman is the Old One. They have caught Ondine. Two judges from the inquisition are summoned and immediately put her on trial. Ondine is brought in draped in the net in which she was caught. [...] She does not deny being an Ondine and proclaims to all who will listen that she deceived Hans with Bertram. The judge asks Hans to clearly state the exact nature of his complaint. Hans says, [...] "My complaint? [...] My complaint is the complaint of all mankind. [...] I claim the right to be left in peace {{in a world that is}} free of intrusions by these creatures. [...] Has there never been an age when they did not afflict us?" [...] The judge answers, [...] "An age? [...] There has never been a moment." [...] But the other judge says, [...] "Yes, there was once a moment. [...] For that instant, the whole world was single-hearted, at play, at peace—and yet I tasted for the first time a certain loneliness." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
50|$|Much of Jang's {{work was}} made into movies or plays, {{including}} his A Journey with Oedipus. Jang’s work relies on the innovative technique of communicating through self-destruction. Exposing the destructive evil lying underneath the seemingly wholesome exterior of the society, the author purposely stimulates a feeling of discomfort in the readers while revealing himself fully and without shame. Jang was arrested when the court judged his novel, Try <b>Lying</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> (Naegae geojinmareul haeboa, 1996) to be pornographic.|$|R

40|$|SET domain {{containing}} 6 (SETD 6) monomethylates the RelA subunit {{of nuclear}} factor kappa B (NF-iB). The ankyrin repeats of G 9 a-like protein (GLP) recog-nizes RelA monomethylated at <b>Lys</b> 310. Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> 310 is Ser 311, a known phosphorylation site of RelA. Ser 311 phosphorylation inhibits Lys 310 methylation by SETD 6 {{as well as}} binding of Lys 310 me 1 by GLP. The structure of SETD 6 in complex with RelA peptide containing the methyla-tion site, {{in the presence of}} S-adenosyl-L-methio-nine, reveals a V-like protein structure and suggests a model for NF-iB binding to SETD 6. In addition, structural modeling of the GLP ankyrin repeats bound <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> 310 <b>me</b> 1 peptide provides insight into the molecular basis for inhibition of Lys 310 me 1 binding by Ser 311 phosphorylation. Together, these findings provide a structural explan-ation for a key cellular signaling pathway centered on RelA Lys 310 methylation, which is generated by SETD 6 and recognized by GLP, and incorporate a methylation–phosphorylation switch of adja-cent lysine and serine residues. Finally, SETD 6 is structurally similar to the Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase. Given the restriction of Rubisco to plant species, this particular appearance of the protein lysine methyltransferase has been evolu-tionarily well conserved...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that being <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> makes a person more likely to respond with deception in a reciprocal manner. I hypothesize that lying instead creates a descriptive norm. Thus, a person being <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> will lie not only to the person who <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> them, but in new conversations with new people. Within a mock job interview, participants were <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> by one confederate, and then given the chance to lie to a second confederate. Being <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> did not produce significantly more lies, favoring existing theory that lying is reciprocal and not transitive...|$|R
