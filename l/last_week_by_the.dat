40|$|Wage earners {{are still}} the {{dominant}} group, says MARK WOODEN ACCORDING to new data released <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the number of owner managers (that is, the self-employed) in November 2006 was little different from the number two years earlier. By contrast, {{the number of employees}} rose by almost 7. 5 per cent over this same period. Even more striking, the number of owner managers that the ABS, in its Forms of Employment Survey, defines as working on a contract basis declined by 9 per cent. This group of self-employed contractors was already a fairly small group, numbering just 450, 000 persons in 2004 (or only 4. 7 per cent of the employed workforce). But by 2006 it had shrunk even further, now numbering just 410, 000. Such trends fly {{in the face of the}} conventional wisdom pedalled by the critics of labour market reform. According to that line of argument, full-time permanent waged work will soon be a thing of the past. Instead, employment in the 21 st century will be characterised by increasingly ephemeral attachment between workers and employers. Many more jobs are expected to become temporary or short-term, and firms are expected to rely increasingly on external sources such as self-employed contractors or labour hire intermediaries to meet their labour requirements. These recent ABS numbers clearly challenge such assumptions. Traditional wage and salary earner employment remains the predominant mode of labour market engagement. Perhaps the decline in the number of self-employed contractors has been offset by a rise in the number of people employed through labour hire firms (and who would be defined by the ABS as being employees) ? The ABS survey does not provide data on this, but other data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey for 2005 suggests this hypothesis should be rejected. Indeed, the estimated number of people employed through a labour hire firm or temporary work agency is both relatively small (just over 3 per cent of all employees) and has declined in recent years (it fell by over 13 per cent in 2005). A large part of the explanation for these recent trends is likely to lie in the healthy state of the jobs market. On the demand side, a shrinking pool of unemployed labour together with expanding shortages in some sectors has almost certainly forced companies to offer many workers more secure employment contracts as part of a strategy to retain skilled and valued labour. On the supply side, rising real wages have increased the attractiveness of more traditional employer-employee relationships over indirect arrangements. It is also plausible that labour market reforms have had a role to play. If the various legislative reforms enacted by the Coalition government have provided greater flexibility for employers in the way they hire and fire and in the way they are able structure relationships with their employees then it follows that employers will feel less need to resort to outsourcing. The greater freedom provided to employers to fire whoever they like under Work Choices is an obvious example here. That said, it needs to be borne in mind that Work Choices only became law at the end of March 2006, towards the end of the period covered by the data reviewed here. In summary, traditional forms of employment remain the overwhelmingly dominant form of labour market engagement in Australia. Self-employed contractors, however, are not going to disappear. They will continue to remain a valuable option for many firms. The extent to which this type of labour engagement system is used will vary over time, depending on such things as the state of the economy, technological change and labour laws and institutions.

40|$|Few Australian {{politicians}} in living memory possess the Queensland premier 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to voters’ wants and fears, argues Paul Williams QUEENSLAND Premier Peter Beattie {{remains one of}} Australia’s most remarkable politicians. If nothing else, he is certainly among the most popular, with a recent Newspoll finding 64 per cent of Queensland voters satisfied with his performance as Premier, compared to just 23 per cent dissatisfied. On the question of preferred Premier, Beattie, on 64 per cent, far outstrips opposition leader Lawrence Springborg’s 15 per cent. Such a commanding lead in public opinion {{is all the more}} astounding given that Beattie has been premier {{for more than five years}} and, in calling a snap election for 7 February, is seeking a third term, a feat such successful premiers as Jeff Kennett and Richard Court failed to accomplish. Beattie, however, since winning minority government in 1998, despite a One Nation onslaught, has proved to be an astonishingly adroit leader who has artfully commanded his state’s affairs. The secret to Beattie’s success lies in the man’s own mode of operational leadership. It is Beattie’s particular style and personal rapport with the Queensland electorate that has given the ALP its winning edge. So great is his command and so wide his appeal, he is often compared to that other leviathan of Queensland politics, Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Beattie’s engaging and affable style is the first, and most critical, reason why his Labor government will be returned comfortably next month. Importantly, Beattie has mastered the ability to bridge the ‘great divide’ - whether it be economic, social or geographical. With his genuine commitment to the Smart State and Community Cabinet programs, Beattie has found strong and enduring support in Brisbane and the regions, just as he has among progressive intellectuals and conservative labourers. Indeed, there are thousands of erstwhile Liberal voters in Brisbane who moved to support Beattie in 2001, and may yet prove unwilling to swing back. Just as the prime minister has his ‘Howard battlers’ in western Sydney, so, too, can the Queensland premier count on the ‘Beattie Liberals’. At his most elementary level, Beattie is a populist leader who speaks to voters in plain language. He empathises with the marginalised voter disenchanted with big-party politics. He consoles the disgruntled voter damaged by unrelenting economic reform. And he wins the respect of even the most cynical voter with his ability to apologise, earnestly and unreservedly, when his government gets it wrong. Beattie even appeals to state parochialism when appropriate with a measure of old-fashioned Canberra-bashing. In short, Beattie has as gift for saying what Queenslanders want to hear. Beattie thus emerges not as a politician but as an ordinary, honest ‘good guy’ doing his best for Queensland. The chances of a third term for Beattie are strengthened when Labor’s massive parliamentary majority is considered. The ALP at the 2001 election won 66 of the 89 seats in the state’s unicameral parliament, a breathtaking achievement given the poll came on the heels of the potentially devastating Shepherdson inquiry into vote rorting in the Queensland ALP. Notwithstanding the release <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Crime and Misconduct Commission of a damning report into the abuse of children in state foster care, there remains no issue with a comparable potential to damage the ALP this time around. Thus, the ALP appears even more secure. But, realistically, the ALP must expect some losses. The 2001 result was clearly an aberration; an artificially high water mark that cannot be repeated. The ALP, for example, won every seat in metropolitan Brisbane, and many on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts, including a number of previously unassailable Coalition strongholds. As such, nine seats could return to the Coalition with a uniform swing of less than three per cent. But this is a long way from the 22 seats the Coalition needs to win to form government, particularly given that Labor holds the bulk of those seats by fat margins. In short, the Coalition’s task is just too great. Beattie’s domination is also a function of his ubiquitous media presence, one that saw the premier wear with cheeky pride the opposition’s criticism of him as a ‘media tart’. Indeed, if Beattie is vulnerable at all, it’s in his potential to overplay his media hand. While many voters until now have found the Premier’s grin endearing, there is some risk that Queenslanders are growing tired of what are obviously carefully orchestrated media stunts. But, overall, this profile, together with the government’s daunting 43 seat majority, has seen the Coalition parties overshadowed in parliamentary, policy and public debates. While both Coalition leaders have been swamped by the wash of Beattie’s seemingly unending press conferences and sound bites, it is the Liberals who have the most to lose. Despite being the junior Coalition partner, the Liberals hold the greater potential to erode the ALP’s vote. Where the Nationals currently attract 13 per cent support, a level lower than the last election, the Liberals are drawing 22 per cent, or eight points higher than in 2001. Few would dispute the common perception of the Queensland Government as primarily a Beattie Government, just as the state ALP is very much a Beattie Labor Party. Beattie’s political leadership and personal style will therefore be at the core of this campaign, one that will be remembered, in every sense, as his election.

40|$|The Victorian budget {{must be the}} servant, not the master, argue David Hayward and Peter Ewer DARK {{clouds are}} {{gathering}} over Spring Street, and a storm is surely about to break. The bad weather is not coming down Collins Street, {{in the way that}} Labor governments have come to expect, but from parts of town where Labor would normally see fair weather. Trades Hall and the public sector unions are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the Bracks Government’s direction, and the Victorian Council of Social Service is also noticeably upset for the same reason. Harsh words are being spoken. Tempers are beginning to flare. These are unexpected developments, for it’s sunshine rather than rain that should be following Bracks around. So what’s gone wrong, and what might be done to fix it? High up the list is finances, and the management of the budget. Despite its massive majority, there remain striking similarities between Labor’s financial policies and those employed by Jeff Kennett, so much so that they almost look to have been penned by the same hand. Equity and social justice still don’t rate a mention, either as a problem worth visiting or an explicit goal worthy of a fight. Remarkably, the policies are even to the right of Peter Costello, who is sensible enough to know that the best budgets are those that move with the economic cycle, rather than simply deny that it exists. While Costello lets the surplus grow during boom, and balances these with deficits during slumps, John Brumby insists on running a surplus always, and he has even nominated by how much. There is misery here for someone when the economy eventually turns sour, for sacrifices will inevitably need to be made. Downturns rob governments of taxes, implying a need for big spending cuts and therefore job losses {{to make sure that the}} precious surplus is maintained. Victorian Labor continues to use an accounting framework that all other state governments, as well as Costello, prefer not to use. Whereas Victoria counts paper losses of government super funds against the budget bottom line, everyone else simply notes them, because they are beyond government control, and because the sharemarket will eventually turn around. The different methods make an enormous difference in times like these. Last year Victoria’s surplus was $ 1. 6 billion using everyone else’s accounting method, and not the paltry $ 260 million implied by our accounts. Had Costello used our method, his budget would have been in deficit instead of modest surplus, as would have Bob Carr’s in NSW. Elsewhere, governments are much more relaxed, being content to run with deficits in Queensland, South Australia and even in the West. The result for Victorian Labor is a political drama it does not need. Departmental annual reports are full of fear and loathing about huge ‘losses’. For a start, public agencies are not profit-making concerns, so they don’t ‘lose’ money in the commonsense meaning of the term. And the framing of the budget deliberately screws down departments with a 1. 5 per cent cut every year, as a so-called productivity dividend. Brumby then carefully protects the bottom line with ‘contingencies’ he tucks aside for moments like these, worth a whopping $ 488 million in 2003 - 4. Cost over-runs give us a permanent sense of departmental crisis, while the Treasury conveniently remains chock-full of cash. What’s the point of Labor’s financial mischief? There really can be only one, and that’s to use the budget as a discipline to keep the public sector small, despite the public pressure to make it much bigger. There’s nothing like the prospect of a financial crisis to keep expectations in check, and what better way to do it than by making sure the numbers always look grim. But there are political costs that arise from a strategy like this. By definition, Treasury and the Treasurer effectively run the show, with their hands wrapped tightly around the throat of social policy as well as the public service, and with no one powerful enough to make them let go. But the best Labor governments are those that are remembered for their social achievements, something that’s impossible as long as Treasury rules unchecked. And there is a deeper problem. A social democratic vision cannot take root under these settings. The public service as both an economic mechanism and a philosophy of effective delivery cannot be revived as long as the neo-liberal financial settings are given top billing. So we end up with a familiar story, not that different from when Kennett was in charge. Billion-dollar surpluses are amassed in Treasury, while down the road in education, health and community services funds are allowed to shrink and jobs are put on the line. And let’s not forget that there are still 45, 000 fewer public sector workers than when Labor was last in power. There’s a solution to these troubles, and it’s not too late to change. Pull Treasury back into line, and give the social policy departments and their ministers a stronger hand in setting policy directions. But first, Labor needs to identify more clearly its core social values and underlying philosophy, at the heart of which must surely be a commitment to social justice and an enabling public service. The budget must become a servant of these values, not their master. The Bracks Government needs a vision like this to bring back the sunshine, and ensure Labor’s natural allies remain its supportive friends.

40|$|The {{influence}} of bulking agents on organic matter (OM) stability and nitrogen (N) availability in sewage sludge composts was investigated. The same sludge was composted on an industrial plant with different mixtures of bulking agents. The composting process included an active phase and a curing phase, both <b>lasting</b> 6 <b>weeks,</b> separated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> screening of composts. The OM evolution was characterised by carbon (C) and N mass balances in biochemical fractions. The OM stability and N potential availability of final composts were measured during soil incubations. During composting, the C and N losses reached more than 62 % {{of the initial}} C and more than 45 % of the initial N, respectively, due to C mineralisation or N volatilisation and screening. The bulking materials mostly influenced OM evolution during the active phase. They contributed to the mitigation of N losses during the active phase where N immobilisation through active microbial activity was favoured by bulking agents increasing the C:N ratio of the initial mixtures. However, the {{influence of}} bulking agents on OM evolution was removed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> screening; this induced the homogenisation of compost characteristics {{and led to the}} production of sludge composts with similar organic matter characteristics, C degradability and N availability...|$|R

It stayed in the top ten for five <b>weeks,</b> and <b>lasted</b> 20 <b>weeks</b> overall. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of 2009, the live DVD sold over 76,235 units in Japan. To promote the {{material}} from Guilty and enhanced Hamasaki's worldwide releases, tracks were remixed and produced for Hamasaki's Ayu-Mi-x remix album series; [...] "Talkin' 2 Myself" [...] and [...] "Glitter" [...] were remixed by Swedish DJ StoneBridge and British production team Soul Central for her remix album Ayu-mi-x 6: Gold (2008). [...] "Together When...", [...] "Fated", and [...] "Decision" [...] were remixed by Co-Fusion, Japanese musician Makoto, and Force of Nature for her remix album Ayu-mi-x 6: Silver (2008). It was released worldwide as a digital album; the decision to release both Guilty and the remix albums worldwide, with remix collaborations from Western DJs The Young Punx, Coldcut, Para One and Armand Van Helden, has been interpreted as her first step into the global market. The reception for both remix albums and the Guilty content received positive reviews from most music critics.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{one of the}} important characteristics of Beijing particulate matter pollution, the mass size distribution of particulate matters and its water-soluble ions, the particle samples were collected by a MOUDI cascade impactor in Beijing during July 2001, March 2002, July 2002 and January 2003 and every sampling period <b>lasted</b> a <b>week.</b> <b>By</b> analysis, <b>the</b> results indicate that there is 'two modes' in the diameter range of the fine particle, one called 'condensation mode' and another called 'droplet mode', and the reasons of the peak of the accumulation mode appearing in the diameter range of 1 - 1. 8 μm was discussed in this paper. And there was a relatively strong correlation between PM 1. 8 and PM 10 (R 2 > 80 %), the same to PM (1. 8 - 10) (PM 10 minus PM 1. 8); the ratio of PM 1. 8 /PM 10 varied between 40 % and 60 % during the sampling periods; as a result, the mass concentration of PM 10 can be decreased <b>by</b> decreasing <b>the</b> concentration of coarse particles; sulfate, nitrate and ammonium are the main component of the inorganic water-soluble ions and the percentage of these three ions in PM 1. 8 was above 70 % when the concentration of fine particle was more than 70 μg·m - 3 and they are the main reason increasing particle concentration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Operational Area of Banyuasin Public Health Service in Loano Subdistrict, Purworejo Regency, Middle Java Province, {{includes}} in {{endemic area}} which still has {{high rate of}} malaria disease and increased in this last three years. In 2005 it was founded four persons which positively suffered malaria; in 2006 it was founded 66 persons which positively suffered malaria (API 5, 4 per 1000 populations) and increase the case in 2007 by 202 persons which positively suffered malaria. Screening test was necessary as initial filtering test of malaria diseases in operational area of Banyuasin Public Health Service, Loano Subdistrict, Purworejo Regency, Middle Java Province.     Method: This was descriptive research using validity test for measuring the sensitivity and specificity of clinical symptoms of malaria as screening test. Technique of sample taking was conducted by consecutive sampling. Population was all of inhabitants living in operational area of Banyuasin Public Health Service, Loano Subdistrict, Purworejo Regency, Middle Java Province. Sample were the persons having periodical fever symptoms, sharp pain in joints, and nauseous symptoms in <b>last</b> two <b>weeks</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of samples were 96 persons.   Result of research: Based on validity calculation of screening test of clinical symptom of malaria, sensitivity and specificity rate of periodic fever symptom (Se: 100 %, Sp: 100 %),  sharp pain on joints (Se: 58, 3 %, Sp: 96, 4 %), nausea (Se: 100 %, Sp: 98, 8 %). Combination of symptom periodical fever and nausea have sensitivity and specificity rate of (Se: 100 %, Sp: 98, 8 %), periodical fever and sharp pain on joints (Se: 58, 3 %, Sp: 96, 4 %), sharp pain on joints and nausea (Se: 58, 3 %, Sp: 100 %), periodical fever and sharp pain on joints (Se: 58, 3 %, Sp: 100 %).   Conclusion: Sensitivity and specificity of the result of these three combinational symptoms, i. e. periodical fever + sharp pain on joints and nausea have sensitivity of 58, 3 % and specificity of 100 %. It means that these three combinational symptoms {{can not be used}} as screening test of malaria by reason of it has low in sensitivity.   Keywords: Screening, Sensitivity, Specificity, Malaria, Banyuasin Public Health Service  <br /...|$|R
