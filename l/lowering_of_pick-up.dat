40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the beam properties and achieve satisfactory cooling performance for an electron cooling device, {{it is essential to}} have adequate diagnostics system both for use on a test stand and in the operational environment. Beam transversal electron temperature is a very important information to be picked up. For this purpose pick-ups with a high sensitivity and a wide bandwidth, working in the microwave bands, are suggested. The use of such a kind <b>of</b> <b>pick-ups</b> is directly correlated {{to the fact that the}} electron beam is confined in an axial magnetic field.

The new tool and procedure provide an effective approach in improving the efficiency and accuracy of sensor response curve estimates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we have {{improved}} our earlier physical concept to theoretically describe the particle-modulated solar wind termination shock by three dynamically interacting hydrodynamic fluids, i. e. the solar wind, the pick-up ion, and the anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) plasmas. In this earlier concept we have introduced a parametrized form {{to describe the}} injection <b>of</b> Fermi-I energized <b>pick-up</b> ions into the ACR regime in the precursor and the subshock region. With this parametrization {{it was possible to}} give solutions for the upstream-to-downstream transition of all thermodynamic fluid properties on the basis of two undefined parameters, i. e. the total injection efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pick-up</b> ions and the mean energy of post-shock ACR particles. Making use <b>of</b> the <b>pick-up</b> ion transport equation we now obtain a parameter-free description of the injection process. In addition we obtain the energy-averaged spatial diffusion coefficien...|$|R
