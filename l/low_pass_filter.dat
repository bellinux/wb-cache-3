25|$|Mathematically, {{applying}} a Gaussian blur to an image {{is the same}} as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. This is also known as a two-dimensional Weierstrass transform. By contrast, convolving by a circle (i.e., a circular box blur) would more accurately reproduce the bokeh effect. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, {{applying a}} Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E

The high <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> can either be applied after the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters,</b> or before (if applied before the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters,</b> the high <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> only affects an external audio signal).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a noise {{reduction}} technique is introduced {{based on the}} Gabor time-frequency transform. In the proposed approach, noise is removed using <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> locally in the transform domain. Finding the cut-off frequency for the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> {{in such a way}} that image does not loose its features, is an important issue. The optimal cut-off frequency of the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> are computed in an iterative method for each sub-block of the image. The followed approach, besides showing a good performance in removing noise, it also performs well in preserving image features. ...|$|R

Using such a subharmonic synthesizer the essential frequency band between 125 - 250 Hz is recreated, adding weight to the signal.|$|R
2500|$|Analog {{phase locked}} loops are {{generally}} built with an analog phase detector, <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> and VCO {{placed in a}} negative feedback configuration. A digital phase locked loop uses a digital phase detector; it may also have a divider in the feedback path or in the reference path, or both, {{in order to make}} the PLL's output signal frequency a rational multiple of the reference frequency. [...] A non-integer multiple of the reference frequency can also be created by replacing the simple divide-by-N counter in the feedback path with a programmable pulse swallowing counter. [...] This technique is usually referred to as a fractional-N synthesizer or fractional-N PLL.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{function}} is to determine loop dynamics, also called stability. [...] This is how the loop responds to disturbances, such as changes in the reference frequency, changes of the feedback divider, or at startup. [...] Common considerations are the range over which the loop can achieve lock (pull-in range, lock range or capture range), how fast the loop achieves lock (lock time, lock-up time or settling time) and damping behavior. [...] Depending on the application, this may require {{one or more of}} the following: a simple proportion (gain or attenuation), an integral (<b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter)</b> and/or derivative (high pass filter). [...] Loop parameters commonly examined for this are the loop's gain margin and phase margin. [...] Common concepts in control theory including the PID controller are used to design this function.|$|E

30|$|The edge-sharpening {{is also an}} {{important}} topic in image processing, which enhances the visual quality of images [6 – 9]. One of the classical edge enhancement methods is to use the “unsharpening filter”, where an image is <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered</b> and subtracted from the original, which leaves the high band signal that contains the edges. The high band signal is then amplified and added to the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered</b> image, which is the edge-sharpened result. When the Gaussian filter is used for the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering,</b> its subtraction from the original is the Laplacian of Gaussian, and thus the subband images so formed are called the Laplacian Pyramids [6]. In this process, since the noise in the high band can also be amplified, it is necessary to denoise all the subband images in the Laplacian pyramid.|$|R
