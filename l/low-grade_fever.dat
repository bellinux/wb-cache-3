5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever.</b> Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
25|$|Febricula {{is an old}} {{term for}} a <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever,</b> {{especially}} if the cause is unknown, no other symptoms are present, and the patient recovers fully {{in less than a}} week.|$|E
50|$|Other {{symptoms}} include diarrhea or constipation, chronic fatigue, nausea and vomiting, headaches, <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers,</b> heavy and/or irregular periods, and hypoglycemia.|$|R
50|$|People with AIDS often develop {{opportunistic}} infections that present with non-specific symptoms, especially <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers</b> and weight loss. These include opportunistic infection with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV can cause colitis, as described above, and CMV retinitis can cause blindness.|$|R

25|$|Mumps {{is usually}} {{preceded by a}} set of prodromal {{symptoms}} including <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever,</b> headache, and malaise. This is followed by progressive swelling of one or both parotid glands. Parotid gland swelling usually lasts about one week. Other symptoms of mumps can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears and some patients find it difficult to talk. A vaccine has been available since the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium chimaera, {{a member}} of the Mycobacterium avium complex, is a slow-growing, nontuberculous {{mycobacterium}} associated with outbreaks in cardiac-surgery patients supported on heart-lung machines. We report a case of an elderly woman on chronic prednisone who presented with a six-month history of worsening chronic back pain, recurrent <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers,</b> and weight loss.

The last phase includes symptoms of ischemia and pain {{associated with the use}} of limbs. Limbs are also cool and clammy in this stage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{a trip to}} Zambia, a {{previously}} healthy adult traveler presented with a prolonged illness characterized by <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers</b> and fatigue. Although malaria smears and antibody tests results for Plasmodium species were negative, a diagnosis of malaria was ultimately determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and species-specific nucleic acid hybridization techniques. The patient was successfully treated and cured. Clinical use of PCR technology may facilitate the identification of cases of smear-negative malaria, which {{up to the present}} time, have been difficult to diagnose...|$|R
25|$|Rotavirus {{gastroenteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by vomiting, watery diarrhoea, and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever.</b> Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear.

25|$|When {{a person}} becomes {{infected}} with norovirus, {{the virus is}} replicated within the small intestine. After approximately one to two days, norovirus infection symptoms can appear. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis that develops between 12 and 48 hours after exposure, and lasts for 24–72 hours. The disease is usually self-limiting, and characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, coughs, and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever</b> may occur.|$|E
25|$|On {{physical}} examination, {{the lungs}} are usually normal. Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over {{the affected area}} of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct). A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is exudative, detectable by decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds, and vocal resonance. Strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave, a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, and/or raised jugular venous pressure. A <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever</b> may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTuberculous {{peritonitis}} is {{a serious}} condition with rising prevalence in recent years. It is especially common in those patients with risk factors such as an immunocompromised state, chronic kidney disease, or cirrhosis/liver disease. Spread is typically hematogenous from pulmonary foci. We report on a 34 -year-old man who presented with initial complaints of cough, <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers,</b> abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting. Chest x-ray showed a cluster of nodular opacities on the right upper lobe, and a CT scan showed diffuse thickening and nodularity of the omentum with prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, consistent with tuberculous peritonitis...|$|R
500|$|After {{about three}} days, {{he seemed to}} be feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, but he still had <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers.</b> Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The laminitis treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|R
2500|$|Norovirus {{infection}} {{is characterized by}} nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. [...] A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. [...] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers</b> may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days. On surfaces, norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents.|$|R
25|$|Symptoms usually {{began to}} appear six to 11 days after initial infection, {{beginning}} with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to expectoration and sometimes hemoptysis. Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by the worms. These symptoms, along with a <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever,</b> can last several months if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if the worms are attached in the larynx. Weight loss and pneumonitis have been reported as possible long-term consequences, but not anemia.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{orthoreovirus}} {{does not}} really cause a significant disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to what a person might have when they have the common cold, such as a <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever</b> and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles {{it can be the}} cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.|$|E
25|$|The early (prodromal) {{symptoms}} in adolescents and adults are nausea, loss of appetite, aching muscles, and headache. This {{is followed by}} the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever</b> that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms, and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso, upper arms and legs; progressing over 10–12 hours to small bumps, blisters and pustules; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs.|$|E
30|$|A 40 -year-old {{white man}} was {{referred}} to our uveitis clinic with several weeks of painless, gradual vision loss in both eyes (OU) and several months of <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers</b> and weight loss. Five years prior to presentation, he {{had been diagnosed with}} uveitis and syphilis (rapid plasma reagin (RPR) 1 : 1, 024). After treatment with prednisolone acetate 1 % eye drops and three intramuscular penicillin injections, his vision returned to normal, but he did not return for follow-up. Just prior to referral to our clinic, his vision was 20 / 50 in the right eye (OD) and 20 / 60 in the left (OS); prednisolone acetate 1 % drops were started OU.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a 69 -year-old patient who {{underwent}} ascending aortic aneurysm repair with aortic valve replacement. On postsurgical day 12, he developed leukocytosis and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers.</b> The chest computed tomography (CT) showed a periaortic hematoma which represents a postsurgical change from aortic aneurysm repair, and a small pericardial effusion. The abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis without any sign of cholecystitis. Finally, a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -positron emission tomography (PET) /CT examination was ordered to find the cause of fever of unknown origin, and it showed increased FDG uptake in the gallbladder wall, with no uptake in the lumen. FDG-PET/CT can diagnose acute cholecystitis in patients with nonspecific clinical symptoms and laboratory results...|$|R

25|$|Aluminium {{compounds}} {{are used}} as immunologic adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of many vaccines. The aluminium apparently simulates or causes small amounts of tissue damage, driving the body to respond more powerfully to what it sees as a serious infection and promoting {{the development of a}} lasting immune response. In some cases these compounds have been associated with redness, itching, and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fever,</b> but the use of aluminium in vaccines has not been associated with serious adverse events. In some cases, aluminium-containing vaccines are associated with macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF), localized microscopic lesions containing aluminium salts that persist for up to 8 years. However, recent case-controlled studies have found no specific clinical symptoms in individuals with biopsies showing MMF, and {{there is no evidence that}} aluminium-containing vaccines are a serious health risk or justify changes to immunization practice.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of aortic valve {{endocarditis}} caused by Bartonella henselae. The patient initially presented to a regional hospital with generalized symptoms including lethargy, malaise and decreased appetite. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large vegetation on the aortic valve and he was treated empirically with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Several blood cultures were obtained which all returned negative results and the {{white blood cell count}} was normal. He was transferred to our hospital, with persistence of his initial symptoms and additional <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers.</b> In light of his negative culture results, serological testing for Bartonella and Chlamydia was performed, which gave a positive result for Bartonella henselae. In view of this result and following development of severe aortic valve insufficiency, he underwent an aortic valve replacement and made a good recovery...|$|R
40|$|Primary Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) {{infection}} in children is common and frequently asymptomatic. While symptomatic patients typically present with features of infectious mononucleosis, a rare complication of primary EBV is acute acalculous cholecystitis. A 6 year old previously healthy boy presented with 6 days of <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers,</b> non-bloody non-bilious vomiting, and periumbilical pain. Based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic evidence, {{the patient was}} diagnosed with acute acalculous cholecystitis due to a primary EBV infection. The patient improved with supportive therapy and remained asymptomatic at follow-up. Overall, clinicians should consider EBV {{infection in}} the setting of multi-organ disease and blood dyscrasia. Furthermore, while the pathogenesis of EBV cholecystitis is still unclear, {{it is important to note}} that these patients may improve with supportive treatment and do not require surgical intervention...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis is a 78 {{year old}} male with a past medical history of {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD), {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), hypertension (HTN), and gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) who presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers</b> for one week prior to admission. He was originally diagnosed with healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP) and an acute on chronic COPD exacerbation and treated with prednisone, inhalers, ipratropium/albuterol, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. His symptoms were slow to respond to therapy and he continued to have end-expiratory wheezes with persistent SOB. A CT of his chest was ordered to rule out a possible pulmonary embolus (PE) and instead showed an obstructing mass in the bronchus. Pulmonology was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy, which revealed a foreign body (bean) causing the obstruction, which was removed, and the patient’s symptoms improved shortly thereafter...|$|R
40|$|Hodgkin's {{lymphoma}} {{accounts for}} {{ten percent of}} all lymphomas. In the United States, there are about 8000 new cases every year. This paper describes a case of lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma (LRHL) manifested by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). A 27 -year-old Israeli male presented with dizziness associated with one month of <b>low-grade</b> <b>fevers</b> and night sweats; he also complained of persistent cough, pruritus, and ten-pound weight lost during this time. The CBC revealed hemoglobin of 5. 9 [*]gm/dL, and direct Coomb's test detected multiple nonspecific antibodies consistent with the diagnosis of AIHA. Chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT scan showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Lymph node biopsy revealed classic LRHL.
