40|$|Background and Objectives: Pre-hospital {{emergency}} services {{are one of}} the main determinants of the services outcome. Patients' satisfactions from these services <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>promoting</b> their trust and finally improving the services quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} survey patients' satisfaction from pre-hospital {{emergency services}} in Tabriz. Material and Methods: In this cross sectional study, data were gathered using a validated questionnaire. Sampling was conducted among pre-hospital emergency services users in 2013 in Tabriz. Using Cochran formula, 1052 samples were selected through systematic random sampling method. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 21. Results: Among the pre-hospital emergency services users, 52. 8 % were men, most of them were married (62 %) and 74 % of the patients using pre-hospital emergency services were recovered. It was revealed that 69. 2 % of the participants were completely satisfied with emergency services. Patients' marital status and gender had no correlation with satisfaction level. Conclusion: Results showed an acceptable level of patients' satisfaction from pre-hospital emergency services in Tabriz. To maintain and improve the patients' satisfaction, its identified determinants in this study should be considered and appropriate policies need to be made to improve services quality...|$|E
40|$|Background & Objective : Libraries {{are among}} main parts of {{universities}} as libraries {{of high quality}} lead to improvement in education and research within universities and the society. Assessing quality of services in educational systems is important to improve quality of provided services. This {{study was conducted to}} assess the quality of services provided by the central library of Kerman University of Medical Sciences from the faculty members and students’ point of view. Methods : In this study, 200 faculty members and students of Kerman University of Medical Sciences were chosen using stratified random sampling. The data was collected using LibQUAL+TM standard questionnaire after its validity and reliability were confirmed Results : Our findings showed that the mean score of general satisfaction of the central library’s provided services was 6. 13 out of 9. Among the three aspects of library service quality, information control was the most satisfactory factor (5. 98) which was followed by efficacy of services (5. 96) and the library’s atmosphere (5. 89). Faculty members were more satisfied with the central library’s provided services in all aspects compared to students, although this difference was not significant. The most frequent referral to the central library and using references was once a month. Conclusion : Although {{the findings of this study}} were suggestive of faculty members and students’ relative satisfaction of provided services, improving quality of services necessitates better and more organized planning. Improvement of library service quality can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>promoting</b> faculty members and students’ scientific level in universities of medical sciences, medical knowledge, and medical education.

This study {{investigated}} the importance of metacognition that helps students? self-directed and self-reflective learning. With that purpose, document analysis method {{as one of the}} qualitative research methods was used in the study. In the document analysis, metacognition was researched in terms of learning, teaching and assessment. The literature review showed that metacognition can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>promoting</b> students? academic achivement. A myriad of studies indicated that metacognitive teaching {{plays an important role in}} students? metacognitive skills and learning. Besides, using learning-oriented assessment methods during metacognitive teaching can enhance students? metagontion level (Jones, 2007). Therefore, in the course of teaching, using or expanding learning-oriented assessment methods is important for students? metacognitive development. Many reserchers agree that measuring metacognition is so difficult due to its complex nature. Therefore, in order to collect more valid and reliable evidence about students? metacognitive domain, the students should interact with metacognitive activities having adequate level of difficulty...|$|E

30|$|The {{disposal}} of radionuclide wastewater from commercial nuclear plants {{is a major}} issues associated with nuclear waste management because it is highly toxic to the environment, particularly to human health (Ahmadpour et al. 2010). Many researchers have used various physico-chemical processes to remove radionuclides such as chemical precipitation, flocculation, ion exchange, membrane process, immobilization and adsorption (Mishra and Tiwary 1999; El-Kamash et al. 2006; Rawat et al. 2006; Rout et al. 2006; Omar et al. 2009). Fujita et al. (2008) investigated a pump and treat method, but {{found that it was}} ineffective at removal of radionuclides from the contaminated environment. Therefore, an alternative method of MICP involved cleaning up the radionuclides safely from the environment. The MICP method stimulates ureolytic microorganisms <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> CaCO 3 precipitation, which in turn <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> co-precipitation of radionuclides by substitution of Ca 2 + ion and formation of radionuclide carbonate minerals (Mitchell and Ferris 2006; Fujita et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Until recently, {{neuroscience}} {{has given}} sleep research and discovery of better treatments of sleep disturbances little attention, {{despite the fact}} that disturbed sleep has overwhelming impact on human health. Sleep is a complex phenomenon in which specific psychological, electrophysiological, neurochemical, endocrinological, immunological and genetic factors are involved. The brain as both the generator and main object of sleep is obviously of particular interest which makes a neuroscience-driven view the most promising approach to evaluate clinical implications and applications of sleep research. Polysomnography as the gold standard of sleep research, complemented by brain imaging, neuroendocrine testing, genomics and other laboratory measures can help to create composite biomarkers that allow maximizing the effects of individualized therapies while minimizing adverse effects.
