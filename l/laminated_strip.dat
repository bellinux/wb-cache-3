The new product is fabricated by four processes: embossing of strip; multi bending of embossed strip; flux injection; and resizing of the material. This flux <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> exhibits similar melting characteristics to flux cored and flux coated alloys. The flux <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> eliminates the need for a separate fluxing operation that is typically needed when using bulk alloy. The product ensures the correct amount of flux during the brazing process and reduces the post-braze clean time. The ability to produce a quality joint while reducing the amount of pre-braze and post-braze operations make flux <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> an innovative Eco-braze-materials...|$|E
40|$|A plane {{elasticity}} {{solution is}} derived {{for the end}} problem in a two-layer <b>laminated</b> <b>strip.</b> The laminae may have arbitrary elastic constants and an arbitrary thickness ratio. The solution is obtained {{as a series of}} non-orthogonal eigenfunctions, each of which varies exponentially along the axis of the strip. Each exponential coefficient is a complex root of an eigenvalue equation that results from the requirement of compatible displacements at the interface. The general solution obtained in this paper may be used to find the stress field in a two-layer <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> subjected to specified self-equilibrating end loading. It thus permits the determination of the stress concentration near the end which is usually neglected by invok-ing St. Venant’s Principle...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of interlaminar stresses has prompted {{a fresh look}} at the theory of laminated plates. An important feature in modelling such laminates is the need to provide for continuity of some strains and stresses, {{while at the same time}} allowing for the discontinuities in the others. A new modelling possibility is examined in this paper. The procedure allows for discontinuities in the in-plane stresses and transverse strains and continuity in the in-plane strains and transverse stresses. This theory is in the form of a heirarchy of formulations each representing an iterative step. Application of the theory is illustrated by considering the example of an infinite <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> subjected to sinusoidal loading...|$|E

40|$|The use of near-surface mounted (NSM) <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> made {{of carbon}} fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) {{is one of}} the most recent and {{promising}} techniques for the repair and rehabilitation of reinforced concrete (RC) members. This technique has recently proved its applicability to improve flexural and or shear capacity of structural members. Several studies on experimental and analytical models of RC members strengthened with NSM <b>laminate</b> CFRP <b>strips</b> have been conducted. However, the influence of different bond behavior and the stress redistribution in RC members strengthened with fibers has not been sufficiently investigated. Also the influence of strengthening with NSM <b>laminate</b> CFRP <b>strips</b> on the tension stiffening and cracking of reinforced concrete members has not been sufficiently studied. In this research an analytical model is proposed that takes into account the influence of different bond behavior and stress redistribution between steel reinforcement and <b>laminate</b> CFRP <b>strips</b> on stress limitation and crack control under service loadings (SLS). Ten uniaxial tensile tests were carried out. Three specimens without <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> were used as reference specimens, while seven specimens were strengthened with <b>laminate</b> CFRP <b>strips.</b> The influence of the ratio between the CFRP strips cross section Area (ACFRP) and steel area (ASteel), the distance between the strips, the cracking and the type of load (static or cyclic) on the stress redistribution is studied. Based on the proposed analytical model it is possible to predict the stress in the steel reinforcement and <b>laminate</b> CFRP <b>strips...</b>|$|R
40|$|The stress-function-based variational {{method of}} Yin (1991) is {{extended}} and modified into a combined layer/sublaminate approach applicable to a <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> {{composed of a}} large number of differently orientated, anisotropic elastic plies. Lekhnitskii's (1963) stress functions are introduced into two interior layers adjacent to a particular interface. The remaining layers are grouped into an upper sublaminate and a lower sublaminate. The stress functions are expanded in truncated power series of the thickness coordinate, and the differential equations governing the coefficient functions are derived by using the complementary virtual work principle. The layer/sublaminate approach limits the dimension of the eigenvalue problem to a fixed number irrespective of the number of layers in the sublaminate, so that reasonably accurate solutions of the interlaminar stresses can be computed with extreme ease. For symmetric, four-layer, angle-ply and cross-ply laminates, a comparison of the previous analysis results based on the pure layer model and new results based on two different layer/sublaminate models indicates reasonable over-all agreement in the interlaminar stresses and superior agreement in the total peeling and shearing force...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of Active Fiber Composites (AFC) as sensors for detecting damage, a pretwisted strip made of AFC with symmetric free-edge delamination is considered in this paper. The strain developed on the top/bottom of the strip is measured to detect and assess delamination. Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) {{is used in the}} development of a non-classical non-linear cross sectional model of the strip. The original three dimensional (3 D) problem is simplified by the decomposition into two simpler problems: a two-dimensional (2 D) problem, which provides in a compact form the cross-sectional properties using VAM, and a non-linear one-dimensional (1 D) problem along the length of the beam. This procedure gives the non-linear stiffnesses, which are very sensitive to damage, at any given cross-section of the strip. The developed model is used to study a special case of cantilevered <b>laminated</b> <b>strip</b> with antisymmetric layup, loaded only by an axial force at the tip. The charge generated in the AFC lamina is derived in closed form in terms of the 1 D strain measures. It is observed that delamination length and location have a definite influence on the charge developed in the AFC lamina. Also, sensor voltage output distribution along the length of the beam is obtained using evenly distributed electrode strip. These data could in turn be used to detect the presence of damage...|$|E

The analytical approach, using a displacement field which decays exponentially in the axial direction, {{gives rise to}} a transcendental equation for the real eigenvalues. The decay rate for the stresses is given in terms of the smallest positive eigenvalue. <b>Laminated</b> <b>strips</b> with periodic layout ale then considered. In the presence of imperfect bonding, the effective shear elastic moduli, computed through a homogenization method, depend on the total number of slipping interfaces in the laminate.

The NSM technique is based on fixing, by epoxy adhesive, CFRP <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> into saw-cut slits on the concrete cover of lateral surfaces of the beams. To assess the efficacy of this technique, an experimental program of fourpoint bending tests was carried out. Each of the four tested series was composed of five beams: without any shear reinforcement; reinforced with conventional steel stirrups; strengthened with U strips of wet lay-up CFRP sheets; and two beams strengthened with precured <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> of CFRP, one of them with laminates positioned at 90 º {{and the other with}} laminates positioned at 45 º in relation to the beam axis. Influences of the <b>laminate</b> <b>strip</b> percentage, <b>laminate</b> <b>strip</b> inclination and beam height on the efficacy of the NSM technique were analyzed. This efficacy was assessed {{not only in terms of}} the increase of maximum load and deflection at beam rupture, but also in terms of the beam strength performance per unit length of the applied material. Neste trabalho apresenta-se a técnica de reforço ao corte baseada na inserção de laminados de CFRP em finos entalhes efectuados nas faces laterais de vigas de betão armado.

The problem {{is governed by}} a fourth-order partial differential equation for the Airy stress function with discontinuous coefficients at the layer interfaces, where displacements and traction continuities are imposed.

External face and interface conditions are used to obtain the characteristic; equation for the eigenvalues governing the decay rate of end effects along the strip. For orthotropic and strongly orthotropic sandwich strips the transcendental eigenvalue equation is explicitly given. The case of <b>laminated</b> <b>strips</b> with periodic layout is finally considered. Making use of the homogenization method, both effective elastic constants and expressions for the local stress variation at the layer level are obtained. Numerical calculations confirm that the eigenvalues of the homogenized material are the asymptotic values of those of periodically <b>laminated</b> <b>strips</b> when the number of layers increases. Moreover, homogenization method is shown to be very powerful also in the calculation of local stress distributions...|$|R

40|$|The {{flexural}} and the {{shear resistance}} of concrete, masonry and timber structures can be efficiently increased using near-surface mounted (NSM) CFRP <b>laminate</b> <b>strips.</b> This technique consists on introducing CFRP <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> into grooves {{made on the}} cover concrete of the structural elements to be strengthened. Bond behavior of CFRP reinforcement is a key feature, {{not only for the}} strengthening efficacy provided by this technique, but also in the structural design. To assess the local bond stress-slip relationship, a numerical strategy was developed taking into account the results obtained in monotonic and cyclic pullout-bending tests that were carried out for this purpose. This relationship was transformed into a bond stress-slip constitutive law for a line interface finite element, used to simulate the concrete-CFRP bond behavior. Important design aspects, like the anchorage length of the CFRP to accomplish the requisites imposed by service and ultimate limit state analysis, can also be determined by the developed model.

A Near Surface Mounted (NSM) strengthening technique was developed to increase the shear resistance of concrete beams. The NSM technique is based on fixing, by epoxy adhesive, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> into pre-cut slits opened in the concrete cover of lateral surfaces of the beams. To assess the efficacy of this technique, an experimental program of four-point bending tests was carried out with reinforced concrete beams failing in shear. Each of the four tested series was composed of five beams: without any shear reinforcement; reinforced with steel stirrups; strengthened with strips of wet lay-up CFRP sheets; and two beams strengthened with NSM precured <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> of CFRP, one of them with laminates positioned at 90 º {{and the other with}} laminates positioned at 45 º in relation to the beam axis. Influences of the <b>laminate</b> <b>strip</b> inclination, beam depth and longitudinal tensile steel reinforcement ratio on the efficacy of the strengthening techniques were analyzed. Amongst the CFRP strengthening techniques, the NSM with <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> at 45 º was the most effective, {{not only in terms of}} increasing beam shear resistance but also in assuring larger deformation capacity at beam failure. This technique was also faster and easier to apply than the externally bonded one. The performance of the ACI and fib analytical formulations for the EBR shear strengthening was appraised. In general, the contribution of the CFRP systems predicted by the analytical formulations was slightly larger than the values registered experimentally. Performance of the formulation by Nanni et al. for NSM strengthening technique was also appraised. Using bond stress and CFRP effective strain values obtained in pullout bending tests with NSM CFRP laminate system, the formulation by Nanni et al. predicted a contribution of this CFRP system for the beam shear resistance of 72 % the experimentally recorded values.

40|$|In recent years, a {{strengthening}} technique {{based on}} near-surface mounted (NSM) <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) {{has been used}} to increase the load-carrying capacity of concrete and masonry structures by introducing <b>laminate</b> <b>strips</b> into precut grooves on the concrete cover of the elements to be strengthened. The high experimentally derived levels of strength efficacy with concrete columns, beams, and masonry panels have presented NSM as a viable and promising technique. This practice requires no surface preparation work and, after cutting the groove, requires minimal installation time compared to the externally bonded reinforcing technique. A further advantage associated with NSM CFRP is its ability to significantly reduce the probability of harm resulting from fire, acts of vandalism, mechanical damage, and aging effects. To assess the bond behavior of CFRP to concrete, pullout-bending tests have been carried out. The influences of bond length and concrete strength on bond behavior are analyzed, the tests are described, and the results are presented and discussed in detail. Finally, a local stress-slip relationship is determined based on both experimental results and a numerical strategy. S&P. Bettor MBT Portugal. Secil. Solucel...|$|R

40|$|Use of {{prestressed}} FRP reinforcement {{represents a}} significant contribution to the advancement of the FRP strengthening technique, and several methods have been developed to prestress the FRP composites under real life conditions. This technique has also some disadvantages, being more expensive than normal strip bonding due to the greater number of operations and equipment that is required. The operation also takes somewhat longer, as the equipment that holds the strip to the beam soffit must remain in place until the adhesive has sufficiently hardened. However, use of prestressed FRP reinforcement for flexural strengthening of RC beams in shape of fabrics has not increased as widely as that of <b>laminated</b> <b>strips.</b> This is mostly due to the difficulty of seizing the fabric when prestressing it, without ripping the fibres. So far research has produced devices that are effective in seizing and prestressing <b>laminated</b> <b>strips,</b> because of their higher transverse stiffness, and field applications have been already carried out. On the other hand, significant problems have been encountered in developing as effective devices for FRP fabrics: the only way to seize a fabric without the risk of ripping it, due to local concentration of stresses, is to wrap it around a round object with an appropriate rounding radius. A new device is proposed to effectively seize and prestress FRP fabrics. The main advantage of the seizing-tensioning device is that it may also allow differential prestressing of the fabric along the beam axis, thus inhibiting the risk of debonding at the free ends of the fabric, in case the fabric is not mechanically end-restrained...|$|R
