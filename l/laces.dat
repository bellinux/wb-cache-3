5|$|<b>Laces,</b> straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional {{blue and gold}} colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his <b>laces</b> {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.|$|E
25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as <b>laces,</b> straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with <b>laces</b> {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the <b>laces.</b> Uppers with <b>laces</b> also have eyelets or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and loosen the <b>laces</b> and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.|$|E

Antwerp <b>lace</b> is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin <b>lace.</b> It has a cordonnet, or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin <b>lace</b> does. The cordonnet was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp <b>lace</b> was also similar to Binche <b>lace</b> in its cordonnet.

5000|$|Originally crocheted <b>lace</b> was not {{regarded}} as true <b>lace.</b> Crocheting {{was considered an}} easy, and less time-consuming, but otherwise clearly inferior surrogate for [...] "true" [...] <b>lace</b> such as bobbin <b>lace,</b> needle <b>lace</b> or [...] netting. The first examples of crocheted <b>lace</b> try to reproduce the products of other lacemaking techniques as faithfully as possible.

It {{launched}} the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior {{as well as the}} shoe <b>laces.</b> This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the <b>laces</b> for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} manifestation of ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy is intention (action) tremor, which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements, such as tying shoe <b>laces</b> or writing with a pencil.

As the hand gets closer to accomplishing the intended task, the trembling intensifies {{which makes it}} even more difficult to complete.|$|E
