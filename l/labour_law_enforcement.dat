40|$|Excerpt] The {{proliferation}} of corporate {{codes of conduct}} generates both alliance and tension between trade unions and NGOs that deal with workers’ rights in the global economy. Alliance, because trade unions and NGOs share a common desire to halt abusive behaviour by multinational companies and a broader goal of checking corporate power in the global economy. Tension, because unions and NGOs have differing institutional interests, different analyses of problems and potential solutions, and different ways of thinking and talking about social justice in the global economy. There are fears that codes of conduct {{may be used to}} undermine effective <b>labour</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> by governmental authorities and undermine workers’ power in trade unions. The substance behind the rhetoric on this new generation of corporate codes of conduct is certainly open to question. However, this paper argues that, given unions’ weak presence in the global assembly line and the rapid-response capabilities of many NGOs, such codes are a valuable asset. Trade unions and NGOs still {{have more in common with}} each other than either has with corporations, governments, or international organisations that see free trade and free-flowing capital as the solution to low labour standards. But both need to be clear-eyed about their differences and their proper roles as they navigate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead...|$|E

Developments such as the emergence of global financial networks, outsourcing, relocation and the establishment of networks of enterprises have had far-reaching consequences for labour relations and <b>labour</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b> This article examines a few of the issues raised by these transformations together with {{the ways in which they}} could be managed – tentatively at this stage – in law, particularly with reference to the experience of France and Europe. 1 Born of the second industrial revolution, contemporary labour law is, historically, the outcome of a gradual process of construction, concomitant with that of productive organization itself, within national boundaries. Such law, be it statutory or contractual, was strongly influenced by the integrated large-scale enterprise model. It conceptualizes wage employment relationships in terms of binary relations between employers and workers. It is therefore hardly surprising that the reorganization of firms, under the combined effects of financial concentration and productive decentralization, should give rise to a new set of needs for protection. The necessary evolution of labour law has already been the subjec...|$|E

However, dynamic regional microsimulation models to forecast crime or to simulate the effect of social welfare, <b>labour,</b> and <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> policies are not currently available. This paper outlines a proposal for developing a special crime module which would be linked to an existing dynamic spatial microsimulation model called SVERIGE (System for Visualising Economic and Regional Influences Governing the Environment). It describes how a unique geographically descriptive micro database called TOPSWING (Total Population of Sweden, Individual and Geographical database) housed at the Spatial Modelling Centre in Kiruna, Sweden, {{might be used to}} generate input data for developing estimates of individual propensities to commit imprisonable offences. It also describes how equations in such a module might be specified and how they could be linked with other economic and demographic variables in the microsimulation model. The paper concludes by suggesting issues and policies that could be investigated using microsimulation methods.

A Thai labour court awarded the equivalent of US$106,000 in damages to 66 trafficking victims rescued in the September 2006 raid of a separate shrimp processing factory in Samut Sakhon. However, as of March 2008, the government has yet to initiate criminal prosecution of the factory's operators. In other cases involving possible trafficking for <b>labour</b> exploitation, <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> reported 41 cases of labour fraud and 16 cases of illegal labour recruitment. The Ministry of Labour's Department of Employment reported that 28 labour recruiting firms were prosecuted in administrative labour courts in 2007 for violating regulations on labour recruitment rendering workers vulnerable to trafficking. These prosecutions mostly resulted in monetary fines, with only one licence suspension. Department of Social Welfare officials and NGOs use the threat of punitive sanctions under the 1998 Labour Protection Act to negotiate settlements with abusive employers exploiting foreign trafficking victims in sweatshops and in domestic work. A total of 189 individual facilitators or brokers received fines and other administrative sanctions for violating labour recruiting regulations in 2007.|$|R
