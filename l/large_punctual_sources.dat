30|$|It {{is assumed}} that the {{received}} signal strength (RSS) measured at each sensor {{is proportional to the}} target-sensor distance to the power of a constant or a parameter, the distance power law. For a motivating example, the signal from a microphone (measured in Volts) is ideally proportional to the sound pressure (in Pascal), which in turn decays inversely proportional to the sound source distance. This holds for <b>punctual</b> <b>sources</b> and free-space propagation. By identifying the RSS with the mean square of the received signal, the decay (for <b>punctual</b> <b>sources</b> in free space) is thus expected to decay inversely proportional to the distance square. However, in the non-ideal case, factors like reflection, diffraction, and refraction influence the RSS decay in a way that generally is difficult or expensive to predict. The approach here is to keep the distance power law for its simplicity, but allow for the decay exponent to adapt to the current situation. Thus, the exponent is considered as an unknown parameter.|$|R

This increment drives the necessity to improve available infrastructure, like roads for instance, to satisfy a higher demand. Bigger roads and higher number of vehicles have raised the concern about possible pollution coming from these sources In this thesis, copper coming from road runoff in a peri-urban catchment in Portugal was analyzed. The catchment {{is located in the}} Coimbra region, center of Portugal. In order to model copper pollution in road runoff, it is necessary to couple a hydrological model and a water quality Based on a previous study (Kalantari, Ferreira, Walsh, Ferreira, & Destouni, 2017) a physical based hydrological model  MIKE SHE  coupled with the hydraulic model MIKE 11 was updated and further coupled with  ECO Lab to simulate water quality and ecological processes. The results show an improvement of the hydrological model compared with the original one, nash-sutcliffe efficiency was raised from 0. 59 to 0. 77 and the coefficient of determination varied from 0. 64 to 0. 79. For copper the model behavior for <b>punctual</b> and distributed <b>sources</b> was analyzed. For <b>punctual</b> <b>sources,</b> highest concentrations were present in the grid points where the incoming sources were located in the tributaries, and these concentrations are rapidly reduced downstream. On the other hand, distributed sources approach gives higher concentrations {{near the end of the}} river than in the tributaries upstream. Comparing time-averaged model results along the river, with fresh water quality criteria according to U. S. EPA (2004), for <b>punctual</b> <b>sources</b> an extension of 978 meters (7, 6 % of the river) presents a concentration above CCC or CMC, on the contrary, for distributed sources the extension is lower with 494 meters (3, 8 %). The organic carbon partitioning coefficient have bigger influence on the results than other factors, nevertheless this influence is not marked. Modeled copper values do not agree well with the mesured values specially for periods with higher discharge as the model simulates lower concentration with higher discharge and viceversa. Copper boundary values for the model represent a big challenge considering limited data available.

In this work, {{the focus is on the}} calculation of the sound pressure in free space generated during squeal events. The calculation of the sound pressure can be performed by the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The inputs of this method are a boundary element model, a field of normal velocity characterized by a unique frequency. However, the field of velocity associated with friction-induced vibrations is composed of several harmonic components. So, the BEM equation has to be solved for each frequencies and in most cases, the number of harmonic component is significant. Therefore, the computation time can be prohibitive. The reduction of the number of harmonic component is a key point for the quick estimation of the squeal noise. The proposed approach is based on the detection and the selection of the predominant harmonic components in the mean square velocity. It is applied on two cases of squeal and allows us to consider only few frequencies. In this study, a new method will be proposed in order to quickly well estimate the noise emission in free space.

However, EMC problems are currently treated after the production ofa prototype, which causes additional costs and significant delays if therequired standards are not reached. In order to consider the compliance toEMC standards {{from the very beginning}} of the design phase, a method hasbeen developed at Laboratoire Ampère to predict near-field coupling betweencomplex components. This predictive method is based on the multipolarexpansion in spherical harmonics of the field close to the element. Thiselement can then be represented by an equivalent <b>punctual</b> <b>source</b> composed ofthe elements of a multipolar expansion, which allows the computation of thenear-field coupling with other elements. The mutual inductance, which represents the magnetic coupling between twoobjects, can be computed once the coefficients of the multipolar developmentare known. To this purpose, a dedicated measuring bench has been designed inLaboratoire Ampère: the multipolar expansion is obtained by the measurementof magnetic field all around the source. Ideally, these field should be measuredin the real environment, with all other elements present, but not excited. However, this is not always practical. In the proposed approach, all the usefulinformation is obtained from measurement of the isolated element. Then themutual inductance can be computed for any set of element positions using thevector-spherical-harmonic addition theorem. Nevertheless, as a result of theabsence of the second source during measurements, the mutual inductancecomputed in this method can possibly differs from the theoretical value. Thisis mainly due to the coupling of second order in the system and the conductingmetal in the secondary element. In this paper, we first expose how the induced currents can sometimes affectthe computed mutual impedance. We propose to study a canonical problem inwhich two systems, composed of a loop source and a passive one, arepositioned close one from the other. The study of the error between thecomputed and the theoretical value of the mutual impedance show that theerror depends on several parameters such as the position of each element, theshape of the conducting metal, etc., which means that the proposed approachcannot always be applied. In the end, a corrective method using the samemeasuring bench is proposed to take into account the effects of inducedcurrents...|$|R

It specifically requires to assess plumes originating from <b>punctual</b> <b>sources</b> such as those due to industrial activities, in order to check if they do not spread and degrade the chemical state of the groundwater bodies. In this context, BRGM (French Geological Survey) supported by the AERMC (Water Agency on the Mediterranean Rhone River basin) has developed an innovative methodologyto assess the impact of industrial activities on the quality of groundwater body. This methodology has been tested and applied on the whole Rhone River basin which covers one quarter of France, five regions and thirty counties. The assessment methodology includes three phases: 1) Inventory of industrial pressures and identification of targeted industrial areas; 2) Assessment of groundwater quality body with respect to industrial contaminants; 3) Assessment of industrial pressures and their impact on the groundwater body. These phases result in technical factsheet on each targeted industrial zone and a proposition for groundwater quality status of each groundwater body of concern. Overall, 57 targeted industrial areas were selected and studied. The assessment of groundwater quality in these zones enabled to identify compounds or groups of compounds causing groundwater degradation. Sixty-five percentage of studied areas were impacted with contaminants (those being by order of importance metals, hydrocarbons, HVOCs and BTEX) originating from around 420 sites. An impact rate (None /local / wide) was attributed for each site / contaminant couple. This " pressure/impact " method enabled to combine industrial data and groundwater data and to give an unprecedented assessment of groundwater quality at the regional scale (contaminated land being mostly managed at the site level in France). It processed numerous groundwater data. The deployment of this innovative methodology at the Mediterranean Rhone River basin scale required a strong engagement with numerous stakeholders (local authorities, regional water agencies, etc.), which in turn fed in the project by providing data and their points of views on the regional-scale project results. The outcomes of this project were used by the AERMC to report groundwater state and quality (with respect to impact from punctual pressures) in compliance with the groundwater directive. The findings enabled to define priority areas where further innovative methodology on regional groundwater body management-encompassing eg multi-sources management, less stringent groundwater objective setting-is currently being developed...|$|R

Hence, engineers must compute the equivalent resistance {{of the system and}} the potential distribution on the earth surface when a fault condition occurs [1], [2], [3]. While very crude approximations were available until the 70 ’s, several computer methods have been more recently proposed on the basis of practice, semi-empirical works and intuitive ideas such as superposition of <b>punctual</b> current <b>sources</b> and error averaging [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Although these techniques are widely used, several problems have been reported. Namely: large computational requirements, unrealistic results when segmentation of conductors is increased, and uncertainty in the margin of error [2], [5]. A Boundary Element formulation for grounding analysis is presented in this paper. Existing computer methods such as APM are identified as particular cases within this theoretical framework. While linear and quadratic leakage current elements allow to increase accuracy, computing time is reduced by means of new analytical integration techniques. Former intuitive ideas can now be explained as suitable assumptions introduced in the BEM formulation to reduce computational cost. Thus, the anomalous asymptotic behaviour of this kind of methods is mathematically explained, and sources of error are rigorously identified...|$|R
30|$|Guaranteeing the {{stability}} of such impoundments {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks in mine waste management. These storage basins are in fact particularly vulnerable to failure for the following reasons (Rico et al. 2008 a): (1) dams made of locally derived filling material (soil, coarse waste, overburden material from mining operations and tailings); (2) dams subsequently raised as solid material coupled with a severe increase in effluent (plus runoff from precipitation); (3) lack of regulations on specific design criteria; (4) their extremely <b>large</b> area makes <b>punctual</b> criticality identification difficult, and would require an extensive and continuous monitoring, which, apart from the very high costs, is also time consuming, and (5) the high cost of remediation works, following the closure of mining activities.|$|R
