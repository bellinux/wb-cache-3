50|$|Where land is registered, as is now common, {{there are}} further {{circumstances}} where an equitable easement will arise. Where both the dominant and servient tenements are registered, easements must be registered against both titles {{under the terms}} of the Land Registration Act 1925. Failure to do so will render them easements in equity only, although they will still bind purchasers under rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925. Where the servient land is unregistered, it is likely that the easement will not have to be registered against the dominant title, even if that is itself registered land. This has been disputed, however, and is significant because if legal would bind successors after first registration whereas an equitable easement would require registration as a <b>land</b> <b>charge.</b> Rule 250(1) allows for easements to arise in equity through prescription where the title is registered, but a right arising through prescription would be created as a legal easement and there seems to be no part of this process where the owner of the dominant tenement has a right in equity only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{considers}} {{the question of}} land relations regulation through the triad of connected blocks of economic, ecological and social direction, which will enforce in the appropriate institutional environment during {{the transition to the}} sustainable development the harmonic society development. The economic aspect of the regulation forms the effective system of taxation on the plots of land using, payment of the <b>land</b> <b>charge,</b> applying of the mechanism of the compensation of land tenants damages, expediency and efficiency of the land tenure. The ecological aspect determines processes of society and land recourses interaction as to protect and reproduce the land recourses potential. The social aspect foresees the possibility of the creation of comfortable dwelling conditions for inhabitants, the fair access and distribution of land recourses among different layers of land users. As a result, the application of the sustainable land tenure principles is proposed, which will enforce the forming of the effective system of the land relations regulation during the transition to the sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch {{mortgage}} (hypotheek) is {{a limited}} real right which gives the creditor a very high rank in the debtor's insolvency and which gives its holder a quick and very practical means of organising a forced sale of the burdened property. The mortgage is in principle accessory to, that is, linked to the secured claim. To give two examples, when the secured claim lapses {{as a result of}} payment the mortgage lapses also and when the secured claim is assigned, the mortgage automatically passes to the assignee. This is called the principle of accessoriness. This principle primarily aims at protecting the mortgagor. In order to enhance the mortgagor's protection the assignee of the secured claim cannot rely on the public land register for the existence or amount of the secured claim. If the secured claim had already been repaid before the assignment, but the claim and mortgage are still registered in the land register, the assignee receives neither a claim nor a mortgage. This Dutch system is contrasted with German law which takes a different approach for the Verkehrshypothek. Here German law favours the bona fide assignee over the debtor by enabling the assignee to rely on the public land register. In the past this applied equally to the more common German Grundschuld (<b>land</b> <b>charge),</b> which was always described as non-accessory. As the non-accessory character has recently given rise to misuse by assignees, the German legislator has changed the law (in the so-called Risikobegrenzungsgesetz) to enable the chargor to set up against the assignee any defences which he had against the assignor, for example the defence that the debt had already been redeemed (partly). This change in the rules on the Grundschuld entered into force on the 19 th August 2008. The effect is that at the moment of enforcement the Grundschuld is accessory, like the Dutch mortgage. The changes did not affect the German Hypothek so that the Verkehrshypothek is now much less accessory than the German Grundschuld, notably at the time of enforcement. This is a very remarkable change because the German Grundschuld has always been the archetype of a non-accessory mortgage. It no longer is. ...|$|E
