5|$|In prokaryotes the cytosol {{contains}} the cell's genome, within a structure {{known as a}} nucleoid. This is an irregular mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the transcription and replication of the bacterial chromosome and plasmids. In eukaryotes the genome is held within the cell nucleus, which is separated from the cytosol by nuclear pores that block the free diffusion of any molecule <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 10nanometres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Small prey {{is usually}} torn into chunks and eaten {{completely}} including bones and fur, while prey <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 100g (4oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary {{to what is}} sometimes assumed, the barn owl does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis. Regionally, non-rodent foods are used as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) or true crickets (Gryllidae). Bats and even frogs, lizards and snakes may make a minor but {{significant contribution to the}} diet; small Soricomorpha like Suncus shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{satellite}} transmitters for bird movements is currently restricted by transmitter size – to species <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 400g. They may {{be attached to}} migratory birds (geese, swans, cranes, penguins etc.) or other species such as penguins that undertake long-distance movements. Individuals may be tracked by satellites for immense distances, for the lifetime of the transmitter battery. As with wing tags, the transmitters may be designed to drop off when the bird moults; {{or they may be}} recovered by recapturing the bird.|$|E

50|$|Editing {{took place}} from April 10-12, while Psy was also {{preparing}} for his concert. He {{said that in}} that week, he got five years older. He estimates the production cost was <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> expected, <b>about</b> $150,000, partly from schedule changes on his part.|$|R
50|$|Onagers are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> donkeys at <b>about</b> 200 kg to 290 kg in {{size and}} 2.1 m to 2.5 m in head-body length. Male onagers are usually <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> females.|$|R
25|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the size of the}} human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 400cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That {{is the result of the}} birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|Correlation {{functions}} are typically measured with scattering experiments. For example, x-ray scattering experiments directly measure electron-electron equal-time correlations. From knowledge of elemental structure factors, {{one can also}} measure elemental pair correlation functions. See Radial distribution function for further information. Equal-time spin–spin correlation {{functions are}} measured with neutron scattering as opposed to x-ray scattering. Neutron scattering can also yield information on pair correlations as well. For systems composed of particles <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> one micrometer, optical microscopy {{can be used to}} measure both equal-time and equal-position correlation functions. Optical microscopy is thus common for colloidal suspensions, especially in two dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Three {{widespread}} {{units are}} recognized within the Victoria quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. In addition, central peak, floor, rim, and ejecta materials {{related to the}} numerous craters and basins <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 20km in diameter are mapped. The simplicity of the stratigraphic scheme is {{at least in part}} due to deficiencies in the data base; the history of plains formation almost certainly is more complex than our threefold division indicates, but {{we were not able to}} define consistent criteria of albedo, texture, and cratering for more than three plains units because of the highly variable quality of available pictures.|$|E
50|$|Grey {{goshawks}} {{are about}} 40-55 cm long, with wingspans of 70-110 cm. Females are much <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> males, weighing <b>about</b> 680 g. Males average 350 g.|$|R

5000|$|They make ships <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> ours, <b>about</b> 2,000 tons in size, {{with five}} sails {{and as many}} masts. The lower part is made of three decks, so as to better resist storms, which occur frequently. These ships are {{separated}} into several compartments, so that if one is touched during a storm, the others remain intact.|$|R
25|$|Craters {{within the}} Kuiper {{quadrangle}} increase in complexity as they increase {{in size from}} simple bowl-shaped craters to complex craters with central peaks to multiringed basins. Kuiper (11° S., 31.5°) is a moderate-size crater with a central peak cluster; Brunelleschi (9° S., 22.5°) exhibits an incomplete ring of peaks; and Rodin (22° N., 18°) is a well-developed double-ringed basin. These three craters are mercurian counterparts in morphology to the lunar craters Copernicus, Compton (or Antoniadi), and Schrödinger. All craters <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 35km diameter and basins are filled to some extent with plains materials, and exposed rims of partly buried craters within the basins indicate that the fill is about 700 to 1000 m thick (De Hon and Waskom, 1976).|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of crystalline water ice, and possibly ammonia ice {{may indicate that}} a renewal mechanism {{was active in the}} past on the surface of Orcus. Ammonia so far has not been detected on any TNO or icy satellite of the outer planets other than Miranda. The 1.65μm band on Orcus is broad and deep (12%), as on Charon, Quaoar, Haumea, and icy satellites of giant planets. On the other hand, the crystalline water ice on the surfaces of TNOs should be completely amorphized by the galactic and Solar radiation in about 10 million years. Some calculations indicate that cryovolcanism, which {{is considered one of the}} possible renewal mechanisms, may indeed be possible for TNOs <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 1000km. Orcus may have experienced at least one such episode in the past, which turned the amorphous water ice on its surface into crystalline. The preferred type of volcanism may have been explosive aqueous volcanism driven by an explosive dissolution of methane from water–ammonia melts.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Great Britain {{government}} army at the Battle of Culloden {{was made}} up of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Of the army's 16 infantry battalions present, four were Scottish units and one was Irish. The officers of the infantry were from the upper classes and aristocracy, while the rank and file were made up of poor agricultural workers. On the outbreak of the Jacobite rising, extra incentives were given to lure recruits to fill the ranks of depleted units. For instance, on 6 September 1745, every recruit who joined the Guards before 24 September was given £6, and those who joined in {{the last days of the}} month were given £4. Regiments were named after their colonel. In theory, an infantry regiment would comprise up to ten companies of up to 70 men. They would then be 815 strong, including officers. However, regiments were rarely anywhere near this large, and at the Battle of Culloden, the regiments were not much <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 400 men.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adult males}} {{grow up to}} 10 - 13 mm long, the female is {{slightly}} <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the male, <b>about</b> 11 - 14 mm long. They can be encountered from July through October.|$|R
50|$|The {{rhinoceros}} auklet (also {{known as}} the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> females (<b>about</b> 10% in mass).|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} a shovel shaped {{metatarsal}} tubercle and has longer hind legs than the somewhat similar H. tigrinus {{with which it}} overlaps in part of its range. When the leg is stretched along the body the tibio-tarsal (ankle) joint lies at a position between the ear and eye. Females are slightly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> males (<b>about</b> 8-10 cm or more while males are about 5-8 cm).|$|R
25|$|As {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions reduce {{the stability of the}} global climate, abrupt climate change could become more intense. The impact of an asteroid or comet <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally, causing impact winter. Particles in the troposphere would quickly rain out, but particles in the stratosphere, especially sulfate, could remain there for years. Similarly, a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis, causing volcanic winter. The Toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans (see Toba catastrophe theory). Again, primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years. Solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible, which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay there for about 10 years. The high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional nuclear conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{variation}} in specific binding energy with atomic number {{is due to}} the interplay of the two fundamental forces acting on the component nucleons (protons and neutrons) that make up the nucleus. Nuclei are bound by an attractive nuclear force between nucleons, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons. However, the nuclear force acts only over relatively short ranges (a few nucleon diameters), since it follows an exponentially decaying Yukawa potential which makes it insignificant at longer distances. The electrostatic repulsion is of longer range, since it decays by an inverse-square rule, so that nuclei <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 12nucleons in diameter reach a point that the total electrostatic repulsion overcomes the nuclear force and causes them to be spontaneously unstable. For the same reason, larger nuclei (more than about eight nucleons in diameter) are less tightly bound per unit mass than are smaller nuclei; breaking a large nucleus into two or more intermediate-sized nuclei releases energy. The origin of this energy is the nuclear force, which intermediate-sized nuclei allows to act more efficiently, because each nucleon has more neighbors which are within the short range attraction of this force. Thus less energy is needed in the smaller nuclei and the difference to the state before is set free.|$|E
500|$|At least 5 stellar occultations by Hygiea {{have been}} tracked by Earth-based astronomers, but all with few {{independent}} observers so that little was learned of its shape.

500|$|Although the {{cytoskeleton}} is {{not part}} of the cytosol, the presence of this network of filaments restricts the diffusion of large particles in the cell. For example, in several studies tracer particles <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 25nanometres (about the size of a ribosome) [...] were excluded from parts of the cytosol around the edges of the cell and next to the nucleus. These [...] "excluding compartments" [...] may contain a much denser meshwork of actin fibres than the remainder of the cytosol. These microdomains could influence the distribution of large structures such as ribosomes and organelles within the cytosol by excluding them from some areas and concentrating them in others.|$|E
500|$|Scenes of Hollywood cityscapes, {{as well as}} {{shots of}} heaven {{at the end of}} the film, were {{achieved}} through the creation of miniature sets that were filmed in long shots to give the appearance that they were large and expansive. A total of 45 sets were built in total, none <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> two square feet, with the most expensive costing $1.67. It took days to prepare these sets. Florey cut cardboard from laundered shirts and shaped them into squares while Vorkapić painted them impressionistically to resemble buildings. The elevated trains in the cityscape scenes were actually toy trains Florey purchased and mounted on pasteboard runaways. He would pull them along the track on a string with one hand while he shot the scene with the other. Movement on the miniature sets was simulated by moving lamps and casting shadows. To make the miniature sets look more realistic and to conceal defects, prisms and kaleidoscopes were placed in front of the camera lens and moved during filming, and cylinder lens systems were used and rotated during shooting to magnify the image to the desired diameter. Florey said this was useful in [...] "giving the scenes the rhythms which we thought they required".|$|E

2500|$|Impact craters <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 250km are {{referred}} to as basins. Unlike many basins on the Moon, however, the two obvious basins in the quadrangle, Beethoven (610km in diameter) and Raphael (320km in diameter), are not multiringed, whereas well-developed rings encircle many craters of lesser diameters. Remnant ejecta blankets around parts of the Beethoven and Raphael basins are subdued in appearance and their margins poorly defined in places. However, where they can be recognized, these extensive aprons allow a generalized regional stratigraphic sequence to be determined. A third basin, extremely subdued but probable, is centered at latitude 0°, longitude 130°.|$|E
2500|$|The rolling to hummocky plains {{that lie}} between large craters {{in the southeastern}} part of the {{quadrangle}} make up the oldest recognizable map unit, the intercrater plains material. The plains were originally described as intercrater by Trask and Guest, who noted their level to gently rolling appearance and their general lack of well-defined craters <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 50km in diameter. Malin showed the plains to contain highly eroded remnants of large craters and basins that are only very shallow circular depressions. These intercrater plains are, however, marked by a very high density of superposed craters that are small (5–10km diameter), elongate, shallow, and probably secondary to the many large craters superposed on the plains. Superposition of crater ejecta over parts of intercrater plains in other areas indicates that some large craters formed in a preexisting intercrater plains unit. On the other hand, the intercrater plains material partly postdates {{some of the major}} cratering events on Mercury, according to apparent superposition relations. In particular, the unit appears to overlap the entire northwest side of the Tolstoj Basin, a feature indicating that the intercrater plains in this region probably do not represent the remains of the primordial surface of the planet. A complex history of contemporaneous craters and plains formation is therefore suggested. A detailed discussion of the origin of the intercrater plains on the Moon and Mercury was given by Strom.|$|E
