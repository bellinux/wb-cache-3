50|$|In 1932-33, {{the city}} population, {{as most of}} the other Ukrainian territories, {{suffered}} from Holodomor. In Kiev, bread and other food products were distributed to workers by food cards according to daily norm, but even with cards, bread was in limited supply, and citizens were <b>standing</b> <b>overnight</b> in lines to obtain it.|$|R

30|$|The {{extracellular}} proteins {{from the}} culture supernatant were precipitated by (NH 4) 2 SO 4 at 85 % saturation. After <b>standing</b> <b>overnight,</b> the precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation at 10, 000  g for 30  min (Thermo Scientific Biofuge Primo R) and then dissolved in 50  mM sodium acetate buffer (pH  5.3). The dissolved sample was dialyzed against the same buffer and concentrated by lyophilisation (Thermo Scientific).|$|R

50|$|Regeneration {{has been}} a natural process {{as part of the}} {{management}} plan since 1960. This is supported by selective thinning and felling of some mature timber trees. Invasive sycamore has been controlled by methods to <b>leave</b> <b>standing</b> dead wood (ringbarking) and also removal.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} mobility, {{the train}} {{does not have}} centre poles, <b>leaving</b> <b>standing</b> riders with fewer places to hold.

5000|$|Often, {{either by}} choice or to conform with local regulations, cars are parked in {{driveways}} {{in order to}} leave streets clear for traffic. Moreover, some jurisdictions prohibit parking or <b>leaving</b> <b>standing</b> any motor vehicle upon any residential lawn area (defined as the property {{from the front of}} a residential house, condominium, or cooperative to the street line other than a driveway, walkway, concrete or blacktopped surface parking space). Other examples include the city of Berkeley, California that forbids [...] "any person to park or <b>leave</b> <b>standing,</b> or cause to be parked or left standing any vehicle upon any public street in the City for seventy-two or more consecutive hours." [...] Other areas may prohibit leaving vehicles on residential streets during certain times (for instance, to accommodate regular street cleaning), necessitating the use of driveways.|$|R
50|$|Historically, a large {{horse-chestnut}} tree {{stood next to}} the roundabout outside the Jolly Topers pub; it had presided over the area for 150 years. However, in 2001, after heavy winds blew down its branches, it was deemed hazardous to <b>leave</b> <b>standing.</b> The tree was taken down and has recently been replaced.|$|R
5000|$|A split is a {{situation}} in ten pin bowling in which the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin ("number 1 bowling pin") but <b>leaves</b> <b>standing</b> two or more non-adjacent groups {{of one or more}} pins.

50|$|Capturing and {{conservation}} of moisture - In regions such as Eastern Washington, {{the average annual}} precipitation available to a dryland farm may {{be as little as}} 8.5 in. Consequently, moisture must be captured until the crop can utilize it. Techniques include summer fallow rotation (in which one crop is grown on two seasons' precipitation, <b>leaving</b> <b>standing</b> stubble and crop residue to trap snow), and preventing runoff by terracing fields.|$|R

50|$|The flowers {{grow from}} a clublike, {{somewhat}} square, whirled cluster; immediately below this club {{is a pair}} of stalkless <b>leaves</b> <b>standing</b> out on either side like a collar. Flowers are two lipped and tubular. The top lip is a purple hood, and the bottom lip is often white; it has three lobes, with the middle lobe being larger and fringed upwardly. Flowers bloom at different times depending on climate and other conditions, but mostly in summer (from June to August in the USA).|$|R

30|$|All of the {{chemicals}} were of analytic grade and used without further purification. We prepared TiO 2 nanoparticles by the hydrolysis of tetrabutyltitanate (TBT) in a cyclohexane (C 6 H 12)/ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) medium under refluxing conditions as reported [23]. Briefly, 36  mL of TBT was dissolved in the mixed solvents (90  mL of ethanol and 90  mL of cyclohexane), and 9  mL of HCl (TBT/HCl (v/v)[*]=[*] 1 : 0.25) was added to it. The final homogeneous solution was refluxed at 67  °C for 10  h and then cooled to room temperature. To precipitate the TiO 2 -NPs, 600  mL of ethanol was added dropwise to the solution under stirring. After <b>standing</b> <b>overnight,</b> a white precipitate was harvested by centrifugation. The powder was obtained by washing with ethanol three times and dried in air at room temperature. (Additional file 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and the size distribution histogram of TiO 2 -NPs).|$|R
