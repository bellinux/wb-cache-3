When the main temple god was male, the secondary chapels were often {{dedicated to}} that god's mythological consort and child. The secondary chapels in mortuary temples were devoted to gods associated with kingship.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
50|$|Hypothetical example:If some entity has {{the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> claim <b>to</b> any object without contest, theft is still possible. One can steal from this entity if one {{is not part of}} this entity. Also, that the entity is {{empowered}} <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> claim necessitates that there are objects which the entity can lay claim upon, therefore, objects which this entity does not possess. Boundaries may exist between objects before the entity <b>lays</b> claim <b>to</b> them, (that is, if it intends <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> claim <b>to</b> them.) Breach of these boundaries constitute theft. A hypothetical entity empowered <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> claim upon any object can also approach a grey area between legitimate possession and theft if its possession of an object is not clearly defined, that is, if this entity itself has doubts as to whether it possesses the object in question.|$|R

5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Spanish, the western portion of the Pacific plain was {{dominated}} by the K'iche' and Kaqchikel states, while the eastern portion was occupied by the Pipil and the Xinca. The Pipil inhabited the area of the modern department of Escuintla and a part of Jutiapa; the main Xinca territory <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the east of the main Pipil population in what is now Santa Rosa department; there were also Xinca in Jutiapa.|$|E

5|$|Odense {{is one of}} Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the vicinity}} show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years {{since at least the}} Stone Age. The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, one of Denmark's former Viking ring fortresses, <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the south of the river. Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area. The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to defend it against invaders coming in from the coast.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{established}} the general geography of this region, and named {{many of its}} features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, {{but was unable to}} do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at 78°10′, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the east of the Barrier, but was unable to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|At 03:50 on 31 July, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge began. The {{division}} {{was ordered to}} capture the German front line, the second line positions based on Pilckem Ridge, a low ridge that also contained the heavily shelled village of Pilckem, followed by Iron Cross Ridge which <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the east, before storming {{down the other side}} and across a small stream known as the Steenbeck. The division would be opposed primarily by the German 3rd Guards Infantry Division, along with elements of the 3rd Reserve Division and 111th Division, dug-in among trench lines and 280 concrete pillboxes and bunkers. To secure these various objectives, the division planned to attack in waves, with fresh troops constantly moving forward to tackle the next objective.|$|E

5|$|Before the conquest, El Salvador {{formed a}} part of the Mesoamerican {{cultural}} region. The central and western portions of the territory were inhabited by the Pipil, a Nahua people related to the Aztecs of Mexico. The Pipil were divided into three main provinces in El Salvador; the two largest were Cuscatlan and Izalco, while Nonualco was the smallest of the three. Cuscatlan extended from the Paz River in the west to the Lempa River in the east. Izalco <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the southwest of Cuscatlan and was subservient to it {{on the eve of the}} Spanish conquest; its territory is now incorporated into the modern departments of Ahuachapan and Sonsonate. Other indigenous groups with territories in El Salvador were the Ch'orti' and the Poqomam (both of these were Maya peoples), the Lenca, the Xinca, and the Matagalpa. The Postclassic Maya and Pipil cities were relatively small by Mesoamerican standards, especially when compared with the great Maya cities of the earlier Classic period (c. 250–950 AD). The Lenca occupied territory to the east of the Lempa River, where their principal kingdom was Chaparrastique. Chaparrastique extended across territory now incorporated into the departments of La Unión, Morazán, and San Miguel. The Ch'orti' and Poqomam occupied territories in the west. The extreme east of El Salvador was occupied by the Mangue, with the Matagalpa in the southeast. The population of the entire territory of El Salvador is variously estimated at anything between 130,000 and 1,000,000 at the time of the conquest; the low-mid estimates within this range are more likely.|$|E
5|$|By day four, the battalions of the 1st Airlanding Brigade were {{dispersed}} {{over a wide}} area. While the Borders were to {{the west}} on {{a line from the}} River Rhine east of Heveadorp to the Heelsum road, the remaining KOSB companies <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the north with the remnants of the Staffords forming part of Lonsdale Force in the east. Brigade headquarters was established on open ground at the centre of the divisional area. On day five (21 September), defence of the divisional area was divided between the two remaining brigade headquarters. The 1st Airlanding Brigade in the west now commanded the remaining three companies of Borders, the remnants of the KOSB, and what remained of the Royal Engineers, 21st Independent Company, Glider Pilots and Poles. Lonsdale Force Major Robert Henry Cain of the Staffords disabled a tank with a PIAT and then, although wounded by machine gun fire, positioned one of the division's artillery guns and destroyed it. This was the first of a number of actions by Major Cain which led to the award of a Victoria Cross. This second medal for the Staffords meant it became the only British battalion to receive two Victoria Crosses in one battle during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.|$|E

25|$|The writ {{of error}} coram nobis {{was one of}} the oldest {{remedies}} of the common law.

The ordinary writ of error <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis <b>lay</b> <b>to</b> the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.|$|E
