5000|$|The UTQGS {{traction}} rating procedure specifies {{that the}} traction coefficients for asphalt and for concrete {{are to be}} calculated using the locked-wheel traction coefficient on the tire, or sliding coefficient of friction. More specifically, upon application of the brakes, the tire is subjected to shear between the wheel and the road surface, and deforms towards {{the rear of the}} vehicle. This generates a traction force to oppose the motion of the vehicle. As braking torque increases, the tire deforms more and tread elements near the rear of the contact patch with the road begin to slip rather than grip. The coefficient of friction rapidly reaches a maximum value at about 10-20 percent slip, and then declines as the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip</b> values increase to 100 percent, which represents a fully locked tire. The maximum coefficient of friction in the 0-100 percent slip range is termed “peak” coefficient of friction, and the lower coefficient value for the fully locked tire is termed “slide” coefficient of friction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In road vehicles, {{wheel locking}} can be {{prevented}} by means of closed-loop Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). Two output measured variables are usually considered for regulation: wheel- deceleration and wheel <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip.</b> The traditional controlled variable used in ABS is the wheel deceleration, since it can be easily measured with a simple wheel encoder; however, it can be dynamically critical if the road-surface rapidly changes. On the other hand, the regulation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip</b> is much robust from the dynamical point of view, but the slip measurement is critical, since it requires the estimation of the longitudinal vehicle speed.

The goal of this research is to let the planetary rovers be able to achieve demand of motion from upper level with satisfied control performance under the rough and deformable planetary terrain that often lead to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip.</b> The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip</b> influences the mobility efficiency obviously, especially on the major deformable slopes.

40|$|Currently, most cold-formed {{steel sheet}} designs for {{composite}} slabs incorporate a repeating pattern of embossments {{along the entire}} length of the steel sheet ribs. Their function is to hinder the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slipping,</b> similarly to the corrugation of the rods in reinforced concrete, so that the longitudinal shear forces are transferred between steel and concrete. However, in composite slabs, the wedge effect of the embossments transforms the relative slipping of the steel sheet and concrete into forces acting on the interface, causing the transversal bending of the sheet, the separation and relative slipping between steel and concrete and, eventually, the complete detachment and the resistance drop. This paper is presenting the experimental results of a new bonding system, under patent by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), ensuring the full connection between steel sheet and concrete, applied to composite slabs. The system consists in producing a series of many small crown-shaped breakages on the steel sheet, which are oriented towards the side of the sheet that will remain in contact with the concrete. When fresh concrete is poured, the projections of the mentioned breakages are embedded therein; once the concrete is set, their function is to resist the shearing forces and separating forces generated between both materials when the composite steel-concrete element is loaded.

40|$|The {{operational}} capacity of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) {{is limited by}} many different challenges. Limited energy storage and loss of wheel traction can interrupt completion of the robot's mission. To prevent these disruptions to robot operation, three different problems are considered: trajectory planning for an area coverage mission with energy considerations, efficient power management for a hybrid power system, and traction control to prevent wheel slip. An area coverage mission consists of driving the robot within sensor range of every point in a region. To plan operation, the energy usage characteristics of the robot are required. A method to determine motor efficiency and energy usage is presented. To balance the mission goals and the energy required for operation, a novel cost function, weighting motor torques, area covered and motor efficiency, is used to plan the trajectory. This trajectory is constrained to follow a coverage path planned using existing techniques. We show how the cost function {{can be used to}} tradeoff between energy usage and time required to complete the mission. To increase onboard energy storage, we propose a hybrid power system for a UGV. This combination of power sources requires additional control algorithms to determine which sources should be used throughout the mission. Our control algorithm is based on forming a model of the hybrid power system with power demands from a particular mission. To make the control optimization problem tractable, the model is simplified by using averaged dynamics. Using this model, power management is optimized to limit energy losses. Simulation and Experimental results with a battery/fuel cell power system are presented and show 5 % decrease in energy usage compared to a baseline control strategy. Both lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> wheel <b>slip</b> must be controlled to prevent loss of traction.

The sliding mode controller, based on automotive techniques, only controls <b>longitudinal</b> wheel <b>slip,</b> possibly losing traction while turning...|$|R

The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip</b> of a tyre is often determined using three independent measurements namely the rotational velocity, tyre rolling radius and vehicle speed.

40|$|Studying rubber wear is {{important}} because it can save money, minimize health and environmental issues related to the particles generated from tyre wear and reduce fuel consumption. The wear of rubber is considered {{to be the result of}} energy dissipation due to friction. There are many models that describe the dynamical behaviour of vehicles and tyre, but less e ort has been dedicated to consider the tyre wear in these models. The purpose of the thesis was to create an easy to understand and trend-accurate tyre wear model for implementation in a complete car model. The tyre wear in the thesis is determined to be the amount of rubber volume loss due to sliding per unit length that the tyre travels. A literature study was performed with the objective of gaining knowledge of tyre models and the a ecting parameters of tyre wear. The most important parameters in determining tyre wear were identied as the forward velocity, side-slip angle, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip,</b> vertical load, and tyre ination pressure. The wear was chosen to be calculated with Archards wear law for these parameters both separately and combined in pairs in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the wear. The results show that wear is increasing exponentially for the forward velocity. Tyre wear decreases linearly as tyre ination pressure (vertical bristle sti ness) increases. The vertical load, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip</b> and side-slip angle yielded exponentially increasing wear. The most inuential parameters a ecting the tyre wear were the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slip</b> and side-slip angle, these yielded wear rates up to 107 higher compared with the reference case.

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> wheel <b>slip</b> {{control is}} a crucial problem in {{automotive}} systems, as it it {{is the basis for}} traction, braking and stability control. As slip dynamics are critically dependent on the vehicle speed, it is interesting to devise an adaptation of the controller parameters with respect to this variable.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} and understand the dynamics of motor vehicles un-der straight ahead braking and accelerating condi-tions. Two vehicle braking models are considered— a quarter-car, or single wheel model, and a half-car, or two wheel model—and a nonlinear analysis is un-dertaken for each. A brief survey of the main char-acteristics and features of a single wheel acceleration model is also conducted. The equations of motion describing the single wheel model shown in Figure 1 are presented and the need to quantify the available friction force for braking is specified. This motivates an investigation of the tire/road interface and leads to the introduc-tion of force coefficient characteristics µ as a function of <b>longitudinal</b> wheel <b>slip</b> s. The equations of motion are hence cast into a framework which is convenient for a nonlinear dynamic analysis. The forward vehi-cle speed u is customarily chosen as an independent variable for such an investigation. Whereas the an-gular velocity of the wheel ω is typically chosen as the second independent variable for braking anal-ysis [1], this paper utilizes wheel slip in its stead. This results in a single dimensionless function h(s) of <b>longitudinal</b> wheel <b>slip</b> that completely character-izes the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system. It will be shown that considerable insight is gained from such a description. Criteria for the local sta-bility of finite slip in braking and wheel lockup are outlined and a qualitative vector field description of the braking model is presented and discussed. The main results of the investigation include domains of stable and unstable braking, local stability criteria, and a description of the transition to wheel lock-up as the brake torque is varied.
