5|$|Alprazolam, {{like other}} benzodiazepines, binds to {{specific}} {{sites on the}} GABAA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which {{are referred to as}} benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. <b>Long-term</b> <b>use</b> causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. <b>Long-term</b> <b>use</b> is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the <b>long-term</b> <b>use</b> of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for <b>long-term</b> <b>use.</b> NICE stated that <b>long-term</b> <b>use</b> of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cold {{recycling}} {{technology has been}} widely used in road maintenance projects. Many roads which have been reconstructed with cold {{recycling technology}} have emerged some diseases after a <b>long-term</b> <b>used.</b> In this condition, these roads can be rebuilt by secondary recycling technology. The microstructure characteristics of secondary recycled road materials after cement stabilizing were observed by SEM; then, material properties after being <b>long-term</b> <b>used</b> and secondary recycled were analyzed. CBR value and aggregate crush value are put forward for the evaluation indexes of secondary recycling. The unconfined compressive strength, splitting strength and modulus of cement stabilized secondary recycling materials are determined by laboratory tests. The {{results indicate that the}} existence of asphalt components lead the strength lower than ordinary base materials stabilized by cement. And temperature exerts an obviously influence on the compressive strength. Frost resistance, water stability and anti-erosion resistance are also determined by laboratory tests. The results indicate that the strength and pavement performance of cement secondary recycling materials can meet the requirements for base and sub base in asphalt pavement. 1...|$|R

5|$|Whether {{the drug}} {{has a unique}} effect on dental health has been {{questioned}} by a few academics, who note that the <b>long-term</b> <b>use</b> of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems. Several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective, affirming meth mouth's status as a discrete condition.

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and <b>long-term</b> <b>use</b> of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E

5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of <b>long-term</b> <b>use</b> of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their <b>long-term</b> <b>use.</b> The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control.

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their <b>long-term</b> <b>use</b> is not recommended due to risks of dependence.

40|$|Former {{studies that}} have {{attempted}} to characterize individual socio-demographic factors associated with <b>long-term</b> benzodiazepine <b>use</b> were based on relatively small sample sizes and/or self-reported data. Our aim was to clarify this using large-scale primary health care data from Sweden. The present study covered 71 primary health care centres containing individual-level data from a total of 919, 941 individuals who visited a primary health care centre (PHCC) during the period 2001 – 2007. From this database we selected individuals 25 years or older with depression, anxiety and/or insomnia and who were prescribed a benzodiazepine within 0 – 90 as well as 91 – 270 days after their first clinical diagnosis of depression, anxiety and/or insomnia. Older age (OR, 2. 92, 95 % CI, 2. 28 – 3. 84), middle SES (OR, 1. 22, 95 % CI, 1. 08 – 1. 38), being on social welfare (OR, 1. 40, 95 % CI, 1. 23 – 1. 62) and not being married were associated with higher <b>long-term</b> benzodiazepine <b>use.</b> The PHCCs only explained {{a small part of}} the individual variation in <b>long-term</b> benzodiazepine <b>use.</b> Awareness of the impact on <b>long-term</b> benzodiazepine <b>use</b> of certain individual-level socio-demographic factors is important for health care workers and decision-makers who should aim at targeting general interventions at all primary health care centres...|$|R
