60|$|Margaret {{turned away}} her head, but {{presently}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> with {{a nervous}} but {{relieved}} little laugh.|$|E
60|$|He {{said nothing}} {{more for a}} little, and then <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> wearily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am glad,' said Mary, absently, {{anxious to}} go on with her letter; but, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at him--'I am sure you want something.' ...|$|R
60|$|Helen did not <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> {{until she}} was near the porch. She had dreaded this meeting, yet she was so glad {{that she could have}} cried aloud.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> all was changed, {{the banner}} nowhere in sight, but I kept my saddle, {{and cut down}} half a dozen rascaille after that." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was silent}} for a few moments, and then <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> wearily.|$|E
60|$|Devine sat silent at a space, {{apparently}} reflecting, {{and then}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Leger <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> {{with the}} {{twinkle in his}} eyes showing plainer still.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must see}} her the last thing,--about nine, but I can <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> afterwards, {{for a minute}} or so. I don't stay long with her now: it's better not." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{passed away}} without <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> The Prince {{listened to her}} {{footsteps}} dying away in the corridor. Then he closed the door, and, entering his bedroom, undressed himself and slept...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ecod!' said Jonas, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> for a moment, {{and shaking}} his head, 'I've been {{as good a}} son as ever you were a brother. It's the pot and the kettle, {{if you come to}} that.' ...|$|R
60|$|Sally {{considered}} this statement {{for a moment}} or two before she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|But the Colonel <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> {{and again}} he cried out in his {{agitation}} and surprise.|$|E
60|$|Flora {{turned her}} head for a moment, but when she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> her eyes shone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Rosie, what's the matter? Poor little girl--she's all tired out, climbin' up here." [...] He {{sat down}} and took her on his lap and talked to her of the valley below and where the river went--but she would not <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{consolation}} {{of a sort}} came soon enough. As {{she took}} her seat she distinctly {{glanced up at the}} gallery, and afterwards as he knelt to pray he peeped between his fingers and saw her <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> She was certainly not laughing at him.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 the {{property}} market began to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> and in late 1985 Hongkong Land completed {{and opened the}} first phase of its new flagship property, One and Two Exchange Square. In 1988, the final third phase of Exchange Square was completed and The Forum was opened.|$|R
60|$|He {{dropped on}} one knee, and Hetty {{turned her face}} aside when he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Meyer turned {{aside to}} hide his face, and {{presently}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> and spoke quite softly.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gladwyne <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> {{as if she}} had not heard, and {{the girl}} smiled at her.|$|E
25|$|Yet 2005 {{saw little}} improvement, and doubts {{circulated}} about his defensive technique, {{causing him to}} be shuffled {{in and out of}} the side. But things started <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> during the winter Test series against England, in which he scored a century and two fifties, with a more cautious attitude to his innings building than he had previously shown.|$|R
6000|$|She {{patted the}} {{face on the}} {{miniature}} gently with her little, withered, white fingers, {{as if it had}} been a living thing. [...] "Sister Rose!" [...] she sighed to herself; then, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at me, said, [...] "I should like it put into my portrait, sir, because I have always worn it since I was a young woman, for 'Sister Rose's' sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven forefend!" [...] cried Wildschloss, with despair on {{his face}} unseen by the boys, for Friedel had hidden his eyes, and Ebbo was {{straining}} his with the intense gaze of horror. He had carried his glance downwards, following the 380 feet fall that must be the lot of the adventurer. Then <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> he shouted, [...] "I see him! I see him! Praise to St. Barbara! He is safe! He has caught by the upright stone work." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Betty turned her head, {{but when she}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> she was calm and businesslike.|$|E
60|$|Gartok {{closed his}} eyes for a few seconds, but did not speak. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> earnestly.|$|E
60|$|Midwinter {{suddenly}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> {{his cheeks}} turning ashy pale, and his glittering black eyes fixed full on Allan's face.|$|E
60|$|Nor would Henry {{return to}} Bankside. After many vacillations, {{the moment for}} {{starting}} found him {{in a fit of}} despair about the family disgrace, only able to beg that 'the unhappy boy' should be assured that no expense should be spared in his defence; or else, that if he were cleared and returned home, his welcome should be most joyful. But there Henry broke off, groaned, said they should never <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> and must leave the place.|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at me <b>again,</b> {{and swore}} {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he added, [...] "I don't {{like for}} old friends to leave me, and I decided to <b>look</b> you <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Will {{you want a}} new binder or a back-set plow this fall?" ...|$|R
60|$|When Déroulède <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> Sir Percy {{was sitting}} placidly in the arm-chair, with an {{absolutely}} blank {{expression on his}} face.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped and}} Alice {{looked down at}} the table for a moment. Then she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> and met his fixed gaze.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{closed her}} eyes again and lay quiet for a short time, then she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> and tried to sit up.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> amazed <b>again.</b> 'I must! I don't like it! But I couldn't {{ever have}} a happy Christmas if I didn't tell! I wish they would come that I might have it over.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her cousin {{took out}} his pocket-{{handkerchief}}. He seemed to be drifted absorbed into the sermon. He put his handkerchief to his face. Then something dropped on to his knee. There lay the bit of flowering currant! He was looking down at it in real astonishment. A wild snort of laughter came from Anna. Everybody heard: it was torture. He had shut the crumpled flower {{in his hand and}} was <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> with the same absorbed attention to the sermon. Another snort of laughter from Anna. Fred nudged her remindingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shillito knew, but one learns caution," [...] Cartwright remarked. [...] "Well, Shillito became {{somewhat}} of a nuisance, and I don't imagine {{you want him to}} <b>look</b> us <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> I rather think I must get to work." ...|$|R
