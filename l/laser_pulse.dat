25|$|The {{ablation}} of {{the target}} material upon laser irradiation {{and the creation of}} plasma are very complex processes. The removal of atoms from the bulk material is done by vaporization of the bulk at the surface region in a state of non-equilibrium.

This dimension is dependent on the laser wavelength and the index of refraction {{of the target}} material at the applied laser wavelength and is typically in the region of 10nm for most materials. The strong electrical field generated by the laser light is sufficiently strong to remove the electrons from the bulk material of the penetrated volume. This process occurs within 10 ps of a ns <b>laser</b> <b>pulse</b> and is caused by non-linear processes such as multiphoton ionization which are enhanced by microscopic cracks at the surface, voids, and nodules, which increase the electric field. The free electrons oscillate within the electromagnetic field of the laser light and can collide with the atoms of the bulk material thus transferring some of their energy to the lattice of the target material within the surface region.

25|$|Curiously, higher-order solitons can attain {{complicated}} shapes {{before returning}} exactly to their initial shape {{at the end}} of the soliton period. In the picture of various solitons, the spectrum (left) and time domain (right) are shown at varying distances of propagation (vertical axis) in an idealized nonlinear medium. This shows how a <b>laser</b> <b>pulse</b> might behave as it travels in a medium with the properties necessary to support fundamental solitons. In practice, in order to reach the very high peak intensity needed to achieve nonlinear effects, laser pulses may be coupled into optical fibers such as photonic-crystal fiber with highly confined propagating modes. Those fibers have more complicated dispersion and other characteristics which depart from the analytical soliton parameters.|$|E
25|$|Chirped-pulse {{amplification}} {{was originally}} introduced as {{a technique to}} increase the available power in radar in 1960. CPA for lasers was invented by Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland at the University of Rochester in the mid 1980s. Before then, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a <b>laser</b> <b>pulse</b> at intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter causes serious damage to the gain medium through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, {{some of the most}} powerful compressed CPA laser beams, even in an unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 gigawatts/cm2, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser gain medium would instantly self focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below the threshold of the nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or terawatt level for very large multi beam facilities.|$|E
