5|$|The lens is {{equipped}} with a full-frame digital SLR-compatible mount allowing the usage of both APS-C sized cameras and formats larger than APS-C – the build in <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> however visibly restricts the field of view (FOV) on formats larger than APS-C – see example above. The FOV in APS-C sized cameras is further restricted at shorter focal lengths if the front cap adaptor ring is not removed – see example below.|$|E

25|$|The red {{aspect is}} usually {{positioned}} {{at the bottom}} of pole and gantry mounted signals is so that snow does not build up on the <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> of an aspect placed below the red aspect, resulting in the aspect becoming obscured. Similarly it is placed {{at the top of a}} ground mounted signal to minimize the risk of the red aspect becoming obscured by snow build up on the ground. Signal alignment is generally aimed towards a distance 200 yards (183 metres) in rear of the signal and at a height of 2.5 to 3 m from the left hand rail. Ground mounted signals are rarely so critical for alignment (hence ground mounting) and are often used in tunnels where the relative luminosity of the aspects are much higher.|$|E
50|$|Correctly made {{rectangular}} or square <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> {{are generally}} more efficient than cylindrical or conical ones because those shapes closely resemble {{the shape of the}} photograph. However, rectangular or square <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> should not be used with zoom lenses whose front elements rotate as the focal length is changed, as the hood will rotate as well, blocking parts of the angle of view. The same also applies to petal <b>lens</b> <b>hoods.</b> For these types of lenses, only cylindrical or conical <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> will work effectively.|$|R

50|$|Lens hoods {{that are}} {{supplied}} by the manufacturer of the lens are often designed to fit onto the matching lens facing either forward, for normal use, or backwards, so that the hood may be stored with the lens without occupying much additional space. Rubber <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> are flexible and generally collapse for storage. However other <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> must be removed if these features are not available and length extension of the lens is not preferred during storage.|$|R
500|$|The lens {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] It has a bulb-like aspherical lens, similar to notable wide-angle and fisheye lenses {{such as the}} Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED, Nikon AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8G ED, or Tokina AT-X 107 DX AF 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 fisheye lens. Because of the shape of front element, it is not compatible with many filters, including UV filters, but the frontal exposure is rectified by a petal-shaped <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> element. Because the lens has a permanent <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> affixed, {{it comes with a}} friction-fit aluminum element, variously described as a sleeve, ring or shroud, that surrounds the hood to enable the placement of a front cap on the lens. PC Magazine Jim Fisher says the lens is relatively large and heavy; A reviewer at photozone.de says that for a wide-angle lens the dimensions are unusually narrow but long.|$|E

2500|$|For {{designated}} marksman use, the SG 550 {{is equipped}} with a Kern 4x24 telescopic sight on a quick-detachable mount. The sight weighs [...] and includes a variety of features, such as STANAG 2324/MIL-STD-1913 compliant mounting components, a Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) elevation adjustment knob for ranges from 100 to 600 m, a tritium-illuminated reticle that enables target acquisition in low-light conditions and a diopter eyesight correction adjustment. Included with the sight is a <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> for mounting on the ocular that reduces image quality-impairing stray light and a gray filter for glare reduction. The basic model of this optical sight was already used on the Stgw 57.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> {{can offer}} {{some degree of}} {{physical}} protection for the lens due to the hood extending farther than the lens itself.|$|R

50|$|In the {{photographic}} industry, flocking is one method {{used to reduce}} the reflectivity of surfaces, including the insides of some bellows and <b>lens</b> <b>hoods.</b> It {{is also used to}} produce light-tight passages for film such as in 135 film cartridges.|$|R

In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced {{in excess of}} US$110,000 - the most extensive and expensive in the world.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical {{vignetting}} {{occurs when}} light beams emanating from object points located off-axis are partially blocked by external {{objects such as}} thick or stacked filters, secondary lenses, and improper <b>lens</b> <b>hoods.</b> This {{has the effect of}} changing the entrance pupil shape as a function of angle (resulting in the path of light being partially blocked). Darkening can be gradual or abrupt - the smaller the aperture, the more abrupt the vignetting as a function of angle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lens</b> <b>hood</b> mount: This {{feature is}} found on most EF lenses. This mount {{is used for}} {{attaching}} the <b>lens</b> <b>hood.</b> The hood mount is of a bayonet style on most EF lenses, though a clip-on style hood mount is used for a small selection of current lenses.|$|E

50|$|Some bridge cameras have a lens thread {{to attach}} {{accessories}} such as wide-angle or telephoto converters {{as well as}} filters such as UV or Circular Polarizing filter and <b>lens</b> <b>hoods.</b> The scene is composed by viewing the display or the electronic viewfinder (EVF). Most have a slightly longer shutter lag than a DSLR. Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG. The majority have a built-in flash, {{but only a few}} have a hotshoe.|$|R
50|$|Ideally, <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> should {{increase}} in length, and therefore in efficiency, as the focal {{length of the}} lens increases and the angle of view reduces. Lens hoods are more prominent in long focus lenses {{because they have a}} smaller viewing angle than that of wide-angle lenses. For wide angle lenses, the length of the hood (away {{from the end of the}} lens) cannot be as long as those for telephoto lenses, as a longer hood would enter the wider field of view of the lens.|$|R
50|$|When {{a bright}} light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast. This can be avoided by shading the lens using a <b>lens</b> <b>hoods.</b> In a studio, a gobo or set of barn doors can be {{attached}} to the lighting to keep it from shining on the camera. Filters can {{be attached to the}} camera lens which will also minimise lens flare, which is especially useful for outdoor photographers.|$|R
50|$|This lens is {{compatible}} with the Canon ET-65B <b>lens</b> <b>hood.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} a <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> can vary from a plain {{cylindrical}} or conical section (much like a lamp shade) to a more complex shape, sometimes called a petal, tulip, or flower hood. These more complex shapes {{take into account the}} final image's shape and aspect ratio. This allows the <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> to block stray light with the longer portions of the <b>lens</b> <b>hood,</b> while allowing more light into the corners of the image through the shorter portions of the hood, thereby reducing the amount of mechanical vignetting (reduction of light around the periphery) in the final image.|$|E

40|$|The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) program, {{led by the}} Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will be {{the first-ever}} {{spaceborne}} all-sky transit survey. MIT Lincoln Laboratory {{is responsible for the}} cameras, including the lens assemblies, detector assemblies, <b>lens</b> <b>hoods,</b> and camera mounts. TESS is scheduled to be launched in August of 2017 with the primary goal to detect small planets with bright host starts in the solar neighborhood, so that detailed characterizations of the planets and their atmospheres can be performed. The TESS payload consists of four identical cameras and a data handling unit. Each camera consists of a lens assembly with seven optical elements and a detector assembly with four charge-coupled devices (CCDs) including their associated electronics. The optical prescription requires that several of the lenses are in close proximity to a neighboring element. A finite element model (FEM) was developed to estimate the relative deflections between each lens-bezel assembly under launch loads to predict that there are adequate clearances preventing the lenses from making contact. Modal tests using non-contact response measurements were conducted to experimentally estimate the modal parameters of the lens-bezel assembly, and used to validate the initial FEM assumptions.

50|$|The Sony Handycam NEX-VG10 (model {{variants}} NEX-VG10E, NEX-VG10A, NEX-VG10J) was {{the large}} sensor interchangeable-lens video camera made and distributed by Sony in 2010-2011. It uses Sony E-mount camera lenses that were first {{used on the}} Sony NEX-3 and Sony NEX-5. It is capable of shooting in 1920×1080 full high definition using a large APS-C sensor. The video is captured in the AVCHD format. When capturing still photos the NEX-VG10 is capable of 14-megapixel stills. The camera kit comes with an 18-200 mm lens that will also be compatible with the NEX Mirrorless interchangeable lens camera systems. The 16 mm ultra wide and 18-55 mm lens E-mount lenses will also work with full auto-focus support. The built-on microphone is made of four directional mics that record in two-way stereo {{with the ability to}} capture both front and back sounds. The mic handle also has support for a hot shoe to connect a supported flash gun and a cold shoe to add on extra accessories. There will also be a 3.5 mm microphone jack to add an external microphone for more accurate sound capture. First shipments of the NEX-VG10 commenced in September 2010. Its launch price is 1999 US dollars and it comes in a kit with a Sony SAL-18200 <b>lens</b> with <b>hood</b> and a free download of Vegas Movie Studio.|$|R
50|$|The first Paul's Model Art diecast car made by Minichamps {{was created}} in 1990; a 1:43 scale GTC Audi V8 driven by Hans-Joachim Stuck. It was the German Touring Car Champion in 1990. By 1995 Minichamps was {{manufacturing}} more than 110 different castings in several hundred different racing liveries and three different scales - and sponsoring real racing cars (Paul's Model Art 2005). The company was officially named Minichamps GmbH in 1996. Minichamps produces die-cast models of Formula One cars and other racing cars, street cars, 1:12 scale motorcycles, trucks & buses, and military vehicles. Cars in 1:43 scale have exceptional detail including items like badges {{in the center of}} steering wheels and hubcaps, and separately molded parts for windshield visors, door handles, air vents, headlight lamp <b>lenses,</b> and <b>hood</b> badges (Rixon 2005, p. 63). Again, most models are manufactured in China.The excellent quality of Minichamps die-cast models has been appreciated by car manufacturers, many of whom, like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, Volkswagen, Opel and BMW, have licensed it to produce official promotional replicas. Additionally, model car collectors have sought out some of the company's 1/43 scale models paying very high prices. Possibly the best example is the McLaren F1 GTR West Promotion model made for the West cigarette company which trades for well over US $1000 on eBay. Another rare item was the Michael Schumacher Benetton B195 #17 which was recalled after an error was found: it has been known to fetch over UK £1000.|$|R
