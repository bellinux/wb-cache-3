25|$|In 1967 Scott held a Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, {{where he}} contributed {{regularly}} to Alan Montefiore's politics seminar for postgraduates. Once, {{when he and}} Montefiore started talking at the same time, Scott carried on speaking with the amiable excuse : 'You can remember {{what you want to}} say <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can'.|$|E
500|$|Two weeks {{following}} his announcement, Bayh {{withdrew from the}} race, citing that [...] "the odds were <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> felt I could responsibly pursue". He further commented that a run would cause him to be [...] "absent from the Senate...instead of working {{to help the people}} of my state and the nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|At St Peter's, Connolly {{decided he}} wanted to make people laugh. [...] "I can {{remember}} the moment in the school playground. I would have been 7 or 8. And I was sitting in a puddle and people were laughing. I had fallen in it and people found it funny. And it wasn't all that uncomfortable, so I stayed in it <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> normally would because I really enjoyed the laughing. My life was very unhappy at the time, and laughter wasn't something I heard all the time, so it was a joy. And I realised quickly that if you can have an audience this way, life was rather pleasant." [...] While at St Peter's, Connolly joined a gang. His arch-enemy was Geordie Sinclair, who lived around the corner.|$|E

2500|$|... "I'm super happy. It's {{difficult}} {{to describe how}} I feel now," [...] she said after the race. [...] "I'm so excited because I dreamt so long of this one and the pressure was high to finish it off. It's great to have won. My intention was to start fast but I wanted to keep going a bit <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did. I maybe got over excited and a went too fast, but I maintained the time difference {{and so it was}} all ok." [...] This race was the seasons' main goal for Van Dijk. She had been tested on her time trial position during the season and found a better position which she was able to maintain for almost half an hour. Van Dijk told she practiced the course twice in August at 5:00am to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. She had watched the video over and over again until she could dream it.|$|E
2500|$|... "From {{beginning}} to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward {{the targets of}} his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in Abner waned, and this showed in the strip itself," [...] according to Don Markstein's Toonopedia. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been {{the best he could}} manage due to declining health. [...] "If you have any sense of humor about your strip—and I had a sense of humor about mine—you knew that for three or four years Abner was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> should have," [...] he admitted, adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. [...] "When he retired Li'l Abner, newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. People magazine ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free New York Times devoted nearly a full page to the event," [...] wrote publisher Denis Kitchen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've stayed <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> meant {{and forgot}} my lamp," [...] Festing remarked. [...] "However, this has {{happened}} before, and I hope I haven't stayed <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is growing}} to be a <b>longer</b> hunt <b>than</b> <b>I</b> anticipated," [...] remarked Fred. [...] "I thought finding the {{houseboat}} {{would be dead}} easy."' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{story was}} a much <b>longer</b> one <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{expected}} it to be, and John must have driven those horses backward and forward for half an hour.|$|R
6000|$|For <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> [...] <b>I</b> know, in San Francisco lived {{a beggar}} man; [...] And when in bed [...] They found him dead-- [...] "Just like the scamp!" [...] the people said.|$|R
60|$|Gentlemen, I {{have already}} spoken <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> intended, and must beg leave to stop here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can help," [...] rejoined Heriot. [...] "I want my revenge against Bompard, remember. He did fleece me last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|GUNNER. Do {{you suppose}} I want to stay? Do you think I would breathe this {{polluted}} atmosphere a moment <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could help? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Pauline," [...] he said, [...] "sometimes lately I fancied {{that you}} have seemed a little morbid. <b>I</b> have lived <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> you. <b>I</b> have {{lived long enough to}} be sure of one thing." ...|$|R
60|$|LINA. It means {{something}} that will last <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> yes. <b>I</b> like you. I admit you to my friendship. What a pity you were not trained when you were young! Youd be young still.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a sleep," [...] he said on waking. [...] "I have slept <b>longer</b> to-night <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have done for the past fortnight. Now I will take the helm. How fast have we been moving?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} lazy boys. I {{had to do}} all the talking in Brittany. You are {{supposed}} to have learnt French <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{let that}} pass. I've already stopped here {{talking with you}} <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> care about. Will you pull your buggy out of the way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who {{were those}} two?' asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog. 'You {{have been in}} this yard <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have. Do you know who they are?' ...|$|E
60|$|I kept {{on writing}} as much like Heine as I could for several years, though, {{and for a}} much <b>longer</b> time <b>than</b> <b>I</b> should have done if I had ever become equally impassioned of any other author.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Two years. If <b>I</b> keep it <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> that <b>I</b> {{shall have}} to pay rent {{at the rate of}} three hundred a year. The Petherwin estate {{provides}} me with it till then, which will be the end of Lady Petherwin's term.' ...|$|R
60|$|However, I {{did not say}} anything, but {{started the}} packing. It seemed a <b>longer</b> job <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had {{thought it was going}} to be; but I got the bag {{finished}} at last, and I sat on it and strapped it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did not {{calculate}} upon {{being so}} long,' she said sweetly, {{at the same}} time throwing back her face and smiling. 'But I--was <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected.' ...|$|E

60|$|I have dwelt {{longer on}} this subject <b>than</b> <b>I</b> intended, and <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> perhaps <b>I</b> ought; for having laid down, as my foundation, that the Scripture is a rule; that in all things needful to {{salvation}} it is clear, sufficient, and ordained by God Almighty for that purpose, I have left myself no right to interpret obscure places, such as concern the possibility of eternal happiness to heathens: because whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary to be known.|$|R
