The {{hydraulic}} system of tine new fatigue test rig failed to function. The used hydraulic {{oil and the}} 13; conveyor <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> were examined. It {{was found that the}} pipe and the gauze supporting it had contaminated the oil. The pipe had dissolved in the oil increasing its viscosity and specific gravity. The gauze contributed suspended particles(5 to 100 microns) which blocked the servo valve. Ultrasonic cleaning of the servo valve suspended in benzene removed all such particles of the sieve of the valve. The following recommendations are made to avoid 13; this problem: (i) Use of teflon-lined <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> 13; (ii) Periodic check on the oil viscosity once in six 13; months (iii) Introduction of an easily detachable 13; magnetic line fi 1 ter.

5000|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations {{believes}} that locally produced low-cost treadle pumps could boost {{security in the}} region. KickStart’s strategy is aligned with this philosophy as the organization designs and sells durable yet affordable “MoneyMaker” branded irrigation pumps. Starting in 1998, KickStart began developing this line of manually operated irrigation pumps which allow farmers to easily pull water from a river, pond, or shallow well, and pressurize it through a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> to reach their crops. The MoneyMaker Max, for example, can pressurize water to a total height of 50 feet, pushing it through a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> as far as 200 m, and can irrigate {{as much as two}} acres of land. [...] The low-cost ($70 and $150) pumps are purchased by poor farmers who use them to irrigate their plots, enabling them to move from rain-fed subsistence farming to year-round commercial irrigated agriculture.|$|R

Considering {{the large}} {{deformation}} of the <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter {{caused by the}} pressure, this paper revises the hydraulic capacity {{on the basis of}} physical model of pipe-wall, establishes the mathematical model of the hose by lumped parameter model of pipe, builds the model of the system composed of the constant pressure oil source and flow valve using Simulink software and simulates the hydraulic impact by changing the pipe diameter and length. The established hose model and simulation results can provide reference for the related research...|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a large bore straight tube to which is attached a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> through which clean water is pumped. The Bernoulli effect from the flow of pumped water causes suction {{at the mouth of}} the dredge. Water and sediment are sucked from the excavation site and released from the far end of the tube. The tube can be made of any rigid material such as steel or plastic. The diameter of the tube depends on the power available from the pump and whether delicate work is required.|$|R
50|$|This {{system has}} the {{advantage}} of being able to be tightened mechanically before being sealed. Most threaded systems, such as NPT, have a seal provided by a taper in the thread, so it is difficult to orient both ends of the <b>hose,</b> <b>pipe</b> or tube so that it is not twisted. In the o-ring boss system, this problem is eliminated because the threads do not seal the connection and therefore can be rotated at least a full revolution before they are sealed while maintaining a proper mechanical connection. The orientation problem could also be solved with a suitable union.|$|R

In some pubs a small device or cap, known as a sparkler, is fitted {{to the end of the}} spout and acts like a sprinkler at the end of a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe.</b> This can be twisted to regulate the flow of the beer.

50|$|Attacker was {{designed}} to accompany other ships forming the escort for convoys. The anti-submarine aircraft employed were initially the Fairey Swordfish and later the Grumman Avenger, which could be armed with torpedoes, depth charges, 250 lb bombs or the RP-3 rocket projectile. As well as carrying out their own attacks on U-Boats, these aircraft identified their locations for the convoy's escorts to mount an attack. Typically anti-submarine patrols would be flown between dawn and dusk. One aircraft would fly about 10 mi ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern. Patrols would last between two and three hours, using both Radar and visual observation {{in their search for}} U-Boats.Attacker also had a secondary role, providing oil and provisions for her accompanying destroyers. This could be a lengthy process and was done on the move. It took 40 minutes from firing a line across to the destroyer to start pumping oil, while it took another two hours to pump 98 tons of oil and a further 35 minutes to disconnect the <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> and secure the equipment.|$|R
50|$|The town did {{not have}} any sort of formal or {{professional}} fire brigade. Although the stand-pipes connected to the public water main had recently been improved and increased, the apparatus for delivering water was wholly unsuitable - little more than a cart and a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> (which, according to the inquiry, may have been faulty). The Council had attempted to obtain a trailer pump, but this had been delayed by the war emergency. There was no pumping equipment and formal, organised structure of fire officers. On the night of the fire, the Brigade in Dundalk was summoned by telephone. By the time the Dundalk Fire Brigade (which was a professional unit) had covered the forty-five or so miles of twisting road, {{there was nothing to be}} done. Enniskillen is about ten miles closer to Cavan than Dundalk and the roads are more direct. However, there is nothing to suggest that the Enniskillen Fire Brigade was summoned, even though Northern fire brigades had in the past crossed the border to assist in the South.|$|R

50|$|The M1A1 had a {{backpack}} configuration with a fuel tank {{that consisted of}} two upright bottles. A third, smaller upright bottle, the propellant tank, was located between the fuel tanks. The backpack had a high-pressure valve. The nozzle of the weapon was located {{at the end of}} a long, thin pipe, which was connected to the backpack via a <b>hose.</b> The <b>pipe</b> was slightly bent at the nozzle end. The nozzle had a hydrogen-powered ignitor. The long and thin cylindrical hydrogen tank was attached parallel to the pipe. A battery provided the spark needed to ignite the hydrogen. The hydrogen flame then ignited the fuel, which was forced out of the fuel tank through the hose and out of the nozzle by the propellant pressure when a valve was opened. The valve lever was located at the other end of the pipe, at the junction of the <b>hose</b> and the <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
