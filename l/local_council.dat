5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the <b>local</b> <b>council</b> refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} <b>local</b> <b>council</b> would obey it. Nonetheless, the <b>local</b> <b>council</b> still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E

5|$|Arad has, {{since its}} {{inception}} in 1962, been under the governance of a regional council and <b>local</b> <b>council,</b> before being designated as a city council in 1995. Democratic elections have been held in Arad since 1966, although only Avraham Shochat, Betzalel Tabib and Moty Brill were ever elected or re-elected {{as the head of the}} municipality. The first mayor of the city of Arad was Betzalel Tabib who served as both head of the <b>local</b> <b>council</b> and city council. He was replaced by Mordechai Brill in 2003, although due to his inability to pass a yearly budget, Brill was dismissed by the Minister of the Interior Meir Sheetrit in August 2007, and a government-appointed clerk, Gideon Bar-Lev, took his place. An election took place again 13 April 2010, won by Tali Ploskov of the Yisrael Beiteinu party. The longest serving head of Arad's municipality was Avraham Shochat who served as head of the <b>local</b> <b>council</b> between 1967 and 1986.|$|E

5|$|Highgrove House, {{also known}} as High Grove House or High Grove, is a Grade II listed mansion in the {{suburban}} area of Ruislip, within the London Borough of Hillingdon. Originally built in 1750 by the Reverend John Lidgould, the house was rebuilt in 1881 by Sir Hugh Hume-Campbell following a catastrophic fire. Along with Haydon Hall and Eastcote House, Highgrove {{was one of the}} three main houses of Eastcote and eventually became a residential hostel for homeless families, run by the <b>local</b> <b>council</b> from the 1960s until 2007. An area of the estate was sold to the <b>local</b> <b>council</b> in 1935 by the then-owner Eleanor Warrender to become what is now Warrender Park. In 1975, the house was granted Grade II listed status on account of its special architectural character.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara <b>Local</b> <b>Council</b> {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original.

The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara <b>Local</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper seeks {{for public}} {{spending}} interdependence among jurisdictions within some Italian <b>local</b> <b>councils.</b> We find significant positive interaction among spending of neighboring <b>local</b> <b>councils</b> {{both at the}} level of total expenditure and also for different subcategories.

Attempts to identifying the source of this interaction seem to refuse yardstick competition hypothesis. Fiscal spill-overs among jurisdictions appear as a more plausible explanation; we also find evidence that <b>local</b> <b>councils</b> partnerships fail to effectively internalize these spill-overs. Finally, commuting affects spatial interdependence among jurisdictions. <b>local</b> <b>councils</b> partnerships, <b>local</b> public expenditures, spatial econometrics, spill-overs, strategic interaction, yardistick competition...|$|R
