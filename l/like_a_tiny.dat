25|$|In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake {{looks more}} like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, {{somewhat}} darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks {{on the head and}} neck, and scaly spots {{on the rest of the}} body; overall they look much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> mallard (A. platyrhynchos) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.|$|E
25|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, {{each of which}} acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.|$|E
500|$|Only {{vertebrate}} {{animals have}} ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using {{other kinds of}} sense organs. In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds. They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs {{on each side of}} her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her [...] "ears" [...] to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.|$|E

500|$|Philippe had {{numerous}} business interests and investments, and {{was responsible for}} building at least three restaurants, a casino, a theater, and an eighteen-hole golf course in Guadeloupe in the 1960s. By 1960, Alexis Lichine and Philippe owned an extensive stretch of beach called Jack Bay. They bought a large parcel of undeveloped land in the French portion of Saint Martin around 1964, [...] Philippe's dream had been to build a luxury resort called La Belle Creole which would be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> portion of France in the Caribbean. [...] Philippe's intended guests were the people he had been acquainted with through his hotel work. [...] His plans were also for a casino, a nightclub and various luxury shops {{as part of the}} resort. [...] The French government was interested enough in the project to assist Philippe by providing a desalination plant and a paved road leading to the potential resort. Philippe hired architects and designers who estimated that it would cost about $5.5 million to make the dream a reality. [...] It was decided to break ground after an investment of $2.5 million, which was enough to construct buildings and begin the resort plans. [...] However, Philippe's funds ran out by 1969 and work on La Belle Creole was suspended.|$|E

During movement it is repeatedly raised a couple of millimetres from the substratum before being lowered again.As movement continues, circular, diagonal and longitudinal muscles in the rest of the body contract. Friction between the ventral surface and the substratum is reduced by mucus produced by the ciliated epidermal cells. A. triangulatus can achieve speeds of up to 17m per hour.|$|R

According to a review by composer David Ahlstrom, the capacitance fields generated by the artist allowed audience members to modulate the sound field by moving around the space, activating “tinkly sounds like Chinese wind chimes, percussive little points of sound, cascades of sound that spill like water, and bundles of pointed sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> million <b>tiny</b> Christmas tree lights flickering on and off.” A second iteration of Sun Spots was installed at the Neuberger Museum of Art at SUNY Purchase in 1982.|$|R
