40|$|The {{environmental}} charging of spacecraft surfaces program consists, in part, {{of experimental}} evaluation of material {{response to the}} environmental charged particle flux. A flight type spacecraft thermal control <b>louver</b> <b>assembly</b> has been tested in an electron flux. The louver blade surface potential, the <b>louver</b> <b>assembly</b> currents, and the relatively high number of discharges observed in the electron environment are self-consistent results. The unexpected result of this testing was the flutter observed when the louvers were closed. The flutter is about 1 to 2 Hz in frequency and is probably electrostatically induced...|$|E
50|$|Louvers {{are active}} thermal control {{elements}} {{that are used in}} many different forms. Most commonly they are placed over external radiators, louvers {{can also be used to}} control heat transfer between internal spacecraft surfaces, or be placed on openings on the spacecraft walls. A louver in its fully open state can reject six times as much heat as it does in its fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. The most commonly used louver is the bimetallic, spring-actuated, rectangular blade louver also known as venetian-blind <b>louver.</b> <b>Louver</b> radiator <b>assemblies</b> consist of five main elements: baseplate, blades, actuators, sensing elements, and structural elements.|$|R
50|$|The Gushee House {{stands on}} the {{southwest}} side of Sennebec Road {{in the village of}} Appleton, just south of the local public library. It is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It is connected via a series of single-story ells to a 19th-century barn, which has been set on a concrete foundation. The main block of the house is five bays wide, with two sash windows set on either side of an unusually elaborate main entrance. The entry consists of a six-panel door, flanked by half-length sidelight windows and topped by a half-oval fanlight <b>louver.</b> This <b>assembly</b> is framed by pilasters set on plinths, rising to support a broad entablature and cornice. The interior of the house has a typical center-chimney plan, with well-preserved Federal and Greek Revival styling.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summers}} {{following}} {{his high school}} graduation until his second year in medical school, Carson worked {{at a variety of}} jobs: as a clerk in the payroll office of Ford Motor Company, supervisor of a six-person crew picking up trash along the highway under a federal jobs program for inner-city students, a clerk in the mailroom of Young & Rubicam Advertising, assembling fender parts and inspecting back window <b>louvers</b> on the <b>assembly</b> line at Chrysler, a crane operator at Sennett Steel, and finally a radiology technician taking X-rays. At Yale, Carson had a part-time job on campus as a student police aide.|$|R
