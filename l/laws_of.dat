5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> physics are {{the same for all}} observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E

5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> physics {{are the same}} in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E

Restitution for unjust enrichment is a subset <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> restitution {{in the same way}} that compensation for breach of contract is a subset <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> relating to compensation.|$|R

5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{outstanding}} {{problems associated with}} the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem.
