For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500hPa level, or 5.9km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection.

It is therefore a key input variable to models of land-surface-atmosphere interaction. Despite this importance, its spatial variability is poorly understood and simple assumptions are made to extrapolate it from point observations to the catchment scale. We use a dataset of 2. 75 years of air temperature measurements (from May 2012 to November 2014) at a network of up to 27 locations in the Langtang River, Nepal, catchment to investigate air temperature seasonality and consistency between years. We use observations from high elevations and from the easternmost section of the basin to corroborate previous findings of shallow <b>lapse</b> <b>rates.</b> Seasonal variability is strong, with shallowest <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> during the monsoon season. Diurnal variability is also strong and {{should be taken into}} account since processes such as melt have a pronounced diurnal variability. Use of seasonal <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> seems crucial for glacio-hydrological modelling, but seasonal <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> seem stable over the 2 - 3 years investigated. Lateral variability at transects across valley is high and dominated by aspect, with south-facing sites being warmer than north-facing sites and deviations from the fitted <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> of up to several degrees.

Observations were compared against a weighted average of nearby private-weather-station readings and Rapid Refresh [RAP]-model gridpoint forecasts for the corresponding time periods. Local nowcasts or forecasts for locations along the transects — generated from a similarity analysis of station and transect-location metadata — showed generally poor skill, though the consistently greater errors at higher elevations suggest the potential for fruitful additional adjustments {{beyond the scope of this}} study. A distinct reversal in the upslope wind corresponding to <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> near the moist-adiabatic value supports the hypothesis of a triggered hilltop cold-air pool.

However assuming an emission of six billion tons of sulphur dioxide, his computer simulations concluded that a maximum global cooling of approximately 15°C occurred for {{three years after the}} eruption, and that this cooling would last for decades, devastating life. Because the saturated adiabatic <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> is 4.9°C/1,000 m for temperatures above freezing, the tree line and the snow line were around 3,000 m (9,900ft) lower at this time. The climate recovered over a few decades, and Robock found no evidence that the 1,000-year cold period seen in Greenland ice core records had resulted from the Toba eruption. In contrast, Oppenheimer believes that estimates of a drop in surface temperature by 3–5°C are probably too high, and he suggests that temperatures dropped only by 1°C.

25|$|The {{possibility}} of using water isotope depletion with elevation to reconstruct paleoaltimetry was demonstrated {{as early as}} the late 1960s, when Caltech geochemist Samuel Epstein tried to collect rainwater at different elevations in a single storm. The δ18O and δD lapse rates vary within -1 to -5‰/km and -10 to -40‰/km respectively, but can vary with locations and seasons, and are not exactly linear with altitude. One of the first studies in stable isotope paleoaltimetry demonstrated a meteoric water δD signature of -90 to -139‰ in fluid inclusions in quartz and adularia in an epithermal gold-silver deposit in Nevada, and suggested the applicability of stable isotopes in reconstruction of ancient topography in the Great Basin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of hydrous silicate minerals have since then been used to reconstruct topographic histories in mountain ranges across the world, including the North American Cordillera, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the European Alps, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. Lab experiments with clay minerals have shown that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions are relatively resistant to alteration at moderate temperature (<100nbsp&°C), and can preserve the original meteoric water signal. One important effect of mountain ranges on rainfall stable isotopes is the rain shadow effect, in which an isotopic depletion happens in precipitation on the leeward side compared to the windward side. A change in the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation on the two sides of a mountain can be used to infer the magnitude of the rain shadow effect. In one such study, an isotope enrichment was observed in smectite {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-Miocene to late Pliocene, suggesting a decrease in elevation during this period. Another study found δD values around -140‰ in muscovite in the North America Cordillera during the early Eocene, which would suggest an elevation 1000m higher than today at the time. In addition to hydrous minerals, hydrogen isotopes in biomarkers such as leaf waxes have also been developed for paleoaltimetry studies. The δD <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> in leaf waxes (-21‰/km) falls in the range of meteoric water observations. As an example study, leaf wax δD data have been used to confirm hydrous mineral paleoaltimetry for the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada during the Eocene.|$|E

The forcing data become increasingly important in high-elevation, glacierized catchments where the interplay between extreme topography, climate, and the cryosphere is complex. It is challenging to generate a reliable forcing data set that captures this spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we analyze the results of a 1 year field campaign focusing on air temperature and precipitation observations in the Langtang valley in the Nepalese Himalayas. We use the observed time series to characterize both temperature <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> (LRs) and precipitation gradients (PGs). We study their spatial and temporal variability, and we attempt to identify possible controlling factors. We show that very clear LRs exist in the valley and that there are strong seasonal differences related to the water vapor content in the atmosphere. Results also show that the LRs are generally shallower than the commonly used environmental <b>lapse</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis of the precipitation observations reveals that there is great variability in precipitation over short horizontal distances. A uniform valley wide PG cannot be established, and several scale-dependent mechanisms may explain our observations. We complete our analysis by showing the impact of the observed LRs and PGs on the outputs of the TOPKAPI-ETH glaciohydrological model. We conclude that LRs and PGs have a very large impact on the water balance composition and that short-term monitoring campaigns have the potential to improve model quality considerably.

We study sets of simulations {{of past and}} present climates in which carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations vary over a wide range: from pre-industrial era levels of 280 ppm to an exceedingly high value of 8960 ppm. This allows us to assess the importance of convective processes relative to middle latitude thermal stratification and changes to the general circulation in progressively warmer climate states. As a tool to assess the stability of the atmosphere, we calculate a thermodynamic variable called saturation potential vorticity (P*), which has the property of being identically zero wherever <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> are neutral with respect to moist convection, and large where <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> are stable. Using P* allows us to examine convective motions arising from both gravitational accelerations as well as symmetric instabilities. We assess the ability of current models (of varying spectral resolutions) in resolving conditions unstable to slantwise convection. We show that the coarse resolution reanalysis data captures instances of observed slantwise convection. Our results show examples of vertically stable <b>lapse</b> <b>rates,</b> while being conditionally unstable along slanted angular momentum surfaces. This suggests the need for model parameterizations of convection to include instabilities arising from symmetric displacements. Tropical regions are neutral with respect to moist convection while higher latitudes most often have stable <b>lapse</b> <b>rates,</b> especially during the winter months. In the warmer climate simulations, the frequency of convectively neutral air masses increases in both middle latitude and polar regions, especially during the summer months.
