Thus, {{the aim of this}} research was to compare six hoe-type <b>furrow</b> <b>openers,</b> four of industrial manufacturing and two handcrafted models, which were used in planters in the region of Pelotas, Brazil. The parameters for comparison among these <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> were the horizontal (Fh) and vertical (Fv) forces acting on the tip of the hoe and the cross-sectional area mobilized in the furrow. The experimental design was randomized, with six treatments (<b>furrow</b> <b>openers)</b> from T 1 to T 6, with four repetitions, constituted by their passage through plots of 20 x 3 m. The force data were collected by load cells and a signal conditioner. The determination of the mobilized area in the furrow was done by a micro soil profilometer. It was concluded that the <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> T 1, T 4 and T 6 presented the lowest values of horizontal force (statistically equal and ranging between 1, 034 and 1, 230 N) and that T 1 and T 2 produced the highest vertical forces downwards (statistically identical and varying between 749 and 845 N).

40|$|Introduction Direct {{planting}} {{becomes more}} common in the recent years, because it conserves soil and water as well as it saves energy and time. However, this technology needs special implements such as seed planter. Given that direct planting is practiced in undisturbed lands, so it was needed to design a special <b>furrow</b> <b>opener.</b> In order to obtain a suitable <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> this experiment was conducted in rain-fed Agricultural Research Institute in Maragheh. Materials and Methods Most of seed planters that are used for cultivation in rain fed conditions are equipped by hoe-type <b>furrow</b> <b>opener.</b> Hoe-type <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> have good penetration in hard and dry soils. However, {{they do not have the}} ability for direct planting. Hoe-type <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> was chosen as a model. Then by changing the geometric form of the depth to width ratio (d/w), the two openers were designed. In the first design, which was called O 1 two wings and a narrow blade acting as a coulter were added in front of the hoe-type <b>furrow</b> <b>opener.</b> In the second design, which was called O 2, in addition to the O 1 modification, <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> width was decreased and a disk blade was added for seed sowing (Fig. 1). The performance of O 1 and O 2 openers were compared with the conventional hoe-type <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> (check) in soil bin and in field conditions. At three different forward speeds (1, 1. 5 and 2 m. s- 1) with 3 replications, the effects of the openers designs of vertical and horizontal soil forces were evaluated in soil-bin conditions. In order to evaluate the performance of the <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> in field conditions, an experiment was conducted using a split plot design based on RCBD at 4 replications. <b>Furrow</b> <b>openers</b> formed the main plots and forward speeds formed the sub plots. Each plot size was 22 meters long in two rows for each treatment. After germination of wheat crop, the numbers of seedlings in two rows were counted (along a one meter). After crop maturity, all plots were harvested by hand and grain and biological yield was measured. ANOVA test, uniformity test and mean comparison were conducted by using Genstat software. Results and Discussion The soil bin test results showed that opener design and forward speed both have significant influences on the horizontal force (p< 0. 01). Horizontal force was increased with increasing of forward speeds. The same result was reported by Wheeler and Godwin, 1996 and Astafford, 1979. The lowest horizontal force (average 1. 66 kN) occurred at 1 m. s- 1 and the highest (average 1. 94 kN) occurred at 2 m. s- 1 forward speeds. Horizontal force increased in O 2 (2. 8...|$|R

However, the rice residue management becomes an "impossible to achieve" task {{due to high}} soil moisture content at harvest time and the thickness of rice straw. Disc type <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> are used for both seed drilling as well as straw cutting during no tillage sowing. A {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the draft requirement and straw cutting performances of different sized <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> in no-till paddy soil conditions. Double disc <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> was tested on an in-field traction bench for three working depths, i. e. 30, 60 and 90 mm, and three forwarding speeds, i. e. 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 m/s. The draft and vertical forces on the disc were recorded with load cells. These sensors were connected to a data acquisition system developed with hardware and software. The results revealed that the size of the <b>furrow</b> <b>opener,</b> operating depth and the forwarding speed had significant effects (P< 0. 05) on the horizontal and vertical forces, and the straw cutting performance. Mean values of the draft were 648. 9, 737. 2 and 784. 6 N for the opener with diameters of 330, 450 and 600 mm respectively, and the vertical forces for similar openers were 904. 7, 1553. 9 and 1620. 4 N, respectively. Furthermore, the mean straw cutting efficiencies for the double disc opener with diameters of 330, 450 and 600 mm were 39. 36, 78. 47 and 65. 46 %, respectively. The opener with 450 mm diameter provided higher straw cutting efficiency as compared to 600 mm diameter disc, while lowest straw cutting efficiency was observed with 330 mm diameter disc.

The study was conducted {{on a farm in}} Santa Maria (Brazil/RS), in soil classified as sandy loam Ultisol. The experiment consisted of 24 combinations of treatments with three replications in a 2 Ã 3 Ã 4 factorial experiment. The combinations were formed by the interaction of the factors including: two types of <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> (hoe and double-disc), three types of coulters (no-coulter, smooth and offset fluted) and four levels of forward speed (1. 11, 1. 67, 2. 22 and 2. 78 m/s). Soil elevation and soil disturbance area profiles were obtained {{with the use of a}} micro profilometer, and disturbance values were calculated with the aid of computer software program Auto Cad. The disturbance area was not affected by speed; it was greater when using the hoe opener, and in association with the offset fluted coulter.

In a certain way, the mechanism used in seeders to open furrows for the deposition of fertilizers can have great importance in facilitating root penetration. This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of two fertilizer distribution mechanisms and N fertilization in upland rice (Oryza sativa) under NTS. The experiment was carried out in the growing seasons 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 2003, in Botucatu, state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. A completely randomized block design was applied, with subdivided plots and four replications. Main plots consisted of two furrow opening mechanisms (<b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> and double disk). Subplots consisted of four side dressing N levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha- 1).

When seeds are sown too close together, it is time consuming to thin seedlings to the desired plant spacing of 20 to 30 cm by hand and {{very difficult to do}} mechanically. The overall goal of the project was to improve lettuce seed placement accuracy and reduce the percentage of seeds spaced closely together. Specific objectives were: 1) to compare vacuum and belt-type planters to determine which style of planter provides better planting performance, 2) to evaluate belt planter seeding performance with different types of <b>furrow</b> <b>openers,</b> and 3) to develop practical modifications for vacuum planters to improve lettuce seed placement accuracy. Three vacuum planter configurations, an unmodified and two reduced seed drop height designs and a belt planter equipped with two types of <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> were tested in situ with pelleted lettuce seed at four travel speeds ranging from 1. 6 to 4. 0 kph. Belt planter performance was significantly better than that of the vacuum planter. Vacuum and belt planters both provided acceptable levels of performance at speeds below 2. 4 kph, but at higher speeds, seed placement accuracy declined rapidly. No differences in planter performance were found between the two belt planter configurations tested. The mid-level drop height vacuum planter configuration had significantly better seed placement precision and fewer closely spaced seed spacings as compared to the unmodified vacuum planter. These findings illustrate the significant effect planter type, travel speed, and drop height have on planter performance. They also contradict the common perception that vacuum planters deliver seed more precisely and with fewer closely-spaced seeds as compared to belt planters.

As a second step, the prototype was tested in the field by analysing the effects of forward speed and application depth on the mechanical behaviour of the implement structure. The FEM was used in the design phase and a prototype was manufactured. The structural strains on the prototype chassis under working conditions were tested by using strain gauges to validate the design phase. Three forward speeds (4. 5, 5. 5, and 7. 0 km/h), three application depths (0. 12, 0. 15, and 0. 17 m), and two types of soil (clayey-silty-loam and clayey-silty-sandy) were considered. The prototype was validated successfully by analysing the information obtained from the strain gauges. The Von Mises stresses indicated a safety coefficient of 1. 9 for the most critical load case. Although both forward speed and application depth had a significant effect on the stresses generated on the chassis, the latter parameter critically affected the structural behaviour of the implement. The effects of the application depth on the strains were linear such that strains increased with depth.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on the physical properties of two Albaqualf soils of the Central Plains region in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. Two experiments were conducted: one in Santa Maria, RS, during the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 crop seasons, and another in Formigueiro, RS, during the 2013 / 14 crop season. A randomized block experimental design with four replications was used. The treatments were: sowing using an offset double disc (T 1); sowing using a fluted coulter disc (wavy disc with 12 waves) (T 2); sowing with a knife runner opener (T 3); sowing with a knife runner opener + press wheel mechanism for ground levelling (T 4); sowing using a <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> upon a raised bed (T 5); and chisel plough + sowing using an offset double-disc (T 6). In the 2014 / 15 growing season, the T 4 factor was changed using a knife runner opener 0. 05 m from the planting row. A smaller reduction in the compacted subsurface soil layer was observed for both T 1 and T 2, which exhibited high soil bulk density values for the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 crop seasons. Furthermore, T 3, T 5 and T 6 led to a reduction in bulk density, and increasing total porosity and macroporosity in the soil, which consequently increased water infiltration, water storage capacity, and crop yield in areas with the presence of a compacted subsurface soil layer...|$|R

The proposed system was evaluated at various conditions including three illumination levels, previous plant residue levels (9, 24 and 50 %) and soil surfaces tilled by one of the three implements (plow, subsoiler and row-crop plant <b>furrow</b> <b>opener).</b> For each test accuracy of algorithm was determined and Line Prediction Error (LPE) was calculated by the algorithm. Tests were conducted in field at three forward speeds; 4, 7. 5 and 11 km h - 1 and three steering angles; 10 o, 16 o and 20. 5 o. Distance error (DE) and response time (RT) for each forward speed and steering angle was measured and compared. Results indicated that various illumination and residue levels have not distorted the output of the system proposed (LPE was limited to Â± 1. 72 cm). Response time was decreased for increasing forward speed and steering angle. Effect of forward speed on DE was significant whereas effect of steering angle on DE was not significant (0. 05 p). </p...|$|R
40|$|Currently used {{conventional}} tillage systems for small-scale vegetable {{production in the}} region of Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico require a considerable amount of hand labor, energy and materials for all activities. Seedbed preparation can require up to 60 % of the total production cost in some systems in Mexico. Further, soil is degraded and eroded due to the system. Conservation tillage may reduce costs and prevent soil degradation, but appropriate tools, such as, no-tillage seeders for small-scale farmers are not available. This papers reports on the design and construction of a prototype of a no-tillage seeder for small-scale conservation tillage using a 2 -wheeled tractor. Three main functions received particular attention: opening of the soil, placing seed and/or fertilizer and closing the slot. Because of its vapor conservation and good seedling emergence, tools to create T-shaped slots were chosen, with adapted depth control and closing and covering devices. A systematic design process was applied in order to reach the required decisions. Function diagrams were defined from where morphologic charts guided the selection of the configuration of the seeder. A preliminary evaluation included testing of two <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> disc types (notched and fluted), and four crop residue levels, 0, 30, 60 and 100 %, with respect to performance of the seeder. An evaluation showed that with low cover amounts a consistent and firm seed cover was obtained, but emergence quality decreased due to insufficient residue cover. The notched disc had a better performance than the fluted disc. The inverted T-shape in the soil was not always sustained due to technical flaws. It was possible to build a prototype under 2000 dollars with basic tools in a local workshop. Further research will focus on the biological performance and improvement of the mechanical components and performance...|$|R
40|$|Rhizoctonia {{root rot}} of wheat and barley caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG- 8 {{continues}} to cause significant yield losses, especially in no-till cropping systems in low to medium rainfall regions across southern Australia. This {{study was conducted}} to determine if liquid banding of the fungicides UniformÂ® and EverGolÂ® Prime could significantly reduce yield losses attributed to Rhizoctonia. From 2011 - 2013, 28 trials were conducted at 14 sites across SA and WA; UniformÂ® was evaluated in 10 barley and 11 wheat trials, and EverGolÂ® Prime in 6 barley trials sown using a knife point <b>furrow</b> <b>opener.</b> Sites had significant levels of Rhizoctonia prior to seeding and treatments included banding fungicide 3 - 4 cm below the seed, on the soil surface behind the press wheel and a combination of both. Seed treatments plus/minus banding fungicide below the seed were also evaluated. Vibranceâ¢ and EverGolÂ® Prime seed treatments produced significant yield responses in 4 / 21 and 2 / 6 trials, respectively. UniformÂ® banded below the seed at different rates produced significant yield responses in 21 / 33 trials and EverGolÂ® Prime in 2 / 8 trials. The split UniformÂ® treatment applied to the surface and below the seed produced the greatest proportion of significant yield responses, 14 / 19 trials, with net yield increases of up to 0. 87 and 0. 53 t/ha in barley and wheat, respectively. For EverGolÂ® Prime this split treatment resulted in 2 / 5 trials showing significant responses with the largest net gain being 0. 44 t/ha in barley. The APVMA is currently reviewing submissions to have UniformÂ® registered for banding on the surface and below the seed, and EverGolÂ® Prime below the seed only...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Offset Double-Disk Opener (DDO) is {{a popular}} <b>furrow</b> <b>opener</b> in {{conservation}} tillage. It has some limitations such as negative suction to penetrate in the soil, hair pinning and mixing seed and fertilizer in the slot. Because of importance of separation of seed and fertilizer in the slot, by adding two horizontal mini disks to DDO a modified opener was made (MDO) which placed the fertilizer between and under two rows of seed. Approach: To consider performance of novel opener an indoor comparison test between DDO and MDO was performed at soil bin. The experiment was conducted with three working speeds (3, 6 and 8 km h - 1), two bulk densities of soil (1. 1 and 1. 4 Mg m - 3) and two levels of residues (1 and 2 ton ha - 1). The experimental design consisted in a (3 Ã 2 Ã 2) complete randomized factorial with three replicates for each test. Moisture of seed furrow, separation of seed and fertilizer, hair pinning and resultant forces acting on the openers were used as assessing indexes. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between soil moisture content in slots created by DDO and MDO at 0 - 4 cm depth, but at 4 - 8 cm the in the slot created by MDO moisture content was higher about 9 %. Horizontal force for both openers increased with increasing speed and soil bulk density. Vertical force for DDO was negative so it needed additional weight for penetrating in the soil, but vertical force for MDO was positive and, which can solve the challenge of penetration in the soil in DDO. In soft soil with heavy residues some trash was pushed by DDO into seed furrow (hair pinning) but at MDO seed were placed at clean groove. Lateral and vertical separation of seed and fertilizer was performed effectively by MDO (4. 5 and 5 cm, respectively) while DDO put seed and fertilizer close to each other. Conclusion: Overall, the Modified Offset Double-disks (MDO) had better performance. So by adapting this opener with no-tillage drillers it would possible to have higher yield in conservation tillage where the most appropriate opener is disk type...|$|R

No tillage implies {{keeping the}} soil surface covered with crops or crop residues, which might {{influence}} planter performance. Using fixed shanks as <b>furrow</b> <b>openers</b> to place fertiliser is an alternative to minimize compaction, as it mobilizes the soil in the sowing line. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of different amounts of winter cover crop residues evenly distributed on the soil, the effect of the shanks working depth and quantity of planter lines on power demand, cross sectional furrow area and total volume of soil mobilized in the lines and corresponding wheel slippage in distrophic red Argisol. During winter, black oats and black oats plus turnip were used as cover crops before maize and beans, respectively. Increasing the working depth showed an increase in power demand, as measured directly at the shanks (three lines for maize and five for beans). There was also an effect of residue, increasing power demand on the shanks, but only measurable with the planter operating with three lines in maize sowing. Soil mobilization in the sowing lines was influenced by the amount of residues, the working depths of shank and the quantity of planter lines. Wheel slippage was higher with larger amounts of soil cover residues and when power demand was higher...|$|R

Verificou-se o desempenho de cinco tipos de soldagem, utilizando-se eletrodos revestidos e arame tubular, sobre a extremidade das ponteiras. Os testes foram executados em solo franco-arenoso caracterizado fisicamente pela sua textura, Ã­ndice de plasticidade, densidade e teor de Ã¡gua, assim como a resistÃªncia Ã  penetraÃ§Ã£o. O desgaste, a forÃ§a {{horizontal}} e vertical foram obtidos em intervalos de 10, 5 km atÃ© o limite de 52, 5 km. Os resultados indicaram que a ponteira testemunha perdeu na mÃ©dia do experimento 38, 41 % da sua massa inicial quando percorreu 52, 5 km enquanto que as demais ponteiras soldadas percorreram entre 61, 0 km e 108, 7 km para atingir as mesmas reduÃ§Ãµes de massa. Observou-se que as forÃ§as verticais e horizontais contribuÃ­ram com 11 % e 89 %, respectivamente, da forÃ§a resultante na ponteira. Com o uso dos revestimentos obteve-se um aumento da Ã¡rea trabalhada na semeadura, pela maior durabilidade das ferramentas, entre 2, 0 ha e 13, 4 ha, em relaÃ§Ã£o Ã  testemunha. A eficiÃªncia de campo teÃ³rica foi maior quando se utilizou os revestimentos sendo que o arame tubular aumentou em 5, 1 % em relaÃ§Ã£o Ã  ponteira sem revestimento. A partir dos resultados encontrados conclui-se que se pode aumentar a vida Ãºtil das ponteiras de hastes sulcadoras atravÃ©s da adiÃ§Ã£o de material soldÃ¡vel e que a conservaÃ§Ã£o da geometria das ferramentas, proporciona a manutenÃ§Ã£o das forÃ§as atuantes sobre estas assim como a suas caracterÃ­sticas funcionais.

It was verified the performance of five welding types, being used covered electrodes and tubular wire, over the extremity of the hoe. The tests were executed in franc-sandy soil characterized physically by its texture, plasticity index, density, and water tenor, {{as well as the}} resistance to the penetration. The wearing, the horizontal and vertical force were obtained in intervals of 10, 5 km to the limit of 52, 5 km. The results indicated that the witness ferrule has lost in the average of the experiment 38, 41 % of its initial mass when it traveled 52, 5 km while the other welded ferrules traveled between 61, 0 km and 108, 7 km to reach the same mass reductions. It was observed that the vertical and horizontal forces contributed with 11 % and 89 %, respectively, of the resulting force in the hoe. With the use of the coverings, it was obtained an increase of the area worked in the sowing, for the largest durability of the tools, between 2, 0 ha and 13, 4 ha, in relation to the witness. The theoretical field efficiency was larger when it was used the coverings. The tubular wire increased in 5, 1 % in relation to the ferrule without covering.
