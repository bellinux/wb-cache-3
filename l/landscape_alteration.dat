The patchwork of incremental changes may remain stuck in niches (such as lead markets) or be isolated in a few pioneering regions. Structural barriers embedded in the social and economic framework “lock-in” development pathways, making <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations</b> particularly challenging. Examples of such structural barriers include e.g. vested interests of asset owners that make them less favourable to radical innovations and long investment cycles in e.g. infrastructures (like roads and power stations) that favour established economic practices and actors [43]. Our vision is based on a combination of bottom-up and top-down changes that includes both step-wise incremental processes and structural changes in the way societies and economies operate and are governed. A key aspect seems to be going beyond the support of niches and regime changes to address <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations</b> by identifying and tackling structural barriers. We highlight five key challenges to managing the transition toward our vision.|$|R

We hypothesised that colonisation rates would be higher for exotic fish species and that extinction rates would be higher for native species in large stream systems. We also predicted that cold-water species would be more impacted than thermally tolerant species. To test these hypotheses, we used generalised linear mixed models to compare changes in native and exotic fish species richness over 10 years in a French drainage basin subjected to <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations.</b> Exotic fish were more susceptible to local extinction than the native ones. Extinction was greater among cold-tolerant species and at higher elevations. Colonisation by exotic species was higher at lower elevations. Although a decade of expanding urbanisation affected fish colonisation, agricultural lands experienced higher extinction rates. In the context of global changes in land use and population pressure, our study suggests that the temporal dynamics of fish diversity are driven by <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations</b> as well as by the thermal tolerance of species...|$|R

50|$|A {{pioneer in}} the use of remote sensing in Maya {{research}} is NASA archaeologist Tom Sever, who has applied remote sensing to research in Maya site discovery as well as mapping causeways (sacbeob) and roads. Sever has stressed the enormous use of remote sensing in uncovering settlement patterns, population densities, societal structure, communication, and transportation. Sever has done much of his research in the Petén region of northern Guatemala, where he and his research team have used satellite imagery and GIS to map undiscovered roads and causeways the ancient Maya built to connect cities and settlements. These landscape artifacts represent the advantage of using remote sensing as these causeways are not visible from the ground. By mapping these forms, Sever is able to locate new sites and further uncover ancient Maya methods of communicated and transportation. Sever and his team also use remote sensing methods to gather data on deforestation. The rain forests of the Petén are undergoing massive deforestation, and Sever's remote sensing offers another window into this understanding and halting this problem. Monitoring the rate of deforestation not only has important ecological value, but the use of remote sensing can detect landscape change. By measuring the magnitude of landscape change in terms of vegetative cover and soil geography, as well as shifting land use patterns and the associated cultural diversity, archaeologists are given a window into depletion rates and trends in anthropogenic <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration.</b>|$|E

40|$|The need to {{understand}} how anthropogenic <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> affects fauna populations has never been more pressing. The importance of developing an understanding of the processes behind local extinction is widely acknowledged, but inference from spatial patterns of fauna distribution continues to dominate. However, this approach is limited in its ability to generate strong predictions about future distributions and local extinctions, especially when population-level responses to <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> are subject to long time lags. We review the potential for indices of physiological stress and condition to contribute {{to understand}}ing of how landscape pattern affects species persistence.

Spatial patterns of chronic stress may therefore yield valuable insight into how <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> influences species.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} modified world, understanding and predicting {{the consequences of}} <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> on biodiversity is a challenge for ecologists. To this end, metacommunity theory has developed {{to better understand the}} complexity of local and regional interactions that occur across larger landscapes. While metacommunity ecology has now provided several alternative models of species coexistence at different spatial scales, predictions regarding the consequences of <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> have been done exclusively for the competition-colonization trade off model (CC). In this paper we investigate the effects of landscape perturbation on source-sink metacommunities. We show that habitat destruction perturbs the equilibria among species competitive effects within the metacommunity, driving both direct extinctions and an indirect extinction debt. As in CC models, we found a time lag for extinction following habitat destruction that varied in length depending upon the relative importance of direct and indirect effects. However, in contrast to CC models, we found that the less competitive species are more affected by habitat destruction. The best competitors can sometimes even be positively affected by habitat destruction, which corresponds well with the results of field studies. Our results are complementary to those results found in CC models of metacommunity dynamics. From a conservation perspective, our results illustrate that <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> jeopardizes species coexistence in patchy landscapes through complex indirec...|$|E

Neither the business tools of integrated environmental management nor classic environmental policy tools can deliver such systemic changes at the level of <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations.</b> Nevertheless, the key insight is that materials and other resources are economically relevant, both for business and for macro-economic perspectives.

40|$|Surface {{mining and}} {{quarrying}} typically generate {{a considerable number of}} environmental impacts among which <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> {{remains one of the most}} significant. Although <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> does not directly affect public health, it may produce an adverse reaction among potential observers and compromise the use and potential growth of the surrounding territory. In order to assess the impact produced by surface excavation, some aspects of landscape modification can be objectively measured, such as the extent of the visible alteration, its shape and the chromatic contrast with the surroundings. With reference to a case study located in Sardinia, this article discusses the implementation of two different visual impact assessment methods, one defined by the EC decision 272 / 02 (Commission Decision 2002), the other previously proposed by the authors of the present article and based on the estimation of the impact indicator Lvi (level of visual impact). The comparison of the results proves that the method established by the EC decision leads to the underestimation of the visual impact for alterations which are significantly wider than their height. On the other hand, the implementation of the Lvi method clearly shows how the indicator is affected by the quarry’s lateral extent and suggests the possibility of calculating a global impact factor LVI to be associated to a given route, considering the variability of the visual impact with the curvilinear abscissa of the route itself...|$|E

40|$|Patterns {{of urban}} {{development}} across the United States are changing natural landscapes and their dynamics. Although scholars in landscape ecology are increasingly studying {{the relationship between}} urban development and ecological conditions, few have directly addressed {{the question of how}} patterns of urban development affect landscape dynamics. In this paper we first propose that landscape patterns emerge from the spatial interactions between biophysical and socioeconomic processes. We then analyze urban patterns using landscape metrics to characterize their composition and configuration. We propose that distinct landscape signatures relevant to various ecosystem processes can be identified for different urban development patterns. Using selected landscape metrics we describe patterns of landscape change in the Central Puget Sound region between 1991 and 1999. The findings indicate two simultaneous key trends: the loss of forested land and the intensification of urban areas. Land conversion and increase in population density have been accompanied by an increase in dispersion of urban development and forest fragmentation. Identified trends have significant consequences for the response that ecosystems have shown to these human <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic <b>landscape</b> <b>alterations</b> have {{increased}} global carbon transported by rivers to oceans since preindustrial times. Few suitable observational data sets exist to distinguish different drivers of carbon increase, given that alterations only reveal {{their impact on}} fluvial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over long time periods. We use the world's longest record of DOC concentrations (130 years) to identify key drivers of DOC change in the Thames basin (UK). We show that 90 % of the long-term rise in fluvial DOC is explained by increased urbanization, which released to the river 671 kt C over the entire period. This source of carbon is linked to rising population, due to increased sewage effluent. Soil disturbance from land use change explained shorter-term fluvial responses. The largest land use disturbance was during the Second World War, when almost half the grassland area in the catchment was converted into arable land, which released 45 kt C from soils to the river.

40|$|Human-driven {{landscape}} changes may promote plant invasions by increasing propagule pressure and providing favourable conditions for non-native species {{to establish and}} spread. The increase in invasion levels might not be immediate but rather exhibit a time-lag (i. e. invasion debt). Moreover, the relationship between invasion and landscape history (i. e. changes in landscape composition) might be extremely complex as it might also include extinction debts of invasive species currently in regression. In {{order to understand the}} effect of landscape history on plant invasion, we studied the invasion level in coastal plant communities affected by intense human-driven <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> in the last 50 years. We identified all non-native plant species within 809 grid cells (250 × 250 m) along ~ 500 km of the Spanish SW coast. We tested the association of (1) non-native richness conditional on the overall presence of non-natives (at least one species), and (2) the occurrence of the most frequent non-native species, with the percentage of human land-cover categories in 1956, 1991 and 2007 using a multimodel inference approach. We used these models to project future invasion patterns in the region. We found non-native richness to be more associated with land-cover variables in 1956 than in 2007, suggesting the existence of an invasion debt, but not for the overall presence of non-natives. For most frequent species, the effects of past <b>landscape</b> <b>alteration</b> depended on the introduction pathway and the region of origin.
