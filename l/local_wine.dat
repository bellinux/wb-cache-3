5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Champagne {{has seen the}} wine evolve from being a pale, pinkish still wine to the {{sparkling}} wine now associated with the region.

When Hugh Capet was crowned King of France in 987 at the cathedral of Reims, located {{in the heart of the}} region, he started a tradition that brought successive monarchs to the region—with the <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> being on prominent display at the coronation banquets. The early wine of the Champagne region was a pale, pinkish wine made from Pinot noir.|$|E

25|$|Wine {{competitions}} {{are held}} to assess whether a wine is of good quality and whether it is true to its character. In 2014, more than 20 wine competitions were held in South Africa, many of them concentrating on specific styles or varietals. The only South African wine competition acknowledged as a truly international wine concours is the annual Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards, founded in 1997. The first Michelangelo Liqueur Awards were held in 2014 {{as part of the}} wine awards. Only accredited wine judges, wine makers and sommeliers from Europe, USA, Australia and Asia are invited to judge the approximately 1700 South African wines and spirits entered by producers in the Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards (www.michelangeloawards.com). Another South African wine competition, the national Veritas award, was started in 1990. The Top 100 South African Wine Competition is a newer example of a <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> competition.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a matter}} of {{speculation}} why Hannibal did not march on Rome or what might have happened had he done so immediately after Trasimene. The Carthaginian army instead marched south-east into Umbria, through Perugia, although Livy refers to a failed siege of Spoletum, a Latin colony, Polybius does not mention it, and it is likely that only some Carthaginian raiders troubled the Latin colony. Hannibal, all the while ravaging the countryside, marched through Picenum towards the Adriatic coast, reaching Herita 10 days after leaving Lake Trasimene. Here Hannibal rested his army, which was suffering from scurvy, refitted the Libyan/African troops with captured Roman equipment and retrained them, and by using low grade <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> (acetum) as an ointment, brought the cavalry horses back to health. With no Roman army situated near him, Hannibal was free to choose his next course of action unhindered.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} windy {{throughout}} the year and this makes the climate dry and warm enough to grow grapes. In classical antiquity wine production was linked with the cult of Dionysus, while grapes were also depicted in the local currency. The <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> culture outlived the Ottoman period. Vineyards have existed on the island since antiquity and today occupy one-third of the total land of the island and 80% of its agricultural land, In the mid-1800s, the island exported 800,000 barrels of wine annually and was revered as the best wine in the Eastern Mediterranean. Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote in the 16th century that the finest wines in the world were being produced in Tenedos. Today, the island {{is one of the}} major wine producing areas in Turkey and grows four local strains of grape: Çavuş, Karasakız (Kuntra), Altinbaş (Vasilaki), and Karalahna. However, in recent years traditional French varieties have increased in prominence, namely Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E

25|$|Wine {{was bought}} and sold at the Halle aux Vins, a large market ordered by Napoleon I in 1811, but not {{finished}} until 1845. It was located on the Left Bank of the Seine, on the Quai Saint Bernard, near the present-day Jardin des Plantes. It was on the river so that barrels of wine could be delivered by barge from Burgundy and other wine regions and unloaded directly into the depot. The hand-made barrels were enormous and were of slightly different sizes for each region; barrels of Burgundy wine held 271 liters each. The Halle aux Vins covered fourteen hectares, and contained 158 wine cellars on the ground level. It sold not only wine, but also liquors, spirits, vinegar, and olive oil. Wine merchants rented space in the cellars and halls, located in four large buildings. All the wine and spirits were taxed; inspectors in the halls opened all the barrels, tested the wine to be certain it did not contain more than 18 percent alcohol, and one of 28 tasters employed by the Prefecture de Police tasted each to verify {{that it was in}} fact wine. Wine that contained more than 18 percent alcohol was taxed at a higher rate. The Halle sold 956,910 hectoliters of wine to Parisian cafés, bars and <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> merchants in 1867.|$|E
25|$|North-African {{production}} {{was based on}} ancient tradition which could {{be traced back to}} the Phoenician colony of Carthage. Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3. In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC thanks to the <b>local</b> <b>wine</b> production which flourished for long time. This types developed into the Camulodunum 184, an amphora used for the transportation of the Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2–4 were produced in the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th BC until the middle imperial times. Cretan containers were also popular for the transportation of wine and can be found in the Mediterranean from the Augustan times until the 3rd century AD. During the late empire north-African types dominated the amphorae production. The so-called African I and II were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased to exist.|$|E
25|$|Traverse City {{was named}} by USA Today among the Top Ten Places for <b>Local</b> <b>Wine.</b> There are nine wineries on the Old Mission Peninsula and 21 wineries on the Leelanau Peninsula, both {{just a few}} minutes drive from {{downtown}} Traverse City. Both peninsulas sit close to the 45th parallel, a latitude known for growing prestigious grapes. The two arms of Grand Traverse Bay provide the ideal maritime climate and the rich glacial soil does the rest. Northern Michigan specializes in growing white grapes and is known for its Rieslings which grow well in the summer months and late fall which Traverse City is known for. Every October the wineries host a harvest fest. Some Riesling grapes are spared being picked in the fall to be picked when they freeze, from which ice wine is made. The wineries along the Old Mission Peninsula are Black Star Farms, 2 Lads Winery, Bowers Harbor Vineyards, Brys Estate Vineyard & Winery, Chateau Chantal Winery And Inn, Chateau Grand Traverse, Bonobo Winery, Mari Vineyards, and Peninsula Cellars. The wineries along the Leelanau Peninsula are Black Star Farms, Leelenau Cellars, Silver Leaf Vineyard and Winery, Gill's Pier Vineyard and Winery, Raftshol Vineyards, Circa Estate Winery, Forty-Five North Vineyard and Winery, Good Harbor Vineyards, Chateau Fontaine, Boskydel Vineyards, L. Mawby Vineyards, Ciccone Vineyard and Winery, Willow Vineyards, Chateau de Leelanau Vineyard and Winery, Shady Lane Cellars, Cherry Republic Winery, Longview Winery, Boathouse Winery, Verterra, Brengman Brothers, and Bel Lago Winery.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – With a wine {{history that}} dates {{as far as}} the fifteenth century, and {{includes}} exports of highly valued wine products, the Canary Islands illustrates the case of a region with a splendorous wine trading past. While the potential of the uniqueness of <b>local</b> <b>wines</b> still exists, little is known about consumer patterns, and perceptions of Canary Islands <b>wines</b> among the <b>local</b> consumers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to address this area of research, focusing on the case of La Palma Island. Design/methodology/approach– An online questionnaire was designed to investigate both local and outside consumers. A total of 378 respondents, predominantly local residents, participated in the study. Findings– The potential of the <b>local</b> <b>wines</b> to become a valuable resource is identified in various ways. In particular, many respondent comments highlight the uniqueness of some of the <b>local</b> <b>wines,</b> including the Albillo, Malvasía, and “vino de tea”. In comparing various respondent groups to their wine perceptions and experiences with <b>local</b> <b>wines,</b> the findings also identify strengths, and areas of improvement, not only for those involved in wine production, but also for the island’s wine tourism. Practical implications– The potential for the local designation of origin to maximise the uniqueness, historic value, and other valuable elements of the wines is highlighted. In addition, given the importance of tourism in this and other islands, opportunities exist for the <b>local</b> <b>wines</b> to be a highlight in visitors’ and local residents’ leisure pursuits, particularly through the organisation of special events, winery visitations, and the establishment of wine trails. Originality/value – This exploratory research on La Palma Island’s consumers seeks to address a knowledge gap about a region where, albeit a very rich wine history, wine consumer research has been very limited...|$|R

500|$|Rogers {{encountered}} {{various problems}} along the way. Forty of the Bristol crew deserted or were dismissed, {{and he spent}} a month in Ireland recruiting replacements and having the vessels prepared for sea. Many crew members were Dutch, Danish, or other foreigners. [...] Some of the crew mutinied after Rogers refused to let them plunder a neutral Swedish vessel. When the mutiny was put down, he had the leader flogged, put in irons, and sent to England aboard another ship. The less culpable mutineers were given lighter punishments, such as reduced rations. [...] The ships intended to force the chilly Drake Passage off the tip of South America, but expedition leaders soon realised that they were short of warm clothing and alcohol, which was then believed to warm those exposed to cold. Considering the latter the more important problem, the expedition made a stop at Tenerife {{to stock up on}} the <b>local</b> <b>wine,</b> and later sewed the ships' blankets into cold weather gear. [...] The ships experienced a difficult inter-oceanic passage; they were forced to almost 62° South latitude, which, according to Rogers, [...] "for ought we know is the furthest that any one has yet been to the southward". [...] At their furthest south, they were closer to as-yet-undiscovered Antarctica than to South America.|$|E
