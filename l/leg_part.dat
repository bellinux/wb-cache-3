500|$|The mesosoma is [...] {{wide and}} covered in erect setae (on the dorsal surfaces). On the propodeum, the setae are {{slightly}} recurved. The neck is long and one-quarter {{the length of the}} thorax (when excluding the propodeum). V-shaped sulci are present on the dorsomedial portion of the pronotum. The promesonotal suture (a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism) is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the scutellum is approximately half the length of the scutum, and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular-shaped foveae that is located nearby the median line. The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow foveae. The pronotum contains little to no foveae or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C-shaped grooves and foveae. The propodeum measures [...] long and sports a slit-like spiracle which faces to the rear; the posterior margin of the propodeum is shelf-like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter (<b>leg</b> <b>part</b> attached rigidly to the femur) and femur on both the meso- and metathoracic legs (the middle and hindmost pair of legs). On the ventral margin, a subapical tooth can be seen on the large claws. The metasoma is mostly obscured by a large bubble. A large stinger appears to be present.|$|E
2500|$|The well-preserved {{skeleton}} of the Sinocalliopteryx holotype contained the partial {{leg of a}} dromaeosaurid within the abdominal cavity, comprising a complete {{lower leg and foot}} with toes and claws in their natural, articulated position. While the <b>leg</b> <b>part,</b> about one foot long, is very large in relation to the abdominal cavity, it is clearly situated within it, lying between the ribs. Ji and colleagues in 2007 suggested that this could indicate it preyed upon the smaller, bird-like dinosaur. This discovery indicated that Sinocalliopteryx may have been an agile, active, [...] "fierce" [...] predator, especially since other compsognathids have been found with (presumably fast-moving) lizards and small mammals in their abdominal cavities. In 2012 the dromaeosaurid was tentatively identified as an individual of Sinornithosaurus with a length of 1.2 metres (3.9 ft). The 2012 study also reported newly discovered remains of prey animals. Above the dromaeosaurid leg, feathers are visible. Below it two clusters of digested food can be seen. It was suggested that the feathers had belonged to a bird and were with the leg still present in the stomach. The digested food would, using the preserved digestive tract of Scipionyx as a reference, have been positioned in the duodenum. The C-shaped abdominal contents of this specimen appear to reflect of the original contour of the digestive tract.|$|E

The carcass was divided into three parts, namely the body stem, the forelimbs, and the hind <b>legs</b> <b>part</b> respectively. The deposit fat and viscera were taken off from these three parts. The results obtained were as follows; (1) Body weight and the total muscle weight exhibited the same tendency that these weights became heavier in the order, in female WL<WR<WC and in male WL<NH<WR<WC. These weights of male of each breed were heavier than those of its female. (2) The total muscle weight per kg of body weight was as follows: in female, WL- 359 ± 16. 5 g, WR- 396 ± 5. 4 g, WC- 438 ± 4. 7 g, and in male, WL- 418 ± 5. 5 g, WR 486 + 6. 6 g, NH- 494 ± 4. 2 g, WC- 533 ± 3. 6 g. (3) In female the weight of hind <b>legs</b> <b>part</b> was lighter than that of forelimbs, while, in male, the weight of hindelegs part was equal to, or in NH-male, was heavier than that of forelimbs.

And it seems that the growth of Nil-male hind <b>legs</b> <b>part</b> is better than that of any other breeds. (4) Generally, each muscle weight of the female forelimbs part per total muscle weight was larger than that of the male. On the contrary, each muscle weight of the male hind legs and body stem parts was larger than that of the female. 卵用種WL,卵肉兼用種NH・WR,肉用種WCの 4 品種について,と体を体幹部・前肢部・後肢部の 3 部に区分し,骨格筋構成からみた性および品種間の差異を検討した. その結果は次の通りであつた.

The authors interpreted these as gastroliths (gizzard stones) similar to those found with Nqwebasaurus and Baryonyx. Other theropods, such as Caudipteryx and a Mongolian ornithomimid, were also found with gastroliths, though in those cases the stones were much more numerous and smaller in size. Ji and colleagues speculated that, since the later two dinosaurs were probably primarily herbivores, the number and size of gastroliths may correspond with diet; that is, herbivores ingested many small stones, while carnivores ingested only a few larger stones to aid in digestion. However, the 2012 study could find no gastroliths with the second specimen and therefore concluded that the stones with the holotype were swallowed by accident. In any case no special gizzard would have been present.|$|E
