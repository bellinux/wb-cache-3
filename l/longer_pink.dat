5000|$|Cook all poultry {{products}} thoroughly. Make {{sure that the}} meat is cooked throughout (no <b>longer</b> <b>pink)</b> and any juices run clear. All poultry should be cooked to reach a minimum internal temperature of 165 F.|$|E
50|$|Clarkia concinna is {{a species}} of wildflower known as red ribbons. It is endemic to California, {{where it can be}} found in the low-elevation {{mountains}} of the northern part of the state. This is an annual plant with erect, herbaceous stems. The distinctive flowers have four looping sepals of red or dark pink which look like loops of silk ribbon. The <b>longer,</b> <b>pink</b> petals have three lobes which are usually streaked with white.|$|E
50|$|A later {{refinement}} {{of the basic}} Mountbatten pink camouflage {{was the use of}} a slightly lighter tone of the same colour for the upper structures of the ship. By the end of 1942, however, all vessels of destroyer size and larger had dispensed with Mountbatten pink, although it is believed that smaller vessels retained this colour until well into 1944. The primary problem with Mountbatten pink was that it stood out around midday, when the sky was no <b>longer</b> <b>pink,</b> and the traditional battleship grey was much less visible.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1984, a {{plan was}} {{approved}} in which private investors would convert the former hotel into 70 apartments for low-income residents {{on the six}} upper floors and commercial space {{on the first two}} floors. [...] The building reopened in 1986 with 66 apartments of subsidized housing, referred to as the Astor Apartments and no <b>longer</b> colored <b>pink.</b> The lowermost two floors remained mostly vacant into the 1990s, but gradually businesses moved into the commercial spaces. The ornate lobby remained unused until 2010, when a business selling vintage furniture and hardware moved into the space.|$|R
50|$|Ivesia pickeringii is an {{uncommon}} species of flowering {{plant in the}} rose family known by the common names silky mousetail and Pickering's ivesia. It is endemic to the Klamath Mountains of northern California where it is a plant of mountain meadows, often on serpentine soils. This is a perennial herb forming tufts of long, erect leaves and thin, naked stems. Each leaf is a taillike strip of overlapping lobed leaflets. The reddish to greenish stems reach 30 to 50 centimeters in height and bear inflorescences of clustered flowers. The stems, leaves, and inflorescences are all covered in fuzzy white to gray hairs. Each flower is about a centimeter wide, with pinkish-green triangular sepals and <b>longer,</b> narrower <b>pink</b> or purple petals. In {{the center of the}} flower are 20 stamens and a few pistils.|$|R
50|$|Downtown to Cheat Lake {{by way of}} Richwood Ave., Sabraton, Brookhaven, Richard, Dellslow, Tyrone Road, Tyrone-Avery Road, Cheat Road, and Fairchance Road. Leaves the {{downtown}} depot every 90 minutes starting at 6:30am. It would originally allow a deviation request to the Pierpont Center before taking I-68 from Exit 7 to Exit 10 before the old iron bridge was replaced over Cheat Lake. That deviation request is no <b>longer</b> allowed, so <b>Pink</b> Line must be used from the Depot or Blue Line if picked up along its route.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{movements}} and habitat use {{is necessary to}} assess a speciesâ€™ ecological role and {{is especially important for}} mesopredators because they provide the link between upper and lower trophic levels. Using acoustic telemetry, we examined coarse-scale diel and seasonal movements of elasmobranch mesopredators on a shallow sandflat in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Giant shovelnose rays (Glaucostegus typus) and reticulate whiprays (Himantura uarnak) were most often detected in nearshore microhabitats and were regularly detected throughout the day and year, although reticulate whiprays tended to frequent the monitored array over <b>longer</b> periods. <b>Pink</b> whiprays (H. fai) and cowtail stingrays (Pastinachus atrus) were also detected throughout the day, but were far less frequently detected. Overall, there was no apparent spatial or temporal partitioning of the sandflats, but residency to the area varied between species. In addition, ray presence throughout the year suggests that previously observed differences in seasonal abundance are likely because of seasonal changes in habitat use rather than large-scale migrations. Continuous use of the sandflats and limited movements within this ray community suggests that rays have {{the potential to be a}} structuring force on this system and that focusing on nearshore habitats is important for managing subtropical ray populations...|$|R
