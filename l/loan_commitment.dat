50|$|In the U.S., market flex {{language}} drives initial pricing levels. Before formally {{launching a}} loan to these retail accounts, arrangers will often get a market read by informally polling select investors to gauge their appetite for the credit. After this market read, the arrangers will launch the deal at a spread and fee that it thinks will clear the market. Once the pricing, or the initial {{spread over a}} base rate (usually LIBOR), was set, it was largely fixed, except in the most extreme cases. If the loans were undersubscribed, the arrangers {{could very well be}} left above their desired hold level. Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis roiled the market, however, arrangers have adopted market-flex contractual language, which allows them to change the pricing of the loan based on investor demand— in some cases within a predetermined range— and to shift amounts between various tranches of a loan.

50|$|Kashyap and Stein then {{collaborated with}} Raghuram Rajan on two {{noteworthy}} papers on financial intermediation. The first, {{winner of the}} 2002 Brattle Distinguished Paper Prize and published in the Journal of Finance, proposed a theory for why banks have debt which is demandable and loans which are longer term. They conjectured {{that there is a}} synergy between offering sight deposits (aka checking accounts, or demandable debt) and <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> (the antecedents to loans). Both checking accounts and <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> require the institution offering them to have a pool of liquidity. The liquidity can be used to honor a deposit withdrawal or the takedown of a commitment (after which it is converted into a loan). The link between these two goes back all the way to medieval money changers; Kashyap et al. presented empirical evidence showing that banks which had more <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> tended to also have more checking accounts, and they showed why this is optimal for imperfectly correlated withdrawals and commitment takedowns because of the cost savings from accommodating both with a common pool of liquidity.|$|R
