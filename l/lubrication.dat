5|$|Earwax {{is partly}} {{composed}} of sebum produced by glands {{in the ear}} canal. These secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content, which provides good <b>lubrication.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal <b>lubrication</b> of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant <b>lubrication</b> to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant <b>lubrication</b> to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and <b>lubrication.</b> This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5|$|Eight 6-car trains {{supplied}} by CAF Beasain were imported from Spain. CAF held 5% {{equity in the}} DAME project, and Reliance Infrastructure held the remaining 95% before DMRC took over the operations. The trains on this line are of a premium standard compared to the existing metro trains and have in-built noise reduction and padded fabric seats. The coaches are equipped with LCD screens for entertainment of the passengers and also provide flight information for convenience of air travellers. The trains are fitted with an event recorder which can withstand high levels of temperature and impact and the wheels have flange <b>lubrication</b> system for less noise and better riding comfort.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides <b>lubrication,</b> and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with <b>lubrication</b> starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of <b>lubrication</b> from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump <b>lubrication.</b> These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E
5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of <b>lubrication</b> points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for <b>lubrication.</b> The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even <b>lubrication</b> of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
5|$|World War II was a {{demanding}} {{time for the}} railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, {{and much of the}} equipment and maintenance was lacking. On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor <b>lubrication</b> oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for <b>lubrication.</b> The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and <b>lubrication.</b> While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a <b>lubrication</b> effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal <b>lubrication.</b> More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{breakthrough}} in <b>lubrication</b> {{is the use}} of phosphate coatings. With this process, in conjunction with glass <b>lubrication,</b> steel can be cold extruded. The phosphate coat absorbs the liquid glass to offer even better lubricating properties.|$|E
25|$|Dyspareunia may {{be caused}} by {{insufficient}} <b>lubrication</b> (vaginal dryness) in women. Poor <b>lubrication</b> may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by menopause, pregnancy, or breast-feeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sex.|$|E
25|$|GDF-003: Minor {{enhancements}} including {{protective covers}} and automatic weapon <b>lubrication.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>lubrication</b> {{system is}} self-contained, the oil tank being {{integral}} {{with the air}} intake casing.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} the applied load is carried by {{pressure}} generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate <b>lubrication</b> allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When <b>lubrication</b> breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.|$|E
25|$|Integrated dry-sump is Porsche's {{name for}} a dry sump <b>lubrication</b> system {{integrated}} within the engine block, i.e. no separate oil reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Lack of <b>lubrication</b> is {{a common}} problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and {{lubricants}} can help with <b>lubrication</b> difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.|$|E
25|$|Castrol is BP's main brand for {{industrial}} and automotive lubricants and {{is applied to}} a large range of BP oils, greases and similar products for most <b>lubrication</b> applications.|$|E
25|$|At Linotype, Barr {{improved}} punch-cutting machines by substituting {{ball bearings}} for oil <b>lubrication</b> {{to achieve a}} more precise fit, and using tractrix-shaped sleeves to distribute wear uniformly.|$|E
25|$|The Bartholin's glands, {{located near}} the vaginal opening, were {{originally}} considered the primary source for vaginal <b>lubrication,</b> but further examination showed that they provide only {{a few drops of}} mucus. The significant majority of vaginal <b>lubrication</b> is now believed to be provided by plasma seepage from the vaginal walls, which is called vaginal transudation. Vaginal transudation, which initially forms as sweat-like droplets, is caused by vascular engorgement of the vagina (vasocongestion), resulting in the pressure inside the capillaries increasing the transudation of plasma through the vaginal epithelium.|$|E
25|$|Lubricants to {{overcome}} friction need {{not always be}} thin, turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and talc; acoustic <b>lubrication</b> actually uses sound as a lubricant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lubrication</b> {{theory and}} Hele–Shaw flow {{exploits}} the large aspect {{ratio of the}} domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluids degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the <b>lubrication</b> system. A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as <b>lubrication</b> oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.|$|E
25|$|The no. 700316 6C 2300 tipo Turismo straight-six engine placed {{behind the}} driver was Alfa Romeo: 2,309cc, iron block, light alloy head, {{chain-driven}} dual overhead camshafts, spur gears, wet sump <b>lubrication.</b>|$|E
25|$|Improvements {{in sexual}} pain, vaginal <b>lubrication</b> and orgasm {{are found to}} be {{statistically}} different from those using HRT. Estrogens have positive effects of mood, sexual function, target end organs, and cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|There may be medical causes {{to these}} disorders, such as {{decreased}} blood flow {{or lack of}} vaginal <b>lubrication.</b> Chronic disease can also contribute, {{as well as the}} nature of the relationship between the partners.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{contains}} {{virtually no}} sulfur, {{and it is}} often used as an additive to Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel to aid with <b>lubrication,</b> as the sulfur compounds in petrodiesel provide much of the lubricity.|$|E
25|$|Starting in September 2008 Tesla {{selected}} BorgWarner {{to manufacture}} gearboxes and began equipping all Roadsters {{with a single}} speed, fixed gear gearbox (8.2752:1) with an electrically actuated parking pawl mechanism and a mechanical <b>lubrication</b> pump.|$|E
