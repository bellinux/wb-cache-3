5|$|Josquin {{wrote in}} all of the {{important}} forms current at the time, including masses, motets, chansons, and frottole. He even contributed {{to the development of a}} new form, the motet-chanson, of which he <b>left</b> <b>at</b> least three examples. In addition, some of his pieces were probably intended for instrumental performance.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{month after}} Ignacio, Hurricane Marty passed through the area, causing {{additional}} damage to areas hit by Ignacio. The combined damage from the two hurricanes totaled about $1billion (2003USD, $1.1billion 2006USD), and the effects from the two storms <b>left</b> <b>at</b> least 50,000 homeless.|$|E
5|$|Pressure is also {{generally}} {{monitored by}} the diver.

5|$|The sinkhole's {{collapse}} in Guatemala City's Zona 2 <b>left</b> <b>at</b> least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at risk.

5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal <b>left</b> <b>at</b> the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E

5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} slowly and marched into Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army <b>left</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} summer after only a brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their <b>left</b> <b>at</b> Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
5|$|Across the state, the {{hurricane}} damaged 23,000homes and destroyed 985homes and 1,951mobile homes; private property damage {{was estimated at}} $1billion. The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops, estimated at $289million in damage. Strong winds also <b>left</b> <b>at</b> least 230,000people without electricity. During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and Bayou Lafourche, killing 187million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266million. Overall, losses {{in the state of}} Louisiana reached approximately $1.56billion. A total of 17deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8directly and 9from indirect causes. At least 75injuries were reported.|$|E

5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Mason got a job with the {{district}} bank while he attended night school in his spare time. He worked there until 1838, when he <b>left</b> <b>at</b> the age of 21 to join the family's cotton business. He became {{the driving force behind the}} business. The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the Ryecroft area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} the latest McBain film, Grampa suffers a mild heart attack. Thinking he might die, he is prompted to confess a long-hidden secret: Homer has a half-brother. Grampa {{explains that he}} met a carnival prostitute before marrying Mona, Homer's mother, {{and they had a}} son that they <b>left</b> <b>at</b> the Shelbyville Orphanage. Determined to find his brother, Homer and his family go to the orphanage and find out that Grampa's love child was adopted by a Mr. and Mrs. Powell and named Herbert.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, <b>left</b> <b>at</b> the car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E

5|$|Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) call Angela's husband Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{to inform}} {{him that the}} {{documentary}} will probably out him and reveal that Angela slept with Dwight. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) becomes obsessed with online comments regarding his brief appearance in the promo, posting lengthy replies and even uploading his own video in response to negative reactions. The documentary crew discovers that Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has <b>left</b> <b>at</b> {{least some of the}} negative comments, taking pleasure in Andy's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material <b>left</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

5|$|Chesney <b>left</b> <b>at</b> {{least ten}} books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive.

5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} with a 12–2 regular-season record and won the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) championship in 1946, the league's first year of play.

He signed Tony Adamle, a fullback and linebacker who joined the team even though he had two years of college eligibility <b>left</b> <b>at</b> Ohio State University, and guard Bob Gaudio, another Ohio State player.
