25|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} compressive stress, buckling may occur. Buckling {{is characterized by a}} sudden sideways deflection of a structural member. This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an applied load is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled. Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's <b>load-carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the buckled member {{is part of a larger}} assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure.|$|E
25|$|On 5 August 2008, two {{pilots and}} seven firefighters {{assigned}} to the Iron Complex fire in California's Shasta-Trinity National Forest, were killed when Carson Helicopters S-61N N612AZ crashed on takeoff. Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional understatement of the helicopter’s empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots’ relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated <b>load-carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address {{the fact that the}} helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a fuel spillage upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the seat restraints.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{numerical}} model {{for use in}} a finite analysis (FEA) of scaffold-shoring systems. The structural model consists of a single set of multiple-story scaffolds with constraints in the out-of-plane direction at every connection joint between stories. Although this model has only two dimensions (termed the 2 -D model), it is derived from the analysis of a complete scaffold-shoring system and represents the structural behavior of a complete three-dimensional system. Experimental testing of scaffolds up to three stories in height conducted in the laboratory, along with an outdoor test of a five-story scaffold system, were used to validate the 2 -D model. Both failure modes and critical loads were compared. In the comparison of failure modes, the computational results agree very well with the test results. However, in the comparison of critical loads, computational results were consistently somewhat greater than test results. The decreasing trends of critical loads with number of stories in both the test and simulation results were similar. After investigations to explain the differences between the computationally and experimentally determined critical loads, it was recommended that the 2 -D model be used as the numerical model in subsequent analysis. In addition, the computational critical loads were calibrated and revised in accordance with the experimental critical loads, and the revised critical loads were then used as <b>load-carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> for scaffold-shoring systems for any number of stories. Finally, a simple procedure is suggested for determining <b>load-carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of scaffold-shoring systems of heights other than those considered in this study...|$|R
