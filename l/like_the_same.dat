Though Kublai Khan eventually won, the succession war and the subsequent Kaidu–Kublai war essentially resulted in the permanent division of the Mongol Empire. It was not until 1304, when all Mongol khans submitted to Kublai's successor, Temür Khan, that the Mongol world again acknowledged a single paramount sovereign, although {{the authority of the}} late Khagans rested on nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> foundations as that of Genghis Khan and his first three successors.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Kaidu, the Chatagai ruler Duwa {{initiated}} a peace proposal and persuaded the Ögedeids to submit to Temür Khan. In 1304, all khanates approved a peace treaty and accepted Yuan emperor Temür's supremacy. This established the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates. While this supremacy based on nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> foundations {{as that of the}} earlier Khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them) and each of the four khanates continued to develop separately and function as different states, the nominal supremacy did last for a few decades.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, Kaidu and Duwa of the Chagatai Khanate mobilized a large army to attack Karakorum (then under Yuan control) around 1300 during {{the final stage of}} the Kaidu–Kublai war. The Yuan army {{suffered}} heavy losses while both sides could not make any decisive victory in September. Duwa was wounded in the battle and Kaidu died soon thereafter. After that, Duwa, Kaidu's son Chapar, Tokhta of the Golden Horde and Ilkhan Oljeitu (Ghazan's successor) negotiated peace with Temür Khan in 1304 in order to maintain trade and diplomatic relations, and agreed him to be their nominal overlord. This established the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates. However, the peace was short-lived. The fighting between Duwa and Chapar soon broke out over the question of territory. Temür backed Duwa and sent a large army under Khayisan in the fall of 1306, and Chapar finally surrendered. The territory controlled by Chapar was divided up by the Chagataids and the Yuan dynasty. The nominal supremacy of the Yuan, while based on nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> foundations as that of the earlier Khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them), did last for a few decades, until the Yuan dynasty fell in China (1368). The four khanates continued to interact with one another {{in the first half of}} the 14th century, but they did so as sovereign states. They formed alliances, fought one another, exchanged envoys, and traded commercial products. In the case of the Yuan dynasty based in China and the Ilkhanate based in Iran, there was an extensive program of cultural and scientific interaction. But they never again pooled their resources in a cooperative military endeavor.|$|E

[...] According to Sub Pop, the band had [...] "a hunky lead singer and fused Led Zeppelin and the Butthole Surfers".

500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} soundtrack to lack the focus that Activision claims it has, {{and that the}} series may have {{exhausted}} a number of good guitar songs in its previous iterations. Gies stated that the game soundtrack [...] "may be the most uneven collection {{in any of the}} main Guitar Hero titles", citing problems with [...] "a surplus of tracks that seem out of place", [...] "too many songs that are just boring to play", and [...] "a number of synth heavy songs that are nevertheless shoehorned" [...] into the game. Official Xbox Magazine UK stated that the setlist [...] "feels at times uninspired, incongruous and uninteresting". Helgeson felt the setlist was [...] "a mixed bag", with a strong and balanced set of songs in the early tiers of Quest mode, while the latter, more difficult songs were [...] "terrible and felt like a chore" [...] to complete. Roger Hargreaves of The Metro commented that [...] "with so many of the more iconic rock songs having already been used in previous Guitar Hero and Rock Band games developers are forced to use ever more obscure songs and/or acts". Heppe also considered the lack of iconic song, noting the setlist [...] "seems <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bands we always see in , just their 3rd tier hits". On the other hand, USA Todays Mike Snider claimed that the game's soundtrack [...] "gave [...] a reason to blast music on [...] stereo", and besides providing well-known songs and bands, introduced him to new bands.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} {{introduces}} [...] "moving zorts," [...] an upgraded technique the film crew used {{to complete the}} effect where Druitt teleports. The zorts were used specifically to make the sequences where the cast around Heyerdahl freeze until he leaves the screen. The producers wanted to have the camera move during those shots, as they believed it would be [...] "way cooler to have those zorts on the move." [...] One of the more difficult moving zorts included a [...] "triple zort" [...] with other characters who could teleport on the same shot in [...] "End of Nights". The sequence was difficult for Tapping, as she had to carry a prop weighing approximately 73 pounds. A three-dimensional hologram of Rachel's office was included in [...] "Fragments"; it was originally intended to feature the hologram throughout the episode, but because doing so would be costly, the producers decided to have one scene with the hologram, so Henry could {{use it as a}} blueprint to make an identical office with boxes. For the finale, Anthem decided to make the macri and Big Bertha look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> creature, though Bertha would be a considerably larger creature. Some scenes involve the macri interacting with real life objects, including clothing. To make a scene where the macri enters a jacket, Wilson used fishing wire to move a sleeve slightly. Big Bertha's actions meanwhile, were largely made underwater. Anthem found that making underwater effects was difficult because there was a different style of movement. Additionally, Anthem produced a sequence where Wexford launches depth charges from his ship. The producers were looking for stock footage of the dropping depth charges, but they could not find one in high-definition.|$|E

500|$|While Robinson {{said the}} {{response}} from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic, Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War I, wished to ban it altogether. Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against Caligaris release, condemning it as a [...] "foreign invasion". Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States. Several American reviewers compared it to an Edgar Allan Poe story, including a 1921 review in Variety magazine, which praised the direction and [...] "perfect tempo" [...] of the film, {{as well as the}} sets that [...] "squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality". A New York Times review likened it to modernist art, comparing the film's sets to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, and said the film [...] "gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background", which was key to the film's [...] "importance as a work of cinematography". Albert Lewin, a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called Caligari [...] "the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art". A story in a November 1921 edition of Exceptional Photoplays, an independent publication issued by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, said it [...] "occupies the position of unique artistic merit", and said American films in comparison looked like they were made for [...] "a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level".|$|E
