5|$|Root form implants; {{the most}} common type of implant {{indicated}} for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior <b>long-term</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> of {{implants}} is determined, in part, by {{the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|Whittaker enjoyed {{immediate}} success, {{winning the}} League title in 1947–48; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were {{top of the}} table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given {{the age of the}} Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949–50, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|<b>Long-term</b> <b>success</b> {{rates of}} {{treatment}} have seldom been evaluated. However, experienced clinicians acknowledge that DSPD {{is extremely difficult}} to treat. One study of 61 DSPD patients, with average sleep onset at about 3 a.m. and average waking time of about 11:30a.m., was followed with questionnaires to the subjects after a year. Good effect was seen during the six-week treatment with a large daily dose of melatonin. Follow-up showed that over 90% had relapsed to pre-treatment sleeping patterns within the year, 29% reporting that the relapse occurred within one week. The mild cases retained changes significantly longer than the severe cases.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War, Augustus reorganized Roman {{military}} forces, discharging {{soldiers and}} disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire. During the Principate, the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The auxilia remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit, the cohortes equitatae, combining cavalry and legionaries in a single formation could be stationed at garrisons or outposts, could fight on their own as balanced small forces or could combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility over time helped ensure the <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> of Roman military forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{developer}} was E Alec Colman Investments Ltd, who {{had also}} used Luder for their Tricorn Centre in Portsmouth, and construction was undertaken by Robert McAlpine. The Consulting Structural Engineer was Gordon Rose of Rose Associates. The lead architect was Rodney Gordon. The car park was commissioned {{as part of the}} redevelopment of the established market square in Gateshead town centre, and hence was sometimes referred to as the Inner Market Car Park. However the landscaping ultimately created an exposed and unattractive shopping precinct on two levels with poor access. While construction of the car park was in progress subsidence was noticed due to mine workings, but this was overcome. At the same time nearby Newcastle upon Tyne had begun the covered Eldon Square Shopping Centre and this further undermined the <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> of the development. The rooftop cafe failed to find a tenant and was never opened.|$|E

25|$|In 1880, {{although}} the county’s record remained bad, Surrey {{began to make}} the steps that would return them {{to the top of}} the table with the appointment of John Shuter as captain and of Walter Read – established as a class batsman but previously available only in August – as assistant secretary. The death of Southerton and retirement of other veterans paved the way for new talent in Maurice Read, William Roller, left-arm spinner Edward Barratt and pace bowler Charles Horner to lay a foundation for <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> in the middle 1880s. With the rapid rise of George Lohmann in 1885, Surrey challenged for the unofficial title of Champion County for the first time in twenty years; then, by winning 32 of 42 matches in 1887, 1888 and 1889, Surrey were first or equal first in the final three years before official County Champions emerged.|$|E
25|$|Confronted {{with the}} {{challenge}} of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's <b>long-term</b> <b>success,</b> allowing gamers to see just how un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} detriments towards the {{theoretical}} success of open source software, {{there are several}} {{factors that contribute to}} the lack of <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> in open source projects. One of the most obvious drawback is that without pay or royalty licensing, there is little financial incentive for a programmer to become involved with a project in the first place, or to continue development and support once the initial product is released. This leads to innumerable examples of well-anticipated software being forever condemned to beta versions and unsupported early model products. With donations as the only source of income for a truly open source (and GPL licensed) project, there is almost no certainty in the future of the project simply because of developer abandonment, making it a poor choice for any sort of application in which future versions, support and a long-term plan would be essential, as is the case for most business software.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if {{there are differences in}} short-term weight loss and <b>long-term</b> weight maintenance <b>success</b> by age or gender. Methods: Patients were enrolled in a Midwestern weight loss clinic. The primary outcome measures were short-term weight loss success (achieving ≥ 10 % of the initial body weight loss (IBWL) at three months) and <b>long-term</b> weight maintenance <b>success</b> (maintaining ≥ 10 % IBWL at one year). Results: Patients 18 – 45 years were more likely to achieve short-term weight loss success compared to those in the two other age categories (45 - 64 and ≥ 65 years). However, age was not a significant predictor for <b>long-term</b> weight maintenance <b>success.</b> Females had decreased odds (OR= 0. 47, 95 % CI 0. 38, 0. 59) of achieving short-term weight loss success, but had increased odds (OR= 1. 94, 95 % CI 1. 02, 3. 67) of achieving <b>long-term</b> weight maintenance <b>success.</b> Discussion: Age and Gender effect were different for short-term weight loss and <b>long-term</b> weight maintenance <b>success...</b>|$|R

25|$|Frito-Lay {{acquired}} Grandma's Cookies in 1980, which launched {{nationwide in}} the United States in 1983. In January 1978 Frito-Lay's product development {{group led by}} Jack Liczkowski completed development of Tostitos, a Mexican-style tortilla chip lineup. Tostitos Traditional Flavor and Tostitos Nacho Cheese Flavor went into national distribution in the United States by 1980 and reached the sales of $140 million, {{making it one of}} the most successful new products introduction in Frito-Lay history. Tostitos sales grew quickly, and in 1985 it had become Frito-Lay's fifth-largest brand, generating annual sales of $200 million. Ahead of Tostitos at the time were Doritos, Lay's, Fritos, and Ruffles, each recording annual sales between $250 and $500 million. While Tostitos became a <b>long-term</b> <b>success,</b> several other new products launched in the 1980s were discontinued after lackluster results. These short lived Frito-Lay products included Stuffers pre-filled dip shells and Toppels crackers, which came pre-topped with cheese. In the late 1980s, Frito-Lay acquired Smartfood, a brand of cheese-flavored popcorn which it began to distribute across the United States. International sales began to increase significantly at this time as well, with annual revenues from sales outside of the U.S. and Canada accounting for $500 million in 1989, contributing to total Frito-Lay sales of $3.5 billion in the same year.|$|E
500|$|The only <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> that Shankly {{had in the}} {{transfer}} market in the late 1960s was his signing of Emlyn Hughes, {{who went on to}} captain Liverpool to victory in the European Cup. Otherwise, he did not significantly change the team until the 1969–70 season when Liverpool finished fifth in the league championship, a long way behind the winners: their local rivals Everton. Shankly was characteristically defiant whenever Everton got the better of Liverpool and, although he liked and respected everyone connected with Everton, would always talk up Liverpool at Everton's expense. Typical of this was his view that: [...] "This city has two great football teams – Liverpool and Liverpool reserves".|$|E
500|$|Success {{or failure}} of {{implants}} depends {{on the health of}} the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for <b>long-term</b> <b>success</b> of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes [...] required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{status of}} intelligence is not clear: It is {{positively related to}} various indicators of fitness but negatively to reproductive success {{as the most important}} fitness marker. In the present research, we explored the links between intelligence and three fitness indicators: number of children (short-term reproductive success), number of grandchildren (<b>long-term</b> reproductive <b>success),</b> and age at first birth. Participants were individuals in a postreproductive stage (N = 191; mean age = 66. 5 years). Intelligence had a positive correlation with short-term reproductive success and age at first birth but a negative correlation with <b>long-term</b> reproductive <b>success.</b> Participants’ education {{turned out to be a}} significant mediator of the link between intelligence and criterion measures. The results showed that intelligence can elevate short-term reproductive success. Furthermore, individuals with higher intellectual abilities tended to delay reproduction, which negatively affected their <b>long-term</b> reproductive <b>success.</b> Education was revealed as a very important resource which affects the link between cognitive abilities and fitness, thus proving its evolutionary role in contemporary populations...|$|R
