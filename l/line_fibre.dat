40|$|The beam intensities of {{short-lived}} carbon isotopes at Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) {{facilities have}} been limited {{in the past for}} technical reasons. The production of radioactive ion beams of carbon isotopes is currently of high interest for fundamental nuclear physics research. To produce radioactive ions a target station consisting of a target in a container connected to an ion source via a transfer line is commonly used. The target is heated to vaporize the product for transport. Carbon in elementary form is a very reactive element and react strongly with hot metal surfaces. Due to the strong chemisorption interaction, in the target and ion source unit, the atoms undergo significant retention on their way from the target to the ion source. Due to this the short lived isotopes decays and are lost leading to low ion yields. A first approach to tackle these limitations consists of incorporating the carbon atoms into less reactive molecules and to use materials for the target housing and the transfer line that only weakly interact with these molecules. Therefore, the adsorption properties of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a range of materials of interest were investigated in thermochromatography experiments at PSI (Switzerland) by using the carbon isotope 11 C. The adsorption enthalpy was retrieved for several materials. A second approach consists of the optimization of target materials and structure, both f or the effusion and diffusion of the nuclides of interest. Corresponding on-line experiments were performed at GANIL (France). For the production, diffusion and ionization efficiencies out of different target materials on-line and off-line experiments with carbon and nitrogen isotopes were performed at ISOLDE (CERN). The work performed within this thesis shows that the use of a coated transfer <b>line,</b> <b>fibre</b> felt targets and an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source would strongly decrease the losses, and provide the experiments with up to 1000 times higher beam currents than today...|$|E

50|$|Kernmantle rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a braided {{outer sheath}} or mantle of woven fibres. The kern {{provides}} {{most of the}} strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how {{easy it is to}} hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In dynamic climbing <b>line,</b> core <b>fibres</b> are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths, which makes the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.|$|R

40|$|Oncolytic adenoviruses offer a {{promising}} new treatment for cancers, especially those which respond poorly to current therapies such as cholangiocarcinoma. However, for clinical use, high selectivity to cancers is required. Thus, I constructed two EGFP-reporter gene expressing viruses, hTERTp-E 1 AWT-EGFP and E 2 Fp-E 1 AΔ 24 -EGFP {{to allow the}} comparison with an existing WTp-E 1 AΔ 24 -EGFP virus. These viruses were compared {{for their ability to}} infect and replicate in two cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, CCLP 1 and CCSW 1 cells. Flow cytometry was used to monitor EGFP expression by the replicating viruses. In these experiments, the virus WTp-E 1 AΔ 24 (virus B) reproducibly showed the greatest EGFP expression at equivalent multiplicity of infection. This replication efficacy was also confirmed in qPCR experiments measuring viral genome copy number. In cell viability assays, the hTERTp-E 1 AWT virus (virus A) was less potent than either E 2 Fp-E 1 AΔ 24 (virus C) or WTp-E 1 AΔ 24 (virus B), which had similar oncolytic potency. I also compared the ability of replication-defective adenoviruses expressing EGFP and a range of alternative fibre proteins to infect the cholangiocarcinoma cell <b>lines.</b> <b>Fibre</b> proteins incorporating the knob domain from adenovirus type 3, or including the A 20 -RGD (arginine, glycine and aspartate) -containing peptide from foot and mouth disease virus, showed significantly improved infectivity. These data will assist in the development of improved oncolytic viruses for treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. ...|$|R
