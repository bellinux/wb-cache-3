500|$|The {{gang member}} likes insignias that are {{prominent}} on sweaters and their creator. Among the 28 stories, other notable tales include {{one about the}} influence of Madonna (with discourse including [...] "Any American woman under 40 who says she's never dressed as Madonna is either lying or Amish."); one about dressing room anxiety (a story revolving around the concept that [...] "I'm an 8. I've always been an 8"); and one about your mother's tastes in clothes ("I don't understand, you could <b>look</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> if you tried"). [...] Three of the characters sometimes work as a trio and all characters have monologues.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should <b>look</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> at seventy-five." ...|$|E

500|$|While sources {{agree the}} name is a {{reference}} to North Texas' athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his [...] "Mean Greene" [...] nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university's moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene's first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the [...] "Mean Green" [...] moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she blurted out, [...] "That’s the way, Mean Greene!" [...] Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham's thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, [...] "Mean Green, you <b>look</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> to me". The rest of the crowd soon followed. [...] "After that we did it every game," [...] Davis said. [...] "A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant that Saturday night at Fouts Field. And that's the truth." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Brown {{met him at}} the door; and she <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> and motherly, {{and there}} was such a {{peculiar}} wistful look in her eyes, that {{he put his arm around}} her in a sudden impulse and kissed her.

6000|$|Well, he did <b>look</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem half so hard {{to refuse}} him as it did poor Dr. Seward. So I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know {{anything}} of hitching, and that I wasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then {{he said that he}} had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, and occasion for him, I would forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number Two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free [...] .|$|E

5000|$|Alternative Press {{called the}} novel [...] "one of coolest {{books of the}} year.

[...] Karen Karbo in {{reviewing}} the book, wrote: [...] "No one writing today walks the line between glamour and pathos better than Michael Hornburg.

The lake may have started off as a farm tank but the developer (Irby Simkins) probably enlarged it and certainly landscaped it well. In those early days after the developer had departed, Forrest Lake {{had a lot of}} problems with the lake and so mud covered residents were frequently seen wading around trying to find and repair leaks. It <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> now that it's hard to imagine it once had those sort of issues.|$|R
