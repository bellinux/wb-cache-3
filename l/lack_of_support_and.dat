5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Wizards {{began an}} {{association}} with The Beanstalk Group, a brand licensing agency and consultancy, to license the Magic brand. After {{the success of}} Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line. Peter Adkison explained {{that the company was}} doing a disservice to the games with <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> had lost money on all of Wizards' roleplaying game products. Also in 1995, Wizards' annual sales passed US$65million.|$|E
5|$|The year 1720 {{brought an}} end to {{external}} threats to Rogers' rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islandsâ€”a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers' problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS Flamborough (1707), a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt.|$|E

25|$|In Lithuania {{there were}} four ghettos that {{remained}} after a mass murder campaign by the Nazis in 1941. There were armed resistance groups in three of them. These ghettos were Vilna, Oszmiana, and Kovno. The Vilna Ghetto {{was the site of}} the first Jewish resistance group known as FPO. The FPO tried to persuade the occupants within the Vilna Ghetto to revolt against the Nazis but it failed. This led the group to leave after an armed altercation in September 1943. The partisan group left the ghetto because of a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> went through the sewers to escape to the eastern Lithuanian woods. However the partisan group in the Kovno Ghetto had no intention of fighting in the ghetto itself. They had always planned to fight outside of the ghetto. They organized a large escape from the ghetto that took place {{over a long period of}} time. It led to many people escaping and joining outside partisan groups, which eventually led them to create their own.|$|E

[...] However, he also conceded that it may have been intentional in an effort to evoke a genuine sense of off-balancedness in the character. [...] Either way, though he was unaccustomed to the environment, Wright expressed his willingness to revisit Tuvix or even work on any Star Trek again if the opportunity arose. [...] In interviews, Wright specifically fondly recalled his time working with Jennifer Lien (Kes), Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway), and director Cliff Bole.|$|E
500|$|In 1923 Fender {{enjoyed his}} best all-round season, scoring 1,427 runs and taking 178 wickets. The former {{was the second}} best {{aggregate}} of his career, the latter his highest total of wickets. Again, there were no Test matches, but Fender played in two Test trials. He was successful in the first match, taking six for 44 and scoring 49 runs, but his performance was overshadowed by continued controversy over the captaincy; Fender was not asked to captain a side in either match. The press questioned why the selectors ignored Fender's captaincy claims even though, {{in the view of}} journalists, he was the most deserving candidate. One writer suggested that Lord's [...] "resented" [...] Fender's success, and that politics prevented his appointment. At that time it was usual for amateurs and professionals to enter the field of play from different gates; Fender's habit was to use the same gate as his professionals. This brought a rebuke for Fender from Lord Harris, who said: [...] "We do not want that sort of thing at Lord's, Fender". Surrey finished fourth in the Championship, hampered once again by their lack of bowlers; their batsmen frequently made large scores but the team could not bowl out the opposition and many games were drawn. Fender's [...] batting continued to be effective, but he demonstrated a more restrained approach and improved his defence. Again, he had a heavy bowling workload given the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> <b>and</b> Wisden said that he bowled with [...] "pronounced spin and variety of device".|$|E

Even as the council stopped short and delivered an apology, fifteen council members focused on a report about lessons to be learned. It {{was based on the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> help in Africa. The United Nations presents a core policy and a great challenge to prevent another round of genocidal violence. The councils have already evidently learned how to bring peace from lessons of past failures. The Rwandan ambassador Joseph Mutaboba has welcomed the report and its apologies stating that the council could do more, itâ€™s not too late. In 1994 the United Nations Security Council had appointed General Kofi Annan to the United Nations Security Council and Head of United Nations Peacekeeping operations.
