Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} the mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E
5|$|The US {{became the}} {{protecting}} {{power for the}} United Kingdom in Somalia after Somalia severed diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in 1963, due to a dispute over {{the administration of the}} ethnic-Somali Northern Frontier District. Besides providing consular assistance for Britons, the embassy was also tasked with the protection of the British embassy compound and its properties. The US opened a consulate in Hargeisa the following year to assist Peace Corps activities and represent British interests in the northwestern region of Somalia, which had been under British administration from 1884-1960. In 1967, the embassy went into a <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> during the Six-Day War between Israel and neighboring Arab countries, which Somalia supported. The US was viewed as Israel's protector by Somalis and the embassy was subjected to some minor demonstrations.|$|E
50|$|On April 10, 2008, two Canadian {{secondary}} schools were <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> due to suspected firearm threats. George S.

40|$|In {{order to}} keep shared access {{computers}} secure and stable system administrators resort to <b>locking</b> <b>down</b> the computing environment {{in order to prevent}} intentional and unintentional damage by users. Skilled attackers are often able to break out of <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> computing environments and intentionally misuse shared access computers. This misuse has resulted in cases of mass identity theft and fraud, some of which have had an estimated cost ranging in millions. In order to determine if it is possible to break out of <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> computing environments an assessment method is required. Although a number of vulnerability assessment techniques exist, none of the existing techniques are sufficient for assessing <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> shared access computers. This is due to the existing techniques focusing on traditional, application specific, software vulnerabilities. Break out path vulnerabilities (which are exploited by attackers in order to break out of <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> environments) differ substantially from traditional vulnerabilities, and as a consequence are not easily discovered using existing techniques. Ontologies {{can be thought of as}} a modelling technique that can be used to capture expert knowledge about a domain of interest. The method for discovering break out paths in <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> computers can be considered expert knowledge in the domain of shared access computer security. This research proposes an ontology based assessment process for discovering break out path vulnerabilities in <b>locked</b> <b>down</b> shared access computers. The proposed approach is called the ontological lockdown assessment process. The ontological lockdown assessment process is implemented against a real world system and successfully identifies numerous break out path vulnerabilities...|$|R

5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Asian {{financial}} crisis, however, the temple was subject to widespread criticism for its fundraising methods and teachings, Luang Por Dhammajayo was eventually charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, the charges were withdrawn and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further in the following years and became known for its many projects in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship in Thai society. The temple's movement developed an international scope, as of 2007, the temple's following was estimated at one million practitioners worldwide and thirty to fifty international centers outside of Thailand. Under the 2014 military junta, the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money of a supporter and money-laundering. This incident led to several standoffs between the temple and the junta, eventually leading to 23 day <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> of the temple in 2017 by the junta that made headlines worldwide. In the aftermath of the <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> the junta stated they will look for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere but continued its scrutiny of the temple, giving the vice abbot, Luang Por Dattajivo several charges as well.|$|E

The victim was subsequently hospitalized in critical condition. The next day, Toronto Police announced it had made two arrests in the case; 18-year-old Mark Deicsics, was charged with armed robbery. The incident prompted authorities to <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> not only Bendale, but three other nearby schools (David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute) for almost three hours.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April 1967, a British Eagle Bristol 175 Britannia 308F (registration: G-ANCG) {{operating}} a non-scheduled passenger service from London Heathrow to Kuwait made {{an emergency landing}} at RAF Manston after the flightdeck crew experienced problems locking down the aircraft's retracted undercarriage following takeoff from Heathrow. There were no fatalities among the 65 occupants (eleven crew and 54 passengers). Accident investigators established that the undercarriage's failure to <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> {{was caused by a}} loss of hydraulic fluid from both the main and emergency systems. The hydraulic lines had been broken by the incorrect retraction sequence of the port bogie, itself caused by incorrect setup of a replaced sequence valve.|$|E

25|$|The V8 Security Feature Pack (a mid-release product update {{designated}} 8.5) added {{important new}} security features designed to <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> Pervasive.SQL data files. Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data {{was controlled by}} the operating system's security mechanism. This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying data files. 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user {{has access to the}} underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations no longer require the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI connection string.|$|E
25|$|Værnes Air Station {{was in such}} a {{condition}} that it was unsuitable for the large German aircraft, such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Thus the Luftwaffe chose to use both the fields at Lade and the ice on Jonsvannet while Værnes was being upgraded. In April 1940 the Wehrmacht demanded that 500 men be made available immediately to build the airport, and 2000 men within short time. If the local authorities were not able to follow up, the German military threatened to <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> the city and shoot anyone attempting to leave. At Lade there was built a wooden runway, a partially wooden and partially concrete taxiway and some hangars. Later the runway was later rebuilt to concrete. The taxiways were often first built in wood and the later rebuilt to concrete.|$|E
25|$|The Barrie Colts {{would begin}} the season without the {{previous}} season's top scorers Tanner Pearson and Ivan Telegin who would play {{the season in}} the AHL. Overage defenceman Ryan O'Connor was named team captain. With the likes of Mark Scheifele, Anthony Camara, Steven Beyers, Zach Hall, and former London Knight Andreas Athanasiou, the Colts would continue to pack an offensive punch. Leading the way on defence were returnees Alex Yuill, Johnathan Laser, Aaron Ekblad, and Alex Lepkowski. Overager Mathias Neiderberger was stellar all year in goal. With this crop of experienced players, {{as well as a}} handful of rookies to fill in the gaps, the Colts would quickly take the top spot in the Eastern Conference; a position they would hold {{for the majority of the}} season. The Colts would also be ranked amongst the CHL Top Ten teams for most of the year as well. Throughout the season, many Colts would say goodbye through trades. Included in this group were Brendan Bell, Sammu Markula, Dylan Smoskowitz, and the Colts 2012 first round draft pick Brendan Perlini. In exchange they would receive many draft picks as well as defencman Jake Dotchin, and forwards Devon Rymarchuk, and Mitchell Theoret in the hopes that the Colts could make a run deep into the playoffs. Over the Christmas Break, sophomore defenceman Aaron Ekblad would captain Team Ontario's Under 17 squad, and both Anthony Camara, and Mark Scheifele would make Team Canada's Under 20 team. Scheifele would soon after be recalled to the NHL after the lockout was settled. He would remain with the Winnipeg Jets until early February when he was returned to the OHL. The Colts would <b>lock</b> <b>down</b> the 2nd place seed in the Eastern Conference heading into the playoffs. After quickly beating the 7th seed Kingston Frontenacs and 3rd seed Oshawa Generals 4 games to 0 a piece, the Colts would meet the first place Belleville Bulls in the conference finals. The Colts would need 7 games to beat Belleville for a trip to the OHL Championships. No one gave the Colts a chance at winning this series as they would play the defending champions London Knights. After 4 games, the Colts would lead the series 3 games to 1. At this point, injuries to Mark Scheifele and suspensions (10 games for Ryan O'Connor, 5 games for Anthony Camara, and 5 games for Jake Dotchin) would catch up with the Colts. London would win game 5 at home and game 6 in Barrie in thrilling fashion. In game 6 London would hold a 4–0 lead with just over 10 minutes left in the third period. The Colts stormed back to score 4 goals before losing in overtime. In game 7 Barrie headed back to London where the game was tied 2–2 in the dying seconds of the third period. A miscommunication between the Colts players led to a turnover, and a London goal with 0.1 seconds remaining on the clock to deny the Colts a trip to the Memorial Cup. To add insult to injury, London was awarded the 2014 Memorial Cup early the next day; a tournament that Barrie also had a solid bid for.|$|E
