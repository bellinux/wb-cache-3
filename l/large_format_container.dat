40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy {{is used to}} track factory relevant tomato paste spoilage. It was found that spoilage in tomato paste test samples leads to longer spin lattice relaxation times T 1 using a conventional low magnetic field NMR system. The increase in T 1 value for contaminated samples over a five day room temperature exposure period prompted the work to be extended {{to the study of}} industry standard, 1, 000 L, non-ferrous, metal-lined totes. NMR signals and T 1 values were recovered from a <b>large</b> <b>format</b> <b>container</b> with a single-sided NMR sensor. The results of this work suggest that a handheld NMR device can be used to study tomato paste spoilage in factory process environments...|$|E

Through HABS/HAER/HALS, buildings and sites of historic significance are recorded with <b>large</b> <b>format</b> cameras and black and white film and using techniques that document the key features of the historic resource with special care not to distort the angles and views. This rectified photography can be accomplished with <b>large</b> <b>format</b> cameras by keeping the film, lens and subject perfectly parallel.

5000|$|Video content encoded using a {{particular}} video coding format is normally bundled with an audio stream (encoded using an audio coding format) inside a multimedia <b>container</b> <b>format</b> such as AVI, MP4, FLV, RealMedia, or Matroska. As such, the user normally doesn't have a H.264 file, but instead has a [...]mp4 video file, {{which is an}} MP4 container containing H.264-encoded video, normally alongside AAC-encoded audio. Multimedia <b>container</b> <b>formats</b> can contain any {{one of a number}} of different video coding formats; for example the MP4 <b>container</b> <b>format</b> can contain video in either the MPEG-2 Part 2 or the H.264 video coding format, among others.
