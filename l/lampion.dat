50|$|Thomas Vanadium was {{a detective}} and {{previously}} {{a man of}} the cloth. He had a talent to flick quarters through a hole or gap in dimensions and into another. He was sent into a coma which lasted for 8 months after Junior killed a nurse and tried to kill Vanadium. Vanadium suffered numerous facial injuries as a result of this, thus making his face severely distorted. However, he chooses to keep his face in this condition as a way of tormenting Junior, spending much of the book after this making Junior believe he is a ghost back for revenge. Unlike Angel, Barty cannot extend his power to Vanadium so he can walk in the rain without getting wet. Near the end of the story, he helps Angel, Grace, and Celestina move into the Lampions' house. After finding Junior's former lawyer's severed head in a cooler at his and Paul's house, Vanadium arrives just in time to distract Junior enough for Angel to push her evil father into another world. Eventually, after Jacob is killed by Junior, he moves into Jacob's apartment on the Lampion's property (by then Thomas had become good friends with the <b>Lampions,</b> the Whites, and the Isaacsons). A few years before Thomas eventually died from old age, he once again became {{a man of the}} cloth.|$|R

50|$|Agnes <b>Lampion</b> is Bartholomew's (Barty) {{mother who}} is an {{extremely}} kind woman who helps others by providing her faith, hope, and occasionally a pie. She cares for her twin brothers who are both traumatized and have slight mental issues. Despite these draw backs she still treats them as normal people and never once shows grief at their presence. Agnes {{grew up with a}} father who was very strict and often punished his children very harshly. She was not allowed to take part in any entertainment for it was considered a sin. Her brothers are wary of the house after their father's death, for too many painful memories occurred there, but Agnes tries to wash the horrid suffering away by replacing the terrible reminds with happier ones in their new family. While most people would despise religion after having such strict teaching shoved onto them so brutally, Agnes still strongly believes in God and in his teachings. She often prays for those who are down on their luck, while also providing pies and groceries to people who are in need. Agnes is confused by her son's special talents but does not cast them off as her father would have and embraces them. She carries huge burdens on her shoulders but with her rock like faith she can take on anything. Agnes is one of the characters who represent everything good in the world, while even though she is innocent and a better person than a large chunk of today's population, terrible things still happen to her. Her character shows that while you may have done nothing wrong, bad things happen and it's important to hold faith because when one door closes a new one opens.|$|E

40|$|The main {{question}} of this master diploma publication is: Who is the dramaturgist {{and what is}} it the dramaturgy in the contemporary theatre, especially during the play preparation. In the first part there are teoretical principles and the definition of the terms dramaturgist and dramaturgy. In the second part there are practical experiences from my work since 2005 until 2007. During this period I prepared following performances: Balada o velkém kostlivci in Theatre DISK, Díra ve zdi in Theatre Minor, Prolhaný ovčák, O kouzelném jablíčku, Červená Karkulka and Slůně in Theatre <b>Lampion</b> Kladno. In my master diploma publication I tried to show the effort of a dramaturgist in different levels. The dramaturgist could be co-creator of a performance or partner of a director and a stage designer. The dramaturgist could cooperate with a group of creators or could be an author of a script or could make an oponency of a new dramatical script or could be an author of a playbill only. These categories I showed {{from the perspective of a}} chosen text and its preparation with the director, than from the perspective of a stage design and at last from the perspective of a cooperation with actors during rehearsals. Part of this master diploma publication are DVDs, photos and notes and passages from scripts...|$|E
