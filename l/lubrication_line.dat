40|$|A thermal elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>line</b> contact model, {{which could}} handle ultra-thin-film conditions, was {{developed}} to study effects of speed on the lubrication performance of a spur gear pair. Dynamic loads were calculated using a classic mass-spring model. They effect of speed on lubrication performance was studied comprehensively through its direct influence on lubrication and indirect influence by affecting dynamic loads of the gear pair. The effect of dynamic loads on film thickness, pressure distribution, and temperature field were studied. It was concluded that a comprehensive model combining a lubricated contact analysis and a dynamic analysis for a gear system is required for a reasonable performance evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The unified {{approach}} {{based upon}} the Reduced Reynolds technique is applied to develop a deterministic transient mixed <b>lubrication</b> <b>line</b> contact model. This model is used in spur gear applications to comprehensively show effects of roughness, working conditions, i. e., rotational speeds and loads on pressure ripples and severity of asperity contacts. Results show effects of the speed, the load, {{as well as the}} RMS value are coupled which makes it difficult to evaluate lubrication states by only considering one variable. Considering the Ree-Eyring non-Newtonian behavior could alleviate pressure ripples significantly, compared with the Newtonian fluid assumption. Small RMS values of surfaces, which could be achieved by superfinish techniques, would be desirable when evaluating gear tooth surface contact performances. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|E

In this article, we proved the existence of solution for the more realistic model problem without taking any constant assumption in viscosity or density of the lubricant. We have shown that optimal error estimate of $H^{ 1 }$ and $L^{ 2 }$ norm can be achieved under a light load non-dimensional parameter condition. In addition, we provided a complete algorithm to tackle all numerical complexities appear in the solution procedure. We obtained results for moderate loaded conditions which have been discussed {{at the end of}} the section. Furthermore, results give a hope for the further development of the scheme for highly loaded condition appeared in a more realistic operating situation which will be discussed in part II.

40|$|Advances in {{material}} development and processing {{have led to}} the introduction of ceramic hybrid bearings for many applications. The introduction of silicon nitride hybrid bearings into the high pressure oxidizer turbopump, on the space shuttle main engine, led NASA to solve a highly persistent and troublesome bearing problem. Hybrid bearings consist of ceramic balls and steel races. The majority of hybrid bearings utilize Si 3 N 4 balls. The aerospace industry is currently studying the use of hybrid bearings and naturally the failure modes of these bearings become an issue in light of the limited data available. In today s turbine engines and helicopter transmissions, the health of the bearings is detected by the properties of the debris found in the <b>lubrication</b> <b>line</b> when damage begins to occur. Current oil debris sensor technology relies on the magnetic properties of the debris to detect damage. Since the ceramic rolling elements of hybrid bearings have no metallic properties, a new sensing system must be developed to indicate the system health if ceramic components are to be safely implemented in aerospace applications. The ceramic oil debris sensor must be capable of detecting ceramic and metallic component damage with sufficient reliability and forewarning to prevent a catastrophic failure. The objective of this research is to provide a background summary on what is currently known about hybrid bearing failure modes and to report preliminary results on the detection of silicon nitride debris, in oil, using a commercial particle counter...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first {{extension of the}} amplitude reduction approach, where the deformation of harmonic components of the roughness is considered, to non-Newtonian elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> (EHL) <b>line</b> contact. The amplitude reduction of one-sided waviness is computed {{as a function of}} the slide-roll ratio. Non-Newtonian effects result in an increase in the deformation for positive slide-roll ratios. This contrasts with published results using a Newtonian fluid where the deformation decreased for such conditions. Moreover, the amplitude reduction varies significantly throughout the contact, requiring an additional parameter for the characterization of the amplitude reduction. An explanation of these differences based on the velocity profile of the lubricant inside the contact concludes the paper...|$|R

In 1916 Martin obtained a closed form solution {{for a minimum}} film thickness and pressure for a rigid cylinder and plane geometry. This solution is not accurate for the cases when the elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes considerably to the film thickness. In 1949, Grubin obtained an approximate solution for so called elasto-hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> (EHL) <b>line</b> contact problem, where he combined both elastic deformation and lubricant hydrodynamic flow. In this solution {{it was assumed that}} the pressure profile follows Hertz solution.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{solution to the}} problem of thermal elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> of <b>line</b> contacts was obtained by using a finite difference formulation. The solution procedure consists of simultaneous solution of the thermal Reynolds equation, the elasticity equation, and the energy equation subject to appropriate boundary conditions. Pressure distribution, film shape, and temperature distribution were obtained for fully flooded conjunctions, a paraffinic lubricant, and various dimensionless speed parameters while the dimensionless load and materials parameters were held constant. Reduction in the minimum film thickness due to thermal effects (as a ratio of thermal to isothermal minimum film thickness) is given by a simple formula as a function of the thermal loading parameter Q: H(min) /H(min, I) = 10 / 10 + Q(0. 4).

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of variable-step time-integration techniques in {{a method of}} lines approach for the numerical solution of transient elastohydrodynamic lubrication calculations is described. Spatial discretization of the coupled integro-differential equations leads {{to a system of}} differential-algebraic equations in time. At each timestep a large system of nonlinear equations of 104 – 107 variables is solved by using multigrid methods and multilevel multi-integration. The {{application of}} temporal error control methods is considered with reference to both the differential-algebraic formulation of the system to be solved and the multigrid-based nonlinear equation solver to be used. The error control method used takes account of the magnitude of the spatial error present by using a local time error control based on the magnitude of this error. This approach is shown to be beneficial in reducing the computational work required. Experimental results on a variety of lubrication problems, including a challenging rough surface problem, are used to display the effectiveness of the methods.

40|$|Flooded oil {{lubrication}} systems are commonly utilized for many manufacturing processes. However, {{there is an}} increasing concern with the flooded lubrication systems due to their biological and envi-ronmental impact {{as well as their}} maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a sponge-like solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environ-mentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces.

Following this, typical nondimensionalizations of the equations are discussed, along with boundary conditions. Two families of problems are considered: line and point contacts. Following a review of existing numerical methods for EHL problems, a different numerical technique, known as the Discontinuous Galerkin method is described. This is motivated by the high accuracy requirement for the numerical simulation of EHL problems. This method is successfully applied to steady-state line contact problems. The free boundary is captured accurately using the moving-grid method and the penalty method respectively. Highly accurate numerical results are obtained at a low expense through the use of h-adaptivity methods based on discontinuity and high-order components respectively. Combined with the Crank-Nicolson method and other implicit schemes for the temporal discretization, highly accurate solutions are also obtained for transient line contact problems using the high order DG method for the spatial discretization. In particular, an extra pressure spike is captured, which is difficult to resolve when using low order schemes for spatial discretization. The extension of this high order DG method to the two-dimensional case (point contact) is straightforward. However, the computation in the two-dimensional case is more expensive due to the extra dimension. Hence p-multigrid is employed to improve the efficiency. Since the free boundary in the two-dimensional case is more complicated, only the penalty method is used to handle the cavitation condition.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been undertaken of the phenomenon of non-steady state lubrication of concentrated point and line contacts. This has been based upon {{a study of the}} effect of squeeze-film action in both hydrodynamically and elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts. The work described in this thesis is in two main sections. The first is concerned with squeeze-film lubrication of lightly loaded point contacts where the surfaces are taken to be rigid. A complete analytical solution is developed considering both piezoviscous and isoviscous fluids. Formulae representing the relationships between the controlling parameters of hydrodynamic lubrication of point contacts with a pure squeeze action became available. In the second section general numerical solutions to the non-steady state hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> problems for <b>line</b> contacts are developed. The finite difference approximation method has been used to solve simultaneously the Reynolds, elasticity and load equations at successive time steps. To avoid convergence difficulties and reduce computing effort a tri-diagonal matrix algorithm has been incorporated. A wide range of <b>line</b> contact <b>lubrication</b> problems is considered. These include the hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic lubrication of cylinders with either pure squeeze-film action or under combined 'entraining' and 'squeeze-film' action. Graphical representations of pressure distributions and film shapes are presented in time sequence as the gap between the two cylinders changes. The variations of the dimensionless minimum film thickness, velocity of approach and peak pressure under various loading conditions are also included. The formation and development of the elastic indentation under constant load with squeeze-film action and with the combined effect of squeeze and entraining action has been ascertained. It has been established that the squeeze-film action plays an effective role in the enhancement of the smallest value of the minimum film thickness occurring under oscillating loading conditions. This effect is more pronounced in elastohydrodynamic than in hydrodynamic lubrication. This general analysis of time dependent lubrication problems for both hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic conditions permits specific studies to be undertaken of realistic machine components operating under non-steady state conditions...|$|R
