50|$|The {{upside down}} carry knife stays {{in place by}} means of a form-fitting {{synthetic}} sheath, which holds it securely in place until yanked sharply. Some manufacturers prefer a <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> sheath augmented with magnets. When carried handle up, a normal style leather sheath is used. When drawing the knife from this sort of carry, the off side hand holds the sheath while the dominant hand pulls the knife free.|$|R
25|$|In the Middle Ages, western men's {{underwear}} became <b>looser</b> <b>fitting.</b> The loincloth {{was replaced}} by loose, trouser-like clothing called braies, which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf. Wealthier men often wore chausses as well, which only covered the legs. Braies (or rather braccae) were a type of trouser worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages they were used exclusively as undergarments.|$|R
25|$|Two {{rumors about}} finalist Katharine McPhee {{circulated}} during early March {{and throughout the}} season. The first {{was that she was}} quitting the show and would not show up for the March 7th airing. The second was sparked by the <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> blouses she had been wearing, leading viewers to suspect she was pregnant. Katharine denied both rumors when interviewed by host Ryan Seacrest on the March 7th show.|$|E
25|$|The first {{military}} frock coats {{were issued}} {{late in the}} Napoleonic Wars to French line infantry and Prussian Landwehr troops. Unwilling to soil the expensive tail coats on campaign, the French adopted a <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> single-breasted coat with contrasting collar and cuffs. The Germans, having been devastated by years of war, were unable to afford elaborate uniforms like the British line infantry and chose a peaked cap and double-breasted blue coat, again with contrasting collar and cuffs, as these were cheaper to produce for {{the large numbers of}} recruits, smart enough for full dress, and more practical for campaigns.|$|E
25|$|The Akha {{people are}} often noted for their very {{recognizable}} sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women {{are known for their}} embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.|$|E
25|$|During the mid 17th century, {{the older}} doublets, ruffs, paned hose, and jerkins were {{replaced}} by the precursor to the three piece suit comprising waistcoat, tight breeches, powdered wig, tricorne hat, and a long coat called a justacorps. This coat, popularised by Louis XIII of France and Charles II of England, was knee length and <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> than the later frock coat, with turn-back cuffs and two rows of buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive brocade coats decorated with velvet, gold braid, embroidery, and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, the English army uniform's colour (England not yet having {{joined with}} Scotland to form the United Kingdom), was largely settled on red with few exceptions. The {{practice}} of distinguishing regiments by different facings was in general use by the early 18th century. In the decades after {{the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars, British Army uniforms trended towards extravagance rather than practicality. That trend was reversed during Crimean war with the adoption of <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> tunics and more practical headdresses. Red coats were however retained, except in India where drab coloured garments were introduced in 1848 [...] and worn increasingly from 1857 on.|$|R
50|$|Rifles existed {{long before}} the 17th century, but were rarely used by {{military}} forces. In order to be effective, the round in a rifle had to fit snugly into the barrel. This would allow the round to grip the barrel's rifling as the weapon was fired, and the rifling would impart a spin onto the round {{which would make it}} more stable and accurate. However, 16th and 17th century weapons were muzzle loaded, and the black powder that was used at the time would quickly foul the barrel. Rifles, with their tight fitting rounds, would quickly become unusable. Smooth bore muskets with <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> rounds were much less accurate, but did not suffer from this problem. Armies therefore tended to favor smooth bore weapons.|$|R
25|$|Heated {{water in}} the suit forms an active {{insulation}} barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, {{and in the early}} stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit is <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|In Los Angeles, {{clothing}} {{is an important}} marker for Filipino street gangs and gang members. After 1965, Los Angeles {{became one of the}} largest cities of Filipino immigrants which saw a massive migration of Filipino youth. To combat Mexican gang members, Filipino gangs arose. The Satana gang fused styles of the Philippines with those of other fashions, particularly cholo fashion among the Latino neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Satana members used the cholo style of dress as inspiration, as well as the jefrox style popularized in Manila. The jefrox style was typically associated with counterculture elements such as long hair and Rock and roll music. The hybrid of both jefrox and cholo styles resulted in brushed hair, the use of nets and bandanas, open toed sandals, and <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> shirts. Some Satana members preferred wearing khakis with significant creases as an homage to the Manong generation of the 1920’s and 1930’s. These khakis were deliberately worn to showcase the unity that the younger generations had with the Filipino laborers of the 1930’s who originally came to California. By the eighties and nineties, Filipino gang members quickly adopted the cholo style of Latino youth. Satana gang members wore <b>loose</b> <b>fitting,</b> baggy pants that were fully black in conjunction with white t-shirts and pendletons. Styles of dress varied, however, even among gangs. The Satana homeboys of the mid-Wilshire and Temple areas of Los Angeles were Filipinos from all economic backgrounds, from lower class to upper class families. Members from a wealthier background were easily identifiable, as they wore luxury clothes reminiscent of the “Manong” generation. Overall, men and women sought to wear brand name clothing such as Tommy Hilfiger and Nautica, who had significant presence in the hip-hop fashion community in the nineties. Filipino men chose to wore ill-fitting clothes while Filipina women chose to wear more revealing clothing. Items such as clothing played a role in how Filipino youth identified themselves, especially in inner city areas.|$|E
25|$|The early uniforms worn by Mongolian {{troops were}} their {{civilian}} clothing. Typical {{it consisted of}} a long blue padded cotton tunic that was worn which reached down to the ankles along with an ornage sash around the waist. Headgear was either a lambs' wool hat or a colored turban wrapped around the head. The color of the turban varied with each Mongol banner clan having a distinctive one. In addition they wore a leather bandolier for cartridges which was slung over the left shoulder. Some soldiers were dressed in <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> cotton jacket and trousers along with a peak cap. In 1936 a new uniform was in use, modeled on the Nationalist Chinese uniform. It included a loose-fitting grey jacket and grey cotton trousers. A peaked grey cotton peaked cap was worn along with it (similar in appearance to those worn by the Russian Imperial Army during World War I). Other uniforms they used included the regular Japanese Army uniform but with Inner Mongolian insignia.|$|E
50|$|A karategi is {{somewhat}} {{similar to a}} judogi (柔道着 or 柔道衣, Judo uniform) as it shares a common origin; however, the material and cut of the uniform is generally much lighter and <b>looser</b> <b>fitting.</b> The heaviest of Karategi are only 16 oz compared to some judogi at 35 oz. Because {{of the nature of}} Karate training which emphasizes striking, kicking and a more limited range of standing throws compared to Judo the karategi has evolved in a manner that maximizes mobility and speed without the extremely coarse and strong fabric required for grappling and throwing found in Judo. They are made from smooth cotton which may be brushed or ribbed for unrestricted movement and added comfort. Reinforced stitching is common, as to compensate for the stresses put on the gi.|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{closely at}} the {{individual}} gleaners, they are each given some individual [...] "character". Rather than having plain smooth looking clothes like in Millet's painting, Lhermitte opted for <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> shirts and added more detail to {{the faces of the}} women. The second woman reaching down has a pained expression on her face, showing the effort of reaching down all day. While the women in Millet's painting share the same traits, the women in Lhermitte's have different expressions. The two standing women each hold their bundle as if they are taking a small break, while the woman at the far end has her hand on her back and an exacerbated look on her face. This piece leaves the viewer without a sense of closure, as it seems the day is just beginning and a hard day of work is still ahead.|$|R
2500|$|Around 1860, the Frye Company {{produced}} a popular line of harness boots. Quickly {{adopted by the}} United States Cavalry, they featured an ankle strap style that revolved around metal rings which may have served as inspiration {{for the design of}} the engineer boot. During the 1930s, Chippewa Shoe Manufacturing Company developed a pair of boots with stovepipe legs and fashioned over their [...] "English Riding Boot" [...] lasts. The West Coast Shoe Company (Wesco) began manufacturing their [...] "engineer boots" [...] in 1939. Engineer boots were originally meant as protective gear for firemen working on steam railway engines (i.e. [...] "engineers"), as their minimal stitching and pull-on design made them ideal for working in conditions with hot coals, embers, and sharp edges. This is a probable source of the name. Wesco's boots were immediately popular with welders in Portland, Oregon-area shipyards, who needed <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> shoes that they could quickly remove in the event embers landed in the shafts. On the overall basis, engineer boots were subverted in the shoe market during World War II by the production of lace-up combat boots and demand for them dramatically decreased.|$|R
25|$|The style {{began as}} part of Neoclassical fashion, {{reviving}} styles from Greco-Roman art which showed women wearing <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> rectangular tunics known as peplos which were belted under the bust, providing support for women and a cool, comfortable outfit especially in warm climate. The empire silhouette was defined by the waistline, which was positioned directly under the bust. The Empire silhouette were the key style in women’s clothing during the Regency era. The dresses were usually light, long and fit loosely, they were usually in white and often sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice which strongly emphasized thin hem and tied around the body. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored. The dresses had a fitted bodice and it gave a high-waist appearance.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor's {{clothing}} {{has been}} equally distinctive, from the distinguished Edwardian suits of the First Doctor to the Second Doctor's rumpled, clown-like Chaplinesque attire to the dandyish frills and velvet of the Third Doctor's era. The Fourth Doctor's long frock coat, <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> trousers, occasionally worn wide-brimmed hat and trailing, multi-striped scarf {{added to his}} somewhat shambolic and bohemian image; the Fifth's Edwardian cricketer's outfit suited his youthful, aristocratic air {{as well as his}} love of the sport (with a stick of celery on the lapel for an eccentric touch, though in The Caves of Androzani it is revealed to turn purple when exposed to gases the Doctor is allergic to); and the Sixth's multicoloured jacket, with its cat-shaped lapel pins, reflected the excesses of 1980s fashion. The Seventh Doctor's outfit – a straw hat, a coat with two scarves, a tie, checked trousers and brogues/wing-tips – was more subdued and suggestive of a showman, reflecting his whimsical approach to life. In later seasons, as his personality grew more mysterious, his jacket, tie and hatband all grew darker.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the confounding influence of external factors, patients undergoing infrared thermographic testing must conform to special restrictions {{regarding the use}} of certain vasoconstrictors (namely, nicotine and caffeine), skin lotions, physical therapy, and other diagnostic procedures in the days prior to testing. Patients may also be required to discontinue certain pain medications and sympathetic blockers. After a patient arrives at a thermographic laboratory, he or she is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in a 16–20°C, draft-free, steady-state room wearing a <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> cotton hospital gown for approximately twenty minutes. A technician then takes infrared images of both the patient's affected and unaffected limbs, as well as reference images of other parts of the patient's body, including his or her face, upper back, and lower back. After capturing a set of baseline images, some labs further require the patient to undergo cold-water autonomic-functional-stress-testing to evaluate the function of his or her autonomic nervous system's peripheral vasoconstrictor reflex. This is performed by placing a patient's unaffected limb in a cold water bath (approximately 20°C) for five minutes while collecting images. In a normal, intact, functioning autonomic nervous system, a patient's affected extremity will become colder. Conversely, warming of an affected extremity may indicate a disruption of the body's normal thermoregulatory vasoconstrictor function, which may sometimes indicate underlying CRPS.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} linings on comfort were {{investigated}} for pleasantness in texture and movement performance in stretch pants. We conducted wearing tests {{in two different}} patterns. At first, comfort of six same stretch pants, five with different lining fabrics and one with no lining, was compared, Then, another waring test was conducted to compare comfort {{in order to obtain}} data on appropriate selection of linings for closer and <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> designs, The results were as follows: 1) Stretch pants with linings gained higher evaluation than pants without linings, in terms of pleasantness in texture, slipperiness on the skin and easiness of body movement. The results revealed that the use of lining fabrics improved the comfort of stretch pants. 2) For pants with relatively sufficient ease, it was revealed that the use of supple and smoothsurfaced linings produced more pleasantness to the skin. It was also revealed that easier vertical slipperiness of the lining towards the body deformation improved mobility. Since human body stretches vertically when in action, less vertical friction with the lining yields easier slippage and mobility. 3) For the linings of closer-fitting pants such as stretch pants, we found that elasticity was more effective than slippage on the skin for maintaining mobility...|$|R
50|$|The {{new design}} steamed well and {{retained}} {{much of the}} Power of the P2's. The reduced weight meant they had a high power to weight ratio, and were good at hauling high speed expresses, although {{in the opinion of}} O.S. Nock they 'acquired a particularly bad reputation for wild and unsafe riding at high speed!' However, there were other problems which prevented them from ever making an impact on the east coast main line. The first of these was a lack of adhesion causing wheel slip when starting, which meant that they could not be used on the Edinburgh-Aberdeen line for which they had originally been built. The second problem was that of reliability caused by their having been adapted from quite different locomotives. Both the A2/2 and the subsequent A2/3 suffered badly from frame movement, vibration and <b>loose</b> <b>fittings.</b> Using equal length connecting rods, as well as the divided drive meant that the centre cylinder was much further forward than the outside cylinders.

2500|$|In Europe, {{from the}} time of the Middle Ages, {{undergarments}} available were limited to a <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> trouser-like piece of clothing called a braies. [...] This article of clothing was stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf and provided no support to the male genitals. This allowed the scrotum unlimited movement under clothing and resulted in injury from carts, carriages with wooden planks for seats or the saddle as the body took all of the force of the motion. The suspensory, was developed around the early 1820s as a way to lift the scrotum away from the plank seat and saddle thereby preventing injury or while in a cart, carriage or horseback riding. Today the suspensory is used primarily as a medical device after genital surgery to aid in post operative healing. General Custer’s suspensory can be seen in the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument museum, near Crow Agency Montana.|$|E

5000|$|Competitive {{swimwear}} generally {{refers to}} the swimsuit, clothing, equipment and accessories used in the aquatic sports of swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, triathlon and water polo.Some swimsuits are designed specifically for swimming competitions where they may be constructed of a special low resistance fabric that reduces skin drag. For some kinds of swimming and diving, special bodysuits called [...] "diveskins" [...] are worn. These suits are made from spandex and provide little thermal protection, but they do protect the skin from stings and abrasion. Most competitive swimmers also wear special swimsuits including partial bodysuits, racerback styles, jammers and racing briefs to assist their glide through the water thus gaining a speed advantage.Unlike regular swimsuits, which are designed mainly for the aesthetic appearances, swimsuits designed to be worn during competitions are manufactured to assist the athlete in swim competitions. They reduce friction and drag in the water, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} swimmer's forward motion. The tight fits allow for easy movement and are said to reduce muscle vibration, thus reducing drag. This also reduces the possibility that a high forwards dive will remove a divers swimwear. Starting around 2000, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of the swimsuits, engineers have taken to designing them to replicate the skin of sea based animals, sharks in particular.In July 2009, FINA voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance enhancing swimsuits, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women's' counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.Some swimmers use a specialized training suit called drag suits to artificially increase drag during practice. Drag suits are swimwear with an outer layer of looser fabric - often mesh or nylon - to increase resistance against the water and build up the swimmer's endurance. They {{come in a variety of}} styles, but most resemble a <b>looser</b> <b>fitting</b> square-cut or swim brief.|$|R

Disconnected or <b>loose</b> chimney <b>fittings</b> caused by corrosion over time can pose serious dangers for residents due to leakage of carbon monoxide into the home. Thus, it is recommended—and in some countries even mandatory—that chimneys be inspected annually and cleaned on a regular basis to prevent these problems. The workers who perform this task are called chimney sweeps or steeplejacks. This work used to be done largely by child labour, and as such features in Victorian literature. In the Middle Ages in some parts of Europe, a crow-stepped gable design was developed, partly to provide access to chimneys without use of ladders.|$|R
2500|$|Wraps, garments, and {{clothing}} have shown {{to affect the}} rate of decomposition because the corpse is covered by some type of barrier. Wraps, such as tight fighting tarps can advance the stages of decay during warm weather when the body is outside. [...] However, <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> coverings that are open on the ends may aid colonization of certain insect species and keep the insects protected from the outside environment. This boost in colonization can lead to faster decomposition. Clothing also provides a protective barrier between the body and insects that can delay stages of decomposition. For instance, if a corpse is wearing a heavy jacket, this can slow down decomposition in that particular area and insects will colonize elsewhere. Bodies that are covered in pesticides or in an area surrounded in pesticides may be slow to have insect colonization. The absence of insects feeding on the body would slow down the rate of decomposition.|$|E
2500|$|As in {{the beat}} {{movement}} preceding them, and the punk movement that followed soon after, hippie symbols and iconography were purposely borrowed from either [...] "low" [...] or [...] "primitive" [...] cultures, with hippie fashion reflecting a disorderly, often vagrant style. As with other adolescent, white middle-class movements, deviant {{behavior of the}} hippies involved challenging the prevailing gender differences of their time: {{both men and women}} in the hippie movement wore jeans and maintained long hair, and both genders wore sandals, moccasins or went barefoot. Men often wore beards, while women wore little or no makeup, with many going braless. Hippies often chose brightly colored clothing and wore unusual styles, such as bell-bottom pants, vests, tie-dyed garments, dashikis, peasant blouses, and long, full skirts; non-Western inspired clothing with Native American, Asian, African and Latin American motifs were also popular. Much hippie clothing was self-made in defiance of corporate culture, and hippies often purchased their clothes from flea markets and second-hand shops. Favored accessories for both men and women included Native American jewelry, head scarves, headbands and long beaded necklaces. Hippie homes, vehicles and other possessions were often decorated with psychedelic art. The bold colors, hand-made clothing and <b>loose</b> <b>fitting</b> clothes opposed the tight and uniform clothing of the 1940s and 1950s. It also rejected consumerism in that the hand-production of clothing called for self-efficiency and individuality.|$|E

Dentures provide a relative acidic, moist and anaerobic environment because the mucosa covered by the denture is sheltered from oxygen and saliva. <b>Loose,</b> poorly <b>fitting</b> dentures may also cause minor trauma to the mucosa, which is thought to increase the permeability of the mucosa and increase the ability of C. albicans to invade the tissues. These conditions all favor the growth of C. albicans. Sometimes dentures become very worn, or they have been constructed to allow insufficient lower facial height (occlusal vertical dimension), leading to over-closure of the mouth (an appearance sometimes described as [...] "collapse of the jaws"). This causes deepening of the skin folds {{at the corners of}} the mouth (nasolabial crease), in effect creating intertriginous areas where another form of candidiasis, angular cheilitis, can develop. Candida species are capable of adhering to the surface of dentures, most of which are made from polymethylacrylate. They exploit micro-fissures and cracks in the surface of dentures to aid their retention. Dentures may therefore become covered in a biofilm, and act as reservoirs of infection, continually re-infecting the mucosa. For this reason, disinfecting the denture is a vital part of treatment of oral candidiasis in persons who wear dentures, as well as correcting other factors like inadequate lower facial height and fit of the dentures.|$|R
