E. coli O 157 :H 7 was essentially rinsed from <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts</b> with repeated washing steps, while 1 to 2 log CFU of S. enterica remained attached per sprout. S. enterica Newport adhered to 3 -day-old sprouts as well as Pantoea agglomerans and 10 -fold more than Pseudomonas putida and Rahnella aquatilis, whereas the growth rates of all four strains throughout seed sprouting were similar. S. enterica Newport and plant-associated bacteria adhered 10 - to 1, 000 -fold more than E. coli O 157 :H 7; however, three of four other E. coli serotypes, isolated from cabbage roots exposed to sewage water following a spill, adhered to sprouts better than E. coli O 157 :H 7 and as well as the Pseudomonas and Rahnella strains.

40|$|Numerous Salmonella enterica food-borne illness {{outbreaks}} {{have been}} associated with contaminated vegetables, in particular sprouted seeds, and the incidence of reported contamination has steadily risen. In order to understand the physiology of S. enterica serovar Newport on plants, a screen was developed to identify transposon mutants that were defective in attachment to <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts.</b> Twenty independent mutants from a pool of 6, 000 were selected for reduced adherence to <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts.</b> Sixty-five percentage of these mutants had insertions in uncharacterized genes. Among the characterized genes were strains with insertions in the intergenic region between agfB, the surface-exposed aggregative fimbria (curli) nucleator, and agfD, a transcriptional regulator of the LuxR superfamily, and rpoS, the stationary-phase sigma factor. Both AgfD and RpoS have been reported to regulate curli and cellulose production and RpoS regulates other adhesins such as pili. The intergenic and rpoS mutants were reduced in initial attachment to <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts</b> by 1 log unit compared to the wild type. Mutations of agfA, curli subunit, and agfB in S. enterica serovar Enteritidis differentially affected attachment to plant tissue. The agfA mutation was not reduced in ability to attach to or colonize <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts,</b> whereas the agfB mutation was reduced. Thus, agfB alone can play a role in attachment of S. enterica to plant tissue.

RESULTS: Seventeen of 18 patients were women. Seventeen were adults 20 - 89 years of age.

40|$|<b>Alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts</b> {{and other}} seed sprouts have {{been implicated in}} {{numerous}} outbreaks of salmonellosis. The source of these epidemics {{appears to have been}} low-level contamination of seeds by Salmonella bacteria that developed into clinically significant populations during the seed germination process. To test the possibility that Salmonella enterica strains carry host range determinants that allow them to grow on alfalfa, strains isolated from alfalfa or other sources were surveyed for their ability to grow on germinating alfalfa seeds. An S. enterica serovar Cubana strain originally isolated from contaminated <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts</b> multiplied most rapidly during the initial 24 h of the seed germination process. Germinating alfalfa seeds supported the multiplication of S. enterica cells prior to the emergence of the root radicle at 72 h. Thereafter, much lower rates of multiplication were apparent.

Isolates obtained from alfalfa attained population levels similar to those observed for strains isolated from contaminated meat products or stools. Each of the strains could be detected in the waste irrigation water, with populations being strongly correlated with those detected on the germinating alfalfa seeds.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the control of pathogens on <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts</b> and some treatments {{have been shown to}} be effective in reducing pathogen populations. However, control methods investigated thus far only provide pathogen control at a given point in the sprouting process leaving the sprouts vulnerable at other times during sprouting and storage. Competitive inhibition of pathogens with LAB (lactic acid bacteria) may provide pathogen control throughout the sprouting process and up to consumption. The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify LAB with the intention of adding selected isolates to <b>alfalfa</b> <b>sprouts</b> to inhibit the growth of pathogens during sprouting and storage. Fifty-eight LAB isolates were obtained from <b>alfalfa</b> seeds and <b>sprouts.</b> Based on the agar spot test, all pathogens were inhibited by 32 (55 %) of the isolates, Salmonella enterica by 56, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 by 49, and Listeria monocytogenes by 41. The isolates were identified using the Analytical Profile Index for carbohydrate utilization, and the isolate L 7 was identified using 16 s rRNA sequence analysis. Isolate L 7 and an isolate previously obtained, D 3, were evaluated for competitive inhibition of pathogens in laboratory media. Pathogen populations were significantly reduced by day 5. The isolates were added to seed soak water with pathogen inoculated seeds. During sprouting and storage, LM showed a significant reduction compared to the Control while EC and SE were consistently higher than the Control, though significance was borderline. For this reason, the interactions of these LAB cultures and EC and SE need to be elucidated by further study. The effects of LAB on Gram negative bacteria have been largely overlooked in the literature. It is suggested that in competitive inhibition studies, the effects of LAB on Gram negative pathogens be addressed concurrently with Gram positive pathogens. ...|$|R
