40|$|How to optimally {{allocate}} limited freeway sensor {{resources is}} {{of great interest to}} transportation engineers. In this paper, we focus on the optimal allocation of point sensors, such as <b>loop</b> <b>detectors,</b> to minimize performance measurement errors. Although {{it has been shown that}} the minimization problem can be intuitively formulated as a nonlinear program, the formulation is so complex that only heuristic approaches can be used to solve the problem. In this paper, we transform the nonlinear program into an equivalent mixed-integer linear model. The linearized model is shown to have a graphical interpretation and can be solved using resource constrained shortest path algorithms. A customized Branch-and-Bound technique is then proposed to solve the resource constrained shortest path problem. Numerical experiments along an urban freeway corridor demonstrate that this sensor location model is successful in allocating <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> to improve the accuracy of travel time estimation.

40|$|Travel-time data {{provides}} {{vital information}} for traffic monitoring, management, and planning. The {{objective of this}} research was to develop a new computational approach that could accurately measure travel time from two sets of spatially separated <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> using re-identification of vehicle inductance signatures generated by the loops. Although measuring travel time using loop inductance signatures is not new, all past approaches essentially relied on pattern matching of raw inductance waveforms without restoring the loss of detailed features caused by a large detection zone of inductive loops. The main effort in this research was to develop a new computational algorithm that restores the lost details from the raw inductance waveforms by modeling the output of <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> as a convolution of the original vehicle signature and the loop system function. This restoration problem was formulated as a blind deconvolution problem since we know neither the impulse response of the <b>loop</b> <b>detectors,</b> nor the original vehicle signature. To solve this blind problem, two basic blind deconvolution approaches were used, Godard deconvolution and constrained least squares. Experimental results showed that both methods performed well and significantly exposed the original signature information with unique vehicle characteristics. Guidesta...|$|R

This algorithm is based on the unscented Kalman filter using vehicle counts and flows from <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> located {{at the end of every}} link, and travel time from probe vehicles.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} used method of detection is induction loops. Other methods include magnetometers, video, infrared, radar and microwave detection. A typical <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> installation could be approximately six foot square or six feet wide by thirty feet long. Other shapes may also be used including circular and hexagonal loops. These are cut into, or buried {{below the surface of the}} roadway. The preferred wire is stranded copper with an insulating cover which is then loosely surrounded by a protection jacket. Electrically this is a 'flat' coil in the pavement structure that detects vehicles by changes in the magnetic inductance field of the coil when ferrous metal from a vehicle passes through the field. The electronic sensor in the controller cabinet senses the change in the magnetic field. The output from the sensor electronics is a 'switch' closure. This can be an electro-mechincial relay or solid-state. The 'switch' is normally closed (NC) in the de-engerized state but held open when power is applied to the circuit. This is called 'Fail-Call' so that if there is a failure in the sensor electronics the output will place a 'Call' to the controller as if a vehicle is present on the <b>loop</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E
50|$|Video (both {{normal and}} infrared) use {{a change in}} {{contrast}} of the image detection zone to detect traffic.

Recently {{state of the art}} Bluetooth MAC Scanners (BMS) has significantly captured the interest of stakeholders for exploiting it for area wide traffic monitoring. <b>Loop</b> <b>detectors</b> provide flow- a fundamental traffic parameter; whereas BMS provides individual vehicle travel time between BMS stations. Hence, these two data sources complement each other, and if integrated should increase the accuracy and reliability of the traffic state estimation.

5000|$|Tachometers {{are used}} to {{estimate}} traffic speed and volume (flow). A vehicle is equipped with the sensor and conducts [...] "tach runs" [...] which record the traffic data. These data are a substitute or complement to <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> data. To get statistically significant results requires {{a high number of}} runs, and bias is introduced by the time of day, day of week, and the season. However, because of the expense, spacing (a lower density of loop detectors diminishes data accuracy), and relatively low reliability of loop detectors (often 30% or more are out of service at any given time), tach runs remain a common practice.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory has}} been criticized for two primary reasons. First, the theory is almost {{completely}} based on measurements on the Bundesautobahn 5 in Germany. It may be that this road has this pattern, but other roads in other countries have other characteristics. Future research must show the validity of the theory on other roads in other countries around the world. Second, {{it is not clear how}} the data was interpolated. Kerner uses fixed point measurements (loop detectors), but draws his conclusions on vehicle trajectories, which span the whole length of the road under investigation. These trajectories can only be measured directly if floating car data is used, but as said, only <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> measurements are used. How the data in between was gathered or interpolated, is not clear.|$|E
5000|$|Practically {{all modern}} {{receivers}} {{are of the}} superheterodyne design. The RF signal from the antenna may have one stage of amplification to improve the receiver's noise figure, although at lower frequencies this is typically omitted. The RF signal enters a mixer, along with {{the output of the}} local oscillator, in order to produce a so-called intermediate frequency (IF) signal. An early optimization of the superheterodyne was to combine the local oscillator and mixer into a single stage called [...] "converter". The local oscillator is tuned to a frequency somewhat higher (or lower) than the intended reception frequency so that the IF signal will be at a particular frequency where it is further amplified in a narrow-band multistage amplifier. Tuning the receiver involves changing the frequency of the local oscillator, with further processing of the signal (especially in relation to increasing the receiver) conveniently done at a single frequency (the IF frequency) thus requiring no further tuning for different stations.Here we show block diagrams for typical superheterodyne receivers for AM and FM broadcast respectively. This particular FM design uses a modern phase locked <b>loop</b> <b>detector,</b> unlike the frequency discriminator or ratio detector used in earlier FM receivers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCapacity at signalized intersections {{is a basic}} {{parameter}} in urban transport networks. The capacity of a signalized intersection {{is a function of}} existing geometric, control, weather, and other conditions. Estimation of capacity at signalized intersections {{is one of the most}} important topics in traffic Engineering. If the capacity can directly be measured, the delay at signalized intersections and thus the traffic performance and quality of service can be calculated according to the functional relationship between delay and capacity. Unfortunately, under real world traffic conditions, the capacity cannot easily be measured directly for an existing intersection, especially under unsaturated flow conditions where the flow volume is lower than the capacity. This paper presents a model for estimating the capacity of an existing signalized intersection under unsaturated flow condition based on the cycle overflow probability which can be directly measured by <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> at stop lines. The cycle overflow probability is just the proportion of cycles with occupied detector at end of green time phases. Also the flow volume can directly be measured by <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> at stop lines. According to the queuing theory, the cycle overflow probability is a function of the degree of saturation, i. e. a function of flow volume and capacity. Thus, by measuring the cycle overflow probability and the flow volume, the capacity can be estimated according to the functional relationship. The proposed model is calibrated to data obtained from <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> at different signalized intersections under unsaturated conditions. For validation the model, the real capacities at the same intersections are measured for saturated cycles where the capacity can be considers as the measured volume. The proposed model delivers a useful tool for estimating capacity at signalized intersections under unsaturated conditions. Using the proposed model, the capacity and thus the traffic quality of service at existing signalized intersections can directly be estimated using data from <b>loop</b> <b>detectors</b> at stop lines. The model is theoretically reasonable and easily to use for practitioners. The results of the calibration and validation are very promising...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology for measuring travel time in real-time on freeways using the existing <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> infrastructure. The methodology uses vehicle length, a simple signature from paired loop detectors, to extract {{information about the}} traffic stream. Other methods of measuring travel time either rely on approximations from aggregate traffic parameters or use expensive, proprietary systems to extract individual vehicle signatures. The reidentification algorithm is tolerant to noise; instead of finding the `best match' for each vehicle, it finds all possible matches. Using a bottom up approach, the algorithm looks for sequences of vehicles from the possible matches. Even with noisy <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> data, the sequence detection eliminates most of the possible but incorrect matches while the true matches remain. The algorithm is fast, because it compares each pair of vehicles once and only once. Using <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> speed traps, the communication bandwidth is small compared [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{volume and}} queue length are two {{important}} variables to identify traffic states in urban areas. Loop detectors {{are often used}} for monitoring traffic. A prominent weakness of <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> data is the limited reliability due to equipment malfunctions and communication faults. This paper presents a method to identify the validity of <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> measurements by analyzing the ratio of counts on adjacent lanes. GPS data from probe vehicles are an alternative for monitoring traffic states. They include instantaneous speed, acceleration and position; individual vehicle trajectories can be grossly estimated in real time. Consequently, the queue length can be measured approximately. This {{can be used to}} estimate traffic volumes and the percentage of probe vehicles. By combining <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> and GPS data, more information regarding traffic status can be extracted from both data sources. This paper discusses two methods to check the volume counts and to fill in missing or invalid data: one method uses the ratio of <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> counts on adjacent links, the other one uses data from probe vehicles to estimate the traffic volumes from the dynamics of the queue length at signalized intersections. Real data from the city Changsha in China are used to validate these two methods.
