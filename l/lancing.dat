5|$|In {{his later}} years at <b>Lancing,</b> Waugh {{achieved}} success as a house captain, editor of the school magazine {{and president of the}} debating society, and won numerous art and literature prizes. He also shed most of his religious beliefs. He started a novel of school life, untitled, but abandoned the effort after writing about around 5,000 words. He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at Hertford College, Oxford, and left <b>Lancing</b> in December 1921.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river {{has not always been}} at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at <b>Lancing</b> some ten miles to the east before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E
50|$|Acting <b>lance</b> daffadar is the {{equivalent}} rank to <b>lance</b> corporal in Pakistan, Indian and British Indian Army cavalry units, ranking below <b>lance</b> daffadar.

In 1965, {{he was arrested in}} {{violation}} of the Paternity Act. A Chicago woman, Para Lee Thomas, claimed she had a son by <b>Lance,</b> Ronnie Maurice <b>Lance,</b> born [...] She asserted that <b>Lance</b> had promised to pay her doctor and hospital bills of around $375, but had defaulted on these payments. Judge Benjamin J. Kanter issued a warrant for <b>Lance's</b> arrest, setting <b>Lance's</b> bond at $1,000.|$|R
40|$|In this research, coal {{combustion}} behavior across {{the regions of}} blowpipe, tuyere, and raceway of blast furnace are numerically examined. Three different <b>lance</b> configurations, including a single <b>lance,</b> a double air-cooled coaxial <b>lance,</b> and an oxy-coal <b>lance</b> with different oxygen enrichment patterns, are taken into consideration. The {{coal combustion}} efficiency by the double <b>lance</b> injection is 5. 1 % higher than that by single <b>lance</b> injection. From the calculated temperature by the oxy-coal <b>lance,</b> coal ignition is retarded due to the cooling effect of enriched oxygen flowing through the <b>lance</b> annulus, resulting in the moderation of pressure loss within the raceway. Most importantly, the enriched oxygen becomes the combustion enhancer in the downstream of coal plume after ignition is triggered. Consequently, the coal burnout under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> injection is comparative to that under the double air-cooled <b>lance</b> injection. The performance of blast furnace may be improved with the advantages provided by the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> injection. Compared with the single <b>lance</b> injection, coal trajectories under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> injection are closer to the tuyere exit due to the higher inertia force of coal particles against hot blast. This {{should be taken into}} account for the designs of the oxy-coal <b>lance...</b>|$|R
5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his <b>Lancing</b> career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} <b>Lancing</b> College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} publisher, Waugh {{was educated}} at <b>Lancing</b> College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and briefly worked as a {{schoolmaster}} {{before he became a}} full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends, and developed a taste for country house society. In the 1930s, he travelled extensively, often as a special newspaper correspondent in which capacity he reported from Abyssinia {{at the time of the}} 1935 Italian invasion. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War (1939–1945), first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown, which occurred in the early 1950s.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic free <b>lance,</b> {{discovered}} accidentally in 2005, is a {{new type}} of injection <b>lance</b> with its top-end connected with a flexible joint so that the <b>lance</b> tip could move during the gas injection. Without mechanical driving apparatus, the free <b>lance</b> is capable of injection of reagent into wide space of the bath. The investigation of the free <b>lance</b> indicated that the <b>lance</b> movement caused forceful interaction of the injection gas with the liquid phase, and jet trajectory was changed due to the drag force from the liquid phase. A <b>lance</b> with weight of 15 kg and length of 2 m has been used as the free <b>lance</b> for modeling study, indicating that the heavy free <b>lance</b> for the industry could achieve certain extent of movement for dispersion injection, and this prediction has been proved in 2012 by industrial application of the 9 meters free <b>lance</b> used for the injection modification of end-slag from BOF converter. In 2013, a stationary refractory <b>lance</b> with weight of 2 t for 120 t ladle of steelmaking desulphurization has also been redesigned and converted into the dynamic free <b>lance</b> with initial tests exhibiting the <b>lance</b> movement...|$|R

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a <b>lancing</b> wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

25|$|The LB {{directors}} recognised {{that part}} of the problem at Brighton was that the works was overwhelmed with work. In 1910 they purchased land at <b>Lancing</b> for a new carriage and wagon works, which was opened in 1912. This allowed Stroudley's carriage shed to be used as an overflow 'stock shed' by the locomotive works and the motive power depot. Locomotives repaired at Brighton were also sometimes taken to <b>Lancing</b> for their final painting.|$|E

5000|$|ISASMELT <b>lances</b> contain {{one or more}} devices called [...] "swirlers" [...] {{that cause}} the {{injected}} gas to spin within the <b>lance,</b> forcing it against the <b>lance</b> wall, cooling it. The cooling effect results in a layer of slag [...] "freezing" [...] {{on the outside of}} the <b>lance.</b> This layer of solid slag protects the <b>lance</b> from the high temperatures inside the furnace. The tip of the <b>lance</b> that is submerged in the bath eventually wears out, and the worn <b>lance</b> is easily replaced with a new one when necessary. The worn tips are subsequently cut off and a new tip welded onto the <b>lance</b> body before it is returned to the furnace.|$|R
