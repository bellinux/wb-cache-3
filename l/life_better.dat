25|$|Many {{military}} {{historians have}} pointed out that Westmoreland became chief of staff at the worst time in history with regard to the Army. Guiding the Army as it transitioned to an all-volunteer force, he issued many directives to try to make Army <b>life</b> <b>better</b> and more palatable for United States youth—e.g., allowing soldiers to wear sideburns and to drink beer in the mess hall. However, many hard-liners scorned these as too liberal. Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for governor of South Carolina in 1974.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, he {{stressed}} the importance of being courteous in one’s everyday life as it would make <b>life</b> <b>better</b> for everyone. It was a desirable attribute which could be found in all cultivated societies, and something which we should practice for Singapore’s own self-esteem. If tourists do find Singapore a courteous nation, it was because it was ‘incidental’. This ‘prodding’ by Lee Kuan Yew thus saw the birth of the National Courtesy Campaign, which became a recurrent, annual campaign that was seen as a long-term project of aiming to imbue values of courtesy into Singaporeans within a period of 10 years.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Canary Islanders {{had already}} emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as Havana, Veracruz, Santo Domingo, San Antonio, Texas and St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. These {{economic}} difficulties spurred mass emigration, primarily to the Americas, during the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to Venezuela. Also, thousands of Canarians moved to Puerto Rico where the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island <b>life</b> <b>better</b> than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain. Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of Hatillo, Puerto Rico, are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico. Similarly, many thousands of Canarians emigrated to the shores of Cuba. During the Spanish–American War of 1898, the Spanish fortified the islands against possible American attack, but an attack never came.|$|E

She met the socialist Kate Richards O'Hare, who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy—Kate O'Hare believed in voting to achieve state power—the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners. Goldman also met and became friends with Gabriella Segata Antolini, an anarchist and follower of Luigi Galleani. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities, and was sent to prison for 14 months.

500|$|Before {{the book}} concludes, Gladwell {{writes about the}} unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a {{descendant}} of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met {{and fell in love}} with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a <b>life</b> <b>better</b> than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success [...] "is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky", and at the end of the book, he remarks, [...] "Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But you could read it as an extended apology for my success." ...|$|E

2500|$|Modern humanists, such as Corliss Lamont or Carl Sagan, {{hold that}} {{humanity}} must seek for truth through reason {{and the best}} observable evidence and endorse scientific skepticism and the scientific method. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong {{must be based on}} the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human. The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making <b>life</b> <b>better</b> for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole. [...] The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving {{the world a better place}} for those who come after.

The {{pressure}} on Bird was temporarily relieved when Coletti locked his tyres [...] heading towards the tenth corner and later braked {{too late for the}} final turn. He overshot the corner and allowed Nasr through into second position. Coletti appeared to have flat-spotted his tyres as a consequence and could not remain on the track and his chances for the victory were over. Nasr appeared to manage his tyre <b>life</b> <b>better</b> than other drivers and quickly drew close to Bird on the final lap and pulled alongside him under braking for the final turn. Bird went defensive and controlled the wheelspin in his tyres. Nasr pulled out of Bird's slipstream but could not overhaul Bird who held on and won the race. The margin of victory was eight-hundredths of a second, the closest in GP2 Series history. Coletti held on to finish third with a comfortable margin over Dillmann in fourth. Calado was fifth, Palmer sixth, Abt seventh and Quaife-Hobbs rounded out the points-scorers in eighth. Leimer, Ceccon, Canamasas, Cecotto, Richelmi, Trummer, Evans, Leal, Giovesi, De Jong, Rosenzweig, Rossi, Varhaug, Berthon, Frijns, Haryanto and Binder were the last of the classified finishers.
