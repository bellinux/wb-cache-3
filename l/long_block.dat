Time resolution can be too low for highly transient signals and may cause smearing of percussive sounds.|$|E
25|$|North of Crittenden Road, NY15 {{passes through}} a pocket of {{residential}} development that borders I-390 and the adjacent Erie Canal. At {{the northern edge of}} the area, NY15 meets and crosses I-390 for the final time at exit16. While I-390 continues northwest from here, bypassing most of Rochester, NY15 stays true to its linear northeasterly alignment, crossing the Erie Canal and entering the city's southernmost section. In this area, NY15, now Mount Hope Avenue, serves the Monroe County offices and meets NY15A at East Henrietta Road, completing the eastern alternate loop of NY15. One <b>long</b> <b>block</b> to the north is Elmwood Avenue (formerly NY47), which crosses NY15 at the southeastern corner of Mount Hope Cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|Information {{theory is}} based on {{probability}} theory and statistics. [...] Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are entropy, a measure of information in a single random variable, and mutual information, a measure of information in common between two random variables. [...] The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on {{the rate at which}} data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably compressed. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy channel in the limit of <b>long</b> <b>block</b> lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.|$|E

Myrtle Avenue trains, which had used this structure since April 27, instead continued along Myrtle Avenue to Hudson Avenue, turning north there via a new junction into the Hudson Avenue Elevated, closed north of Myrtle Avenue since shortly after it opened due to safety concerns with the at-grade crossing at Myrtle Avenue. Thus passengers transferring between the two lines could get out at Navy Street and simply enter the next train on the other route. The company continued to operate one daily train, closed to passengers, over Park Avenue, [...] "to satisfy, it is thought, legal requirements", according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Flash {{memory is}} a good {{candidate}} for the storage de-vice in real-time systems due to its non-fluctuating performance, low power consumption and high shock resistance. However, the garbage collection for invalid pages in flash memory can invoke a <b>long</b> <b>blocking</b> time. Moreover, the worst-case blocking time is significantly long compared to the best-case blocking time under the current flash management techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel flash translation layer (FTL), called KAST, where user can configure the maximum log block associativity to control the worst-case blocking time. Performance evaluation using simulations shows that the overall performance of KAST is better than the current FTL schemes as well as KAST guarantees the <b>longest</b> <b>block</b> time is shorter than the specified value.

A few heads protruded from doors and around corners. That main street of Wellston saw some such situation every few days. If it was an instinct for Texans to fight, it was also instinctive for them to sense with remarkable quickness the signs of a coming gun-play. Rumor could not fly so swiftly. In less than ten minutes everybody who had been on the street or in the shops knew that Buck Duane had come forth to meet his enemy.|$|E
60|$|More than once, in {{the brief}} days of my {{struggle}} for an education, I went to Johnny Heinhold to borrow money. When I entered the university, I borrowed forty dollars from him, without interest, without security, without buying a drink. And yet--and here is the point, the custom, and the code--in the days of my prosperity, after the lapse of years, I {{have gone out of}} my way by many a <b>long</b> <b>block</b> to spend across Johnny Heinhold's bar deferred interest on the various loans. Not that Johnny Heinhold asked me to do it, or expected me to do it. I did it, as I have said, in obedience to the code I had learned along with all the other things connected with John Barleycorn. In distress, when a man has no other place to turn, when he hasn't the slightest bit of security which a savage-hearted pawn-broker would consider, he can go to some saloon-keeper he knows. Gratitude is inherently human. When the man so helped has money again, depend upon it that a portion will be spent across the bar of the saloon-keeper who befriended him.|$|E

40|$|Microphase {{separation}} {{in random}} multiblock copolymers is studied with mean-field theory assuming that <b>long</b> <b>blocks</b> of a copolymer are strongly segregated, whereas short blocks {{are able to}} penetrate into "alien" domains and exchange between the domains and interfacial layer. A bidisperse copolymer with blocks of only two sizes (long and short) is considered {{as a model of}} multiblock copolymers with high polydispersity in the block size. Short blocks of the copolymer {{play an important role in}} microphase separation. First, their penetration into the "alien" domains leads to the formation of joint <b>long</b> <b>blocks</b> in their own domains. Second, short blocks localized at the interface considerably change the interfacial tension. The possibility of penetration of short blocks into the "alien" domains is controlled by the product chi*Nsh (chi is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, Nsh is the short block length). At not very large chi*Nsh, the domain size is larger than that for a regular copolymer consisting of the same <b>long</b> <b>blocks</b> as in the considered random copolymer. At a fixed mean block size, the domain size grows with an increase in the block size dispersity, the rate of the growth being dependent of the more detailed parameters of the block size distribution.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a generalization {{of the notion}} of longest repeats with a block of k don’t care symbols introduced by [8] (for k fixed) to longest motifs composed of three parts: a first and last that parameterize match (that is, match via some symbol renaming, initially unknown), and a functionally equivalent central block. Such three-part motifs are called <b>longest</b> <b>block</b> motifs. Different types of functional equivalence, and thus of matching criteria for the central block are considered, which include as a subcase the one treated in [8] and extend to the case of regular expressions with no Kleene closure or complement operation. We show that a single general algorithmic tool that is a non-trivial extension of the ideas introduced in [8] can handle all the various kinds of <b>longest</b> <b>block</b> motifs defined in this paper. The algorithm complexity is, in all cases, in O(n log n). ...|$|R
