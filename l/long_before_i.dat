500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted the {{extraordinary}} development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines {{to the fact that}} Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: [...] "Suze was into this equality-freedom thing <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was. I checked out the songs with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Boys in August 2003, Shankar began work on his next directorial venture {{entitled}} Anniyan. It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project Robot revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his [...] "dream project" [...] and disclosed {{that it would be}} a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, [...] "The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> started making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these stayed with me. Those were the seeds. I make films based on them." ...|$|E

500|$|During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was {{regarded}} as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, [...] "I am not a role model." [...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies. They're there <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis's {{return to}} Darmstadt as Grand Duke and Duchess {{was met with}} celebration that Alice did not expect. However, she found her duties overwhelming, writing to her mother that she [...] "dreaded everything". Alice used her new role to reform the social {{conditions}} of Darmstadt, but found the responsibility of being Landesmutter (mother of her people) strenuous. In another letter to her mother, she wrote that her duties were [...] "more than she could stand in the long run". She was distressed by a rumour that she was once unkind to Louis's aunt, Grand Duchess Mathilde Caroline, and she was hurt by an unkind letter from Queen Victoria. Alice complained to Louis that the letter [...] "made me cry with anger...I wish I were dead and it probably will not be too <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> give Mama that pleasure." [...] However, no mention is made of what provoked this angry outburst.|$|E

2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he had on her life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] He told me the stories of the classics and, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could understand them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E

2500|$|George Clair St. John (1877–1966), Harvard {{class of}} 1902, aged 31 {{in the fall}} of 1908, had grown up on a farm in Hoskins Station, Connecticut. He was an ordained Episcopal priest. He had taught at Hill School in Pennsylvania and Adirondack-Florida School, and was {{teaching}} at Hackley School in Tarrytown, N.Y., when Samuel Dutton of Columbia Teachers College recruited him for the headmastership. St. John [...] "knew, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> read Mr. Dutton's letter, that I wanted some day to have a school of my own. In my thought about it, Dean Briggs was my first text." [...] This was LeBaron Russell Briggs, dean of men at Harvard when St. John was there and afterward dean of the faculty until 1925. Briggs, St. John wrote, [...] "fathered the whole college", and the St. Johns too would serve in loco parentis.|$|E
2500|$|... "Vexed to Nightmare by a Rocking Cradle" [...] (besides {{being an}} allusion to William Butler Yeats's [...] "The Second Coming") is a short story which deals with televangelism after an apocalypse. Simmons {{mentions}} in the introduction that he was commissioned to write a Christmas tale that included an [...] "overlooked present", {{but that he was}} given free rein otherwise: one of the authors was assigned the upbeat and happy story, so the other three could be as unrelievedly grim and dark as amused them. Amusingly, the happy tale was never actually submitted, so the collection was dark indeed. It didn't help that the next Christmas they were republished in Asimov's SF Magazine [...] "where it served to dark the next Christmas for a host of people." [...] (p.86). As Simmons goes on to relate, [...] "It wasn't <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> had the reputation as The Man Who Sacrificed Christmas with a Survival Knife."

2500|$|James {{recounts the}} role cricket played in his family's history, and his {{meetings}} with such early West Indian players as George John, Wilton St Hill, the great batsman George Headley and the all-rounder Learie Constantine, but {{focuses on the}} importance of the game and its players to society, specifically to colonial era Trinidad. James argues for the importance of sport in history, and refers to its roots in the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece. [...] He documents the primacy of W. G. Grace in the development of modern cricket, and the values embraced by cricket {{in the development of the}} cultures of the British Empire. He approaches cricket as an art form, as well as discussing its political impact - particularly the role of race and class in early West Indian cricket. [...] "Cricket", he writes, [...] "had plunged me into politics <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was aware of it. When I did turn to politics, I did not have too much to learn." [...] Cricket is approached as a method of examining the formation of national culture, society in the West Indies, the United Kingdom, and Trinidad. Education, family, national culture, class, race, colonialism, and the process of decolonisation are all examined through the prism of contemporary West Indian cricket, the history of cricket, and James's life as a player of—and commentator and writer on—the sport of cricket.|$|E

2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> became mayor of this city." [...] Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, [...] "When you conspire and calculate what you intend to do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|E
