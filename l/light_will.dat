5|$|As the {{rotating}} mirror R will have moved {{slightly in the}} time it takes for the light to bounce from R to M and back, the <b>light</b> <b>will</b> be deflected away from the original source by a small angle.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{predicts that}} the path of <b>light</b> <b>will</b> follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star. This effect was initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and <b>light</b> <b>will</b> often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E

50|$|Computer {{graphics}} lighting {{can also}} {{refer to the}} job of lighting in computer animation. A computer graphics <b>lighter</b> <b>will</b> employ {{many of the same}} methods a live-action lighting designer or gaffer might employ. However, the computer graphics <b>lighter</b> <b>will</b> work within a computer graphics application.|$|R

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn, but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>will</b> deliver a high amount of energy– enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a sunburn. A photon of infrared <b>light</b> <b>will</b> deliver a lower amount of energy– only enough to warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough to keep people comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a sunburn.|$|E
25|$|If a fault {{develops}} in {{any part of}} the ABS, a warning <b>light</b> <b>will</b> usually be illuminated on the vehicle instrument panel, and the ABS will be disabled until the fault is rectified.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide {{has been}} {{researched}} {{for its ability to}} reduce air pollution. Ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>will</b> release free electrons from material, thereby creating free radicals, which break up VOCs and NOx gases. One form is superhydrophilic.|$|E
50|$|The cloning {{functionality}} {{is limited}} by certain light sources. Blue <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> prevent clones from being created in the illuminated area, while red <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> block the control swapping ability; purple lights block both actions. Touching certain white lights, moving off the current stage, or touching another clone will otherwise destroy those clones.|$|R
50|$|When {{lighting}} loads are in {{use for a}} {{high proportion}} of the time, energy savings on lighting equipment are extremely valuable. When voltage is reduced, incandescent <b>lighting</b> <b>will</b> see a large decrease in power drawn, a large decrease in light output and an increase in lifetime, as the previous extracts from the Electricians Guide illustrate. Since the decrease in <b>light</b> output <b>will</b> exceed the decrease in power drawn, the energy efficiency - luminous efficacy - of the <b>lighting</b> <b>will</b> drop.|$|R

25|$|In practice, {{some light}} {{is lost in}} the {{polariser}} and the actual transmission of unpolarised <b>light</b> <b>will</b> be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarisers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for some birefringent prism types.|$|E
25|$|At Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon appears {{a broken}} man after being crushed at the Battle of the Blackwater. His advisor Ser Davos is imprisoned after {{attempting}} to kill Melisandre, who still believes her god, the Lord of <b>Light,</b> <b>will</b> help Stannis return to prominence.|$|E
25|$|Infrared and {{ultraviolet}} watermarks – When seen in {{the near}} infrared, the banknotes will show darker areas in different zones depending on the denomination. Ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>will</b> make the EURion constellation show in sharper contrast, and also some fluorescent threads stand out.|$|E
25|$|Many synagogues <b>will</b> have <b>lights</b> on {{a special}} {{memorial}} plaque {{on one of the}} synagogue's walls, with names of synagogue members who have died. Each of these <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> be lit for individuals on their Yahrzeit, and all the <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> be lit for a Yizkor service. Some synagogues will also turn on all the lights for memorial days, such as Yom Ha'Shoah.|$|R

25|$|There may be dust {{along the}} line of sight from the GRB to Earth, both in the host galaxy and in the Milky Way. If so, the <b>light</b> <b>will</b> be {{attenuated}} and reddened and an afterglow spectrum may look very different from that modeled.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of life}} {{failure mode}} for {{fluorescent}} lamps varies depending on how they are used and their control gear type. Often the <b>light</b> <b>will</b> turn pink (see Loss of mercury), with black burns {{on the ends of}} the lamp due to sputtering of emission mix (see below). The lamp may also flicker at a noticeable rate (see Flicker problems).|$|E
25|$|A {{flash of}} light is given off {{at the center of}} the traincar just as the two {{observers}} pass each other. For the observer on board the train the front and back of the traincar are at fixed distances from the source of light and as such, according to this observer, the <b>light</b> <b>will</b> reach the front and back of the traincar at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The race {{is started}} by ten red lights in {{two rows of}} five (i.e. five columns of two), {{controlled}} by FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting. The red lights in each column operate as a pair i.e. both go on and off together. The lights illuminate one pair at a time, left to right, in one-second intervals, and then go out simultaneously after an interval of between four and seven seconds. When the lights go out, the race begins. Should the start need to be aborted for any reason, all five pairs of red <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> come on as normal, but instead of going out, the orange <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> flash. All engines are stopped and the start resumes from the five-minute point. If a single driver raises his hand to indicate that he can't start, the marshall for that row will wave a yellow flag, then after a few seconds, both the red and orange <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> extinguish and the green <b>lights</b> <b>will</b> come on to indicate another formation lap.|$|R

25|$|Circular polarizers {{can also}} be used to {{selectively}} absorb or pass right-handed or left-handed circularly polarized light. It is this feature which is utilized by the 3D glasses in stereoscopic cinemas such as RealD Cinema. A given polarizer which creates one of the two polarizations of <b>light</b> <b>will</b> pass that same polarization of light when that light is sent through it in the other direction. In contrast it will block light of the opposite polarization.|$|E
25|$|In {{a habitat}} with {{abundant}} soil nutrients but little light (as shown above), the gross photosynthesis curve will be lower and flatter, because <b>light</b> <b>will</b> be more limiting than nutrients. A plant can grow at zero investment in carnivory; {{this is also}} the optimum investment for a plant, as any investment in traps reduces net photosynthesis (growth) to less than the net photosynthesis of a plant that obtains its nutrients from soil alone.|$|E
25|$|Perception {{of color}} depends {{heavily on the}} context in which the {{perceived}} object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple <b>light</b> <b>will</b> reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.|$|E

25|$|Optical phonons are {{out-of-phase}} {{movements of}} the atoms in the lattice, one atom moving to the left, and its neighbour to the right. This occurs if the lattice basis consists {{of two or more}} atoms. They are called optical because in ionic crystals, like sodium chloride, they are excited by infrared radiation. The electric field of the <b>light</b> <b>will</b> move every positive sodium ion {{in the direction of the}} field, and every negative chloride ion in the other direction, sending the crystal vibrating.|$|E
25|$|As light {{passes the}} border between media, {{depending}} upon the relative refractive indices of the two media, the <b>light</b> <b>will</b> either be refracted to a lesser angle, or a greater one. These angles are measured {{with respect to the}} normal line, represented perpendicular to the boundary. In the case of light traveling from air into water, light would be refracted towards the normal line, because the light is slowed down in water; light traveling from water to air would refract away from the normal line.|$|E

Al-Hawsawi sent an {{accumulation}} of the harsh messages she has received on social media {{to the department of}} the interior in Saudi Arabia, and says the issue is being considered important, yet endeavors to find the abusers, the greater part of whom post secretly is requiring some serious energy. What's more, she is known for taking her lessons from Mandala, Gandhi, and others who fought with peaceful resistance, believing that only love and <b>light</b> <b>will</b> change the darkness of repression.|$|E
