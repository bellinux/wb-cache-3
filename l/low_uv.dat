25|$|Light skin is a {{naturally}} occurring human skin color, which has little eumelanin pigmentation {{and which has}} been adapted to environments of <b>low</b> <b>UV</b> radiation. Light skin is most commonly found amongst the native populations of Europe and Northeast Asia as measured through skin reflectance.

25|$|UVS is also {{demonstrated}} to serve functions in foraging, prey identification, and frugivory. Similar advantages afforded to trichromatic primates over dichromatic primates in frugivory are {{generally considered to}} exist in birds. The waxy surfaces of many fruits and berries reﬂect UV light that advertise their presence to UVS birds. Common kestrels be able to locate the trails of voles with vision; these small rodents lay scent trails of urine and feces that reﬂect UV light, making them visible to the kestrels. However, this view has been challenged by the finding of <b>low</b> <b>UV</b> sensitivity in raptors and weak UV reflection of mammal urine.|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide is {{a widely}} used {{quenching}} agent in UV/VIS spectroscopic studies of biopolymers. It is believed {{to interfere with the}} chromophore luminescence by electron capture, resonance energy transfer or through collisional deactivation. The agent itself has been presumed optically silent, due to the low magnitude of the <b>lowest</b> <b>UV</b> absorption band. We have postulated that the dynamics of the semi-rigid acrylamide, at room temperature, can provide an efficient dissipative channel of the optical energy. Consequently, by restricting the acrylamide by a glass environment in the 10 - 95 K range, we were able to record flourescence emission and excitation spectra associated with the <b>lowest</b> <b>UV</b> absorption band. This observation, corroborated by the electronic structure calculations, further supports the photon exchange as the mechanism of the acrylamide-induced quenching...|$|R

25|$|With the {{increase}} of vitamin D synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions {{that are related to}} common vitamin D deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of <b>low</b> <b>UV</b> radition: rickets, osteoporosis, numerous cancer types (including colon and breast cancer), and immune system malfunctioning. Vitamin D promotes the production of cathelicidin, which helps to defend humans' bodies against fungal, bacterial, and viral infections, including flu. When exposed to UVB, the entire exposed area of body’s skin of a relatively light skinned person is able to between 10 - 20000 IU of vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|Some populations who had diets rich in vitamin D {{were less}} {{affected}} by the evolutionary selection for light skin. Vitamin D3 is available in low quantities in fish and liver. Populations who lived in coastal areas or areas with access to abundant sources to seafood could get their proportion of vitamin D from food. Some Arctic populations, such as the Inuit, could retain some of their skin pigmentation in areas of <b>low</b> <b>UV</b> radiation. In the winter they receive high levels of UV radiation as reflection from the snow, and their relatively darker skin protects them from the sunlight.|$|E
25|$|An {{abundance}} of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports that light skin pigmentation developed {{due to the}} importance of maintaining vitamin D3 production in the skin. Dark skin pigmentation was the original condition for the genus Homo and has been maintained for populations in areas of high UV radiation through human evolutionary history. As a consequence, {{there must have been a}} strong selective pressure for the evolution of light skin in areas of <b>low</b> <b>UV</b> radiation. The evidence that dark skin evolved as a protection against the effect of UV radiation is overwhelming, and research shows that eumelanin protects against both folate depletion and direct damage to DNA. This accounts for the development of dark skin pigmentation of people living near the equator but does not account for the increasingly lighter-skinned people living outside the tropics.|$|E

40|$|Red {{leaf lettuce}} (Lollo Rosso) was grown under {{three types of}} plastic films that varied in {{transparency}} to UV radiation (designated as <b>UV</b> block, <b>UV</b> <b>low,</b> and <b>UV</b> window). Flavonoid composition was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), total phenolics by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and antioxiclant capacity by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. Exposure to increased levels of UV radiation during cultivation caused the leaves to redden and increased concentrations of total phenols and the main flavonoids, quercetin and cyanidin glycosides, as well as luteolin conjugates and phenolic acids. The total phenol content increased from 1. 6 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /g of fresh weight (FW) for lettuce grown under UV block film to 2. 9 and 3. 5 mg of GAE/g of FW for lettuce grown under the <b>UV</b> <b>low</b> and <b>UV</b> window films. The antioxiclant activity was also higher in lettuce exposed {{to higher levels of}} UV radiation with ORAC values of 25. 4 and 55. 1 mu mol of Trolox equivalents/g of FW for lettuce grown under the UV block and UV window films, respectively. The content of phenolic acids, quantified as caffeic acid, was also different, ranging from 6. 2 to 11. 1 mu mol/g of FW for lettuce cultivated under the <b>lowest</b> and highest <b>UV</b> exposure plastic films, respectively. Higher concentrations of the flavonoid glycosides were observed with increased exposure to UV radiation, as demonstrated by the concentrations of aglycones after hydrolysis, which were cyanidin (ranging from 165 to 793 mu g/g), quercetin (ranging from 196 to 880,mu g/g), and luteolin (ranging from 19 to 152 mu g/g). The results demonstrate the potential of the use of UV-transparent plastic as a means of increasing beneficial flavonoid content of red leaf lettuce when the crop is grown in polytunnels...|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that dark skin pigmentation {{was the original}} condition for the genus Homo, including Homo sapiens. However, as populations migrated away from the tropics between 125,000 and 65,000 years ago into areas of <b>low</b> <b>UV</b> radiation, they developed light skin pigmentation as an evolutionary selection acting against vitamin D depletion. Based on ancient DNA analysis conducted in 2014 on human skeletal remains from western Europe, this change from dark to light skin pigmentation likely occurred only recently {{for at least some}} Europeans. Paleogenomics researcher Carles Lalueza-Fox of the Pompeu Fabra University in Spain and his colleagues observed that a 7,000-year-old hunter-gatherer from the La Braña-Arintero labyrinthine cave in the Cantabrian Mountains possessed the allele for blue eyes but not the European mutations for lighter skin pigmentation.|$|E
25|$|One may {{reasonably}} {{maintain an}} average and acceptable temperature for the snake {{by the use}} of a heating element or infrared light bulbs. A gradient must be offered within the enclosure to allow the snake to bask in the heat or go to cooler areas in the tank. Optimum humidity can be difficult to maintain and research must be done on the snake to determine the correct level. More than 80% humidity must be maintained for caging an anaconda species from the tropical region, while a slightly less than 30% humidity must be maintained for a species of a desert region.

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} (UVR) is {{hazardous to}} patients with photosensitive skin disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, xeroderma pigmentosum and skin cancer. As such, these patients are advised to minimize their exposure to UVR. Classically, this is accomplished through careful avoidance of sun exposure and artificial tanning booths. Indoor light bulbs, however, are generally not considered to pose significant UVR hazard. We sought to test this notion by measuring the UV emissions of 19 different compact fluorescent light bulbs. The ability to induce skin damage was assessed with the CIE erythema action spectrum, ANSI S(λ) generalized UV hazard spectrum and the CIE photocarcinogenesis action spectrum. The results indicate {{that there is a}} great deal of variation amongst different bulbs, even within the same class. Although the irradiance of any given bulb is low, the possible daily exposure time is rather lengthy. This results in potential daily UVR doses ranging from 0. 1 to 625 mJ cm− 2, including a daily UVB (290 – 320 nm) dose of 0. 01 to 15 mJ cm− 2. Because patients are exposed continually over long time frames, this could lead to significant cumulative damage. It would therefore be prudent for patients to use bulbs with the <b>lowest</b> <b>UV</b> irradiance...|$|R
