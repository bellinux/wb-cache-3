6000|$|LADY MARKBY. Good evening, dear Gertrude! So {{kind of you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> my friend, Mrs. Cheveley. Two such charming {{women should}} know each other! ...|$|E
6000|$|ANDERSON. Well, {{perhaps you}} will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you the news myself. Judith: {{will you give}} Mr. Dudgeon his tea, and keep him here until I return? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him to you. He did not know until this moment you were in town. I have not seen him since we met yesterday.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he's rich enough," [...] said Jimmy; {{getting up}} and {{reaching}} for his hat. [...] "In dollars, that is. Some ways he's poor enough. Well, I must be going. Thanks ever so much for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Uncle Joe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No harm! lurking here in {{that fashion}} in the dark! You'll not make <b>me</b> believe that! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> hear what <b>brings</b> you here! The truth, mind!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, my brother," [...] said Ravonino to the youth, in {{tones of}} unusual tenderness, [...] "and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know what <b>brings</b> you here so unexpectedly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{not only}} because he's a genius that I ask you to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him here; it's because he's a human being, and he is ill and poor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, thanks most awfully," [...] {{interrupted}} Freddie. [...] "It's fearfully {{good of you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him along. I must be staggering off now. Lot {{of things}} to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Albert {{sprang up}} to help her put down the wood in her arms. [...] "I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the wood," [...] he said pleadingly, as she refused his aid.|$|E
60|$|HAROLD. And {{wherefore}} not, my king, to Normandy? Is not {{my brother}} Wulfnoth hostage there For my dead father's loyalty to thee? I pray thee, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hence and <b>bring</b> him home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anthony, call up a groom, and <b>let</b> him <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> a horse round. Gentlemen, if {{you will}} excuse me five minutes, I shall be at your service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Tom, you can," [...] replied Mr Kennedy. [...] "Light these candles, my man, {{and then}} go to the stable and see that {{everything}} there is arranged for putting up the horses. It will be pretty full to-night, Tom, and will require some management. Then, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see--ah, yes, <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> my pipe, Tom, my big meerschaum.--I'll sport that to-night in honour of you, Kate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you pardon me," [...] he said, [...] "if I {{remark that}} this {{conversation}} has no particular interest for me? Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you any further {{out of your}} way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> my Uncle Joe to dinner tomorrow," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "The poor old fellow is {{stranded}} here for Thanksgiving, and he hates hotels. May I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Martha eagerly {{interrupted}} the hesitating voice,--and it was easily interrupted! [...] "Yes, yes, gran'father. They'll {{be sure to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> home some for you. I'll be quite, quite sure to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, Hal! I {{want you}} to help me to persuade father, and if you get your temper up you'll like as not go against <b>me.</b> If he <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> go I'll <b>bring</b> you in as soon as I dare. That's a promise. I guess I know how much I'd like to have you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, go," [...] said Smith; [...] "but {{if there}} is anyone {{who is not a}} coward, <b>let</b> him <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> my big coat, {{something}} to eat and drink, and the lantern that hangs in my tent. I will meet him there in the valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, never!--let them bring scissors, and shear my {{hair like}} that of the parish fool, whom I have so richly resembled--let them bid the monastery or the grave yawn for <b>me,</b> <b>let</b> them <b>bring</b> red hot basins to sear my eyes--axe or aconite--whatever they will, but Orleans shall not break his plighted faith to my daughter, or marry another while she lives!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's a scrape! Do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> that wicked boy over {{to explain}} and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him." [...] And Jo made for the door again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ordered a}} carriage; shall I show him where it is? Perhaps you will {{let me take}} you to it? They are so stupid here. They would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> it up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age â€“ just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|R
25|$|Jojo and Sadie, {{who have}} reconciled, {{put on a}} rooftop concert, with Prudence {{as a member of}} their band ("Don't <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Down"). Max <b>brings</b> Jude to the rooftop, but the police arrive to break up the concert, while Lucy nearly joins, but can't bring herself to face Jude again. Jude manages to remain on the roof and begins to sing ("All You Need Is Love"). The police allow the band to {{accompany}} him, while Lucy tries {{to get back to the}} building, but is blocked by the police. Max draws Jude's attention to an opposite rooftop where Lucy is standing and looking at him. Lucy and Jude gaze smilingly at each other across opposite rooftops as the performance concludes ("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds").|$|R
6000|$|... "She is too old, Sampson, I {{know she}} is," [...] says Mr. Warrington, with much majesty; [...] "but she has my word, and you see, sir, how fond she is of <b>me.</b> Go <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> the letters, sir, which you found, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> try and forgive {{you for having}} seized upon them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To {{be seen by}} you--it {{comes to}} the same thing. She's really worth seeing; you must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> her; you'll find her very suggestive. That idea that you should paint her--she appears to {{consider}} it a sort of bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{the valet}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a bath in five minutes," [...] I ordered, {{springing}} out of bed, [...] "and <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> some tea. Look sharp!" ...|$|R

[To COLONEL LAWLEY.] Will you <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> the mallets? Yes, I am afraid he is a faddist. We have done our best for him, but {{he ought to be}} more with men.|$|R
6000|$|Calib. I pr'ythee <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> thee where crabs grow; and I, with my long nails, will dig thee pig-nuts, shew thee a jay's nest, and {{instruct}} thee how to snare the marmozet: I'll bring thee to clustered filberts. Wilt thou go with me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is lying!" [...] Lenora insisted. [...] "I {{tell you}} there's another {{creature}} there, something we don't understand. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the Electro-thought transference apparatus; let us read his mind. If I am wrong, I {{will go down}} on my knees and beg for forgiveness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see,' {{said the}} young man,'the Marshal's family {{living in the}} country at present, the Marshal has given Miss Dorrit one of the rooms in his house to use when she likes. Don't you think you had better come up there, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Miss Dorrit?' ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. [Passionately.] If he {{was going}} to leave me like that why didn't he <b>let</b> <b>me</b> stay with my Chinese mother? Why did he <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> up like a lady? Oh, it was cruel.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take {{the child}} {{out into the}} wood, and never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see her face again. You must kill her, and <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> back her lungs and liver, that I may know for certain she is dead.' ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{went and}} came. [...] "He bade <b>me</b> <b>let</b> all know {{he gives his}} name [...] "At the sword point, and bade <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him one [...] "Who had a like vow from our triple dun." ...|$|R
