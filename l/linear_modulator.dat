40|$|Linearization of {{integrated}} optic intensity modulators significantly reduces the two-tone intermodulation distortion. The resulting intermodulation distortion produced by these modulators then varies as the input {{power to the}} fifth-order link system, the overall intermodulation product {{is a combination of}} third-order and higher-order terms. The authors determine the dynamic range of a cascaded microwave network consisting of a preamplifier, a high-dynamic-range fiber-optic link with a highly <b>linear</b> <b>modulator,</b> and a postamplifier. An expression is found that relates the intermodulation power at the output to the relative suppression from the signal level. As an example, a hypothetical 10 -GHz low-distortion fiber-optic link that has a dynamic range of 125 dB in a bandwidth of 1 Hz is cascaded with various preamplifiers, and it is shown that the dynamic range of the system is reduced by as much as 20 dB, depending on the third-order intercept of the amplifier...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{transmission}} of an improper-complex second-order stationary data sequence is considered over a strictly band-limited frequency-selective channel. It is assumed that the transmitter employs linear modulation and that the channel output is corrupted by additive proper-complex cyclostationary noise. Under the average transmit power constraint, the problem of minimizing the mean-squared error at the output of a widely linear receiver is formulated in the time domain to find the optimal transmit and receive waveforms. The optimization problem is converted into a frequency-domain problem by using the vectorized Fourier transform technique and put into {{the form of a}} double minimization. First, the widely linear receiver is optimized that requires, unlike the linear receiver design with only one waveform, the design of two receive waveforms. Then, the optimal transmit waveform for the <b>linear</b> <b>modulator</b> is derived by introducing the notion of the impropriety frequency function of a discrete-time random process and by performing a line search combined with an iterative algorithm.

During readout, the page composer is bypassed and a readout light beam is focussed directly upon the recording medium containing an array of previously recorded digital spots, a sync bit, data positioning bits, and a tracking band.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A new model of an instantaneously adaptive delta modulator called hero a "CONSTANT FACTOR DELTA MODULATOR", (abbreviated C. F. D. M.) has been developed and the selection of suitable constant factors (adaptation constants) with its adaptation logic has been described. The basic delta modulator has been adapted to give an improved performance by introducing a small memory and prediction method in the feedback loop thereby enabling the coder {{to adapt to the}} instantaneous variations in the analogue input signal. This C. F. D. M. model of adaptive system adapts its step size, at every sampling instant r, {{as a result of the}} detection of the four possible binary groups formed from the last three binary values transmitted. The adaptation constant which is the ratio of-the present step size mr, to the previous step size mr-l, can have, at any sampling instant, one of four values with a magnitude of Ai; A 2, A 3 and A 4, corresponding to the four different possible groups formed. The polarity of the present step size is the same as the present binary value Lr. The effect of this C. F. D. M. system is that for a given decoded signal to noise ratio, the necessary bandwidth of the transmission channel is reduced. The C. F. D. M. described here gives an improved overall coding characteristic and removes an objectionable hunting characteristic compared to the one-bit memory adaptive DM by JAYANT(13). It offers wider dynamic range for the bandlimited Gaussian Input. The results are compared with other similar schemes on adaptive delta modulators and computer plotted graphs are presented whenever necessary. From these results and responses, the C. F. D.

The linearization {{of the response}} function of the optical directional coupler modulator uses variable coupling {{along the length of}} the device, and the coupling function can be synthesized for a desired response function. This synthesis gives rise to coupling functions which have negative coupling regions realized by placing a phase shift in one of the arms of the coupler, and the reversion to the positive coupling requires a second phase shift in one or other arm of the coupler. A <b>linear</b> response <b>modulator</b> was previously designed and fabricated, but obtained large switching voltages, and an alternative trapezoidal response was chosen. A second design using a uniform coupling directional coupler with four ð phase shifts to obtain a linear response was considered. These two linear designs have been investigated, the trapezoidal response's design was synthesized by the Fourier transform technique and the design was refined using the Newton's method. The phase shift design was achieved by four phase shift points, which were chosen very carefully for linear response. The small signal calculations for the second and third order intermediate distortions (IMD 2 and IMD 3) show Spur Free Dynamic Ranges (SFDR) of the better than 120 dB/Hz 2 / 3 for the IMD 3 for both designs, and the IMD 2 of the order of 105 dB/Hz 1 / 2 for the trapezoidal response and better than 120 dB/Hz 1 / 2 for the phase shift design. The switching voltage-length product of the trapezoidal response is lower than the phase shift design. Since the electrical phase velocity in III-V semiconductor coplanar strip electrode structures is higher than the optical phase velocity, a slow-wave electrode structure is required for velocity-matching, and the T-rail shunt capacitive and series inductive loaded coplanar strip was chosen. These optical directional modulator designs have been fabricated and tested. The intensity responses are different from the design because of fabrication problems including uneven waveguide etching along the device. The linearity measurement was not performed because of the weak optical output from the modulator due to high insertion loss of the modulator. The velocity matched designs cover up to 20 GHz and is limited by the measurement equipment...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the significant gain in capacity provided by multiple antennas over fading channels, tremendous research and development efforts in academia and industry have been invested to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology. However, difficulties still exist in the design of flexible MIMO transmission schemes. The overall goal of our study is to develop efficient turbo MIMO transceivers that are capacity-achieving and yet with reasonable complexity. First, we study the design of serially concatenated MIMO transmitters. For simpler design and flexible rate-versus-performance tradeoff, conventional encoders are used before a <b>linear</b> space-time <b>modulator.</b> A joint iterative receiver based on the turbo principle is assumed that precludes the use of Tarokh's design criteria for such a concatenated system. Extending the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts to MIMO systems, design criteria that concern both the data rate and error performance are developed for the inner space-time (ST) modulator. Based on the new design criteria, an optimal space-time linear dispersion modulation scheme is presented. In addition, the tradeoff between constellation size and symbol rate for a given data rate is discussed. Simulation results are provided to verify the new design criteria and to demonstrate the merits of the proposed coded space-time modulation. For such a turbo MIMO transmitter, the abundance of highly developed outer decoders allows us to focus on the study on the inner multi-user detection (MUD). To start, a new parallel interference cancellation (PIC) MUD scheme is proposed. This detector {{can be used as a}} stand-alone multi-user detector in a non-iterative MIMO receiver. The new scheme employs a novel nonlinear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator as the soft decision device. The nonlinear estimator exploits the knowledge of symbol alphabet for refined estimates with smaller mean square error (MSE). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector significantly outperforms the conventional detectors with comparable complexity. The nonlinear MMSE estimator is further extended to develop the soft-output MUD for iterative turbo MIMO receivers. The nonlinear estimation makes use of a priori information from the outer decoder and preliminary estimates gleaned from channel observation as well. With the new nonlinear MMSE estimator, a generalized SIC-MMSE scheme is proposed. Depending on the methods for generating preliminary estimates, two generalized SIC-MMSE detectors are proposed: a 2 -staged SIC-MMSE and a recursive SIC-MMSE detectors. Analytical study and simulations are carried out to demonstrate the merits of the two proposed detectors. Last, tradeoffs among the components of the transmitter that affect error performance at the receiver are discussed to provide design guidelines for practic...|$|R
