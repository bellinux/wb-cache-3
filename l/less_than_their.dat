5|$|After an {{impressive}} underdog triumph {{in making the}} playoffs in 2010, and Joe Sacco finishing third in Jack Adams Trophy voting, the Avs failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in 2011. Earning only 68 points in the standings, setting a franchise record for losing and winless streaks after the All-Star break, the Avalanche have seen their worst season yet since moving to Denver. One point <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> previous worst season in 2008–09. They finished 29th in the 30-team NHL, besting only their division mates, the Edmonton Oilers. Matt Duchene set a franchise record as the youngest scoring leader in Quebec/Colorado history with 67 points, sharing the club goals-leader title with David Jones, each with 27 tallies. Former Avs great Peter Forsberg attempted a comeback in the NHL with Colorado mid-season. After two games, zero points and compiling a plus-minus rating of –4, however, Forsberg announced his retirement from professional hockey. Captain Adam Foote also retired after the final game of the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} month, {{the actual number}} of {{passengers}} was 125,971, compared to the predicted annual total of around 650,000 return journeys, i.e. 1.3m single journeys. By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers had been carried on the line with weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons had been carried since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% by reference to the predicted patronage. Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while Galashiels had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567. However, Eskbank, Gorebridge and Shawfair recorded <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> predicted usage. In September 2016, it was announced that one million passengers had been carried on the reopened line.|$|E

In terms of picking or screening stocks, he recommended purchasing firms who have steady profits, are trading at low prices to book value, have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, and who have relatively low debt.|$|E
