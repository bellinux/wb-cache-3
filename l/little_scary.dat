500|$|Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "a breathless new biography" [...] by Herbert. In a review in the Herald Sun, Blanche Clark was critical and said, [...] "Herbert's loose timeline is irritating, as is some of her glib commentary, such as: 'When her parents took her out to restaurants, she would use the breadsticks as drum batons—music was clearly in the blood.'" [...] St. Petersburg Times book critic Colette Bancroft said of the images in the book, [...] "I can tell you lots of the photos are fun, although a few are a <b>little</b> <b>scary,</b> {{like the one in}} which she looks like a space alien awaiting a gynecological exam." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahone {{is often}} {{referred}} to by critics as Michael's nemesis. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found Mahone to be [...] "a far more worthy adversary for Michael than prison guard Brad Bellick... who's still after the convicts but seems like a cartoon compared to the Inspector Javert-like Mahone." [...] Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that [...] "William Fichtner {{is going to be the}} best actor on any show this season. He's brooding, sexy, enigmatic and a <b>little</b> <b>scary</b> as the FBI man waiting for the clan to cross state lines and make this a federal case. Add in the reliance on those pills he's hiding in that pen and I think I smell Emmy!" [...] Brian Zoromski of IGN believes that the [...] "strongest portions of 'Manhunt' deal with the introduction of a new character, an FBI agent named Alexander Mahone, played by the great character actor William Fichtner." ...|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{although}} the series focused heavily on alien abduction lore, {{the decision was}} made early on to allow the plots of individual episodes to branch out into different territories in order to prevent the overarching plot from running out of momentum, which led to standalone episodes such as [...] "Squeeze" [...] being developed. The variety of storylines which the series has shown has led director Daniel Sackheim to note that [...] "The X-Files has sort of found its own style in that it doesn't have a confined style to it", adding that the series' [...] "fluid" [...] approach has meant that [...] "everybody who comes on the show attempt to make a <b>little</b> <b>scary</b> movie". To this end, several episodes feature varying plots, with alien-influenced storylines varying between [...] "Ice", a [...] "briskly-paced" [...] episode set in a single location, and the character-driven [...] "Conduit", which served to fill in background on the characters. Elsewhere, plots focused on soul transference or reincarnation, with the episodes [...] "Shadows", [...] "Born Again" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] sharing similar storylines. The [...] "tired" [...] plot of [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] featured a malevolent artificial intelligence; while [...] "Shapes" [...] introduced the first of what would become several Native American-themed episodes.|$|E

5000|$|Jinny Gudmundsen of USA Today {{gave the}} game a 4 ½ stars out of five, saying [...] "best for teens 13 and up because it's a <b>little</b> <b>scarier,</b> its puzzles are harder, and its themes of witchcraft, lycanthropy, and alchemy {{make it more}} {{appropriate}} for an older audience". Lonnie Brown of The Ledger also gave the game a positive review, saying [...] "The graphics are well done, and the music and characters fit the mood" [...] and called the [...] "second chance" [...] button a [...] "very nice feature".|$|R

[...] It was an exuberant feeling, but also a <b>little</b> <b>scary.</b> [...] At times I was troubled by fears that I wasn't doing things the right way, that I would have regrets, or that someone else had performed a certain procedure successfully but had never bothered to write it up for the medical journals, or if they had I couldn't find it. [...] Koop helped rectify this by publishing his own findings and results. [...] Additionally, he became the first editor of the Journal of Pediatric Surgery when it was founded in 1966.|$|E

2500|$|The film's first trailer was {{released}} during the 2013 Super Bowl on February 3. Among the six film trailers that launched at the event, Fast & Furious 6 generated widespread attention on social media, {{more than the}} other films (including Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness) combined according to data collection agency Fizziology. The extended version of the trailer had been viewed over 16 million times by February 17. The trailer's success was partially attributed to the film's stars promoting the trailer on their personal social networks. [...] The Fast and the Furious series marketing attempted to cultivate an online fan base which was also considered to have helped promote the film; the filmmakers responded to fan interaction, conducted an online poll to decide the title of Fast & Furious 6, brought back the character of Letty Ortiz based on fan feedback and encouraged fans to document the film's production with unofficial photos. Universal marketing co-president Michael Moses said: [...] "We’re trying to remove the studio filter as much as possible, which is a <b>little</b> <b>scary</b> because you’re ceding control... But it makes for more authentic and organic interaction with fans." [...] The Super Bowl trailer, titled [...] "Breathe", won two Golden Trailer Awards for Best Action TV Spot and Best Summer Blockbuster 2013 TV Spot, and the marketing campaign received a further three nominations: Summer 2013 Blockbuster Trailer and Best Sound Editing for the [...] "Trailer" [...] trailer, and Best Teaser Poster. A 15-piece clothing line was also produced in partnership with Guess, including T-shirts, jackets, caps and watches.|$|E

It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls.... It is a little sad, a <b>little</b> <b>scary,</b> a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.|$|E
