Wylbur maintains a current <b>line</b> <b>pointer</b> for each temporary data set. The user may specify an explicit working data set on a command; if he omits it, then the default temporary data set is used as the working data set.|$|E

50|$|The work is {{also known}} as the Bahman Yasht and Zand-i wahman yasht. These titles are {{scholastic}} mistakes, in the former case due to 18th century Anquetil Du Perron, and the latter due to 19th century Edward William West. The text is neither a Yasht, nor is it in any way related to the Avesta's (lost) Bahman Yasht (see note below). Chapter and <b>line</b> <b>pointers</b> to the Zand-i Wahman Yasn are conventionally abbreviated ZWY, and follow the subdivisions defined in the 1957 Anklesaria translation. These subdivisions differ from those used in earlier translations.|$|R
50|$|The {{order of}} {{execution}} of Commodore BASIC lines was not determined by line numbering; instead, it followed {{the order in}} which the lines were linked in memory. Program lines were stored in memory as a singly linked list with a <b>line</b> number, a <b>pointer</b> (containing the address of the beginning of the next program line), and then the tokenized code for the line. While a program was being entered, BASIC would constantly reorder program lines in memory so that the <b>line</b> numbers and <b>pointers</b> were all in ascending order. However, after a program was entered, manually altering the <b>line</b> numbers and <b>pointers</b> with the POKE commands could allow for out-of-order execution or even give each line the same line number. In the early days, when BASIC was used commercially, this was a software protection technique to discourage casual modification of the program.|$|R
40|$|The data {{structure}} used ot maintain {{the sequence of}} characters {{is an important part}} of a text editor. This paper investigates and evaluates the range of possible {{data structure}}s for text sequences. The ADT interface to the text sequence component of a text editor is examined. Six common sequence data structures (array, gap, list, <b>line</b> <b>pointers,</b> fixed size buffers and piece tables) are examined and then a general model of sequence data structures that encompasses all six structures is presented. The piece table method is explained in detail and its advantages are presented. The design space of sequence data structures is examined and several variations on the ones listed above are presented. These sequence data structures are compared experimentally and evaluated based on a number of criteria. The experimental comparison is done by implementing each data structure in an editing simulator and testing it using a synthetic load of many thousands of edits. We also report on experiments on t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Multichannel and {{high-throughput}} fluorescence measuring systems {{provide a}} great advantage in {{speeding up the}} batch analysis from several-fold to hundred-fold, and would be practically significant in application areas such as hygiene analysis, environmental analysis, food analysis, pharmaceutical analysis, biochemical and clinical analysis. Herein we report the design and fabrication of a novel high-throughput and portable fluorescence device. A <b>line</b> laser <b>pointer</b> {{was used as the}} light source, so as to avoid the drawbacks and limitations of conventional complicated optical setup which need professional and exact adjustment. The as-constructed device is simple, portable, low-cost and multichannel. It takes less than 10 min to collect and process data for a 96 microplate-batch analysis of solution samples, by combining use of lab-made software, Chem-Image-Processor (CIP). Its sensitivity was evaluated with Rhodamine B and the limit of detection (LOD) was (2. 80 +/- 0. 15) nmol/L. The new system was further validated by the detection of Hg 2 + in aqueous solution and a LOD of 7. 7 mu g/L was obtained. The standard addition recovery of Hg 2 + in tap water samples was 99. 9 %- 102. 4 % and the RSD was 1. 5 %- 2. 6 %. The standard addition recovery of Hg 2 + in pond water samples was 96. 2 %- 98. 9 % and the RSD was 1. 6 %- 2. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Weak {{measurement}} enables faithful amplification {{and high}} precision measurement of small physical parameters and is under intensive investigation {{as an effective}} tool in metrology and for addressing foundational questions in quantum mechanics. Most of the experimental reports on weak measurements till date have employed external symmetric Gaussian pointers. Here, we demonstrate its universal nature in a system involving asymmetric spectral response of Fano resonance as the pointer arising naturally in precisely designed metamaterials, namely, waveguided plasmonic crystals. The weak coupling arises due to a tiny shift in the asymmetric spectral response between two orthogonal linear polarizations. By choosing the pre- and post-selected polarization states to be nearly mutually orthogonal, we observe both real and imaginary weak value amplifications manifested as spectacular shift of the peak frequency of Fano resonance and narrowing (or broadening) of the resonance line width, respectively. Weak value amplification using asymmetric Fano spectral response broadens the domain of applicability of weak measurements using natural spectral <b>line</b> shapes as <b>pointer</b> in wide range of physical systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition, {{digital image processing}} and recognition technologies become a popular research direction, especially, the using of it is quite extensive in power industry. Among various using, dashboard automatic reading {{is an important part}} of routing inspection of substation system by using robot. Automatic reading of SF 6 pressure gauge pointer is based on image processing and automatic reading techniques, avoiding the influence of subjective factors of naked eye judgment. Designing and analyzing of identification algorithm ofSF 6 meter pointer are shown in this paper. First, pre-processing operations were operated on the instrument image by using gray level transformation equalization and binarization to improve image quality, by using Hough line detection to realize <b>pointer</b> <b>line</b> extraction; determining the number by using the straight-line in mathematics. This traditional method of using morphological and Hough line detection method to determine reading have certain bias, so the using of Hough circle detection methods and centroid detection methods were proposed. The results showed that the improved method has greatly improved the accuracy of the readings, the method has better accuracy than traditional standard line Hough detection method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} model check a {{software}} component {{which is not}} a standalone program, we need a model of the software which completes the program. This is typically done by abstracting the surrounding software and the environment in which the entire system will be executed. However, abstracting the surrounding software artifact is difficult when the surrounding software is a large, complex artifact. In this paper, we take a new approach to the problem by abstracting the software component under test and leaving the surrounding software concrete. We compare three abstraction schemes, bitstate hashing and two schemes based on predicate abstraction, which can be used to abstract the components. We show how to generate the mixed abstract-concrete model automatically from a C program and verify the model using the SPIN model checker. We give verification results for three C programs each consisting of hundreds or thousands of <b>lines</b> of code, <b>pointers,</b> data structures and calls to library functions. Compared to the predicate abstraction schemes, bitstate hashing was uniformly more efficient in both error discovery and exhaustive state enumeration. The component abstraction results in faster error discovery than normal code execution when pruning during state enumeration avoids repeated execution of instructions on the same data. ...|$|R
40|$|What's New V 3. 72 and V 3. 71 fix a few bugs. V 3. 70 adds {{numerous}} major {{features to}} A 86. Let's cover the INCOMPATIBILITIES first, {{so you will}} know where to tweak your existing code: * Error messages in A 86 now have a slightly different format (on their own <b>line</b> with a <b>pointer</b> to the error location). If you have any source code lying around with old-format error messages, {{get rid of the}} messages before reassembling with this new version [...] this version cannot handle them. * I have changed the L switch to the G (code Generation) switch to prepare for L becoming a Listing-control switch. I have also changed the X switch to +G 16, to prepare for X becoming the XRF control switch. If you have any batch files or A 86 environment-flag settings with +L or +X in them, change them to +G for this new version. * The DATA SEGMENT now has a default ORG value of END; that is, it starts {{at the end of your}} program, unless you have an ORG otherwise. V 3. 20 [...] V 3. 22 of A 86 outlawed ORGless DATA segments, in anticipation of this feature. Versions before that had a default ORG of 0 [...] if you have source code written for a pre-V 3. 20 version of A 86, make sure you put ORG 0 at the start of the first DATA SEGMENT if it was ORG-less. Other new features include an INCLUDE directive (Chapter 9), a listing facility (Chapters 3 and 13), END operand value (Chapter 9), pulling XREF and EXMAC functions into the assembler (Chapter 13), operand to EVEN (Chapter 9), the removal of the limit on the length of a source file, the removal of most restrictions on forward-references within expressions, the ability to ORG in the DATA segment and structures to a forward-reference value, the REF and DEF operators (Chapter 9), the K numeric base (Chapter 10), numeric operands to STOSx and MOVSx (Chapter 5), and macros in an A 86 LIB library (Chapter 13). How to Get Everything The packages consist of many files, packed tightly into a few files with the ZIP extension. I have provided the batch files INSTALLA. BAT and INSTALLB. BAT, that create a subdirectory called A 86 on your C drive, and unpack everything except AFIX to that subdirectory. You can just type either A:INSTALLA or B:INSTALLB (depending on whether the diskette is in drive A or B) to the DOS prompt. AFIX is a conversion toolkit for certain old PC-Magazine source files. The command A:PCUNZIP A:AFIX*. ZIP will unpack AFIX from diskette drive A to the current drive and directory. âCD Content with book # E 8434 - E 8443. This diskette contains new releases for the A 86 assembler and D 86 debugger. Everything except the files REG_ONLY. ZIP and A 386 BETA. ZIP (if you have them) can be copied and distributed. Please upload the other ZIP files to bulletin boards, and give them to user groups, computer departments in schools, and anyone else you think might be interested in an assembler or a debugger package for the IBM-PC. REG_ONLY. ZIP is the file containing materials available only to registered users. A 386 BETA. ZIP is a file, available only on the A 86 +D 86 registered disk, containing preliminary test versions of A 386 and D 386. If you see one or both of these files on your registered disk, they are for your use only. You may NOT distribute them. Please support my products by honoring this restriction. You need to read the manuals to use these programs [...] they're just too complex to be self-explanatory. Chapter 2 of each manual takes you through a trial demonstration...|$|R
