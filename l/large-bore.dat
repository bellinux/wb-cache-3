5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or <b>large-bore</b> tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
25|$|Pre-hospital {{care for}} lung {{barotrauma}} includes basic life support of maintaining adequate oxygenation and perfusion, assessment of airway, breathing and circulation, neurological assessment, and managing any immediate life-threatening conditions. High-flow oxygen up to 100% is considered appropriate for diving accidents. <b>Large-bore</b> venous access with isotonic fluid infusion is recommended to maintain {{blood pressure and}} pulse.|$|E
25|$|In 18861889 Alekseyev {{sponsored}} detailed {{feasibility study}} of various sewage system layout. The modular plan, adopted in 1889, divided the city into practically independent parts (central and peripheral), making a provision for subsequent {{expansion of the}} city. The project was delayed by budget constraints; in 1892 the city raised money through a 49-year loan. The first 37 versts of <b>large-bore</b> sewage pipes were operational in 1894, half a year since Alekseyev's death; {{by the end of}} 1895 half of the system was complete and the city laid out its first sewage treatment facility.|$|E
25|$|For the {{manufacturing}} of the on-board power plant, a contract was {{signed with the}} German MAN Diesel company based in Augsburg. The contract, worth over €100 million, includes the supply of 24 <b>large-bore</b> diesel engines, along with electro-mechanical equipment to be installed on four powerships with a total output of 400 MW. Twenty one of them are of type 18V51/60DF dual-fuel diesel engines {{and the three of}} type 14V48/60 heavy fuel oil engines. The dual-fuel diesel engines allow the powership to generate electricity running either on heavy fuel or natural gas, whatever the infrastructure is available at site.|$|E
25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic, {{including}} the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce {{is different from that}} of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce <b>large-bore</b> models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} are {{that because it}} empties near the heart, medications can also be quickly distributed {{to the rest of}} the body. As there is room for multiple parallel compartments (lumen) within the catheter, so that multiple medications can be delivered at once even if they would not be chemically compatible within a single tube. Caregivers can also measure central venous pressure and other physiological variables through the line. It is commonly believed that fluid can be pushed faster through a central venous catheter but as they are often divided into multiple lumens then the internal diameter is less than that of a <b>large-bore</b> peripheral cannula. They are also longer, which as reflected in Poiseuille's law, requires higher pressure to achieve the same flow, all other variables being equal.|$|E
500|$|The easiest {{method to}} perform this {{technique}} is the needle cricothyrotomy (also {{referred to as a}} percutaneous dilational cricothyrotomy), in which a <b>large-bore</b> (12–14 gauge) intravenous catheter is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane. Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet insufflation. However, while needle cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, {{this technique is}} only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established. While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation, the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide (ventilation). After one hour of apneic oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy, one can expect a PaCO2 of greater than 250mm Hg and an arterial pH of less than 6.72, despite an oxygen saturation of 98% or greater. A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which a [...] endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision.|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 a.m., {{approximately}} [...] from Franklin, the Commodore Perry {{came under}} fire from the Confederate forces along the river and atop the bluffs. As the Perry {{was too close to}} bring her <b>large-bore</b> guns to bear, Commander Flusser ordered his sailors to shelter themselves as best they could while the ship tried to steam past the enemy. Unfortunately, due to the narrowness of the bend, the Commodore Perry ran aground; Lt. Ruffin and his men were so close to the grounded riverboat, they later claimed to have heard the Perrys officers cursing her enlisted sailors. [...] Freeing herself, the Perry rounded the bend and maneuvered to provide suppressive fire to allow the Hunchback and Whitehead to follow; the combined shelling of all three ships forced Lt. Ruffin and his detachment to withdraw from the banks of the river. [...] However, all three ships' progress was soon halted by a barricade in the river. While the barricade was removable with Commander Flusser's available manpower, he could not attempt to do so due to the [...] "terrible fire to which [...] were exposed." [...] While continuing to assault the Confederacy with their [...] "IX-inch grape and shell" [...] guns, [...] "32-pounder" [...] guns, field gun, and muskets, the three ships waited at the barricade hoping to hear the gunfire of General Dix's infantry forces.|$|E

2500|$|MAN Diesel SE is a European {{manufacturer}} of <b>large-bore</b> diesel engines for marine propulsion systems and power plant applications. [...] MAN Diesel employs over 7,700 staff, primarily in Germany, Denmark, France, the Czech Republic, India and China. The global after-sales organisation, MAN Diesel PrimeServ, comprises {{a network of}} the company’s own service centers, supported by authorized partners.|$|E
2500|$|Sharps rifles are {{a series}} of <b>large-bore</b> single-shot rifles, {{beginning}} with a design by Christian Sharps in 1848, and ceasing production in 1881. They are renowned for long-range accuracy. [...] By 1874 the rifle was available in a variety of calibers and had been adopted by the armies of a number of nations {{and was one of the}} few designs to successfully transition to metallic cartridge use.|$|E
2500|$|One {{variety is}} the short model {{traditional}} cornet, {{also known as}} a [...] "Shepherd's Crook" [...] shaped model. These are most often <b>large–bore</b> instruments with a rich mellow sound. There is also a long-model cornet, usually with a smaller bore and a brighter sound, which is closer to a trumpet in appearance. The Shepherd's Crook model is preferred by cornet traditionalists. The long-model cornet is generally used in concert bands in the United States, but has found little following in British-style brass and concert bands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate deep final repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or <b>large-bore</b> tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Channel Tunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft [...] to [...] below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to achieving a lethal concentration without releasing from cylinders was the [...] "gas projector", essentially a <b>large-bore</b> mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H. Livens in 1917) {{was a simple}} device; an [...] diameter tube sunk into the ground at an angle, a propellant was ignited by an electrical signal, firing the cylinder containing 30 or 40lb (14 or 18kg) of gas up to 1,900 meters. By arranging a battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at Arras on 4 April 1917. On 31 March 1918 the British conducted their largest ever [...] "gas shoot", firing 3,728 cylinders at Lens.|$|E
2500|$|Sharps made {{sporting}} versions {{from the}} late 1840s until the late 1880s. After the American Civil War, converted Army surplus rifles were made into custom firearms, and the Sharps factory produced Models 1869 and 1874 in large numbers for commercial buffalo hunters and frontiersmen. These <b>large-bore</b> rifles were manufactured {{with some of the}} most powerful black powder cartridges ever made. Sharps also fabricated special long-range target versions for the then-popular Creedmore style of [...] target shooting. Many modern black powder cartridge silhouette shooters use original and replica Sharps rifles to target metallic silhouettes cut in the shapes of animals at ranges up to 500 meters. Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company, and C Sharps Arms of Big Timber, Montana, have been manufacturing reproductions of the Sharps Rifle since 1983 and 1979, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Current {{repository}} closure plans require backfilling {{of waste}} disposal rooms, tunnels and shafts with rubble from initial excavation and sealing openings at the surface, but [...] {{do not require}} complete or perpetual isolation of radioactive waste from the human environment. Current policy relinquishes control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repositiory closure. Existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined, meaning {{there is not much}} evidence they are accurate. DOE guidelines contain no requirements for permanent offsite or onsite monitoring after closure. This may seem imprudent considering repositories will contain {{millions of dollars worth of}} spent reactor fuel which might be reprocessed and used again either in reactors generating electricity, in weapons applications, or possibly in terrorist activities. Technology for permanently sealing <b>large-bore</b> hole walls against water infiltration or fracture does not currently exist. Previous experiences sealing mine tunnels and shafts have not been entirely successful, especially where there is any hydraulic pressure from groundwater infiltration into disturbed underground geologic structures. Historical attempts to seal smaller bore holes created during exploration for oil, gas and water are notorious for their high failure rates, often in periods less than 50 years.|$|E
2500|$|The Redhawk was {{the first}} <b>large-bore</b> {{double-action}} revolver made by Ruger. It was designed by Harry Sefried, who previously worked for High Standard Manufacturing Company, where he designed the High Standard Sentinel revolver. [...] The grip profile of the Sentinel was used on the [...] "Six" [...] line of Ruger [...]357 double-action revolvers, which included the Ruger Security-Six and its variants, the Service-Six and Speed-Six. [...] These revolvers were produced from 1970 to 1988, and were unlike other double-action revolvers in that they used a one-piece frame, rather than a removable sideplate, which lent them superior strength. [...] The Redhawk, introduced in 1980, was a scaled-up and improved version of the Security-Six, the target model, with a square butt grip, adjustable sights, and 5.5- and 7.5-inch barrel lengths. [...] The Redhawk was available in blued or stainless steel, and was primarily used by handgun hunters. [...] The Redhawk, designed for long-term use with the heaviest [...]44 Magnum loads, included a new latch at the crane, to firmly lock the cylinder at front and rear, a feature last seen in the Smith & Wesson's triple lock design, discontinued in 1915.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{specimens}} submitted for surgical pathology analysis: biopsies and surgical resections. [...] A biopsy is {{a small piece of}} tissue removed primarily for surgical pathology analysis, most often in order to render a definitive diagnosis. Types of biopsies include core biopsies, which are obtained through the use of <b>large-bore</b> needles, sometimes under the guidance of radiological techniques such as ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging. [...] Incisional biopsies are obtained through diagnostic surgical procedures that remove part of a suspicious lesion, whereas excisional biopsies remove the entire lesion, and are similar to therapeutic surgical resections. Excisional biopsies of skin lesions and gastrointestinal polyps are very common. The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of cancer, as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. Surgical resection specimens are obtained by the therapeutic surgical removal of an entire diseased area or organ (and occasionally multiple organs). These procedures are often intended as definitive surgical treatment of a disease in which the diagnosis is already known or strongly suspected, but pathological analysis of these specimens remains important in confirming the previous diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|While the brass-only {{configuration}} {{has been}} unvarying since 1934, the instrumentation has {{been subject to}} experimentation over the years. Around 1938, slide trombones {{were removed from the}} band for fear they could not easily navigate the difficult Script Ohio drill. Trombones were originally replaced by tenor horns, and then eventually by the King 3B valve trombone - a valve trombone wrapped as a Euphonium - earning the name [...] "Trombonium." [...] By 1970, the band adopted the <b>large-bore</b> Conn 90G, prepared by Conn at the OSUMB's instigation. Slide trombones returned to the band in 1980, with the introduction of Bach Model 36 Stradivarius small shank tenor trombones. Tromboniums last marched in the varsity OSUMB block at the 1982 Alumni Reunion game, but continue to be used by Alumni members of the band. In 1997, the band converted the alto voice of the band from Eb Alto horns, to F Mellophones. Several factors including instrument quality and durability, as well as tone projection, were cited in the switch. The last Eb Alto horns purchased by the OSUMB were Yamaha YAH-203's. The band switched to Getzen G4410 F Mellophones, and continued to use those until 2000, when Getzen discontinued that instrument. The band switched to King 1120SP F Mellophones, and slowly phased these, along with the King 1121SP, which is the newest version of King Mellophone, through 2006. All Getzen Mellophones are now used by Alumni Band or the OSU Athletic Band. In 1999, Dr. Jon Woods, a trombone player himself, added Bass Trombones to the trombone section. This was done in an effort to round out the trombone choir, and to give a bit of an edge to Sousaphone parts in climactic music. The first model, and to date, only model of Bass Trombone used by the OSUMB is the Conn 110H. In 2008, the band received a generous donation which allowed the entire high brass section (Eb Cornets, Trumpets, and Flugelhorns) to be outfitted with new Yamaha Xeno model instruments. These horns greatly influenced the sound of the band, as previous models of trumpets and flugelhorns were student level models, which typically are not constructed with the same quality as professional model instruments, such as the Xeno line. In 2013, the band has begun a switch from King 2104SP tenor trombones to a special order Conn 8HY model.|$|E

60|$|I squatted {{behind the}} {{skeleton}} of an elephant which happened to be handy and well covered with moss and ferns and watched the beast, fascinated, wishing that I had a <b>large-bore</b> rifle in my hand.

60|$|Without {{waiting for}} a reply, my {{companion}} threw himself on his breast, and began to creep over the plain like a snake in the grass. He did this so well and so patiently that he reached to within forty yards of the bull without being discovered. Then he ceased to advance, and I saw his head and shoulders slowly emerge from among the grass, and presently his rifle appeared, and was slowly levelled. It {{was one of our}} <b>large-bore</b> single-barrelled rifles.|$|E
60|$|We endeavoured {{to dissuade}} Jack from going out alone, {{but he said}} truly that his load {{distributed}} among us all was quite sufficient, without adding to it by taking away {{another member of the}} party. Thus we parted; but I felt a strange feeling of depression, a kind of foreboding of evil, which I could not shake off, despite my utmost efforts. Peterkin, too, was unusually silent, and I could not avoid seeing that he felt more anxiety on account of Jack's rashness than he was willing to allow. Our friend took with him one of our <b>large-bore</b> rifles, and a double-barrel of smaller bore slung at his back.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the fight}} began. Except for its grand finale it wasn't really {{much of a}} fight when {{compared}} {{with one or two}} we had afterwards on this expedition. But, on the other hand, its character was extremely awkward for us. The Arabs made one rush at the beginning, shouting on Allah as they came. But though they were plucky villains they did not repeat that experiment. Either by good luck or good management Stephen knocked over two of them with his double-barrelled rifle, and I also emptied my <b>large-bore</b> breech-loader--the first I ever owned--among them, not without results, while the hunters made a hit or two.|$|E
60|$|Orpin was by {{no means}} a milksop, and, {{although}} a Christian man, did not understand Christianity to teach the absolute giving up of all one's possessions to the first scoundrel who shall demand them. The moment, therefore, that the robbers showed themselves, he stopped the waggon {{at the foot of the}} precipice, drew his ever-ready double-barrelled <b>large-bore</b> gun from under the tilt, and ran out in front, calling on his men to support him. Kneeling down, he prepared to take a steady aim at the Bushman in advance, a wild-looking savage in a sheepskin kaross and armed with an assagai. The robbers were evidently aware of the nature of a gun, for they halted on seeing the decided action of the trader.|$|E
60|$|During {{the journey}} Tom {{had seen the}} major, who was an old sportsman, kill several elephants, so that he {{conceived}} himself to be quite able for that duty if it should devolve upon him. He was walking his horse quietly along a sort of path that skirted a piece of thicket {{when he heard a}} tremendous crashing of trees, and looking up saw a troop of fifty or sixty elephants dashing away through a grove of mapani-trees. Tom at once put spurs to his horse, unslung his <b>large-bore</b> double-barrelled gun, and coming close up to a cow-elephant, sent a ball into her behind the shoulder. She did not drop, so he gave her another shot, when she fell heavily to the ground.|$|E
60|$|I {{translated}} {{this speech}} to Lord Ragnall. It made him laugh, at which I was glad for up till then I {{had not seen}} him even smile. I should add {{that in addition to}} these sporting weapons there were no fewer than fifty military rifles of the best make, they were <b>large-bore</b> Sniders that had just then been put upon the market, and with them, packed in tin cases, a great quantity of ammunition. Although the regulations were not so strict then as they are now, I met {{with a great deal of}} difficulty in getting all this armament through the Customs. Lord Ragnall however had letters from the Colonial Office to such authorities as ruled in Natal, and on our giving a joint undertaking that they were for defensive purposes only in unexplored territory and not for sale, they were allowed through. Fortunate did it prove for us in after days that this matter was arranged.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{did any of}} them {{notice the}} little black man who limped {{up the steps and}} stood looking on. Koho was a conservative. His fathers before him had worn no clothes, and neither did he, not even a gee-string. The many empty {{perforations}} in nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions long since dead. The holes on both ear-lobes had been torn out, but their size was attested by the strips of withered flesh that hung down and swept his shoulders. He cared now only for utility, and in one of the half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short clay pipe. Around his waist was buckled a cheap trade-belt, and between the imitation leather and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a long knife. Suspended from the belt was his bamboo betel-nut and lime box. In his hand was a short-barrelled, <b>large-bore</b> Snider rifle. He was indescribably filthy, and here and there marred by scars, the worst being the one left by the Lee-Enfield bullet, which had withered the calf to half the size of its mate. His shrunken mouth showed that few teeth were left to serve him. Face and body were shrunken and withered, but his black, bead-like eyes, small and close together, were very bright, withal they were restless and querulous, and more like a monkey's than a man's.|$|E
