5|$|Many {{accidents}} when driving personal {{vehicles are}} caused by distracted driving. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), distraction plays a factor in 60% of moderate to serious teen car crashes. Specifically, passenger and cell phone interaction accounted for 27% of crashes, the leading cause. Drivers <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the target (roadway) also accounted for 19%.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E

25|$|Using this convention, {{polarization}} {{is defined}} {{from the point}} of view of the source. When using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one's left or right thumb away from the source, in the same direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one's fingers to the direction of the temporal rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the source and in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.|$|E

Truman's 1940 United States Senate campaign, titled [...] "On That Record I Stand", {{and received a}} Rhodes Scholarship at Worcester College, University of Oxford. His tenure at Princeton {{was the subject of}} Pulitzer Prize-winning author John McPhee's January 23, 1965 article [...] "A Sense of Where You Are" [...] in The New Yorker, which McPhee expanded into a book of the same name. The title came from Bradley's explanation for his ability to repeatedly throw a basketball over his shoulder and into the basket while <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E
500|$|French art {{historian}} Françoise Cachin notes that Gauguin designed both Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake and its companion piece Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan [...] as a caricature. In his Self-Portrat, Gauguin appears against a red background with a halo {{above his head}} and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand with {{what appear to be}} either plants or flowers in the foreground. [...] Curator Philip Conisbee observes the religious symbolism in the images, noting that the [...] "apples and snake refer to the Garden of Eden, temptation, sin, and the Fall of Man." [...] Gauguin divides the canvas in half, painting himself as both saint and sinner, reflecting his own personal myth as an artist. In the top portion of the painting, Gauguin is almost angelic with the halo, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the apples of temptation. [...] In the bottom portion, he holds the snake, completing the duality.|$|E

The video premiered on Disney Channel on August 22, 2008, following the premiere of [...] It was later made available for digital download on iTunes Store on September 16, 2008. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Manhattan Bridge, Lovato and her band are then seen on a small stage on top of a building. Lovato sports black clothing, a beaded scarf and red gloves. Throughout the first verse and chorus, Lovato dances around on stage with Manhattan Bridge visible in the background. Following the first chorus, the sun goes down and an aerial shot of the city's nightlife is shown. The second verse and chorus are performed during night. During the song's bridge, a daytime shot is shown of Lovato while sitting alone on the rooftop and <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the camera. After this, she is back on stage and performing the last chorus during nighttime with bright lights in the background. The video ends with the performance being finished, with Lovato turning around and walking towards her band.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after the {{nickname}} Dumont's seventh grade teacher had for Disneyland, which is in Anaheim, California, where the band members grew up. It is a pun on the popular nickname for Disneyland—"The Magic Kingdom". The album photography and portraits were taken by photographer fine artist Daniel Arsenault. Gwen is featured in the foreground {{while the rest of}} the band members are standing in an orange grove in the background. Gwen pushed for Eric to be included on the album cover—a source of tension for the band—reasoning that although he had left the band, he had still contributed substantially to the album. Eric is seen near the back of the picture, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the camera. The pictures on the cover and in the liner notes were taken on city streets in their native Orange County (namely Anaheim and City of Orange) and in orange groves. The red dress Gwen wears on the cover was loaned to the Hard Rock Cafe and was later displayed at the Fullerton Museum Center in an exhibit titled [...] "The Orange Groove: Orange County's Rock n' Roll History". The dress, appraised as high as US$5,000, was stolen from the exhibit in January 2005.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Rihanna plays Casta's lesbian love interest. Casta {{arrives at}} the castle in a car, and steps out with a very provocative dominatrix-looking outfit, and meets Rihanna who is waiting inside. Throughout all of the video, Casta tries to seduce Rihanna whilst Rihanna {{initially}} resists, but eventually gives in to Casta's charm. First, she meets Rihanna {{in the living room}} and catches her eye. In the next scene, the couple are shown on top of a table with ultraviolet lighting and Casta rubs her head on Rihanna's legs. They are then shown outside the castle and Rihanna falls to the ground in despair while Casta looks on, letting her long hair fall loose and standing seductively. Soon, they are shown in a room full of male dancers and Rihanna begins to feel more comfortable around her admirer. The last two scenes are Rihanna and Casta in PVC bondage outfits kissing and caressing on a bed in a darkened room, and then at a burning table, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> each other. Billboards music video reviewer, Monica Herrera commented, [...] "Rihanna saved a far sexier clip than 'Rockstar 101' for fans abroad." [...] She described the video's various scenes as [...] "Rihanna getting frisky in a bedroom and setting a fire with a sultry female companion." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{this threat}} display fails to deter a would-be predator, Heterodon species often roll onto {{their backs and}} play dead, {{going so far as}} to emit a foul musk and fecal matter from their cloaca and let their tongues hang out of their mouth, {{sometimes}} accompanied by small droplets of blood. If they are rolled upright while in this state, they will often roll back as if insisting they really are dead. [...] It has been observed that the snake, while appearing to be dead, will still watch the threat that caused the death pose. The snake will 'resurrect' sooner if the threat is <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it than if the threat is looking at the snake.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ida Görres, [...] "Thérèse {{instantly}} {{understood what}} had happened to her when she won this banal little victory over her sensitivity, which she had borne for so long; ...freedom is found in resolutely <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> oneself.. and the fact that a person can cast himself away from himself reveals again that being good, victory is pure grace, a sudden gift..It cannot be coerced, and yet it can be received only by the patiently prepared heart". Biographer Kathryn Harrison: [...] "After all, in the past she had tried to control herself, had tried with all her being and had failed. Grace, alchemy, masochism: through whatever lens we view her transport, Thérèse's night of illumination presented both its power and its danger. It would guide her steps between the mortal and the divine, between living and dying, destruction and apotheosis. It would take her exactly where she intended to go." ...|$|E
