6000|$|How comes it, I {{have asked}} more than once, that this poor tree {{is so often}} seen on the downs where it is so badly fitted to be and makes so sorry an {{appearance}} with its weak branches broken and its soft <b>leaves</b> <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> the winds? How badly it contrasts with the other trees and bushes that flourish on the downs--furze, juniper, holly, blackthorn, and hawthorn! ...|$|R
60|$|The sea {{was in a}} turmoil; {{the waves}} as they set in from the west being broken up by the rolling of the great ships, and <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> the <b>hail</b> of shot. The noise was prodigious, from the incessant cannonade kept up by the English ships {{and the return of}} the {{artillery}} on board the Armada, the rending of timber, the heavy crashes as the great galleons rolled against one another, the shouting on board the Spanish ships, the creaking of the masts and yards, and the flapping of the sails.|$|R
60|$|Beyond the camp, {{upon the}} hills the bush was thicker than ever, and here, {{where it was}} {{impossible}} for the white soldiers to skirmish through the bush, the Ashantis made a last desperate stand. The narrow lane up which alone the troops could pass was <b>torn</b> as if <b>by</b> <b>hail</b> with the shower of slugs, while a large tree which stood nearly {{in the center of the}} path and caused it slightly to swerve, afforded some shelter to them from the storm of bullets which the 42d sent back in return. Here Rait brought his gun up again to the front and cleared the lane. The bush was too thick even for the Ashantis. The gun stopped firing and with a rush the regiment went up the narrow path and out into the open clearing beyond. For a short time the Ashantis kept up a fire from the houses, but the 42d soon drove them out, and a single shot from the gun down the wide street which divided the town into two portions, bursting in the midst of a group at the further end, killed eight and drove all further idea of resistance in that direction from their minds.|$|R

60|$|But James {{managed the}} case differently. After going {{about the room}} {{for a few minutes}} with the {{children}}, and looking with them at their various treasures, and admiring what they seemed to admire, but without finding any fault, he sat down before the fire and took the children upon his lap--one upon each knee--and began to talk to them. Ann had one of her picture-books in her hand, some of the <b>leaves</b> <b>torn,</b> and the rest defaced with dog's-ears.|$|R
60|$|There is {{something}} bulky in Peggotty's pocket.

I find it very curious to see my own infant face, {{looking up at me}} from the Crocodile stories; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield.|$|R
50|$|In 1845 {{he joined}} the Chartist agitation, quickly {{becoming}} its most prominent figure, and vigorously carrying on the party's campaign on the platform and in the press.
