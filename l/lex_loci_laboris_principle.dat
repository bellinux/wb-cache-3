This is often confused with <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti commissi which is where the tort is committed. While typically they both point to the same location, in the case of product liability, for example, the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus would be the place of manufacturing, while the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti commissi would be the place of injury.|$|R

50|$|The ruling {{concerning}} {{the choice of}} law (lex originis for determining copyright ownership and <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti for the infringement) was contrary to the previous presumption that only the law where the infringement occurred (i.e., <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti) would apply. It has been discussed controversially in several publications. Since the Berne Convention does not offer any guidance on which law shall be applied to determine copyright ownership, this ruling is still the relevant case law in this question and the principle is applied in the U.S. even in other recent cases. The decision is only effective within the U.S.; other countries may follow other rules, such as using the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti exclusively.|$|R

40|$|Art. 7 of Regulation No. 864 / 07 (so called Rome II Regulation) {{provides}} for a specific conflict of laws rule concerning liability for environmental damage, which empowers the person sustaining the damage {{to choose between the}} application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> damni and the application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus. The present article analyses the rationale underpinning the attribution to only one of the parties concerned (the person sustaining the damage) of the unilateral right to choose the law applicable to their relationship and it concludes that the provision at issue does not purport to alter the equal balance between such parties, as it rather aims at ensuring a high level of environmental protection, both by preventing a race {{to the bottom of the}} relevant national legal standards and by discouraging the phenomenon known as environmental dumping. Furthermore, the article compares the specific provision laid down by art. 7 of Rome II Regulation with the general conflict of laws rule provided by art. 4 and art. 14 of the same instrument, with particular reference to the role played – in the peculiar context of environmental liability – by party autonomy and to the different relevance attributed by the said rules to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> damni and to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus...|$|R

It refers to the validity of the union, independent of the laws of marriage of the countries involved: where the two individuals have legal nationality or citizenship, or where they live (reside or are domiciled).

50|$|The proper {{law of the}} {{contract}} governs virtually all aspects of {{the contract}}, including its essential validity, nature, content, mode of performance and interpretation. By way of exception, however, the contractual capacity of the parties, together with the formalities of execution, are governed by the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> contractus, unless the contract concerns immovable property, in which case the law of the country where the property is situated (the lex situs or rei situae) applies.

40|$|Abstract]: Since 1994, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia {{have adopted}} new {{choice of law}} rules for {{cross-border}} torts that, in different ways, centre on {{the application of the}} law of the place where the tort occurred (the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti). All three countries abandoned some species of the rule in Phillips v Eyre, which required some reference to the law of the forum (the lex fori) as well as the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti. However, predictions were made that, where possible, courts in these countries would continue to show a strong inclination to apply the lex fori in cross-border tort cases—and would use a range of homing devices to do so. A comprehensive survey and analysis of the cases that have been decided under the Australian, British and Canadian <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti regimes suggests that courts in these countries do betray a homing instinct, but one that has actually been tightly restrained by appeal courts. Where application of the lex fori was formally allowed by use of a 'flexible exception' in Canada and the United Kingdom, this has been contained by courts of first appeal. Indeed, only the continuing characterization of the assessment of damages as a procedural question in Canada and the United Kingdom, seems to remain as a significant homing device for courts in these countries...|$|R
