6000|$|... § III. It is, however, {{with the}} member d, or Xb, {{that we are}} most seriously concerned; for this being the {{essential}} feature of all bases, and the true preparation for the wall or shaft, it is most necessary that here, if anywhere, we should have full expression of <b>levelness</b> and precision; and farther, that, if possible, the eye should not be suffered {{to rest on the}} points of junction of the stones, which would give an effect of instability. Both these objects are accomplished by attracting the eye to two rolls, separated by a deep hollow, in the member d itself. The bold projections of their mouldings entirely prevent the attention from being drawn to the joints of the masonry, and besides form a simple but beautifully connected group of bars of shadow, which express, in their perfect parallelism, the absolute <b>levelness</b> of the foundation.|$|E

And I saw Table Bay, so named for its <b>levelness.</b> I saw the Castle--built by the Dutch East India Company three hundred years ago--where the Commanding General lives; I saw St. Simon's Bay, where the Admiral lives. I saw the Government, also the Parliament, where they quarreled in two {{languages}} when I was there, and agreed in none. I saw the club.

6000|$|... § II. Now, {{the main}} {{things to be}} {{expressed}} in a base are its <b>levelness</b> and evenness. We cannot do better than construct the {{several members of the}} base, as developed in Fig. II., p. 55, each of a different colored marble, so as to produce marked level bars of color all along the foundation. This is exquisitely done in all the Italian elaborate wall bases; that of St. Anastasia at Verona {{is one of the most}} perfect existing, for play of color; that of Giotto's campanile is on the whole the most beautifully finished. Then, on the vertical portions, a, b, c, we may put what patterns in mosaic we please, so that they be not too rich; but if we choose rather to have sculpture (or must have it for want of stones to inlay), then observe that all sculpture on bases must be in panels, or it will soon be worn away, and that a plain panelling is often good without any other ornament. The member b, which in St. Mark's is subordinate, and c, which is expanded into a seat, are both of them decorated with simple but exquisitely-finished panelling, in red and white or green and white marble; and the member e is in bases of this kind very valuable, as an expression of a firm beginning of the substance of the wall itself. This member has been of no service to us hitherto, and was unnoticed in the chapters on construction; but it was expressed in the figure of the wall base, on account of its great value when the foundation is of stone and the wall of brick (coated or not). In such cases it is always better to add the course e, above the slope of the base, than abruptly to begin the common masonry of the wall.|$|E

50|$|The Temperance {{movement}} sparked to {{life with}} Benjamin Rush's 1784 tract, An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human Body and Mind, which judged the excessive use of alcohol injurious to physical and psychological health. Apparently influenced by Dr. Rush's Inquiry, about 200 farmers in a Connecticut community formed a temperance association in 1789 to ban the making of whiskey. Similar associations were formed in Virginia in 1800, and New York State in 1808. Over the next decade, other temperance organizations were formed in eight states, some being statewide organizations. The young movement advocated temperance or <b>levelness</b> rather than abstinence. Many leaders of the movement expanded their activities and took positions on observance of the Sabbath and other moral issues, and by the early 1820s political in-fighting had stalled the movement.|$|E

It was built of stones and bricks. It has two parts: the body and shigui (also called the ruler to measure the sky). It is 9.46 meters high by itself, and 12.62 meters high if the 2 cabinets on the top are included. The somewhat unconventional gnomon is a bar mounted horizontally between the 2 cabinets. The shigui extending to the far north is 31.19 meters long and 0.53 meters wide. It is made up of 36 square stones with two parallel waterways on it to check its <b>levelness.</b> The location of shigui is in accordance with the direction we take today to measure the meridian. During measurement, a beam is put across the grooves. Jingfu (an instrument with many holes) on the waterways is used to measure the shade, whose precision is within 2 millimeters. At winter solstice, the length of the shadow at noon is nearly as long as the shigui.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{in case of}} henna leaves dyed fabric, good <b>levelness</b> {{was found}} when no mordant was used, as the average ΔE value was found 0.21.

Experimental results reveal that plasma-treated cotton fabric can attain better color yield, <b>levelness,</b> and crocking fastness in dark shade pigment dyeing, compared with normal cotton fabric (not plasma treated). SEM analysis indicates that cracks and grooves were formed on the cotton fiber surface where the pigment and the binder can get deposited and improve the color yield, <b>levelness,</b> and crocking fastness. It was also noticed that pigment was aggregated when deposited on the fiber surface which could affect the final color properties...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} work an objective method {{for evaluating the}} <b>levelness</b> (L) of coloured textile materials by spectrophotometric measurements is reported. Colour <b>levelness</b> is actually {{a description of the}} uniformity of colour shade in different places of the fabric. Thus, we use three different fabrics namely, wool, polyester and wool/polyester blend (65 / 35 %), firstly these fabrics are treated with different uv/ozone exposure times continued for one hour exposure, followed by dyeing separately with three different dye classes; reactive, direct and acid. The colour strength (K/S) and colour difference ?E after exposing of the treated dyed samples to artificial day light are measured spectrophoto-metrically. The results of these measurements are statistically correlated with the <b>levelness</b> (L), relative standard deviation Sr (?), and the unlevelness (U). The obtained results showed that the dyeability, L parameter, U parameter and ?E values are greatly depend on the dye class used, fabric nature, and type of treatment applied. Where as these parameters reflect the effect of homogeneity of dye distribution on the fabric which decreases the colour fading of the dyed samples under test. Where uv/ozone exposure leads to the increase in the amorphousity of the exposed samples especially at the end of exposure leading to an increase in the exhaustion and diffusion of the dye inside the fabric pores besides, to its effect on districting the dye accumulation and hence increases the <b>levelness</b> of dyeing. </p...|$|E
30|$|Day by day the {{customers}} {{are going to}} be more conscious about the quality of clothing items. As a result, it becomes more challenging for the manufacturer to maintain the consistent dyeing quality. Unlevelness is generally unaccepted in commercial dyeing, except for stone-washed, acid-washed or pigment-dyed textiles, where an effect is sought to comply with a fashion trend. Color <b>levelness</b> is actually a description of the uniformity of shade in different places of the fabric. Traditionally it is judged by visual assessment, or by comparing similar samples, e.g. from the same fabric batch, to determine color differences. The human eyes can detect small differences in color, but it is difficult to quantify color differences accurately. Textile manufacturing industries are mainly concerned with the appearance of color uniformity in terms of <b>levelness</b> parameters in dyed fabrics and/or union shade in dyed fabrics of more than one fiber type [13]. Since mordants are also used in the processing of vegetable dyes, unlevelness could be a major problem in textile dyeing and dyeing with the vegetable sources should have proper control over color <b>levelness.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Theta rank of {{a finite}} point {{configuration}} V is the maximal degree {{necessary for a}} sum-of-squares representation of a non-negative linear function on V. This is an important invariant for polynomial optimization that is in general hard to determine. We study the Theta rank and <b>levelness,</b> a related discrete-geometric invariant, for matroid base configurations. It is shown that the class of matroids with bounded Theta rank or <b>levelness</b> is closed under taking minors. This allows for a characterization of matroids with bounded Theta rank or <b>levelness</b> in terms of forbidden minors. We give the complete (finite) list of excluded minors for Theta- 1 matroids which generalizes the well-known series-parallel graphs. Moreover, the class of Theta- 1 matroids can be charac-terized {{in terms of the}} degree of generation of the vanishing ideal {{and in terms of the}} psd rank for the associated matroid base polytope. We further give an excluded minor characterization for k-level graphs and we investigate the excluded minors for graphs of Theta rank 2. 1...|$|E
30|$|From Table  2, it {{was found}} that <b>levelness</b> was found highest when no mordant was used on the fabric as the average ΔE value was the lowest for all the three {{vegetable}} dyes in such cases.|$|E
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>levelness</b> or unlevelness {{can be interpreted}} mainly by the homogeneity of the dye distribution on the fabrics dyed with the vegetable dyes. The reason behind the better <b>levelness</b> of the unmordanted samples was due to homogeneity of the dye distribution on the fabric, while non-homogenous distribution of the dyes can result in the greater ΔE values. In addition, ferrous sulphate as a transition metal mordant forms {{a large number of}} complexes with the dye molecules, mostly octahedral ones with coordination number 6. As a result, ferrous sulphate salts can form a ternary complex on one site with the fiber and in the other site with the dye, which resulted in slightly higher color difference.|$|E
