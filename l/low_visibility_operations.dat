50|$|The {{result is}} that when these <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>{{operations}}</b> are taking place, operations on the ground affect operations in the air much more than in good visibility, when pilots can see what is happening.

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{operations}} (CONOPS) for the Commercial and Business (CaB) aircraft synthetic vision systems (SVS) is described. The CaB SVS is expected to provide increased safety and operational benefits in normal and <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> conditions. Providing operational benefits will promote SVS implementation in the fleet, improve aviation safety, and assist in meeting the national aviation safety goal. SVS will enhance safety and enable consistent gate-to-gate aircraft operations in normal and <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> conditions. The goal for developing SVS is to support operational minima as low as Category IIIb {{in a variety of}} environments. For departure and ground operations, the SVS goal is to enable operations with a runway visual range of 300 feet. The system is an integrated display concept that provides a virtual visual environment. The SVS virtual visual environment is composed of three components: an enhanced intuitive view of the flight environment, hazard and obstacle detection and display, and precision navigation guidance. The virtual visual environment will support enhanced operations procedures during all phases of flight [...] - ground operations, departure, en route, and arrival.

5000|$|This {{imposes a}} {{requirement}} for the ground based guidance element to conform to specific standards, {{as well as the}} airborne elements. Thus, while an aircraft may be equipped with an autoland system, it will be totally unusable without the appropriate ground environment. Similarly, it requires a crew trained in all aspects of the operation to recognise potential failures in both airborne and ground equipment, and to react appropriately, {{to be able to use}} the system in the circumstances from which it is intended. Consequently, the <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>operations</b> categories (Cat I, Cat II and Cat III) apply to all 3 elements in the landing - the aircraft equipment, the ground environment, and the crew. The result of all this is to create a spectrum of low visibility equipment, in which an aircraft's [...] "autoland" [...] autopilot is just one component.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{associated}} with this [...] "human factors" [...] approach was a recognition that improved autopilots could play a major part in low visibility landings. The components of all landings are the same, involving navigation from a point at altitude [...] "en route" [...] {{to a point where}} the wheels are on the desired runway. This navigation is accomplished using information from either external, physical, visual cues or from synthetic cues such as flight instruments. At all times there must be sufficient total information to ensure that the aircraft's position and trajectory (vertical and horizontal) are correct. The problem with <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>operations</b> is that the visual cues may be reduced to effectively zero, and hence there is an increased reliance on [...] "synthetic" [...] information. The dilemma faced by BEA was {{to find a way to}} operate without cues, because this situation occurred on its network with far greater frequency than on that of any other airline. It was particularly prevalent at its home base - London Heathrow Airport - which could effectively be closed for days at a time.|$|E

To meet this potential, research is needed for effective technology development and implementation of regulatory and design guidance to support introduction and use of SVS/EFVS advanced cockpit vision technologies in Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. A fixed-base pilot-in-the-loop simulation test was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center that evaluated the use of SVS/EFVS in NextGen low visibility ground (taxi) operations and approach/landing operations. Twelve crews flew approach and landing operations in a simulated NextGen Chicago O Hare environment. Various scenarios tested the potential for EFVS for operations in visibility as low as 1000 ft runway visibility range (RVR) and SVS to enable lower decision heights (DH) than can currently be flown today. Expanding the EFVS visual segment from DH to the runway in visibilities as low as 1000 RVR appears to be viable as touchdown performance was excellent without any workload penalties noted for the EFVS concept tested.

Simulation and flight tests were jointly sponsored by NASA's Aviation Safety Program, Vehicle Systems Safety Technology project and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate potential safety and operational benefits of SVS/EFVS technologies in low visibility Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. The flight tests were conducted by a team of Honeywell, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel with the goal of obtaining pilot-in-the-loop test data for flight validation, verification, and demonstration of selected SVS/EFVS operational and system-level performance capabilities. Nine test flights were flown in Gulfstream's G 450 flight test aircraft outfitted with the SVS/EFVS technologies under low visibility instrument meteorological conditions. Evaluation pilots flew 108 approaches in low visibility weather conditions (600 feet to 3600 feet reported visibility) under different obscurants (mist, fog, drizzle fog, frozen fog) and sky cover (broken, overcast). Flight test videos were evaluated at three different altitudes (decision altitude, 100 feet radar altitude, and touchdown) to determine the visual advantage afforded to the pilot using the EFVS/Forward-Looking InfraRed (FLIR) imagery compared to natural vision.

40|$|In December 2008 Institute of Flight Guidance of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{installed}} a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) manufactured by Thales Air Systems at the research airport Braunschweig-Wolfsburg in Germany. Since then, the Institute of Flight Guidance and other users have conducted many comprehensive experiments with this ground station throughout the GBAS research area. The ground station {{is part of}} the DLR air traffic validation center. It is not certified for official operations but is designed and developed according to all applicable specifications. In this setup, different flight inspection techniques were investigated with the station and new operational procedures were tested. Different aircraft were used for flight inspection as well as for operational procedure trials. This includes an Airbus A 320 research aircraft, a King Air 350 flight inspection aircraft as well as a Boeing 737 standard airliner or a Do- 128 research aircraft of the Technical University of Braunschweig. For a novel approach of verifying the contents of the GBAS message broadcast and the VHF coverage of the ground station, a helicopter (Bo- 105) was used for flight tests. Over the years, different upgrades of the GBAS ground stations were realized. This includes hardware upgrades as well as software upgrades. In terms of hardware, different GPS receivers were used as well different processor boards. The software was upgraded to not only support straight-in "ILS-look-alike"� Category I operations but also Terminal Area Paths (TAP), a functionality that allows curved path segments. In addition, prototypic software was installed to support Category II/III, so called GBAS Approach Service Type D (GAST-D) operations. Furthermore the TAP functionality will be used to transmit "Ground-TAPs"� to provide a highly accurate guidance for taxi operations during <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>operations.</b> Through Ground-TAPs taxi guidance is possible especially for pilots who are unfamiliar with the given airport or during adverse weather conditions. Different trials are planned to verify this idea in 2014.

This includes steep and segmented steep approaches based on GBAS and curved approaches as well as taxi operations using the TAP functionality. In addition, different performance reports of the station regarding position accuracy and VHF availability will be presented. Furthermore, the results of the helicopter flight trials regarding the VHF coverage with the low cost instrumentation will be shown and discussed in this work. To reduce integration costs, the VHF receiving equipment was integrated into a crate that was hooked as sling load to the helicopter's cargo hook. A VHF antenna was fitted onto the crate and the receiver equipment was battery powered inside the crate.
