The Czech musical film, Rebelové from Filip Renč, also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> touch and freedom of design.|$|E

5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> <b>of</b> Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E
5|$|The term Regency {{architecture}} refers {{primarily to}} {{buildings of the}} early 19th century, when GeorgeIV was still Prince Regent, and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical Georgian style of architecture, adding an elegance and <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door—usually coloured black—framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, often in a setting of trees and shrubs. Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was John Nash, whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet, a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The cottages are now owned by the National Trust.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet {{bore down}} off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
40|$|In {{color gamut}} mapping of {{pictorial}} images, the <b>lightness</b> rendition <b>of</b> the mapped images {{plays a major}} role in the quality of the final image. For color gamut mapping tasks, where the goal is to produce a match to the original scene, it is important to maintain the perceived <b>lightness</b> contrast <b>of</b> the original image. Typical lightness remapping functions such as linear compression, soft compression, and hard clipping reduce the <b>lightness</b> contrast <b>of</b> the input image. Sigmoidal remapping functions were utilized to overcome the natural loss in perceived lightness contrast that results when an image from a full dynamic range device is scaled into the limited dynamic range of a destination device. These functions were tuned to the particular <b>lightness</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the images used and the selected dynamic ranges. The sigmoidal remapping functions were selected based on an empirical contrast enhancement model that was developed from the results of a psychophysical adjustment experiment. [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Kundera's best-known work is The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> <b>of</b> Being. Prior to the Velvet Revolution of 1989 the Communist régime in Czechoslovakia banned his books.

25|$|Kundera's {{most famous}} work, The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> <b>of</b> Being, was {{published}} in 1984. The book chronicles the fragile nature of an individual's fate, theorizing that a single lifetime is insignificant in the scope of Nietzsche's concept of eternal return. In an infinite universe, everything is guaranteed to recur infinitely. In 1988, American director Philip Kaufman released a film adaptation.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability is to compare the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs to dive into the water, it takes on water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle.|$|E

Its original use was to cover the Chalice and prevent anything from falling into it before the consecration. It symbolizes the swaddling clothes with which Christ was wrapped at his Nativity, and also the grave clothes in which he was wrapped at his burial (both themes are found in the text of the Liturgy of Preparation).|$|E
25|$|After the Vanderbilt takeover, an {{increasing}} {{percentage of the}} company's contracts came from Vanderbilt himself, who from this point had most of his new steamboats and steamships engined there, just as most of his shipbuilding contracts {{went to the same}} firm, that of his trusted nephew, Jeremiah Simonson. Vanderbilt brought his own ideas to the field of marine steam engineering. Defying the prevailing wisdom, he began powering oceangoing steamships with American walking beam engines, believing that their relative <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> construction, economy of operation and low maintenance requirements made them preferable to the low center-of-gravity, but more complex, British-designed side-lever and oscillating types. Other American marine engine manufacturers quickly followed his example, and walking beams became the preferred engine type for oceangoing American sidewheel steamships until the introduction of the much more economical surface condensing compound engine in the early 1870s.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his early}} poetic works are staunchly pro-communist, his novels escape ideological classification. Kundera has {{repeatedly}} insisted on being considered a novelist, {{rather than a}} political or dissident writer. Political commentary has all but disappeared from his novels (starting specifically after The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> <b>of</b> Being) except in relation to broader philosophical themes. Kundera's style of fiction, interlaced with philosophical digression, is greatly inspired by the novels of Robert Musil and the philosophy of Nietzsche, and is also used by authors Alain de Botton and Adam Thirlwell. Kundera takes his inspiration, as he notes often enough, {{not only from the}} Renaissance authors Giovanni Boccaccio and Rabelais, but also from Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Denis Diderot, Robert Musil, Witold Gombrowicz, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafka, Martin Heidegger, and perhaps most importantly, Miguel de Cervantes, to whose legacy he considers himself most committed.|$|E
