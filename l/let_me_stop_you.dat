6000|$|... "It iss fery {{glad to see}} you I am, my poy, but it {{is taken}} py {{surprise}} I am, whatever. An' ho!" [...] (as his eyes fell on Tony), [...] "it iss the child you hef found. Well, it iss a happy father you will pe this night, Mr Ruvnshaw. I wish you choy. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you,</b> whatever. It wass something interesting you would pe telling these chentlemen when I came up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whitehall," [...] said Mr. George, {{reading the}} name on the corner. [...] "This must be the street where King Charles I. was beheaded. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> and see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I don't feel sure of myself. I {{might tell}} Selina {{something}} which she must never know; I {{should be so}} sorry to frighten her. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> here with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please! please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> here!" [...] pleaded Yvonne; [...] "if {{you turn}} me out I shall {{not know what}} to do: I shall not know where to meet my friends...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't tell {{any of the}} fellows," [...] said Fitz, [...] "but I'm {{going to}} cut the concern altogether. My {{governor}} wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> here in any other place than that of private secretary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} the shoes will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> and rest; it is so cool here, and I'm so tired," [...] said Kitty, as she came to a cosey nook {{at the foot of}} a tree.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lobsters prefer stones," [...] said Andrew. [...] "I don't {{think there}} are any here, but we'll see, if you get hold of the buoy. Anyhow, it will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> {{paddling}} and throw some water out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say, laddie, I don't want {{to spoil}} your day and {{disappoint}} you and so forth, but my jolly old father-in-law would never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> keep a snake. Why, it's {{as much as}} I {{can do to make}} him <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> on in the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> you." [...] I was impudently suave. [...] "Kick {{as hard as}} you please, and I'll {{still have}} enough face left with which to smile. In the meantime, while you are hesitating, suppose you accept my {{original}} proposition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> at {{the place}} close by and sell this; they'll give a little for it, and I'll get some supper. I've had nothing since {{yesterday}} morning, and maybe cold is easier to bear than hunger.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to," [...] said Benita feebly. [...] "Father, I am {{more afraid}} of him now than ever. Oh! why did <b>you</b> not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> down below, among the Makalanga, instead of {{carrying}} me up here again, where we must live alone with that terrible Jew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir knight; I thank you. But {{why should}} I, who am but a merchant, thrust myself upon your noble company? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> outside with my man, Petros, and dine with your {{people in that}} barn, where I see they are making ready their food." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much obliged. I'll do {{anything}} if you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> a bit, for it's as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready." [...] And Laurie {{sat down with}} a submissive expression delightful to behold.|$|R
6000|$|It's no use; no use at all. The {{children}} won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> telling {{tales of}} the Land of Oz. I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell them, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won't allow me. They cry: [...] "Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!" [...] and what can I do but obey their commands? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' groaned Smid. 'And I {{suppose you}} would expect me to come too, instead of <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> halfway, and settle there among the dragons and elephants. Well, well, wise men are like moorlands--ride {{as far as you}} will on the sound ground, you are sure to come upon a soft place at last. However, I will go down to the guards to-morrow, if my head don't ache.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{got another}} letter and Betty's worse," [...] said Kit. [...] "My mother states {{she has been}} warned she must give up her post. Her work's too hard; she must get the sun and fresh air. I feel I ought to help, but it's impossible. Thinking about this, I've begun to see my job on board the correillo leads nowhere. Perhaps they'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> when my engagement's up, but there's no promotion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{was stopped}} by some sentries, {{a quarter of a}} mile away, and was kept there while my guide came on and got {{permission}} of the captain for me to be brought in. When I met him, I had no great difficulty in persuading him to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop,</b> for Mr. Ramsay had given me fifty rix-dollars to give him; and so, your honour, here I am, and here is a letter from Mr. Ramsay himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno, ma'am," [...] {{answered}} Mike. [...] "Phoebe told me just as {{the wagon}} got there with the boxes an' trunks, an' nobody but me to help the man upstairs with 'em, an' said I must get away to the doctor's jes' as fast as I could drive. She said somethin' about her sleepin' in the garret and ketchin' cold, but she wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> to ax no questions. She said the doctor was wanted straight off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we will, of course, excuse you," [...] she said. [...] "You will, I hope, {{not think}} it very inconsiderate of <b>me</b> to <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] said Armine, with {{an accent}} of pain that made Jock cry, hugging him tighter. [...] "There, never mind, Armie; I'll let you say all you like. I don't know what made <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you,</b> except that I'm a beast, and {{always have been}} one. I'd give {{anything}} not to have gone on playing the fool all my life, {{so as to be}} able to mind this as little as you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! I've {{followed}} him weary and hungry for many days," [...] he said. [...] "He doesn't leave my sight {{until he has}} answered <b>me.</b> <b>Stop!</b> <b>you</b> that sit warm in luxury, pampering your sinful bodies and grinding the poor, you shall hear what one of your kind has done, and judge between us. The tale {{will be good for}} you. Shall the rich rob us of our children, as they rob us of our bread?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stay there!' she said, 'or I'll {{proclaim}} {{you to the}} house, and {{the whole}} street! If you try to evade <b>me,</b> I'll <b>stop</b> <b>you,</b> if it's by the hair, and raise the very stones against you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very disappointing," [...] he said. [...] "In fact {{your country}} is not yet ripe for German occupation. Our experts say that the {{invasion}} of Canada is an impossibility unless we use Milwaukee as a base--But step into my motor," [...] said the Count, interrupting himself, [...] "and come along with <b>me.</b> <b>Stop,</b> <b>you</b> are cold. This morning air is very keen. Take this," [...] he added, picking off the fur cap from the chauffeur's head. [...] "It will be better than that hat you are wearing--or, here, wait a moment--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or that if I {{chose that}} he should I would <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me?</b> He {{is in love with}} {{somebody}} else,--and perhaps I am too. And we are two paupers." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{would not}} be possible without the support of a number of people. I want to express my gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Scott Baldridge for his time, encouragement, and the opportunities he provided for me to further my education. In addition, the last chapter of this dissertation is joint work with him. The first year was rough, but all the wonderful meals at the Ogwyn house really helped get me through it (that and a little Scotch!). Through it all, my wife, Summer, supported me, and even put up with my work scattered around the house. Finally, thanks to my family for their support and encouragement through it all. Yâ€™all never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> believing. Thanks...|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust not," [...] he said quietly; [...] "I pray not. Very {{likely they}} will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> here all my lifetime. I am an {{assistant}} interpreter to the Embassy, in which capacity I am useful to Pekin; whereas in any home appointment I {{would of course}} be an utter failure, a manifest impossibility. But {{there is really no}} accounting for the wild vagaries and caprices of the Vermilion Pencil. For aught I know to the contrary, I might even be recalled to-morrow. If once they suspect a man of European sympathies, their first idea is to cut off his head. They regard it as you would regard the first plague-spot of cholera or small-pox in a great city." ...|$|R

"Pray do not move," [...] said I; [...] "I {{will hurt}} no one, but woe {{to the man}} who lays hands upon <b>me</b> to <b>stop</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> have nothing to fear if you leave me alone, and nothing to hope if you try to hinder me. I am Colonel Etienne Gerard, of the Hussars of Conflans." ...|$|R
