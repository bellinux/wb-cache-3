40|$|Backlight scaling is a {{technique}} proposed to reduce the dis-play panel power consumption by strategically dimming the backlight. However, for Internet streaming to mobile de-vices, a computationally intensive <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation</b> step must be performed in combination with backlight scal-ing to maintain the perceived appearance of video frames. This step, if done by the CPU, could easily offset the power savings via backlight dimming. Furthermore, computing the backlight scaling values requires per-frame luminance infor-mation, which is typically too energy intensive to compute on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose Content-Adaptive Display (CAD) for Internet mobile streaming. CAD uses the mobile device’s GPU rather than the CPU to perform <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation</b> at reduced power consumption. Backlight scaling schedule is computed using a more efficient dynamic programming algorithm than existing work. We implement CAD within an Android app and use a Monsoon power me-ter to measure the real power consumption. Experiments are conducted on more than 470 randomly selected YouTube videos, and results show that CAD can effectively produce power savings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} color and <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation</b> for sequences of overlapping images where the source images have very different colors and luminance. We apply the method for panoramic image construction on mobile phones. A simple approach is proposed that minimizes both the color differences of neighboring images and the overall color correction over the whole sequence. We compare several combinations of gamma correction and linear adjustment over different color representations, and select the method with best results: use Y CbCr and apply gamma correction for the luminance component and linear correction for the chrominance components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{technique}} for detecting scene changes in compressed video streams is proposed which combines multiple modes of information. The proposed technique directly exploits and combines the <b>luminance,</b> chromi-nance, motion <b>compensation</b> {{information and the}} prediction error signal in an MPEG 1 -coded video stream. By performing minimal decoding of the compressed video stream, the proposed technique results in signif-icant savings in terms of execution time and memory usage. The tech-nique is capable of detecting abrupt scene changes (cuts), gradual scene changes (dissolves), and dominant camera motion {{in the form of}} pans and zooms in an MPEG 1 -coded video stream. Experimental results show that combining multiple modes of information is more eective in detect-ing cuts and dissolves. The proposed technique is capable of processing video frames in real time and could be used for the rapid generation of key frames for real-time browsing of video streams and for indexing to support content-based access to video libraries. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{rotation}} and scale invariant face detection algorithm {{based on the}} texture of a human face is proposed in the paper. Wavelet packet analysis is performed on the test image to get the coefficients. It is observed that wavelet packet decomposition until third level is sufficient {{enough to get the}} necessary frequencial components essential for classifying faces and non-faces. Rotation invariant textural features are extracted from the wavelet coefficients. A scale invariant distance measure between the feature vectors of each of the candidate faces and the prototype face image is proposed to classify the candidate faces into faces and non-faces. The detection process implements a non-linear <b>luminance</b> based lighting <b>compensation</b> method, which is very efficient in enhancing and restoring the natural colors into the images taken in darker and varying lighting environments. The novel detection process proposed is highly efficient in terms of speed and accuracy in detecting frontal view faces in a complex background. The face detection performance of the proposed system is comparable to other reported leading system...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{cerebral}} achromatopsia, {{resulting from}} damage to ventromedial occipital cortex, cannot chromatically order, or discriminate, hue. Nevertheless, their chromatic contrast sensitivity can be indistinguishable {{from that of}} normal observers. A possible contributor to the detectability of chromatic gratings is the subadditive nature of certain colour combination such that mixtures of, for example, red and green (yielding yellow) appear dimmer than expected from the simple addition of luminances. This subadditivity is believed to reflect colour-opponent interactions between the outputs of long- and medium-wavelength cones. We performed a first-order compensation for such subadditivity in chromatic gratings and demonstrated that their detection was still not abolished in an achromatopsic patient. In addition, we used a two-alternative forced-choice procedure with an achromatopsic patient, who was required to judge the apparent relative velocity of two drifting gratings with different degrees of compensation for subadditivity. It {{is well known that}} isoluminant gratings, constructed by adding a red and green sinusoidal grating of identical peak luminances in antiphase, appear to drift substantially slower than an achromatic grating with the same velocity. Adding 2 f <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation</b> to an isoluminant grating of spatial frequency f, resulted in an identical minimum of perceived velocity at a compensation contrast of 5 % in both achromatopsics and normal observers. Furthermore, while compensation for subadditivity did not substantially compromise grating detection at low contrasts, such correction severely affected motion detection. Saccadic eye movement accuracy and latency were also measured to uncompensated chromatic, compensated chromatic and achromatic targets. We conclude first that subadditivity, resulting from colour-opponent P-channel processes, influences motion judgements. The ability to extract motion from chromatic differences alone is little, if at all, different in achromatopsic and normal vision. Second, the paradoxical detection of sinusoidally modulated chromatic gratings in achromatopsic patients is not merely a result of subadditivity. Third, saccadic latency, but not accuracy, to chromatic targets is affected by <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation.</b> Finally, and more generally, wavelength processing continues to contribute to several aspects of visual processing even when colour is not perceived...|$|E
40|$|COST Action IE 0601 WoodCultHer Wood Science for Conservation of Cultural HeritageInternational audienceConservation of {{paintings}} of Cultural Heritage on wood panels could gain from using tools of wood science and structural mechanics. Indeed, with a virtual model, prediction of an artwork behavior for various scenarii could help for decision on conservation or restoration acts. Since each artwork {{is a particular}} case, it requires an identification step to nurture the model. In this article, we are concerned with a particular restoration act: the partial replacement of a cradle. This study couples an experimental approach (3 D stereo-correlation) and a numerical approach (finite elements). The experimental part concerns an optical non-invasive form measurement with digital image correlation, using a projected speckle pattern on the painted panel, with <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation.</b> The numerical part concerns stress evaluation, once the model and the experiments are compared using a geometric mapping and a spatial projection of discrete fields. Using modeling and identification, the simulation attempts to recover the residual stresses in the panel, and allows testing several restoration conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResidual stress {{estimation}} is {{an important}} question for structural integrity. Since residual stresses are self-balanced stress fields, a classical way to obtain information on them is to remove {{a part of the}} structure, and observe the structure displacement field arising from the stress redistribution. The hole- drilling method is such an approach. In some cases, as for the present one concerning a painted panel of cultural heritage, the hole-drilling method is not suited (a structure with a complex geometry, few tests allowed) but one can take advantage of structural modifications if they are monitored (here, a restoration act). We therefore describe in this article a model updating approach, focusing on the residual stress estimation and not on the material parameter identification. This study couples an optical non-invasive shape measurement (digital image correlation, using a projected speckle pattern on the painted panel, with <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation)</b> and a numerical approach (3 D finite elements) for the model updating. The 3 D stereo-correlation is used to measure a partial displacement field between three different states of the structure (at three different times of the restoration act). The numerical part concerns stress evaluation, once the model and the experiments are compared using a geometric mapping and a spatial projection of discrete fields. Using modeling and identification, the simulation is used to obtain the residual stresses in the panel, before and after the restoration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The display {{subsystem}} of {{a mobile}} device usually consumes 38 %- 68 % [1] {{of the total}} battery power in video streaming. Therefore, a few schemes {{have been designed to}} reduce the display power consumption. The basic idea is to dim the backlight level while properly compensating the pixel luminance to maintain image fidelity. The <b>luminance</b> <b>compensation</b> and proper backlight level calculation are computation intensive and demand per-frame luminance information. For these reasons, existing schemes only work for video-on-demand where each frame (and thus the luminance information) is available in advance. In addition, they demand additional computing resource support. Otherwise, if the computation is conducted on the mobile device, the power consumption due to such computation can easily offset the power savings from dimming the backlight. In this work, we set to investigate power saving for real-time video calls on mobile devices. Different from video-on-demand, real-time video calls are highly delay sensitive and the frame luminance information is not known in advance. Moreover, video calls often involve multiple streaming sources from multiple (≥ 2) participants, making it more difficult. Because there are few background changes and the frame rate is usually small in video calls, we design a Greedy Display Power saving scheme, called LCD-GDP, which utilizes the commonly available GPU on mobile devices without demanding additional support. Our design is implemented on WebRTC, a popular real-time web browser based video call standard. Experiments show that our scheme can save up to 33 % power consumption in video calls without affecting the video call quality.
