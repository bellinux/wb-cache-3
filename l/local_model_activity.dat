40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for automatic recognition of human activities for video surveillance applications. We propose to represent an activity {{by a combination of}} category components and demonstrate that this approach offers flexibility to add new activities to the system and an ability {{to deal with the problem}} of building <b>models</b> for <b>activities</b> lacking training data. For improving the recognition accuracy, a confident-frame-based recognition algorithm is also proposed, where the video frames with high confidence for recognizing an activity are used as a specialized <b>local</b> <b>model</b> to help classify the remainder of the video frames. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Index Terms—Category components, event detection, <b>local</b> <b>model,</b> video surveillance. I.
