40|$|English In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with the hardware implementation of learning algorithms for analogue VLSI artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are often successfully applied to problems for which no algorithmic solution exist, but can be described by examples. ANNs are fault tolerant and parallel of nature; analogue VLSI is a technology that can efficiently exploit these properties providing high performance systems. Analogue VLSI implementations of recall mode ANNs are maturing, but the equally important problem of implementing programming (or <b>learning)</b> <b>hardware</b> for these is still in its infancy. We shall present the analogue VLSI implementation of two supervised, gradient descent learning algorithms for ANNs: the error back-propagation learning algorithm (BPL) for layered feed forward ANNs and the real-time recurrent learning algorithm (RTRL) for general recurrent networks. Both algorithms teach a cascadable analogue VLSI chip set for ANNs which we s [...] ...|$|E
40|$|New {{types of}} machine <b>learning</b> <b>hardware</b> in {{development}} and entering the market hold {{the promise of}} revolutionizing deep learning in a manner as profound as GPUs. However, existing software frameworks and training algorithms for deep learning have yet to evolve to fully leverage the capability of {{the new wave of}} silicon. We already see the limitations of existing algorithms for models that exploit structured input via complex and instance-dependent control flow, which prohibits minibatching. We present an asynchronous model-parallel (AMP) training algorithm that is specifically motivated by training on networks of interconnected devices. Through an implementation on multi-core CPUs, we show that AMP training converges to the same accuracy as conventional synchronous training algorithms in a similar number of epochs, but utilizes the available hardware more efficiently even for small minibatch sizes, resulting in significantly shorter overall training times. Our framework opens the door for scaling up a new class of deep learning models that cannot be efficiently trained today. Comment: 17 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

We {{have developed an}} ASIC VLSI chip, which is a building block to configure a scalable neural network hardware system. In our system, both the topology and the hidden layer node functions of a neural network mapped on the chips are dynamically changed using a genetic algorithm. Thus, the most desirable network topology and choice of node function (e. g. Gaussian or sigmoid) for a given application can be determined adaptively. This approach is particularly suited to applications requiring {{ability to cope with}} time-varying problems and real-time timing constraints. The chip consists of 15 Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), whose functions and interconnections are reconfigured dynamically according to the chromosomes of the genetic algorithm.
