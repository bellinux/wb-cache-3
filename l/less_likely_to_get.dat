40|$|Abstract Background Thin {{children}} are less muscular, weaker, less active, and have lower performance in measures {{of physical fitness}} than their normal weight peers. Thin {{children are}} also more frequently subjected to teasing and stigmatization. Little is known about thin children's weight perceptions, desired weight and attitudes and behaviours towards food and exercise. The study aimed to compare perceived weight status, desired weight, eating and exercise behaviours and advice received from parents among thin, overweight, obese or normal weight Australian children and adolescents. Methods The sample included 8550 school children aged 6 to 18 years selected from every state and territory of Australia. The children were weighed, measured and classified as thin, normal, overweight or obese using international standards. The main outcome measures were perceived and desired weight, weight related eating and exercising behaviours, and advice received from parents. Results The distribution of weight status was - thin 4. 4 %; normal weight 70. 7 %; overweight 18. 3 %; and obese 6. 6 %. Thin children were significantly shorter than normal weight, overweight or obese children and they were also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report regularly consuming meals and snacks. 57. 4 % of thin children, 83. 1 % of normal weight children, 63. 7 % of overweight and 38. 3 % of obese children perceived their weight as "about right". Of the thin children, 53. 9 % wanted to be heavier, 36. 2 % wanted to stay the same weight, and 9. 8 % wanted to weigh less. Thin children were significantly <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than obese children to respond positively to statements such as "I am trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fitter" or "I need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more exercise. " Parents were significantly <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> recommend exercise for thin children compared with other weight groups. Conclusions Thin children, {{as well as those}} who are overweight or obese, are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than normal weight children to consider their weight "about right'. Thin children differ from children of other weights in that thin children are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fitter or be encouraged to exercise. Both extremes of the spectrum of weight, from underweight to obese, may have serious health consequences for the individuals, as well as for public health policy.

25|$|It is {{challenging}} {{to determine the}} length of the egg phase because eggs are sometimes eaten as part of a dominance struggle. However, since the first eggs, which produce the first workers, are much <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> eaten, one can obtain a general sense of the timing. Most of these first eggs hatch within 10–13 days of being laid. Once the eggs hatch, the larval stage begins. The duration of this phase varies significantly, mostly based {{on the development of the}} colony. As the development of the colony varies, so do the feeding practices, and rate of feeding effects the duration of the larval stage. The length of the larval stages peaks at 60 days, but the average larvae remained in the larval phase for 15–30 days.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} found that black women in the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer even though white {{women are more likely to}} be {{diagnosed}} with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> treatment compared to white women. Scholars have advanced several theories for the disparities, including inadequate access to screening, reduced availability of the most advanced surgical and medical techniques, or some biological characteristic of the disease in the African American population. Some studies suggest that the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes may reflect cultural biases more than biological disease differences. However, the lack of diversity in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment may contribute to these disparities, with recent research indicating that black women are more likely to have estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, which are not responsive to hormone treatments that are effective for most white women. Research is currently ongoing to define the contribution of both biological and cultural factors.|$|E

We examined how African-American and white patients with symptomatic OA of the knee and/or hip compare with respect to their perceptions of care for knee and hip OA. METHODS: Survey of 596 male patients with OA of the knee and/or hip in primary care clinics at Cleveland VAMC.

40|$|Previous {{research}} findings {{were used in}} this study to develop and compare categories of the commonly used tactics and motives of sexually aggressive college women and men. In the collaborative work, 43 % of the men and 26 % of the women said they had perpetrated at least one act of sexual persistence. Based upon the reports of sexual targets, sexually aggressive women were less exploitative than males. Women were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lie, purposefully <b>get</b> a man drunk for sex, or use a high level of physical force. However, sexually aggressive women appear to be as willing as sexually aggressive men to use the authority of their age to pressure for sex; to take advantage of persons who are already intoxicated; and to block the retreat of a reluctant sexual target. Research has suggested that sexually aggressive males can be characterized by dominant personalities; an adversarial stance towards women; membership in hyper-masculine peer groups; and a preference for casual sex. These characteristics can also define some female sexually aggressive behavior along with two other traits. Some sexually aggressive women are motivated by a desire for romance and intimacy, while others may pressure a man into sex because they misjudged his sexual interest.

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that strong family support {{can play an important}} role in helping men and women transition from prison to home and can actually reduce the likelihood of recidivism. Assuming traditional roles within a family, such as parent or spouse, can also aid in the reentry transition process and has been linked to positive outcomes after release. Using data from a longitudinal study of fathers returning to the community after a period of incarceration, this article examines how the relationship between fathers and their children may influence aspects of recently released fathers’ lives that are important to a successful reentry transition, such as employment, abstinence from substance abuse, and mental health. Analyses show that fathers who have regular contact with their children before release and report good family support overall are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be attached to their children after release. Moreover, in the first few months after release, fathers who are more strongly attached to their children work more hours per week, have better mental health, and are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> commit crime, <b>get</b> arrested, or violate conditions of their supervision.

25|$|Dupuytren's contracture, {{a disease}} of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that {{permanently}} bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that {{the severity of the}} epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men. Thirty-five years later, Critcheley et al. reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's contracture. They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating peripheral tissue growth factors. Dupuytren's contracture is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in Northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this, and Drs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if children with complicated medical conditions, requiring coordination of care between a dentist and physician, had better oral health experiences if their primary hospital contained in-house dental services. A 20 question survey was sent to 609 parents of children diagnosed with blood disorders, cancers or solid organ transplants who received their medical care at one of two tertiary care pediatric hospitals: one with an in-house dental service (Children?s Medical Center Dallas-CMCD) or one without (Phoenix Children?s Hospital-PCH). The study yielded 172 (28. 2 percent) completed surveys? 85 patients from CMCD and 87 patients from PCH. Overall, 22. 7 percent of parents reported that they had difficulty getting dental care that they or their physician believed was necessary. The primary barrier to care was parents did not know where to find a dentist willing to treat their child because of his or her medical condition. Children who received medical care at CMCD were 2. 85 times <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have difficulty <b>getting</b> dental care than children treated at PCH (p< 0. 02).

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to examine the {{relationship}} among residence (rural/ nonmetropolitan/ urban), individual traits of elders, community characteristics, and realized access to health care. For this research access to care, referred to as realized access, is defined as (1) reported trouble getting care (2) physician visits, and (3) prescription drug utilization. The aims of this research are to: (1) Determine if changes in realized access to care have occurred over a 5 year period from 1999 - 2004. (2) Determine whether, rural residence’s influence on realized access to care persists when individual traits of elders (insurance, age, education, income, race, health, and health beliefs) and community traits (physician supply, percentage of the population aged 65 and older, and transportation issues) are considered. Data for this study are derived from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) and the Area Resource File. All variables except the physician supply and percentage of the population over 65 are obtained from the MCBS for the years of 1999 and 2004. The sample consists of individuals within the MCBS who are living in the community and are aged 65 and over. Multiple OLS regression and logistic regression with difference in difference estimators are used to answer aims 1 and 2. Results indicate a slightly decreased number of elders reporting trouble getting care over the five year period and modest increases in both physician visits and prescription drug use. Nonmetropolitan elders are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report trouble <b>getting</b> care than metropolitan elders, rural elders are found to use fewer physician visits as compared to metropolitan elders, and no difference is found in the use of prescription drugs when controlling for individual and community traits. Only one of the community characteristics (percentage of the population aged 65 +) is found to be related to realized access to care. These findings add to the existing literature by helping to explain the relationships between individual characteristics, community characteristics, and access to care while also providing a wider definition of access...|$|R

A distinction was made between the different levels of pressings. The first press, done completely by the weight of the grapes on top of each other, produced the highest quality wine, known as the vin de goutte. The second and third pressings, done with weight being applied, produced wine of good but not exceptional quality. The fourth and fifth pressings, the vin de taille and vins de pressoir, were of darker colors and would not be used at all. In addition to adding the pinkish/grey coloring, Dom Pérignon knew that the skins imparted different flavoring and coarser textures than he wanted in his high quality wines. His emphasis on limiting skin contact helped the Abbey of Hautvillers to produce truly white wine from red wine grapes.|$|E
