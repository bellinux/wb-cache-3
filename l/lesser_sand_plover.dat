50|$|Many other waterbirds {{breed in}} colonies on the floodplain, {{especially}} egrets, herons and spoonbills, while the mudflats {{are used by}} flocks of migratory waders in summer. Wader species using the site in large numbers include black-tailed godwits, <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers</b> and red-necked stints. The islands hold significant breeding colonies of little, black-naped and bridled terns.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents or as breeding or passage migrants. These include Himalayan snowcocks, bar-headed geese, ruddy shelducks, common mergansers, saker falcons, Himalayan vultures, eastern imperial eagles, <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> brown-headed gulls, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's larks, sulphur-bellied warblers, wallcreepers, white-winged redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, water pipits, black-headed mountain-finches, Caucasian great rosefinches and red-fronted rosefinches.|$|R
5000|$|Bird Point, also located {{northwest}} of Robbins Island where {{a number of}} birds species permanently roost in the area. They include: fairy terns, little terns, Caspian terns, crested terns, pied oystercatchers and sooty oystercatchers. Many species of migratory birds come to nest here and include grey-tailed tattlers, great knots, <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> masked lapwings, Pacific golden plovers, red knots, red-capped plovers, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, sanderlings, waders, double-banded plovers, curlew sandpipers, common greenshanks, bar-tailed godwit and hooded plovers.|$|R
50|$|Size {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{distinguishing}} a <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> from a greater sand plover, with the lesser being slightly smaller. However, {{it is not easy to}} rely on size alone especially when seen individually. The length of the bill is another distinguishing feature, with the lesser generally having a shorter bill compared to a greater. The colour of the legs in a <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> is generally darker, ranging from black to grey, while in a greater sand plover it is much paler, ranging from grey to yellowish.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as for}} bar-headed geese, with up to 125 {{breeding}} pairs {{using the}} site, the reserve was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of several other bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants.

50|$|The {{lower part}} of Great Sandy Strait was listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of {{international}} significance in 1999. The area {{is also an important}} roosting site for CAMBA and JAMBA listed species. Some 806 km2 of the strait has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports about 120,000 non-breeding waders, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, grey-tailed tattlers, <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> pied oystercatchers, red-necked stints and red-capped plovers, as well as small numbers of the range-restricted mangrove honeyeater.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} races, {{and the large}} east Asian forms, C. m. mongolus and C. m. stegmanni, are {{sometimes}} given specific status as Mongolian plovers, Charadrius mongolus.

25|$|The sound {{becomes a}} perfect habitat for migratory wading birds during the summer, when an {{estimated}} 2,000-3,000 birds {{flock to the}} area to feed in the shallow mudflats of the harbours. Some of the species {{that can be found}} during the summer months include the red-necked stint and the red knot as well as sandpipers, grey plovers, red capped <b>plovers,</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> grey-tailed tattlers, whimbrels, common greenshanks, yellow-billed spoonbill, white-faced heron and stilts.

50|$|About 250,000 waders {{visit the}} Gulf shores and mudflats at peak {{migration}} time; {{these include the}} grey plover, the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> the crab plover, the Kentish plover and the broad-billed sandpiper. The coast, and particularly offshore islands are used by many seabirds. About twenty to thirty percent of the world's Socotra cormorants, about 200,000 birds, breed in the United Arab Emirates, but they are under threat from fishermen who fear for their livelihoods. Sooty gulls breed here, as do red-billed tropicbirds {{as well as several}} species of tern; white-cheeked, bridled and lesser crested tern.|$|R

50|$|In all plumages, it is {{very similar}} to <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> Charadrius mongolus. Separating the species may be {{straightforward}} in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is another thing altogether to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the Middle Eastern race of the greater sand plover is the most similar to the lesser species.|$|E
50|$|Birds of {{the delta}} are both winter {{visitors}} and passage migrants including great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), {{a wide variety of}} Anatidae, Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), about thirty species of migratory shorebirds, the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida), the Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), and the brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus), which is very common.

50|$|The Bakers Creek Conservation Park {{occupies}} the south-east headland created by Bakers Creek entering into the Coral Sea. It is a protected area {{due to the}} need to preserve the shorebird habitat consisting of intertidal zones and mangroves; it has been declared a nationally important area for shorebirds. It has a population of the vulnerable species Eracus neglectus (beach stone-curlew). It is considered of internationally significant for migrating shorebirds such as the Charadrius mongolus (<b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover),</b> Numenius madagascariensis (eastern curlew), Calidris tenuirostris (great knot) and Haematopus fuliginosus (sooty oystercatcher).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the lake}} lies within a {{national}} park, {{much of the}} surroundings are used as pasture. The lake, with its islands, marshes, wet meadows, peat bogs, and pebbly and sandy plains, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include bar-headed geese, ruddy shelducks, common mergansers, saker falcons, Himalayan vultures, <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> brown-headed gulls, Tibetan sandgrouse, yellow-billed choughs, Himalayan rubythroats, white-winged redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, rufous-streaked accentors, brown accentors, black-headed mountain-finches and Caucasian great rosefinches.

5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. The floodplain supports over 1% of the world populations magpie geese and pied herons. The mudflats of Fog Bay, extending from Point Jenny to Stingray Head, support over 1% of the world populations of great knots and grey-tailed tattlers, among the maximum of 35,000 waders, or shorebirds, recorded. [...] Other waders for which the site is at least sometimes important include black-tailed godwits, greaters and <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> grey plovers, Terek sandpipers, and Far Eastern curlews.

50|$|The mud {{from which}} the islands get their name is {{excellent}} feeding habitat for migratory waders. More than 1% of the known Australian populations of four wader species, Pacific golden plover, grey plover, <b>lesser</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> and ruddy turnstone, spend the summer around Mud Islands. More than 5% of the Victorian populations of red knot, great knot, eastern curlew and bar-tailed godwit feed in Swan Bay to the west but roost on the islands at high tide. Two resident waders, the pied oystercatcher and the red-capped plover, regularly breed on undisturbed parts of the islands.|$|E
