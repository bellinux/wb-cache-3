50|$|Second, <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> did {{not share}} basic {{information}} they possessed that would have helped students better understand school offerings and career paths.

Knowing that <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> would decline initially, McEntee and Lynch were actually targeting the American Bar Association's accreditation standards. By 2012, LST succeeded in reforming the ABA standards to better protect students and to hold <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> accountable, and in changing attitudes about how <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> interact with prospective students.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} discussions of {{educational}} reform in U. S. <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> {{have suffered from}} a fundamental misconception: that the education provided {{in all of the}} American Bar Association-accredited schools is roughly the same. A better description of the educational opportunities provided by ABA-accredited <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> would group the schools into three rough clusters: the “elite” <b>law</b> <b>schools,</b> the modal (most frequently occurring) <b>law</b> <b>schools,</b> and the precarious <b>law</b> <b>schools.</b> Because the elite <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> do not need much “reforming,” the better focus of reform would concentrate on the modal and precarious schools; however, both elite and modal <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> could benefit from some changes to help law students move from understanding the theoretical underpinnings of law to understanding how to translate those underpinnings into practice. “Practice” itself is a complex concept, requiring both an understanding of the law and an understanding of how to relate well to others. Because law students may not understand how to relate well to those with different backgrounds from their own, <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> should do more to explain how one’s perspective is both limiting and mutable. Too many <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> suggest that students can “see” different perspectives by, essentially, merely thinking harder. The essay concludes with some suggestions regarding possible reforms of U. S. legal education, focusing primarily on the modal <b>law</b> <b>schools...</b>|$|R
