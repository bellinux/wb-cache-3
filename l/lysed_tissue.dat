40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{examine the}} effects of insulin {{treatment}} on the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt or pAkt) and nitric oxide (NO), known targets of insulin action. MethodsRetinas from Lewis rats were treated with insulin in vitro, and the levels of pAkt and NO expression assessed in <b>lysed</b> <b>tissue</b> homogenates at various time points. In addition, rats were treated in vivo with a single eye drop containing 1 % insulin after which the levels of pAkt and NO were assessed in their retinas at various time points. ResultsIncubation of retinas in media containing 10 or 100 ng/mL of insulin resulted in a significant increase in their expression of pAkt 15 – 30 min later. When insulin was topically applied in vivo, its levels peaked in the retina 35 min. Topically applied insulin significantly increased retinal pAkt levels 10 and 15 min post-treatment (p< 0. 02 and 0. 01, respectively). NO levels were elevated 20 min after insulin treatment both in vitro and in vivo (p< 0. 007 and 0. 04, respectively). ConclusionsInsulin upregulated retinal expression of pAkt and NO both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that topically applied insulin that accumulates in the retina may be physiologically active...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{lymphocytes}} from twenty-three untreated {{patients with}} Hodgkin's disease and twelve healthy controls were studied {{for their ability}} to <b>lyse</b> <b>tissue</b> culture cells (Chang cells) labelled with [51 Cr]chromate. Lysis induced by patients' lymphocytes in the presence of PHA or rabbit IgG antibodies to Chang cells (ACS) was impaired in some, and higher than normal in others. ACS-induced lysis showed some corlation with the content of lymphocytes carrying receptors for human complement (CRL) in the effectory population. No correlation with immunoglobulin-bearing cells was noted. PHA-induced cytoxicity did not correlate with lymphocyte subpopulations. The observations are consistent with the assumption that effector cells of antibody-induced lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (K cells) may be present among CRL. The K-cell activity and PHA cytotoxicity by lymphocytes tended to decrease at high age, but impaired cytotoxity was also noted in young patients. A preliminary follow-up of patients 1 - 2 years after the beginning of treatment revealed almost abolished K-cell activity in four patients who died 6 [...] 13 months after testing. Patients in incomplete remission or with relapse after treatment had lower mean K-cell activity than those in complete remission. A similar, but less pronounced tendency was found for PHA-induced cytotoxicity. A prognostic role of impaired K-cell activity in Hodgkin's disease is suggested from these data, but requires confirmation in a larger clinical follow-up...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Black band disease (BBD) of corals is {{characterized}} as a pathogenic, horizontally migrating micro-bial mat that is dominated by gliding, filamentous cyanobacteria. These cyanobacteria are important in BBD etiology in that they form the dense matrix of the band and {{are the source of}} a cyanotoxin that contributes to BBD pathogenesis. The BBD environment is chemically dynamic, fluctuating between oxic and anoxic condi-tions, and often contains high levels of sulfide. Additionally, it is nutrient and organic carbon rich due to the presence of actively <b>lysing</b> coral <b>tissue</b> and coral mucus. BBD cyanobacteria are physiologically adapted to the BBD environment in both light and darkness. Previous work has shown that BBD cyanobacteria can perform sulfide-insensitive oxygenic photosynthesis during the day. We report here the results of laboratory studies of a culture of the BBD cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. aimed at investigating metabolism during darkness. This isolate exhibited enhancement of survival supported by exogenous organic carbon sources (both sugars and amino acids) during darkness under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with the greatest effect seen under anaerobic conditions. Thus this BBD cyanobacterium is physiologically adapted to the anaerobic, organic rich environment of BBD at night as well as the sulfide-rich, illuminated band environment during the day. Rev.

Black band disease (BBD) of corals is characterized as a polymicrobial biofilm (mat) community, visually-dominated by filamen-tous cyanobacteria. The mat migrates across a living coral host, completely <b>lysing</b> coral <b>tissue</b> and leaving behind exposed coral skeleton.

Fragments of the coral Montastraea annularis, five artificially infected with BBD and two collected from a naturally BBD-infected colony, were used to address these questions by detailed examination using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). In areas close to the interface of coral tissue and the mature disease band two types of clusters of cyanobacteria were observed, one with random orientation and one with parallel orientation of filaments.

We adapted a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for the quantification of TNF-alpha in serum to measure the amount of this cytokine in solid tissue. For this purpose, we developed a buffer that <b>lysed</b> the <b>tissues</b> without affecting the TNF-alpha present. The minimum detection level was about 2 pg of TNF-alpha per mg tissue. Using this technique, we found {{a significant increase in}} the TNF-alpha level after perfusion in the liver tissue of all evaluable patients, which may explain the transient liver toxicity we observed in all patients. In tumour tissue, a significant TNF-alpha increase was observed in one out of five patients. The level of TNF-alpha in all liver tissue samples and some of the tumours after treatment by isolated liver perfusion was much higher than the peak serum concentrations obtained after systemic administration of the maximum tolerated dose of TNF-alpha. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the level of TNF-alpha in the liver tissue samples was about seven to eight times higher than in tumour tissue. We concluded that regional liver treatment resulted in a relatively high local level of TNF-alpha, but also that this cytokine did not preferentially accumulate in tumour tissue...|$|R

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a {{versatile}} bacterial opportunist {{responsible for a}} wide spectrum of infections. Several genomes of this major human pathogen have been publicly available for almost 10 years, but comprehensive links between virulence or epidemicity and genome content of the bacterium are still missing. This project aims at characterizing a set of small transcribed molecules currently ignored by standard automated annotation algorithms. We assessed the NanoString's nCounter Analysis System for its ability to determine the orientation and quantity of the expressed small RNA (sRNA) molecules that we recently detected with RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). The expression of approximately seventy small RNAs, including sRNA localized in pathogenic islands, was assessed at 5 time points during growth of the bacterium in a rich medium. In addition, two extraction strategies were tested: RNA was either purified on columns or simply prepared from crude lysates {{in the presence of a}} chaotropic buffer. The nCounter System allowed us to perform these 64 measurements in a single experiment, without any enzymatic reaction, thus avoiding well-known technical biases. We evaluated the reproducibility and reliability of the nCounter compared to quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). By using two different designs for the two coding strands, we were able to identify the coding strand of 61 small RNA molecules (95 %). Overall, the nCounter System provided an identification of the coding strand in perfect concordance with RNA-Seq data. In addition, expression results were also comparable to those obtained with RT-qPCR. The sensitivity and minimal requirements of the nCounter system open new possibilities in the field of gene expression analysis, for assessing bacterial transcript profiles from complex media (i. e. during host-pathogen interactions) or when starting from poorly purified RNA or even directly from <b>lysed</b> infected <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
40|$|Xenografting pig fetal ventral mesencephalic (pfVM) {{cells to}} repair the {{dopamine}} deficit in patients with Parkinson's disease {{is the focus of}} both experimental and clinical investigations. Although there have been marked advances in the experimental and even clinical application of these xenogeneic transplantations, questions regarding the host's xenospecific immune response remain unanswered. It has been shown that human serum is able to <b>lyse</b> pfVM <b>tissue</b> by both anti-gal-gal and non-anti-gal-gal antibodies by complement activation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether interindividual differences exist in the levels of pfVM cell-specific IgM and IgG subclass antibodies, their ability to lyse pfVM cells in vitro and the relationship between both. Pig fetal VM cells were incubated with heat-inactivated serum from 10 different individuals and binding of IgM antibodies and IgG subclass antibodies to pfVM cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The ability to lyse pfVM cells was analyzed exposing Cr- 51 -labeled pfVM cells to fresh serum or isolated IgM and IgG from the same individuals and subsequent determination of released Cr- 51 from lysed cells. Strong differences were found between individuals in the levels of pfVM cell-specific IgM antibodies: antibody levels differed up to 40 -fold. pfVM-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 levels were only detectable in a few individuals. The ability to lyse pfVM cells ranged from negligible lysis up to 66. 5 % specific lysis. There was a strong correlation between the levels of individual pfVM-specific IgM antibodies and the ability to lyse pfVM cells in vitro. Isolated IgM, but not IgG, was able to lyse pfVM cells in the presence of complement. In conclusion, the interindividual differences in the levels of IgM with affinity for pfVM cells and their ability to lyse pfVM cells in vitro are considerable. Only few individuals possessed IgG 1 and IgG 2 subclass antibodies with affinity for pfVM.

40|$|In 1942, 53 % of {{medically}} treated {{patients with}} cirrhosis were dead 6 {{months after the}} onset of ascites. Only 30 % survived 1 year. This dismal outlook has improved only slightly with advances in medicine. Yet, some internists reject the peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) for this fatal condition {{even if they are}} aware that a diminished blood volume causes the abnormal sodium retention responsible for ascites. Their objections are based on life-threatening complications of PVS, especially post shunt coagulopathy (PSC). Blood shed into the peritoneal cavity becomes incoagulable. Such blood is immediately coagulated by a protocoagulant (soluble collagen) and concurrently <b>lysed</b> by <b>tissue</b> plasminogen activator (TPA) secreted by the peritoneal serosa. Wide zones of lysis surround peritoneal tissue placed on fibrin plates. Large volumes of ascitic fluid infused into circulating blood simulates the fate of blood shed into the peritoneal cavity with lysis playing the major role. Addition of ascitic fluid to normal platelet-rich plasma in vitro initiates clot lysis on thromboelastogram (TEG). Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) counteracts this lysis. EACA and clotting factors normalize the TEG and arrest PSC. Disposal of ascitic fluid at surgery prevents or ameliorates PSC. Mild PSC was encountered only twice in 150 + consecutive patients (1. 3 %) with only one case being clinically significant (0. 6 %). Severe PSC occurred seven times in 98 early shunt patients whose ascitic fluid was not discarded. Severe PSC requires shunt interruption and control of bleeding with clotting factors and EACA. Peritoneal lavage with saline prevents the recurrence of PSC on reopening the shunt. In four patients, EACA and clotting factors were adequate to arrest coagulopathy. Three earlier patients died of PSC before its cause and treatment were understood. Proper management eliminates this life-threatening complication, and PSC cannot be considered a deterrent to PVS. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is produced in experimental animals only by the injection of thrombin or thromboplastin. PSC is a distinct entity differing from DIC; EACA and not heparin is the antidote for PSC...|$|R
40|$|Incubation of rat striatal synaptosomes {{with the}} {{adenosine}} receptor agonist 2 -chloroadenosine (2 -CADO) produced a concentration-dependent increase of dopamine (DA) synthesis (about 50 % of control value). The effect was not additive with the stimulation produced by either 10 microM forskolin or 2 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Pretreatment of striatal synaptosomes with 2 -CADO produced an activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) which withstood washing and <b>lysing</b> of the <b>tissue.</b> This activation was largely {{independent of the}} presence of Ca 2 + ion in the preincubation medium and, when analyzed as a function of different concentrations of the pterin cofactor 6 -methyl- 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydropterin (0. 08 - 0. 4 mM), it was associated with an apparent increase in the Vmax of the enzyme. Quinpirole, a selective D 2 DA receptor agonist, reduced control synaptosomal DA synthesis and caused a persistent inhibition of TH activity. When added together with 2 -CADO, quinpirole depressed the stimulation of DA synthesis and TH activity produced by the adenosine analog. The effect of quinpirole was stereospecifically antagonized by the D 2 DA antagonist sulpiride. Quinpirole also inhibited the activation of TH elicited by a submaximal concentration of forskolin, but not that produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The inhibitory effect of quinpirole on basal and 2 -CADO-stimulated TH activities was mimicked by DA. These results indicate that presynaptic DA autoreceptors and adenosine A 2 receptors interact antagonistically in controlling DA synthesis in rat striatal synaptosomes presumably by exerting opposite inputs on a presynaptic adenylate cyclase system...|$|R
40|$|Background Rationale Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an {{irreversible}} disease reducing {{lung function}} via processes of inflammation, emphysema and fibrosis. Patient treatment options are limited including bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids that are poorly effective. Linked {{with a significant}} history of cigarette smoking, pathology is characterised by recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung (alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes: TH 1 and CD 8); dysregulated neutrophils and macrophages release <b>tissue</b> <b>lysing</b> proteases causing enlargement of airspaces (emphysema). Most severe pathology includes dysregulated epithelial repair and overgrowth of lung fibroblasts (fibrosis). The source of fibroblasts is not clear. Fibrosis in renal, liver and heart disease is partly mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) differentiation whereby epithelia acquire fibrotic biomarkers such as desmin, S 100 A 4 and α-smooth muscle actin. In lung fibrosis {{this has not been}} characterised, further the molecular mechanisms in the lung are poorly understood. Identifying these processes is key to developing improved future therapeutic interventions. Aims To characterise human COPD lungs for expression of EMT biomarkers compared to control subjects to determine the processes of lung fibrosis in COPD. Further, to identify the signalling mechanisms within the EMT tissue to identify the regulatory processes that may be intervened in future therapies. Finally, to assess primary human fibroblast responses to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and stretch forces to establish a new model of emphysema and lung fibrosis for future research. Methods Patients were recruited from the North West Lung Centre at the University Hospital of South Manchester who were undergoing lobectomy surgery as part of their normal clinical care. Lung resections were prepared for histochemical analysis by formalin fixing and wax embedding. 5 ul microtome slices were immunohistochemically stained for typical mesenchymal (EMT) and epithelia biomarkers.

40|$|Transplantation of {{embryonic}} human neural tissue can restore function {{in patients with}} Parkinson’s disease, {{but there is a}} severe shortage of donor tissue which limits the applicability of the technique. Embryonic neural tissue from other species, xenogeneic tissue, would provide a readily accessible donor tissue with the potential to help patients if the immunological reactions in the host could be prevented. Even if the immune responses in the brain are restricted and xenografts placed in the brain survive longer than when placed {{in other parts of the}} body, neural xenografts are ultimately rejected in untreated hosts. In this thesis, we show that porcine dopamine neurons can restore functional deficits when transplanted to hemi-parkinsonian rats. Between 6 and 9 weeks after implantation, the porcine neurons had matured to express a TH+ phenotype, extend axons into the host brain and functional effects were seen in the rats. The optimal age for the donor tissue was found to be embryonic days 26 - 27. There was no proliferation of porcine TH+ neurons after implantation, although porcine glial cells were observed to proliferate in the grafts. Conventional immunosuppression with cyclosporin A (CyA) did not completely protect porcine neural xenografts in rats from infiltration of immune cells and rejection. We therefore analysed the components involved in the rejection process and demonstrate that the immune response to the discordant neural xenografts is dependent on lymphocytes, but that macrophages, microglia and immunoglobulins are also involved in the rejection process. However, Natural Killer cells that are crucially important in the rejection of organ xenografts do not seem to be important for neural xenografts in the brain, which is beneficial. We further show that human complement factors can <b>lyse</b> porcine neural <b>tissue</b> via antibody binding in vitro, but there was no clear protective effect when we grafted porcine neural tissue to complement deficient mice. The role of complement factors and antibodies in the rejection of discordant neural xenografts appears to be an enhancement of the cellular immune responses, in contrast to any direct lytic effects or hyper acute rejection. A combination of CyA or tacrolimus with prednisolone or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), suppressing broader aspects of the immune response than CyA only, led to an unimpaired graft survival for 14 weeks in rats. We also tried an alternative method of manipulating the immune responses, short-term blockade of co-stimulatory signals, which potentially would be more specific and have less side-effects. Injections with CTLA 4 Ig and antibodies against LFA- 1 during the first 10 days after grafting led to large grafts with minimal infiltration of immune cells at four weeks in mice lacking the co-stimulatory molecule CD 40 ligand. In conclusion, embryonic porcine neural tissue is a promising donor tissue for transplantation in neurodegenerative disorders. The treatment of preference would be tacrolimus and MMF, in combination with short-term depletion of xenoreactive antibodies during the period that the blood-brain barrier is open. Before clinical trials are initiated, we suggest that the immunosuppressive regimens are tested in primate models and that the methods with co-stimulation blockade are investigated further...|$|R
