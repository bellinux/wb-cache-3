5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
25|$|In Book Eight of the Odyssey, {{the blind}} singer Demodocus tells of how Aphrodite {{committed}} adultery with Ares, {{the god of}} war. The sun-god Helios saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> captured adulterers, but Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release. Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the Charites. This narrative probably originated as a Greek folk tale, originally independent of the Odyssey.|$|E

25|$|At {{the castle}} of Doris, {{preparations}} {{are under way}} for the celebrations of the young countess Raymonda’s name day. Countess Sybille, her aunt, chides those who are present, including Raymonda's two friends Henrietta and Clémence, and the two troubadours Béranger and Bernard, for their idleness and their passion for dancing, telling them of the legendary White Lady, the protector of the castle, who warns the Doris household every time one of its members is in danger and casts punishment on {{those who do not}} fulfil their duties. The young people <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> countess’s superstitions and continue to celebrate. The seneschal of the Doris castle announces the arrival of a messenger, sent by Raymonda's fiancé, the noble crusader knight, Jean de Brienne, bearing a letter for his beloved. Raymonda rejoices when she reads that King Andre II of Hungary, for whom Jean de Brienne has fought, is returning home in triumph and Jean de Brienne will arrive at the Doris castle the next day for their wedding. Suddenly, the celebrations are interrupted when the seneschal announces the arrival of an uninvited Saracen knight, Abderakhman and his entourage, who have stopped at the castle seeking shelter for the night. Captivated by Raymonda's beauty, Abderakhman falls in love with her at once and resolves to do anything to win her. The party lasts late into the night and, left alone and exhausted by the day, Raymonda lies down on a couch and falls asleep. As she sleeps, she begins to dream that the White Lady appears illuminated by the moonlight and, with an imperious gesture, orders Raymonda to follow her.|$|E
500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see – the side that can <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> diva jokes, <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Paul Feig, making it his sixth directorial credit for the series. Eisenberg and Stupnitsky later noted that, because the episode {{was the first to}} be filmed following the strike, there was [...] "a great, loose vibe on set", and as such, many of the actors would break character and <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> jokes. The majority of the episode took place at Michael's condo. This was the same location used in the second season entry [...] "Office Olympics".

500|$|Erik Wiese, {{a member}} of the SpongeBob SquarePants crew until 2007, {{considers}} [...] "Sailor Mouth" [...] to be his favorite episode, mainly due to its random and satirical nature, saying [...] "Sometimes SpongeBob just catches me off-guard." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes. She said [...] "'Sailor Mouth' just barely missed being in the number one slot." [...] Basile praised the episode's plot and called it [...] "genius because children can relate to the forbidden thrill of using curse words, and adults can <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> parody of TV censorship."

500|$|Nobody, {{according}} to Hazlitt (voicing his disagreement with Dr. Johnson), excelled Shakespeare in tragedy; although his comedies could be first rate, other writers, such as Molière, Cervantes, and Rabelais, excelled {{him in some}} types of comedy. It was in the comedy of [...] "Nature" [...] that Shakespeare was supreme. This is not comedy that satirises the [...] "ridiculous" [...] but is rather the comedy of [...] "convivial laughter", which gently mocks human foibles and invites us to share in innocent pleasures. [...] Of this kind of comedy, Twelfth Night is [...] "one of the most delightful". Unlike the [...] "comedy of artificial life, of wit, of satire," [...] Shakespeare's more gentle comedy [...] "makes us <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> follies of mankind, not despise them [...] Shakespear's comic genius resembles the bee rather in its power of extracting sweets from weeds or poisons, than in leaving a sting behind it." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} the backing track in the car while he was going to the studio. He started playing with the Roland Jupiter 8 keyboard, while singer Simon Le Bon was working with the lyrics. The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Little Red Riding Hood, and the repeating of the word [...] "do" [...] {{at the end of each}} verse takes its melody from the instrumentals in Gordon Lightfoot's song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics. The <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the song and the screams during the song's fade-out were performed and recorded live by Rhodes' girlfriend at the time.|$|E

He added that the episode feels fresher because of the [...] "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> characters and the jokes." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally [...] "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...] ". Dana Stevens of Slate magazine reported that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] offered a chance to punch up the show with some [...] "unusually broad sight gags."

He was also aided by James Doohan's son, Chris, and Tommy Gormley, the film's Glaswegian first assistant director. Pegg described Scotty as a positive Scottish stereotype, noting [...] "Scots are the first people to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that they drink and fight a bit", and that Scotty comes {{from a long line of}} Scots with technical expertise, such as John Logie Baird and Alexander Graham Bell.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E

In Beiste's fourth appearance, for the episode entitled [...] "Never Been Kissed", the character's storyline was met with criticism, though the acting of Jones was not. Reiter questioned why Beiste was made to look to {{high school students to}} [...] "gauge her own desirability", an element she found [...] "hazy and creepy". James Poniewozik of Time criticized the depiction of Beiste as an object of pity, and felt that Will's behavior was worse than the students' when he acted with [...] "amazing condescension" [...] and kissed the coach. Both Poniewozik and MTV's Aly Semigran disliked the way viewers were made complicit in Beiste's humiliation by being invited to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> character's expense, and Linda Holmes of NPR criticized Glee for denying Beiste dignity, with the observation that such a plot would never have been given to Kurt. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented negatively on the way Glee plays up Beiste's [...] "masculine nature" [...] while simultaneously lecturing viewers against mocking Beiste. He called the kiss [...] "somehow both heartfelt and completely horrifying". IGN's Robert Canning praised Jones in her [...] "best performance this season", as well as Beiste's [...] "raw and real" [...] confession to Will.|$|E

IGN's Colin Moriarty said one can [...] "have a hardy <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> high level of dysfunctionality" [...] with the episode while highlighted the one-armed therapist and mainly the interactions between Monk and Harold as the responsible for its humor. On his blog Cultural Leanings, critic Myles McNutt affirmed Shalhoub did a [...] " [...] comic performance" [...] and that [...] "It features most of Monk's best qualities: his feud with fellow patient Harold, his insecurity about his mental health, his reaction to a new therapist with only one arm, and his broad comedy." [...] Although disliked the scene in which Harold tooks a shoot as it was made in a cliched way, Finley enjoyed seem Dr. Kroger getting more attention. Similarly, Raven Snook, a TV Guide contributor, appreciated {{the fact that the}} doctor's home life was explored in the episode. Jon Weisman, writing for Variety, selected the scene in which Monk manifests the five stages of grief the best scene of the episode. The scene was also highlighted by Robert Licuria of the Los Angeles Times, who nevertheless said the episode felt [...] "a bit 'same old same old.'" [...] Chris Beachum, writing for the same newspaper, stated it was [...] "the weakest episode" [...] of the series to ever being submitted for the Primetime Emmy Awards, and, unlike other reviewers, considered the grief scene [...] "just too forced and 'showy.'" ...|$|E
