40|$|Many <b>lawyers</b> lie <b>to</b> {{their clients}} by saying, “Everything {{you tell me}} is confidential” despite the {{existence}} of some rules that require <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> disclose client confidences and others that permit <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> disclose confidences to protect themselves or collect fees.

This Article offers a different approach. It seeks to promote an honest and open dialogue between lawyer and client that will create a relationship of mutual trust and will make it more likely both that clients will share information and will gain an accurate understanding of the confidentiality issues relevant to their representation...|$|R

5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood.

5|$|Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite her into a <b>lawyer</b> <b>to</b> reflect a family that closer resembled their own. At one point, Clair had also been envisioned as a Dominican housewife who speaks Spanish when frustrated, inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, but this idea was also abandoned. Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the role by exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant with their child during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of The <b>Lawyer</b> <b>to</b> his Muse, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An Abridgement of Architecture, two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.|$|E
5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and <b>lawyer</b> <b>to</b> insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer.

Jacob is dragged away from the wreckage by a bespectacled man.

Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who warn him against further investigation. He jumps from the moving car and is injured. He is taken to a hospital where he is restrained on a stretcher and wheeled down corridors full of grotesquely deformed patients before doctors, wielding barbaric metal instruments, inform him he is dead.|$|E
