50|$|The {{relationship}} of armature rotation and the AC output {{can be seen}} in this series of pictures. Due to the circular motion of the armature against the straight <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> a variable number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> will be cut even at a constant speed of the motion. At zero degrees, the rectangular arm of the armature does not cut any <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> giving zero voltage output. As the armature arm rotates at a constant speed toward the 90° position, more lines are cut. The <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are cut at most when the armature is at the 90° position, giving out the most current on one direction. As it turns toward the 180° position, lesser number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are cut, giving out lesser voltage until it becomes zero again at the 180° position. The voltage starts to increase again as the armature heads to the opposite pole at the 270° position. Toward this position, the current is generated on the opposite direction, giving out the maximum voltage on the opposite side. The voltage decrease again as it completes the full rotation. In one rotation, the AC output is produced with one complete cycle as represented in the sine wave.|$|R

50|$|The {{primary reason}} for muzzle rise is that for nearly all firearms, the {{centerline}} of the barrel is above the center of contact between the shooter and the firearms' grips and stock. The recoil forces from the bullet being fired and the propellant gases exiting the muzzle act directly down the centerline of the barrel. If that <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is above {{the center of the}} contact points, this creates a couple, a rotational force. That couple causes the firearm to rotate, and the muzzle end to rise upwards.|$|E
50|$|In a magnetized, {{perfectly}} conducting fluid, {{the magnetic}} forces behave in {{some very important}} respects as though the elements of fluid were connected with elastic bands: trying to displace such an element perpendicular to a magnetic <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> causes an attractive force proportional to the displacement, like a spring under tension. Normally, such a force is restoring, a strongly stabilizing influence that would allow a type of magnetic wave to propagate. If the fluid medium is not stationary but rotating, however, attractive forces can actually be destabilizing. The MRI {{is a consequence of}} this surprising behavior.|$|E
50|$|The {{involute}} {{has some}} properties {{that makes it}} extremely important to the gear industry: If two intermeshed gears have teeth with the profile-shape of involutes (rather than, for example, a traditional triangular shape), they form an involute gear system. Their relative rates of rotation are constant while the teeth are engaged, and also, the gears always make contact along a single steady <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> With teeth of other shapes, the relative speeds and forces rise and fall as successive teeth engage, resulting in vibration, noise, and excessive wear. For this reason, nearly all modern gear teeth bear the involute shape.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the nineteenth}} century, James Clerk-Maxwell {{was unable to}} explain the linkage between gravity and electromagnetism. He {{realized}} that gravitational <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> must involve a pressure, {{as is the case}} with magnetic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> when they are involved in mutual repulsion. He also realized that the pressure in the magnetic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> acts laterally due to centrifugal force in a sea of molecular vortices, but he couldn’t seem to similarly explain the pressure in the gravitational <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> [1]. It will now be suggested that gravitational <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are actually <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> tension, and that Maxwell’s molecular vortices are dielectric in nature. The linear polarization of these dipolar vortices, caused by the gravitational field, will increase the centrifugal pressure which is exerted laterally, and this pressure will result in a repulsive force in competition with the attractive force. The attractive force, being a monopole field, will obey the inverse square law, whereas the repulsive force, being a dipole field, will obey the inverse cube law. Hence if the charge of an object increases, the inverse cube law relationship for the surrounding repulsive force field will lead to a reversal threshold, where it will dominate over the attractive force. The charge can increase electrostatically or because of inertia. In the latter case, the repulsive force field is the large scale centrifugal force...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in Faraday's {{extended}} {{sense is}} synonymous with Maxwell's line of induction. According to J.J. Thomson, Faraday usually discusses lines of force as chains of polarized particles in a dielectric, yet sometimes Faraday discusses them as having an existence all their own as in stretching across a vacuum. In addition to lines of force, J.J. Thomson—similar to Maxwell—also calls them tubes of electrostatic inductance, or simply Faraday tubes. [...] From the 20th century perspective, lines of force are energy linkages embedded in a 19th-century unified field theory that led to more mathematically and experimentally sophisticated concepts and theories, including Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, and Einstein's relativity.|$|E
50|$|The muzzle rises {{primarily}} because, {{for most}} firearms, the {{centerline of the}} barrel is above the center of contact between the shooter and the firearm's grip and stock. The reactive forces from the fired bullet and propellant gases exiting the muzzle act directly down the centerline of the barrel. If that <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is above {{the center of the}} contact points, this creates a moment or torque (rotational force) that causes the firearm to rotate and the muzzle to rise. The M1946 Sieg automatic rifle had an unusual muzzle brake that made the rifle climb downward, but enabled the user to fire it with one hand in full automatic.|$|E
50|$|The {{electron}} optics of camera tubes differ considerably. Electrons inside these long focus coils take helical paths as they travel {{along the length}} of the tube. The center (think local axis) of one of those helices is like a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> of the magnetic field. While the electrons are traveling, the helices essentially don't matter. Assuming that they start from a point, the electrons will focus to a point again at a distance determined by the strength of the field. Focusing a tube with this kind of coil is simply a matter of trimming the coil's current. In effect, the electrons travel along the lines of force, although helically, in detail.|$|E
