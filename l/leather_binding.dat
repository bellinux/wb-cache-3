25|$|The {{next step}} is the {{restoration}} of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full <b>leather</b> <b>binding</b> with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.|$|E

500|$|The St Cuthbert Gospel, {{also known}} as the Stonyhurst Gospel or the St Cuthbert Gospel of St John, is an early 8th-century pocket gospel book, written in Latin. [...] Its finely {{decorated}} <b>leather</b> <b>binding</b> is the earliest known Western bookbinding to survive, and both the 94 vellum folios and the binding are in outstanding condition for a book of this age.

500|$|The church {{struggled}} {{to eliminate the}} pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings. [...] Kings might be buried with a sceptre, and bishops with a crozier, their respective symbols of office. [...] The 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel, with a unique Insular original <b>leather</b> <b>binding,</b> was recovered from St Cuthbert's coffin, itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert's personal copy, which he had very likely scribed himself. [...] The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, {{as those of the}} Black Prince still are in Canterbury Cathedral. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white winding-sheet, as being all that would be required at the Second Coming. [...] For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available {{for the use of the}} living. [...] The use of a rich cloth pall to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black. [...] They were usually then given to the Church to use for vestments or other decorations.|$|E

2500|$|The lower or {{back cover}} {{is older than}} the text and presumably added from another book, perhaps around the time the text was written. [...] It was perhaps {{originally}} a front cover. [...] It is the only largely intact example of a very early Insular metal bookcover to survive, although we know from documentary records that famous works like the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels had them. [...] A few Irish cumdachs or metal book-shrines or reliquaries for books have survived, which show broadly comparable styles, and use crosses as the central feature of their designs. The style is close {{to that of the}} other main survival of essentially Anglo-Saxon work executed on the Continent, the Tassilo Chalice, and also a number of works executed by local workshops in several parts of Europe. However, the St Cuthbert Gospel (British Library), a decorated <b>leather</b> <b>binding</b> thought to date from around 700, is the earliest intact European binding.|$|E
2500|$|Luxury medieval {{books for}} the library had leather covers decorated, often all over, with tooling (incised lines or patterns), blind stamps, and often small metal pieces of furniture. [...] Medieval stamps showed animals and figures {{as well as the}} vegetal and {{geometric}} designs that would later dominate book cover decoration. [...] Until the end of the period books were not usually stood up on shelves in the modern way. The most functional books were bound in plain white vellum over boards, and had a brief title hand-written on the spine. Techniques for fixing gold leaf under the tooling and stamps were imported from the Islamic world in the 15th century, and thereafter the gold-tooled <b>leather</b> <b>binding</b> has remained the conventional choice for high quality bindings for collectors, though cheaper bindings that only used gold for the title on the spine, or not at all, were always more common. Although the arrival of the printed book vastly increased the number of books produced in Europe, it did not in itself change the various styles of binding used, except that vellum became much less used.|$|E

He was a tall, lean man, with thin, white hair and blue eyes, but his wrinkled cheeks were still rosy; incessant snuff-taking had given a special character to his nose. And sometimes, taking upon him the spirit of Catullus, he wrote verses to Lesbia, or, beneath the breast-plate of Marcus Aurelius, he felt his heart beat bravely as he marched against the barbarians; he was Launcelot, and he made charming speeches to Guinevere as he kissed her long white hand....|$|E

60|$|The {{theories}} and speculations of both these parties, and, we may say, of all intermediate parties and persons, {{prove to be}} things which the Eternal Veracity did not accept; things superficial, ephemeral, which already a near Posterity, finding them already dead and brown-leafed, is about to suppress and forget. The Spiritualism of England, for those godless years, is, as it were, all forgettable. Much has been written: but the perennial Scriptures of Mankind have had small accession: from all English Books, in rhyme or prose, in <b>leather</b> <b>binding</b> or in paper wrappage, how many verses {{have been added to}} these? Our most melodious Singers have sung as from the throat outwards: from the inner Heart of Man, from the great Heart of Nature, through no Pope or Philips, has there come any tone. The Oracles have been dumb. In brief, the Spoken Word of England has not been true. The Spoken Word of England turns out to have been trivial; of short endurance; not valuable, not available as a Word, except for the passing day. It has been accordant with transitory Semblance; discordant with eternal Fact. It has been unfortunately not a Word, but a Cant; a helpless involuntary Cant, nay too often a cunning voluntary one: either way, a very mournful Cant; the Voice not of Nature and Fact, but of something other than these.|$|E
60|$|The first lecture says, or {{tries to}} say, that, life being very short, and the quiet hours of it few, {{we ought to}} waste none of them in reading valueless books; and that {{valuable}} books should, in a civilized country, be within the reach of every one, printed in excellent form, for a just price; but not in any vile, vulgar, or, by reason of smallness of type, physically injurious form, at a vile price. For we none of us need many books, and those which we need ought to be clearly printed, on the best paper, and strongly bound. And though we are, indeed, now, a wretched and poverty-struck nation, and hardly able to keep soul and body together, still, as no person in decent circumstances would put on his table confessedly bad wine, or bad meat, without being ashamed, so he need not have on his shelves ill-printed or loosely and wretchedly-stitched books; for though few can be rich, yet every man who honestly exerts himself may, I think, still provide, {{for himself and his}} family, good shoes, good gloves, strong harness for his cart or carriage horses, and stout <b>leather</b> <b>binding</b> for his books. And I would urge upon every young man, as the beginning of his due and wise provision for his household, to obtain as soon as he can, by the severest economy, a restricted, serviceable, and steadily--however slowly-- increasing, series of books for use through life; making his little library, of all the furniture in his room, the most studied and decorative piece; every volume having its assigned place, like a little statue in its niche, and one of the earliest and strictest lessons to the children of the house being how to turn the pages of their own literary possessions lightly and deliberately, with no chance of tearing or dog's ears.|$|E
