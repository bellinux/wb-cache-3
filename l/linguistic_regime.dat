40|$|Drawing on {{the concept}} of {{representative}} bureaucracy, this article examines how two multilingual states - Canada and Switzerland - deal with issues related to the participation of different linguistic communities in the federal public service. Following a political mobilization of the linguistic cleavage, strategies to promote multilingualism in the public service have been adopted in both countries. The Canadian strategy focuses on equal treatment of Anglophones and Francophones in the public service. In Switzerland, adequate representation of the linguistic communities is the primary goal. These differences are explained by the characteristics of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regimes</b> in each of the two countries {{as well as by the}} peculiarities of consociational democracy in Switzerland. In both countries, the linguistic origins of public administration staff, overall, mirrors the proportions of the linguistic communities in the wider society. Within administrative units, however, linguistic diversity is hampered by the logics of language rationalization, where minorities are under pressure to communicate in the language of the majorit...|$|R
50|$|States {{shoulder}} language costs, {{because it}} maintains themselves {{by means of}} it, as does business which needs communication competence. Florian Coulmas discusses the language-related expenditures of government and business in Language and economy. In the same book he also discusses the role of language as a commodity, because languages can behave like economic systems. That is why socio-economic ecologies are (dis)favorable to particular languages. The spread of languages depends in an essential way on economic conditions. Language can be an expression of symbolic power. However, changes in the linguistic {{map of the world}} show that these are also powerful linked to economic developments in the world. Assigning an economic value to a certain language in the linguistic market place means vesting it with some of the privileges and power related to that language. Most language communities in the world practice this policy without any concern about reciprocity in language learning investments, forgetting the pursuit of linguistic justice as parity of esteem and while <b>linguistic</b> <b>regimes</b> are sometimes very unjust.|$|R

40|$|Most {{accounts}} of nationalism {{and national identity}} include {{the idea of a}} ‘national language’ as a foundational element and key organising principle, yet even before the advent of new technologies of communication these defining codes were rarely, if ever, contained within national boundaries. The coexistence of what are perceived as distinct linguistic varieties (‘languages’) is therefore the normal condition of the nation-state. This contradiction between the multilingual reality of individuals and communities and what Ingrid Gogolin calls the ‘monolingual habitus’ is fundamental to Susan Gal’s (2006) discussion of the ironies of <b>linguistic</b> <b>regimes</b> in contemporary Europe that continue to be based on Herderian principles in spite of the pluralising rhetoric of European institutions. In this paper, I start from Gal’s observations on migration, minorities, and multilingualism in Europe and consider their implications for a research agenda on the politics of language that takes account of the multiple layers of language policy {{on the one hand and}} the complexity of individual experiences with language on the other. I then illustrate this agenda with reference to a project on the present relationship between the German language and different forms of social identification in central Europe...|$|R
40|$|In the European Union {{language}} regime debate, theorists of multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism have framed their arguments {{in reference to}} different theories of justice and democracy. Philippe Van Parijs advocates the diffusion of a lingua franca, namely English, as means of changing {{the scale of the}} justificatory community to the European level and allowing the creation of a transnational demos. Paradoxically, one key dimension of democracy has hardly been addressed in this discussion: the question of the democratic legitimacy of {{language regime}} choices and citizens’ preferences on the different language regime scenarios. Addressing the question of the congruence of language policy choices operated by national and European elites and ordinary citizens’ preferences, this paper argues first that the dimension of democratic legitimacy is crucial and needs {{to be taken into account}} in discussions around linguistic justice. Criticizing the assumption of a direct correspondence between individuals’ language learning choices and citizens’ language regime preferences made by different authors, the analysis shows the ambivalence of citizens’ preferences measured by survey data. The article secondly raises the question of the boundaries of the political community at which the expression of citizens’ preferences should be measured and demonstrates that the outcome and the fairness of territorial <b>linguistic</b> <b>regimes</b> may vary significantly according to the level at which this democratic legitimacy is taken into account...|$|R

40|$|Samenvatting: The {{linguistic}} {{diversity in the}} European Union is generally viewed as {{an essential component of}} the European identity, but the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the EU institutions (with eleven official and working languages) is not undisputed. In addition, the upcoming enlargements will complicate greatly the continuation of the present practices as new Member States bring new official languages. As a result, the debate about possible reforms is likely to be boosted by the necessity to prepare EU institutions for further enlargment. The present regime of institutional multilingualism is criticised from different angles, resulting in three options for the future. In this paper the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of EU institutions is discussed in relation to general ideas about the nature of this supranational political system. Supranationalism is treated here as a program to supersede nationalism. Three variants are distinguished: pacified nationalism, neo-nationalism and post-nationalism. The paper examines how these different visions of Europe shed different lights on the issue of multilingualism (in terms of communication, identity and power) and its institutionalisation in the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the core instituions of the European Union. Although the three models are compatible with several arrangements, they support or oppose them for different reasons. Besides, they differ regarding the significance of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the EU institutions for the whole polity and their ability to steer linguistic practice...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the opening of an international meeting. English Lingua Franca as the official language of the meeting is actively discussed and negotiated by the participants. The analysis highlights the issues identified by the participants themselves in choosing a <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> for their professional exchanges. The English Lingua Franca regime is aimed at facilitating the participation of some of the participants, but creates problems for others, too. The chairman deals with this situation in an embodied way (through his gaze, gesture, bodily postures, and by the way in which he walks through the room), displaying that he orients to different member categories (such as 'anglophone', 'anglophone who can understand French', 'francophile', etc.) as benefitting from or resisting against the definitive language choice...|$|E

40|$|The EU {{is about}} to enter into an {{expansion}} that will mean the incorporation of 10 new official languages, {{many of which have}} a lesser demographic dimension and cultural vitality than Catalan. This article comments that the current situation of Catalan in the EU is unjustifiable, scandalous even, and will be even more so following amplification. The foreseeable modification of the EU's <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> will tend towards the reduction of the working languages for reasons of efficiency, but the amplification of its official languages should permit the inclusion of languages like Catalan, which are official in their own territories. Nor is there any reason why Catalan should be excluded from European linguistic programs which are participated in even by the languages of countries outside the EU. Linguistic communities with legislative powers should be able to regulate the public use of languages in their territory just as states do; furthermore, the EU itself indicates that only political independence guarantees equal treatment...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} a brief {{evaluation}} of the regulatory environment of language use in Transylvania, Romania based on Van Parijs’ conceptual toolkit presented in his 2011 book Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World. This <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> is a coercive hybrid regulation containing elements stemming from both the categorical regime (personality principle) and territoriality. In municipalities or counties where the official use of minority languages is permitted, it is typically present in a conjunctive manner, but its enforcement is weak and inconsistent. The principle of territorially coercive linguistic subdivision – proposed by Van Parijs as an optimal solution for a greater linguistic justice – is not accommodated {{in any of the}} fields of official communication and under present political circumstances it has no further plausibility. A hypothetical alternative for the territorially coercive regime would be the introduction of English as a lingua franca in interethnic communication. We argued that this latter option would be fair only if English could entirely replace the official languages currently in use or it would receive a fully equivalent status at least in those regions where a considerable number of linguistic minorities live...|$|E

40|$|The {{territory}} of the European Union {{is made up of}} a rich and wide-ranging universe of languages, which is not only circumscribed to the "state languages". The existence of multilingualism is one of Europe’s defining characteristic and it should remain so in the constantly evolving model of Europe’s political structure. Linguistic rights have been dealt with under Community law through various viewpoints. The <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the European Union is essentially of a legal nature. As a consequence of the legal regime of the languages there is a graduation between them. The building of political and economic Europe based on the "state language" concept affects the European linguistic diversity itself. Nevertheless, the express legal recognition to the European linguistic diversity takes place in a new context: the context of the opening of the European Union to fundamental rights. The respect for the linguistic diversity is shaped as an aim of the Union, identifying a sphere of action. A sphere of action that has to materialise itself with specific measures. We will see if there is enough legal basis to say that linguistic rights do form part of the general principles of law. If linguistic rights are considered as general principles under Community law, when do they have to apply...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of the legal language framework in a hypothetical sovereign Catalonia is not primarily a theoretical exercise or {{the expression of a}} particular political position. In order to achieve a satisfactory arrangement for a multilingual Catalonia in a context of sovereignty, the political process and the social legitimation of this future <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> should be taken into account. The identification {{of the majority of the}} society with the political project of sovereignty depends on linguistic factors which are inseparable from other collective aspirations. Along the different stages of the process (initial situation, access to sovereignty, constitutional process and the new institutional and legal framework), there is a number of factors that can have a great influence upon the process itself such as the sociolinguistic composition of the population, as the equitable management of diversity, as the idea of citizenship, and as a approach to multilingualism. It is from these factors that we must foresee the eventual official status of languages and its institutional and legal framework. Decisions on the official status which is attributed to languages involve socio-political responsibilities that cannot be overlooked if one aims to ensure both the identification of a majority with the aims pursued by sovereignty and the full recovery of Catalan and Aranese Occitan as heritage languages of Catalonia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Whereas the {{linguistic}} governance of the European Union and its institutions {{is the object}} of a heated political debate, there is no such problem yet in North America. This disregard for a “linguistic balance of power” is likely to be temporary. In the case of a deepening in North American Integration such a political debate is bound to emerge. In such case the experience of the ongoing debate in Europe could be invaluable. It is a highly political as well as a highly technical debate which has not much to do with purely linguistic considerations and more with political ones. Although it is often considered as inevitable, choosing English as the only regional communication language in Europe or North America is neither neutral nor costless. To frame these discussions, the notion of “soft power” was developed both in the United States and in Europe, although with different approaches. As theorized by Joseph Nye, “soft power” describes the ability of a State to influence directly or indirectly the behaviour or the interests of other actors through cultural or ideological means. These ideas are an adaptation in International Relations of A. Gramsci’s notion of hegemony where dominant ideas are particularly powerful because they are assumed as implicit aspects of a more explicit ideology. It is also related to P. Bourdieu’s ideas about the symbolic value and thus domination of one particular language over others, based on misrecognition (méconnaissance). To us, language is the most concrete, measurable and should we say scientific way to observe the diffusion of soft power. In this regard, the main focus will be made in three languages that can still be an instrument of power in international relations: English, Spanish and French. Is a regional <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> desirable and possible in North America? Is the European linguistic policy successful and is it a useful reference? These are the questions we shall consider in this article. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the following question: do proponents and {{opponents in the}} linguistic disputes in Catalonia and Flanders prioritise individual or group-oriented rights? The dispute in Catalonia is {{about the use of}} languages in the Catalan education system, while the dispute in Flanders is about the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> in certain municipalities around Brussels. Crucially, both are made of competing normative-laden political arguments. Drawing on interviews and document analysis, the thesis situates the conflicting political arguments within the scholarship on the compatibility between liberalism and nationalism. The central argument of the thesis is that the Catalan and Flemish linguistic disputes occur within liberal nationalism. Proponents in Catalonia and Flanders argue in a form of liberal nationalism that is more nationalist than liberal, although the nationalist dimension is more explicit in Catalonia; opponents in Flanders combine liberal nationalism with classical liberalism; and opponents in Catalonia argue in a form of classical liberalism that relies on liberal nationalist elements. In short, the four positions in the two debates participate in different forms and to different degrees in liberal nationalism. The findings suggest that nationalism {{is an important factor in}} making sense of the paradox that the normative consensus on political liberalism does not translate into political consensus in these specific cases. It is hoped that the findings of this thesis will make two main contributions. The first is an explanatory contribution to improve the understanding of the Catalan and Flemish linguistic disputes: the disputes are not between liberals and nationalists, but between liberal nationalists. The second is a theory-building contribution to refine the theoretical debate about individual and group-specific rights: liberal nationalist scholars run the risk of being unable to account for the national attachments many people experience in ‘the real world’ if, in their efforts to build acceptable liberal theories, they circumscribe their defence of national membership to its instrumental role for individual autonomy. In addition, their conceptualisation of nations as bounded and homogeneous seems to be built upon flimsy empirical grounds...|$|E
40|$|In Luxembourgish {{legislation}} {{the term}} “international protection” includes both refugee status and subsidiary protection status. Integration of beneficiaries of international protection into the Luxembourgish labour market might appear quite unproblematic at first glance. From a legal point of view, the access is indeed very much open to both beneficiaries of international protection {{as well as}} beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. As from 2006 onwards, the legislator proceeded with an approximation of both statuses, providing the same rights to both types of beneficiaries of international protection. As soon as the applicants are granted international protection they are authorised to engage in employed or self-employed activities under the same conditions as Luxembourgish nationals, with the exceptionof civil servant jobs. This is also true {{for most of the}} support measures that aim to advance or enhance the access to employment, whether on the level of education, vocational training, language learning, recognition of diploma, counselling, social aid or access to housing. In each of those areas, the beneficiaries of international may in principle benefit from equivalent access as provided to other migrants, third-countrynationals or Luxembourgish nationals. Yet, the reality on the ground seldom matches the aims of the legislative framework. Effective access to the labour market remains a significant challenge for beneficiaries of international protection in order to fully integrate in Luxembourgish society. The <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> as well as the high demands in terms of language requirements constitute a first major hurdle, both at the level of education/vocational training and the labour market. Rather than being able to immediately access the regular education system, respectively the labour market, refugees must first engage in a learning process sometimes coupled with administrative procedures (i. e. recognition of diplomas) that may significantly slow down the integration process. The transition period that begins once the applicant is granted international protection status appears to be particularly challenging. Indeed, several measures from which the applicants for international protection benefited during the procedure will no longer be available once they are granted the status. Thus, social aid, including housing, provided to international protection seekers will no longer be applicable to refugees. Even though national authorities have implemented several specific targeted measures in order to facilitate the transition period (i. e. progressive financial contribution to accommodation costs), it remains a phase of instability and uncertainty for the refugees and their families. This also stresses the need for employment-related support measures, which in Luxembourg are implemented in a more general integration framework. Thus, most of the support measures that exist for beneficiaries of international protection are not tailored to them in particular, but they are also open to other types of migrants or foreigners living in Luxembourg...|$|E
