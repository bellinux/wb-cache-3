5|$|Certain {{scholars}} have always defended {{the value of}} specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, {{has argued that the}} lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' <b>Lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as <b>Lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these {{are not part of the}} original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E

Her extensive knowledge of history and languages, her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of feminist historiography are reflected in these works.|$|E
