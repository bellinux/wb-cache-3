2500|$|How {{traffic signals}} are {{designed}} and implemented directly impacts cyclists. For instance, poorly adjusted vehicle detector systems, used to trigger signal changes, may not correctly detect cyclists. This can leave cyclists {{in the position}} of having to [...] "run" [...] red lights if no motorized vehicle arrives to trigger a signal change. Some cities use urban adaptive traffic control systems (UTCs), which use <b>linked</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> to manage traffic in response to changes in demand. There is an argument that using a UTC system merely to provide for increased capacity for motor traffic will simply drive growth in such traffic. However, there are more direct negative impacts. For instance, where signals are arranged to provide motor traffic with so called green waves, this can create [...] "red waves" [...] for other road users such as cyclists and public transport services. Traffic managers in Copenhagen have now turned this approach on its head and are linking cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane to provide green waves for rush hour cycle-traffic. However, this would still not resolve the problem of red-waves for slow (old and young) and fast (above average fitness) cyclists. Cycling-specific measures that can be applied at traffic signals include the use of advanced stop lines and/or bypasses. In some cases cyclists might be given a free-turn or a signal bypass if turning into a road on the nearside.|$|E

40|$|After {{decades of}} decline, {{recreational}} and commuter cycling {{are becoming more}} popular in many Australasian cities. This renewed popularity is encouraging {{from the perspectives of}} sustainable transport and public health. A major concern to governments at all levels, however, is the higher crash risk that cyclists face, compared with drivers or passengers in motor vehicles, particularly when cyclists ride on roads. Transportation professionals should understand the level of risk that cyclists face within various parts of the road network and the measures that can be employed to mitigate that risk. This paper presents research findings from three main safety studies undertaken in New Zealand with the use of data from cities in New Zealand and in Adelaide, Australia. The research involved both generalized linear modeling and before-after, control-impact methods. Across the various studies, crash, traffic, and cycle volumes and layout data were collected for urban road <b>links,</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>signals,</b> and roundabouts. Flow-only models demonstrated a safety-in-numbers effect: crash risk per cyclist was shown to be lower as cycle volumes increased. When other variables were added to the models, it was possible to understand the impact on various crash types of factors such as road section length, motor vehicle speed, visibility, presence and type of cycle facilities, and lane and road width. Before-and-after analysis was employed to help identify the presence of any bias in the sites that had received cycle facilities. Research findings were mixed on the capacity of cycle facilities to improve safety. Well-designed facilities of adequate width and painted with color appeared to perform best. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Hippocampal {{synaptic}} plasticity involves both membrane trafficking events and intracellular signaling, but how these are coordinated {{is far from}} clear. The endosomal transport of glutamate receptors {{in and out of}} the postsynaptic membrane responds to multiple signaling cascades triggered by synaptic activity. In this work, we have identified adaptor protein containing a plekstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL 1) as a crucial element <b>linking</b> <b>trafficking</b> and <b>signaling</b> during {{synaptic plasticity}}. We show that APPL 1 knockdown specifically impairs PI 3 Kdependent forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and metabotropic-glutamate-receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). Indeed, we demonstrate that APPL 1 is required for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP) pathway in response to LTP induction. This requirement can be bypassed by membrane localization of PI 3 K and is related to phosphoinositide binding. Interestingly, inhibitors of PDK 1 (also known as PDPK 1) and Akt have no effect on LTP expression. Therefore, we conclude that APPL 1 gates PI 3 K activation at the plasma membrane upon LTP induction, which is then relayed by downstream PIP effectors that are different from PDK 1 and Akt.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{alterations}} in genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), namely FLT 3, c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, and the anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK), {{have been found in}} hematopoietic malignancies. They have drawn much attention after the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RTK gene alterations include point mutations and gene fusions that result from chromosomal rearrangements. In both cases, they activate the kinase domain in the absence of ligand, producing a permanent signal for cell proliferation. Recently, this simple model has been refined. First, by contrast to wild-type RTK, many mutated RTK do not seem to signal from the plasma membrane, but from various locations inside the cell. Second, their signal transduction properties are altered: the pathways that are crucial for cell transformation, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors, do not necessarily contribute to the physiologic functions of these receptors. Finally, different mechanisms prevent the termination of the signal, which normally occurs through receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Several mutations inactivating CBL, a key RTK E 3 ubiquitin ligase, have been recently described.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} the {{macroscopic}} fundamental diagram (MFD) is elegant and attractive because it provides a global view of traffic behavior and performance at a network level. However, recent {{research shows that the}} MFD shape can be influenced by local traffic heterogeneities. Notably, route choices and heterogeneous local capacities may drive uneven (in space) or inconsistent (in time) distributions of congestion and then affect the shape and the scatter of the MFD. We are far from having a global understanding of the connections between local phenomena and the resulting MFD. This paper first aims to improve existing MFD estimation method for a succession of <b>links</b> with <b>traffic</b> <b>signals.</b> The new method overcomes previous limitations, notably regarding to the topology and signal settings regularities, by fully utilizing the receipts of the variational theory. Then, a single network with several parallel routes is investigated. MFDs on different routes are estimated with the variational method and then aggregated in a unified MFD for stationary and dynamic conditions and different sorts of equilibria (user and system optimum). It appears that the flow distribution among routes smoothly varies with respect to the total flow either in free-flow or congestion situations. Such a distribution is much more rough for system optimum, where it presents some discontinuities and is far from equity. This means that a control strategy able to lead such a network to the perfect system optimum would be hard to tune, especially in the congested regime. However, being able to determine the MFD corresponding to the system optimum provides a valuable reference to estimate the current efficiency of the considered network. Case studies for different simple networks and insights for generalization at the city level are proposed...|$|R

By Michelle S.

40|$|Abstract—Real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> {{control is}} an {{integral}} part of the urban traffic control system, and providing effective real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised <b>traffic</b> responsive <b>signal</b> control models, where each agent in the system is a local <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78 % and the mean stoppage time, by 85 % compared to the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm.
