5|$|Sherman {{attacked}} {{once again}} down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) {{leading the way}} with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a <b>long</b> <b>column</b> of regiments, hoping to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass on a narrow front. They were driven back {{in the face of}} heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.|$|E

25|$|A fleet {{formed in}} several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed {{in a single}} <b>long</b> <b>column.</b> Since most command signals were made with flags or signal lamps between ships, the {{flagship}} was usually placed {{at the head of}} the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.|$|E

Stuart paroled over 200 Union prisoners and gave his troopers a much needed six-hour rest (while, unknown to Stuart, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's Confederate {{infantry}} division collided with Brig. Gen. John Buford's Union cavalry at Gettysburg). Stuart resumed his exhausting march through the afternoon and early evening, seizing over 1,000 fresh horses from York County farmers.|$|E
25|$|Drake {{appeared}} off Cartagena {{during the}} afternoon of 9 February 1586 and as the Boca Grande passage was unfortified, his ships passed through it in a <b>long</b> <b>column,</b> with the Elizabeth Bonaventure in the lead. The English ships dropped anchor at {{the northern end of}} the Outer Harbour after sailing past the entrance, just beyond the range of the Spanish guns guarding the Boqueron Channel. Drake sent Martin Frobisher forward to probe the defences using small boats and pinnaces in the afternoon. Coming in by way of Bahía de las Animas they moved forward but they soon ran into a chain of floating barrels which closed their way and in addition intense fire from El Boqueron forced their eventual withdrawal. Drake concurred with Christopher Carleil commander of the English troops that the best chance of capturing the city was by advancing up La Caleta.|$|E
40|$|Single shot {{proteomics}} is {{a promising}} approach to high throughput proteomics analysis. In this strategy, <b>long</b> capillary <b>columns</b> {{are needed to}} perform long and shallow gradients to achieve high peak capacity and good peak width for informative mass spectrometric detection. Herein, we report that meter <b>long</b> capillary <b>columns,</b> packed with 5. μm particulate material, can be facilely fabricated based on single particle fritting technology. The <b>long</b> <b>columns</b> could reliably generate high peak capacities of 800 in 10. h long gradients for protein digest separations. The operation was within the pressure range (40. MPa) {{of the most widely}} used normal pressure nanoLC systems. Due to the excellent life time (> 100 injections) and inter-column performance consistency, the meter <b>long</b> capillary <b>columns</b> reported here should be of practical usefulness in single shot proteomics without the need for ultra-high pressure instrumentation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of slenderness on the compressive bearing capacity of autoclaved fly ash perforated brick masonry <b>long</b> <b>columns</b> and provide experimental evidences for making corresponding technical code, compression tests were conducted on 9 autoclaved fly ash perforated brick masonrys <b>long</b> <b>columns</b> of different slenderness. The damage patterns and compression performance are analyzed. The experimental results indicate that compressive capacity decreases proportionally as slenderness increases and the proposed formula of axial compressive bearing capacity for autoclaved fly ash perforated brick masonry columns is given. The nonlinear FEA program ANSYS is also adopted to simulate the behaviors of masonry columns. By comparing results find that the simulated results agree well with the test ones, the rationality and applicability of the model are verified...|$|R
25|$|As {{they fell}} back, the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades left small {{groups on the}} tracks north and east of Es Salt to keep up {{intermittent}} firing until dawn. After dark, {{the remainder of the}} force withdrew through this line regiment by regiment and marched down the track during the night. The evacuation of Es Salt was completed by 02:30, but as they could only move in single file, the regiments and brigades were strung out for many miles along the track. In the dark, movement down the mountainous Umm esh Shert track was exhausting for the <b>long</b> <b>column</b> of fighting men, wounded and refugees. The column was still making its way down to the Jordan Valley at daybreak. The 5th Mounted Brigade, in particular, had great difficulty moving by a terrible path; their retirement had begun at 20:30 but they did not reach Jebel Umm 'Awiya until 03:45, when the brigade came under the command of Brigadier General Cox (1st Light Horse Brigade).|$|E

At 21:00 on 20 September, a burst of machine gun fire stopped a <b>long</b> <b>column</b> of retreating German and Ottoman soldiers, resulting in the capture of 2,800 prisoners and four guns. During the night the light horsemen were to capture 8,000 prisoners who had retreated, in the face of EEF infantry attacks in the Judean Hills, along the good quality road from Nablus and Tulkarm, north towards Jenin and Damascus.|$|E
500|$|The 11th Cavalry Brigade advance southwards; the 36th Jacob's Horse on {{the east}} bank was fired on, [...] south of Beisan to the {{south-east}} of Khirbet es Samriye.

As the 29th Lancers, advanced down on the west bank, they were fired on from the rearguard at Makhadat abu Naji which was attacked in the rear and the flank by the 36th Jacob's Horse; they broke the rearguard into a [...] "hopeless rout". The commander of the 16th Division, Rushdi Bey, and 18 machine guns were captured, along with 800 prisoners, which were later identified {{to have been the}} rearguard of von Oppen's Asia Corps.|$|E
500|$|Bouck sent James, Slape and Creger {{to set up}} an {{observation}} post in a house on {{the eastern side of the}} village that had been abandoned by Task Force X.

Their distinctive helmet style told Bouck they were Fallschirmjäger, among the best soldiers Germany could field. None of his training or experience prepared him for this situation, outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1. Bouck and James scrambled back to the ridge top and the rest of their unit. The platoon's telephone land line to 1st Battalion headquarters in Losheimergraben was knocked out, but their SCR-300 radio still worked. Bouck reached Regimental headquarters at Hünningen on the radio and requested permission to withdraw and engage in a delaying action.

500|$|The {{bulk of the}} Seventh Army {{had been}} {{retreating}} down the Wadi Fara road where guns and transport had to be abandoned when heavily bombed and machine-gunned from the air.

British and Australian aircraft subsequently bombed the column, at first just blocking one end of a defile, but later returning a number of times. Four hours later the area was covered with the wreckage of 90 guns, 50 lorries and more than 1,000 other vehicles. The Ottoman 53rd Division, which had managed to get down the Wadi Fara before it was blocked by the air attack, was captured by Chaytor's Force on 22 September during the fighting for the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh.
