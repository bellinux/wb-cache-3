40|$|Background: Despite {{surgical}} resection or chemo- radiation {{a significant}} percentage of patients with lung cancer develop recurrent disease.

40|$|The {{microvascular}} free fibula flap, {{is currently}} {{one of the}} preferred methods for reconstruction of the oromandibular defect. The patency of the major vessels in the donor limb should be evaluated before the fibula is harvested because the blood supply can be inadequate to safely utilise this flap. The best method of evaluating, pre-operatively, the lower limb vasculature is controversial. Femoral angiography has been considered as the gold standard, however, the current literature advocates <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods</b> of assessment such as magnetic resonance angiography and colour flow Doppler. A postal questionnaire was sent to all members of The British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists asking details of the preferred method of lower limb vascular assessment prior to fibula flap harvest. Of 137 responses, 48 performed free fibula flaps. Of these 48 surgeons, the preferred method for evaluation was palpation of pulses combined with either angiography (40 %) or Doppler on the ward (38 %). None of this subgroup of surgeons utilised colour flow Doppler as a first line investigation despite this being available to 67 % of responders. This survey highlights the diversity in pre-operative assessment amongst surgeons performing fibula flaps for head and neck malignancy. Few relied on clinical examination alone; however, the <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods</b> of vascular imaging were seldom utilised...|$|R

Key Words. Master-slave systems, Endoscopy, Endoscopic tools/equipments, Flexible stem graspers, Suturing/sewing devices. 1. Introduction Endoscopic surgery has been used widely in the past decade as an alternative to conventional open surgery and it is also gaining more grounds for other applications.

30|$|The {{effective}} {{transition to}} CPAP via NIPPV {{and the relative}} ease of ventilation thereafter suggest that this CPAP model may be applicable in even less mature preterm lambs.

40|$|Introduction: Pelvic {{fractures}} {{are relatively}} uncommon in children, accounting for 0. 3 – 7. 5 % of all pediatric injuries (Gänsslen et al., 2013; Ismail et al., 1996; Peltier, 1965; Galano et al., 2005; Spiguel et al., 2006). This case report describes a pediatric open pelvic injury {{caused by a}} crush mechanism between a car and guardrail. Case: A 13  year old male presented with an open APC 3 pelvic injury after being pinned between a car and guardrail. His definitive treatment included bilateral SI screw placement, {{as well as a}} <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>method</b> for anterior pelvic ring disruption (Internal Brace suture anchor dynamic fixation). Discussion/conclusion: A <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>method</b> for the anterior pelvic ring was used to avoid additional dissection due to extensive soft tissue loss, and to decrease hardware burden, which lessens the chance of complications such as infection. Suture fixation of the pubic symphysis provided stable fixation to allow healing in the current case of open pelvic fracture...|$|E
30|$|Several {{studies have}} shown saline {{infusion}} sonography as effective, cheaper and <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>method</b> in diagnosing submucous fibroids [10 – 12]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a standard practice in many units to evaluate the uterus prior to UAE, partly to exclude adenomyosis and pedunculated myomas, but also to evaluate distortion of the uterine cavity by submucous fibroids [13, 14]. The evidence for routine hysteroscopy prior to UAE, to exclude submucous fibroids, is limited.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} {{investigating}} postmenopausal women with thickened endometrium {{is essentially to}} exclude endometrial cancer, thus obtaining sample(s) for histopathologic examination is fundamental and obligatory. Blind endometrial biopsies (obtained with dilatation/curettage or <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>methods</b> such as Vabra or Pipelle) were the classical methods for obtaining endometrial samples. These blind methods are associated with low-sensitivity diagnostic rates for benign and malignant endometrial pathology [5, 6]. Nowadays, office hysteroscopy is considered the gold-standard procedure for evaluating uterine cavity, allowing not only eye-guided biopsies to suspicious areas but also operative techniques for benign pathology whenever necessary [5 – 7].|$|R
