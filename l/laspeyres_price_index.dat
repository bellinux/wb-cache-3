5000|$|Utility is not {{directly}} measurable, so {{the true cost of}} living index only serves as a theoretical ideal, not a practical price index formula. However, more practical formulas can be evaluated based on their relationship to the true cost of living index. One of the most commonly used formulas for consumer price indices, the <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> compares the cost of what a consumer bought in one time period (q0) with how much it would have cost to buy the same set of goods and services in a later period. Since the utility from q0 in the first year should be equal to the utility from q0 in the next year, Laspeyres gives the upper bound for the true cost-of-living index. [...] Laspeyres only serves as an upper bound, because consumers could turn to substitute goods for those goods that have gotten more expensive and achieved the same level of utility from q0 for a lower cost. In contrast, a Paasche price index uses the cost of a set of goods purchased in one time period with the cost it would have taken to buy the same set of goods in an earlier time period. It can be shown that the Paasche is a lower bound for true cost of living index. Since upper and lower bounds of the true cost of living index can be found, respectively, through the Laspeyres and Paasche indices, the geometric average of the two, known as the Fisher price index, is a close approximation of the true cost of living index if the upper and lower bounds are not too far apart.|$|E

Which is a “good ” index number formula for aggregating prices? A variety of alternative index number formulae are explored based on the economic approach and the axiomatic (test) approach. In practice, use of the <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> is common. For example, this is the formula used for the official US consumer price index (prior to 1999).

40|$|The present paper {{contributes}} to the literature by looking at the empirical evidence of calculations of <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> formed from different elementary indices. For three German price statistics, disaggregate official data are analysed. Generalised means of price relatives are systematically calculated and plugged into the aggregate formula. The results point to widely different estimates between <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> based on the alternative elementary indices. There is a “price ” to be paid at the upper level for suboptimal index formula selection at the lower level. Thus, the need for two-staged <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> to be accurately constructed becomes obvious. ...|$|R

In this case, a nation's terms of trade is {{the ratio of the}} <b>Laspeyre</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of exports to the <b>Laspeyre</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of imports. The Laspeyre export index is the current value of the base period exports divided by the base period value of the base period exports.

Using large-scale retail scanner data in Japan, we construct a unit value price index and decompose its fluctuation into (1) standard price change effects, (2) substitution effects within continuing goods, and (3) turnover-new product effects. The aggregate unit price index exhibits different movements from the standard <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>price</b> <b>index.</b> After the 2014 change in Japan's tax rate, turnover-new product effects from the appearance of relatively expensive new goods increased by 1 percentage point, contributing to increases in unit value.

40|$|While {{national}} and international statistical agencies spend much resource on calculating purchasing power parity (PPP) between countries, relatively little attention is given to PPP calculations within countries. Yet, for large and heterogeneous countries, such as the US and India, intra country PPP {{is as important as}} cross-country PPP. This is particularly true of the rural urban divide in such countries where the idea that one unit of currency has the same purchasing power in both sectors is clearly false. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a demand system based methodology for calculating rural urban PPP that incorporates rural urban differences in preferences and applies it to India. The methodology is compared with conventional procedures, such as the <b>Laspeyre’s</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> and the CPD model, and shown to have several advantages over them. The result on significant rural urban price difference in India underlines the need to extend the cross-country PPP calculations to incorporate spatial differences in large, heterogeneous countries with a diverse set of preferences and prices.

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates spurred the development of trade-weighted exchange rates(TWEXs). These indexes measure changes in the average foreign exchange value of a currency over time. The construction of a TWEX index requires numerous decisions. Producers of TWEXs are revisiting many of their construction decisions because, {{with the advent of}} the single currency in Europe, all TWEXs will have to be modified. In addition, countries adopting the single currency may find it useful to develop their own TWEXs, similar to those that exist for regions within the United States. All commonly-used TWEXs are based on either a <b>Laspeyres</b> or Paasche <b>price</b> <b>index.</b> In the present paper we argue that producers of TWEXs should consider using the chain approach for the construction of their indexes because of an issue that affects TWEXs based on either <b>Laspeyres</b> or Paasche <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> - the choice of base period. We illustrate this problem and show how it leads to different measures of exchange rate changes.

They do however gain extra force if one accepts non‐neoclassical explanations for the empirical results.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{how far we}} can go in establishing normative conclusions {{with regard to the}} evolution of inequality over time, making use of statistical methods which do not need either too specific assumptions about individual preferences, or their recovery by means of complex and expensive econometric methods. The decomposition of the change in money inequality into a real and a price effect occupies the center of the analysis. We have used statistical <b>Laspeyres</b> type <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> which are household specific, and a parametrization which captures the weight one is prepared to give to household size in the definition of equivalent expenditure per person. The central finding is that the improvement in real inequality in Spain from 1973 - 74 to 1980 - 81 is always greater than the improvement in money inequality. Changes in relative prices have been less damaging to the poor than to the rich, and have had a uniform impact across groups from different partitions.

Three types of price corrections are considered: (a) no corrections; (b) living standards deflated by spatial <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>price</b> indices; (c) living standards deflated by true <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> that are estimated from a quadratic almost ideal demand system. Distinguishing these corrections and using data from Tunisia, we {{study the effects of}} the price deflation and the demand system estimation on poverty and budget leakage estimates. These effects can intervene at two stages of the estimation: (1) the calculation of the transfer levels for each household from predicted living standards, and (2) the estimation of the post-transfer poverty or budget leakage statistics. Our results show that price correction, whatever its form, may have only limited role for the assessment of anti-poverty policy in Tunisia. Correcting or not for spatial price differences, or for consumption substitution does not modify the ranking of the studied transfer policies. This is at odd with other findings in the empirical literature that price differences may be important for poverty monitoring. Poverty; Targeting; Transfers, Spatial Prices. ...|$|R
