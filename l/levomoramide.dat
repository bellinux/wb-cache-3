50|$|Racemoramide (INN, BAN), {{or simply}} moramide, is an opioid {{analgesic}} and a racemic {{mixture of the}} substances dextromoramide (the active component) and <b>levomoramide</b> (which is inactive), two enantiomers of a chiral molecule.|$|E
50|$|Dextromoramide is the {{right-handed}} isomer of the moramide molecule. The left-handed molecule {{is called}} <b>levomoramide,</b> and {{a mixture of}} the two is called racemoramide. Its full chemical name is (+)-1-(3-Methyl-4-morpholino-2,2-diphenylbutyryl)pyrrolidine, and its molecular formula: C25H32N2O2, with an atomic weight of ~392.5.|$|E
