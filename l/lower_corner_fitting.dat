40|$|Textile {{composite}} reinforcement forming {{has been}} employed in many aeronautic industries {{as a traditional}} composite manufacturing process. The double-curved shape manufacturing may be difficult {{and can lead to}} defects when the composite parts have high curvatures and large deformations. Compared with the textile composites forming, surface 3 D weaving can demonstrate directly the geometry of final composite part without the stages involved in 2 D product. The weaving in three directions is completely designed and warp and weft yarns are always perpendicular to the surfaces of the final 3 D ply. These two manufacturing techniques are applied to produce an important piece of aircraft: the <b>corner</b> <b>fitting.</b> The 3 D weaving results are compared with the experimental forming by a punch as same geometry as the <b>corner</b> <b>fitting</b> part. The conveniences and limits of each technique are investigated. The comparisons show particularly a perfect final 3 D fabric with homogeneous fibre volume fraction performed by the surface 3 D weaving technique...|$|R

25|$|Swap body units {{usually have}} the same bottom corner {{fixtures}} as intermodal containers, and often have folding legs under their frame {{so that they can}} be moved between trucks without using a crane. However they frequently don't have the upper <b>corner</b> <b>fittings</b> of ISO containers, and are not stackable, nor can they be lifted and handled by the usual equipment like reach-stackers or straddle-carriers. They are generally more expensive to procure.|$|R
50|$|Spinnaker - Some sailboats use a {{symmetrical}} spinnaker—a three-sided, parachute-like sail—off the wind. The {{windward side}} of a spinnaker {{is attached to a}} horizontal pole at the <b>lower</b> <b>corner</b> of the sail and the other end to the mast. The pole is controlled by a line, called a guy, and the other <b>lower</b> <b>corner</b> is controlled by a sheet. When jibing, the pole is disconnected from the mast and attached to the opposite <b>lower</b> <b>corner.</b> Upon establishment on the new tack, the end of the pole that was on the sail is connected to the mast and the former guy becomes the new sheet and vice versa for the former sheet. For high-performance craft with an asymmetrical spinnaker attached to a bow sprit, the sail is jibed {{in a manner similar to}} a jib.|$|R

50|$|Metrocargo is a fully {{automated}} technology developed for (un)loading containers horizontally from wagons to track-side stocking areas {{and vice versa}} operating under the catenary. Actually containers are lifted for a small height (up to 161 cm {{to take care of}} different heights of wagons) acting on the lateral slots of the standard <b>corner</b> <b>fittings</b> every container and swap body is equipped with. Today the technology is implemented in a working prototype set-up at Vado Ligure (IT).|$|R
50|$|As a consequence, {{swap bodies}} {{do not have}} upper <b>corner</b> <b>fittings,</b> are not stackable, and must be lifted by the bottom frame, unlike the more {{widespread}} shipping containers (ISO containers). This makes them unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation. Because they are not stackable and are lifted by the bottom corners, they require special handling when transported by rail. Due to security concerns, {{an increasing number of}} swap bodies have a hard surface instead of curtains and tarpaulins.|$|R

50|$|Swap bodies {{normally}} {{have the same}} external dimensions for the bottom <b>corner</b> <b>fittings</b> as ISO shipping containers, {{so that they can}} be placed on the same kinds of trucks, trailers and railroad cars designed for shipping containers. However, to optimize the carriage of pallets, wide bodies are often scaled to the maximum width allowed for standard road trucks and railroad cars and to a different length accommodating a quantity of European-pool pallets (0.8 x 1.2 m) without leaving empty space.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Lower</b> <b>Corner</b> Historic District {{encompasses}} {{a small village}} center {{in the town of}} Sandwich, New Hampshire. <b>Lower</b> <b>Corner</b> is a rural village that is strung along New Hampshire Route 109 on either side of its junction with School House Road, about one mile from the main village of Center Sandwich. The village was developed relatively early in Sandwich's history, although its oldest buildings now date to the early 19th century. There are 25 contributing structures, mostly residences. There are two buildings built as stores, including one of brick; all the other buildings are wood frame. [...] The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Sails are {{classified}} as [...] "triangular sails", [...] "quadrilateral fore-and-aft sails" [...] (gaff-rigged, etc.), and [...] "square sails". The top of a triangular sail, the head, is raised by a halyard, The forward <b>lower</b> <b>corner</b> of the sail, the tack, is shackled to a fixed point on the boat in a manner to allow pivoting about that point—either on a mast, e.g. for a mainsail, or on the deck, e.g. for a jib or staysail. The trailing <b>lower</b> <b>corner,</b> the clew, is positioned with an outhaul on a boom or directly with a sheet, absent a boom. Symmetrical sails have two clews, which may be adjusted forward or back.|$|R
