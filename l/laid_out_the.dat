5|$|Judge Cross <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> city's first streets. Cross' {{home was}} built in the late 1840s by Fendal Cason, and Cross {{purchased}} it in 1862.

There is also a small park named after Cross, located at the same place one of the Indian tribes made its camp.|$|E
5|$|Part I {{authorised}} {{the establishment}} of County Associations under schemes to be drawn up by the Army Council, and <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> expected form of these associations and their areas of authority.

It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered.|$|E
5|$|By 1844, Albert {{had managed}} to modernise the royal {{finances}} and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a private residence for their growing family. Over {{the next few years}} a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and Thomas Cubitt. Albert <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> grounds, and improved the estate and farm. Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at Windsor was admired by his biographers, and under his stewardship the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the {{surveyors}} on behalf of Lord Fairfax had <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence along with other public buildings. Later in 1762 following the establishment of Romney, the school was rebuilt in stone on the same site. The stone building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy. The stone building was a rugged square building that served as Romney's cultural center before the school was formally incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly, but the exact date of its construction is unknown. Romney Academy was first incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814.|$|E
5|$|Constantine the Great {{effectively}} {{became the}} emperor {{of the whole}} of the Roman Empire in September 324. Two months later, he <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> plans for a new, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the empire, the city was named Nova Roma; most called it Constantinople, a name that persisted into the 20th century. On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman Empire, which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of Buckingham Palace, the improvement plans were revisited. The grand entrance to the park at Hyde Park Corner was designed by Decimus Burton, and was constructed in the 1820s. Burton <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> paths and driveways and designed a series of lodges, the Screen/Gate at Hyde Park Corner (also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate) in 1825 and the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828. The Screen and the Arch originally formed a single composition, {{designed to provide a}} monumental transition between Hyde Park and Green Park, although the arch was moved in 1883. It originally had a statue of the Duke of Wellington on top; it was moved to Aldershot in 1883 when the arch was re-sited.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the scholar-turned-bureaucrat Guo Moruo <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{first modern}} {{proposal}} {{to repair the}} Great Wall. Five years later, the renovated Badaling became the first section to be {{opened to the public}} since the establishment of the PRC. The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries who come to China, beginning with Nepali prime minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala in 1960, and most notably the American president Richard Nixon in his historic 1972 visit to China. To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great Wall.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January, La Thanh Ton, an NVA {{lieutenant}} {{from the}} 325th Division, defected and <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{plans for an}} entire series of North Vietnamese attacks. Hills 881 South, 861, and the main base itself would be simultaneously attacked that same evening. At 00:30 on 21 January, Hill 861 was attacked by approximately 300 North Vietnamese troops.

5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E
5|$|PNC Park {{has hosted}} various {{evacuation}} and response drills, {{which would be}} used {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Members of the United States Department of Homeland Security <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> groundwork for the initial drill in February 2004. In May 2005, 5,000volunteers participated in the $1million evacuation drill, which included mock explosions. A goal of the drill was to test the response of 49western Pennsylvania emergency agencies. In April 2006, the Department of Homeland Security worked in conjunction with the United States Coast Guard to develop a plan of response for the 2006 All-Star Game. Similar exercises were conducted on the Allegheny River in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Several {{areas of}} Bath had {{undergone}} development during the Stuart period, and development increased during Georgian times {{in response to}} the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764).|$|E

5|$|Sir David further {{extended}} the castle {{in the late}} 16th century, {{with the addition of}} a large north range with round corner towers. He <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> garden in 1604, with symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland, to celebrate the Union of the Crowns of the previous year, when James VI acceded to the English throne on the death of his cousin, Elizabeth I.

5|$|The university's campus {{has gone}} through {{continuous}} development since 1928. The main campus's six original buildings are of Collegiate Gothic architecture, designed by William Lyon Somerville, who also <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> initial campus plan. They are now flanked by over fifty structures built predominantly during the boom in the 1950s, 1960s and during the 2000s. The largest facility is the McMaster University Medical Centre, a multi-use research hospital {{that is home to}} the second-largest neonatal intensive care unit and the third-largest child and youth mental health unit in the country. It is connected to the Life Sciences building and the Michael DeGroote Centre for Learning & Discovery, which houses many well-funded research groups in areas of genetics, infectious diseases, and several specific conditions.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Frazier strike, the Twin Wells, just {{to the south of}} the Frazier Well, also struck oil. In May1865, A. P. Duncan and George C. Prather {{purchased}} the Holmden Farm, including the portions still leased to United States Petroleum, for $25,000 and a bonus of $75,000. The wooded bluff overlooking the Frazier and Twin Wells was cleared and a town was <b>laid</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> town was divided into 500lots, which were put up for sale on May24. By July, the population was estimated to have been at least 2,000. The population of Pithole rose to 15,000people in September and 20,000 by Christmas. Pithole was incorporated as a borough on November 30, 1865.|$|E
