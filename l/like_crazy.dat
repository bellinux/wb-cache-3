5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit <b>like</b> <b>crazy.</b> It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> is a 2011 American romantic drama film {{directed}} by Drake Doremus and starring Anton Yelchin, Felicity Jones and Jennifer Lawrence. Written by Doremus and Ben York Jones, the film {{tells the story}} of Anna (Felicity Jones), a British exchange student who falls in love with an American student, Jacob (Yelchin), only to be separated from him when she is denied re-entry into the United States after staying in the country longer than her student visa allows.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> premiered on January 22, 2011 at the Sundance Film Festival, {{where it}} won the festival's Grand Jury Prize. It was {{released}} in theaters on October 28, 2011 and grossed over $3.7 million at the box office. Most reviews of the film were positive, with reviewers giving particular praise to the performances of Yelchin and Jones, although some found the plot unrealistic and contrived.|$|E
5|$|Drake Doremus was {{inspired}} to make <b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> {{by the end of}} his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles. Many elements of the film resemble their real-life relationship, such as frequent travelling between Los Angeles and London, trouble with American immigration laws, a brief marriage, a trip to Santa Catalina Island (where Jacob takes Anna in the early stages of their relationship), and the gift of a bracelet (in the film, a bracelet is given to Anna by Jacob). The story was co-written by Ben York Jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. Together, they assembled a 50-page outline of the film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay. The outline included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue.|$|E

500|$|<b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> {{was filmed}} over four weeks—the first three in Los Angeles {{and the last}} in London. The {{production}} budget was $250,000, which included the cost of airfares for the cast and crew. The film was shot on a Canon EOS 7D still camera with cinema lenses, mounted on a rig constructed by cinematographer John Guleserian. He chose the 7D for its portability and the ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes, where he found other cameras too cumbersome. Guleserian said {{that many of the}} film's scenes were shot [...] "really far away from our characters [...] really tight close ups" [...] due to the technological limitations of the camera, but he noted that this added to the tone of the film.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern {{described}} <b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> as a [...] "wise and beautiful little film", giving particular praise to Guleserian's cinematography and Yelchin and Jones's improvised performances. David Edelstein of New York magazine claimed that <b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> was [...] "the most infectious love story in decades", comparing its [...] "wonderfully sane" [...] perspective to other romance films and romantic comedies. Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film an A– grade and praised Doremus, Yelchin and Felicity Jones's storytelling ability in creating [...] "a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love {{in all its}} ecstasy and agony". In a review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that [...] "Drake Doremus has crafted a crazily inventive and totally irresistible tale of first love that makes the familiar seem bittersweet and heart-stoppingly new". He described Felicity Jones as [...] "a marvel" [...] and Yelchin as [...] "outstanding". Time magazine's Mary Pols commended the film's ambiguous ending and wrote, [...] "Like Crazy is a cinematic love potion and you leave it feeling bewitched." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Jones and Yelchin's performances and the [...] "intelligent, graceful indie style" [...] of the film, although he found the storyline somewhat unrealistic. Indiewire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ grade and felt that while the plot developed slowly, Yelchin and Jones shared [...] "an indelible and entirely realistic chemistry". Variety film critic Andrew Barker, who described the film as [...] "an exquisite, beautifully acted gem", gave particular praise to the film's [...] "dexterous editing", given that it [...] "contains nary an extraneous detail, while still managing to luxuriate in the tender and awkward silences of young love".|$|E
500|$|A {{negative}} {{review of}} the film came from Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, who found it [...] "a conventional, wan affair, despite its art-cinema flourishes" [...] and thought that Anna's inability to obtain a visa was a contrived plot point that conflicted with Doremus's attempt at creating realism. The Globe and Mail Rick Groen also found <b>Like</b> <b>Crazy</b> unrealistic, giving the film 2 out of 4 stars and writing that [...] "nothing feels more false than a failed attempt at getting real". Writing for Salon, Andrew O'Hehir opined that the film was uninteresting, unmemorable, and [...] "sickly sweet". Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice found Jones and Yelchin's performances [...] "aggressively average" [...] and described the film as [...] "a rote story, arbitrarily scattered into abstraction".|$|E

500|$|According to the singer, {{the clip}} portrays [...] "a {{day in the}} life of the earth to show that we are rushing forward to the end of the 1900s century at full speed. I think Jonas made an {{excellent}} interpretation of the song, although he forced me to dance <b>like</b> <b>crazy</b> for two days. He's a tough director". Inspiration came from the 1982 American experimental film, Koyaanisqatsi, which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were deemed good to be used in the final product.|$|E

Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked <b>like</b> <b>crazy</b> these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
