40|$|The {{experiments}} of <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> gravity currents {{were performed}} in a rectangular channel with salt water and fresh water. The spreading law of the salt water is validated by using a digital video to record {{the progress of the}} current. Detailed instantaneous velocity structure of <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> gravity currents in the slumping phase was studied experimentally with particle image velocimetry (PIV). The time variation of the spatial distribution of velocity and vorticity is obtained, which shows some qualitative characters of the current as well as the effects of the bottom boundary layer and upper mixing layer. © 2004 Elsevier B.

50|$|Swordmakers in Toledo, Spain, {{developed}} {{a market in}} the 1920s for gold plated automatic leverlock knives with pearl handles and enamel inlaid blades. Italian knifemakers had their own style of knives including both pushbutton and leverlock styles, some bearing design characteristics similar to the early French Châtellerault knife. Prior to World War II, hand crafted automatic knives marked Campobasso or Frosolone were often called Flat Guards because of the two-piece top bolster design. Some Italian switchblades incorporated a bayonet-type blade equipped with a blade <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> activated by picking a lever at the hinge end, and were known as picklocks. These were later supplanted by newer designs which incorporated the blade <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> into a tilting bolster, which released a spearpoint or bayonet-style blade.|$|R

40|$|This {{proposal}} is for an SMP zone <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> function {{associated with the}} zone management client procedure; lock, load, activate and release. When zoning expander devices in a ZPSDS are locked by a zone management client, and either: a) all zone configuration tasks are complete and acknowledged; or b) an error result from an expander device; c) a [tbd] zone lock timer expires; then the zone management client shall unlock the zoning expander devices. When a zoning expander device receives an SMP ZONE <b>LOCK</b> <b>RELEASE</b> function then it shall set the ZONE LOCKED bit to zero.

50|$|A <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> can be {{considered}} as a type of release synchronization. Assume a loop operation is concerned as the code shown to the right. Two threads intend to enter a critical section and read the most recent value of a, then exit the critical section. The code shows that thread 0 first acquires the lock and enters the critical section. In order to execute correctly, P1 must read the latest value of ‘a’ written by P0. In that case, only one thread can be in the critical section at a time. Therefore, the synchronization itself has ensured that the successful lock acquisition at P1 occurs after <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> by P0. Besides, the S2 -> S3 ordering has to be ensured, since the P0 must propagate the new value of ‘a’ to P1. For the same reason, S5 must occur after S4.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the procedure taken to modify trans-tibial shuttle <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> mechanisms to decrease standard reach requirements {{in a case of}} limited mobility secondary to morbid obesity. The participant was a middle-aged, morbidly obese client with bilateral trans-tibial amputations. The distomedial shuttle <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> buttons were modified to activate with a cable/Dacron pull strap located proximal/lateral. The outcome of the modification was determined by whether or not the client would be able to independently doff the prostheses, if the patient was satisfied with the prostheses and by the condition of the components at the three-month follow-up. The client was independently successful at doffing both prostheses following the modification procedure. The patient expressed satisfaction with operation of the release mechanism but cosmetic covering was an issue. Components were optimally functioning at the three month follow-up. It was concluded that this procedure is a viable option for relocating distomedial <b>release</b> <b>lock</b> buttons more proximally when reach is limited. The procedure is not indicated in every case as gadget tolerance, cosmesis and manufacturer warranty issues must be considered...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} that examine the initial development of an axisymmetric gravity current have been carried out. The experiments highlight {{the growth of a}} ring vortex that dominates the dynamics of the gravity current's early time propagation. In particular, the experiments show three distinct stages of early time development that have previously been described as the "initial phase" of a gravity current. The first phase of the early time development is dependent on the fractional depth of the <b>lock</b> <b>release,</b> followed by a secondary phase wherein the frontal speed is approximately constant and a third phase of reducing speed. The second phase of the gravity current's propagation comes to an abrupt end with the breakdown of the ring vortex at a clearly defined position. All of the experimental results show the development of a complex flow field where the generation and collapse of a ring vortex dominate the gravity current's early time propagation. The complexity of the flow field and the dependence of the propagation speed on the presence of the ring vortex in the head of the gravity current highlights the unsuitability of shallow-water modeling for axisymmetric <b>lock</b> <b>releases</b> at early time...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism. A <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade. With the final design of the leading edge flap and <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism, a preliminary design for a three-dimensional propeller was created...|$|R
50|$|Array Based Queuing Lock is an {{extension}} to ticket lock algorithm which ensures that on a <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> only one processor attempts to acquire the lock resulting in {{decrease in the number}} of cache misses. This can be achieved by having all the processors spin on unique memory locations. One analogy used to explain the lock mechanism is the relay race where the athlete passes on the baton to the next athlete in queue which ensures that only one athlete acquires the baton.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the main features}} of a distributed transactional system {{with a high degree}} of efficiency. The possibility of increasing concurrency both among the various processes of one transaction, through a somewhat novel version of the well-known two-phase commit protocol and among different transactions, through a mechanism of object dynamic allocation which allows <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> before of transaction completion, is explored. An approach to a nesting mechanism, exploiting the capabilitities offered by the outlined object manipulation algorithm, is also proposed...|$|R
50|$|SS2PL Vs. S2PL: Both provide Serializability and Strictness. Since S2PL is a super {{class of}} SS2PL it may, in principle, provide more {{concurrency}}. However, no concurrency advantage is typically practically noticed (exactly same locking exists for both, with practically not much earlier <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> for S2PL), and the overhead {{of dealing with}} an end-of-phase-1 mechanism in S2PL, separate from transaction-end, is not justified. Also, while SS2PL provides Commitment ordering, S2PL does not. This explains the preference of SS2PL over S2PL.|$|R

50|$|Multiple {{instances}} of access methods can be opened on a file {{at the same}} time, each serving a single client. If a file is opened for update access, conflicts can occur when the same record is being accessed by multiple clients. To prevent such conflicts, a lock can be obtained on an entire file. Also, if a file is opened for update a lock is obtained on a record by the first client to read it and released when that client updates it.
