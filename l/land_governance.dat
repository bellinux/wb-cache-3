40|$|Urban sprawl {{has evolved}} into an {{exceptionally}} complex public policy problem in the United States {{over the course of}} recent decades. One factor that has made it particularly difficult to deal with is its relationship to the fragmented structure of the American system of <b>land</b> use <b>governance.</b> Acting on behalf of their residents, local governments enact land use regulations to secure lifestyle preferences for low density, suburban living environments {{while at the same time}} ensuring a high quality of public service provision. This article examines the effect of this process on metropolitan spatial structure through a series of econometric models designed to test the following hypothesis: that fragmentation promotes sprawl by increasing the proportion of growth that occurs at the unincorporated urban fringe. The estimation results reveal substantive evidence that municipal fragmentation and several related factors - including special districts, infrastructure investments, and white flight processes - have a significant and enduring effect on the growth of outlying areas.

50|$|Governance of {{the soil}} differs from soil {{management}}. Soil management involves practices and techniques used to increase and maintain soil fertility, structure, and carbon sequestration, etc. Soil management techniques are heavily utilized in agriculture, {{because of the need}} to regulate the various practices, such as tillage techniques, fertilizer application and crop rotation (among others) by the various stakeholders involved. The need to monitor and avoid the negative effects of agricultural land use such as soil erosion has formed the basis of the discourse and awareness on soil governance, and has also seen the emergence of science and technology as the link between soil management and governance. Soil governance mechanisms are usually encapsulated within the context of <b>land</b> <b>governance,</b> with little focus on urban and industrial soil governance especially in developing countries that have rapid urbanization rates; thus, soil governance is highly interlinked with other atmospheric and anthropogenic processes which may contribute to the difficulty in distinguishing it as an entity.|$|E
40|$|Corruption in <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> is a {{significant}} problem in many countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} oil, {{financial}} and food crises of 2008, sub-Saharan Africa has witnessed a marked increase in large-scale investment in agricultural land. The drivers of this investment are varied and include growing food, {{water and energy}} insecurity {{as well as social}} and economic interests of investors and recipient countries. The shape of these investments and their eventual outcomes are equally influenced by the existing <b>land</b> and water <b>governance</b> systems in the host countries. Based on fieldlevel research conducted in Ghana and Mali which covered six large-scale agricultural investments, this paper analyzes the current <b>land</b> and water <b>governance</b> systems in these two countries through the lens of land and water acquisition and initial outcomes. It highlights missed opportunities for sustainable and equitable large-scale agricultural land investments due to uncoordinated governance systems and failure to rigorously apply detailed rules and regulations that are already in place. It offers suggestions for revamping <b>land</b> and water <b>governance</b> to promote large-scale investments that will lead to equitable distribution of benefits and sustainable management of natural resources...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{on urban}} <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> {{suggests}} cadastres {{play an important}} role in delivering equal land access, adequate tenure security, sustainable land use, accountability of actors, and transparency. Accordingly, <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> is increasingly examined through the domain of cadastres, or more broadly land administration. In Ethiopia, urban cadastres are yet to be studied through this lens. This paper examines the evolution of Ethiopia's urban cadastres in support of urban <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> across three governing regimes: the Imperial, the Military, and the Ethiopian People Republic Democratic Front (EPRDF) regimes. Three data collection techniques are applied: research synthesis is used to understand the nature and role of Ethiopia's urban cadastres during the Imperial and Military regimes, whilst secondary data and primary observational analysis are used to assess the early and contemporary parts of EPRDF regime respectively. The recognized cadastral ‘toolbox’ approach informs the analysis: the comparative role of cadastres in delivering urban <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> across the three study epochs is assessed. The study reveals that during the Imperial and Military regimes, policies and legal frameworks afforded less consideration to important aspects of urban <b>land</b> <b>governance.</b> Meanwhile, results from the early EPRDF regime suggest that whilst urban <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> discourse was popular, the operational role of the urban cadastre in improving urban <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> was limited: the basic requirements needed for the operation of urban cadastres, including political steadiness, policy and legal clarity, technical capacity, sound organizational design and societal support were missing. The contemporary situation shows improvement, however, each ‘toolbox’ element has improvement opportunitie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBeyond {{concerns}} about agricultural productivity growth, issues of <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> have attracted global interest as {{demand for land}} acquisition by outsiders has increased rapidly {{but most of the}} transfers {{failed to live up to}} expectations and instead disrupted local livelihoods. We use the <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> assessment framework to identify key conceptual issues and identify how <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> in 10 African countries compares to global good practice. Results point towards weak protection of rights in practice, large gaps in female land access, and limited outreach and effectiveness of institutions to record rights and adjudicate disputes. We note that programs to improve performance along these lines had significant impact in other contexts, suggesting that efforts to improve <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> will be warranted and should be closely monitored and evaluated in an effort to identify models suited to African conditions and assess their impact and interaction with other factor markets...|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{witnessed}} the flourishing of monitoring systems that produce new metrics to diagnose and benchmark <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> at country level. One {{of the most}} influential initiatives is the <b>Land</b> <b>Governance</b> Assessment Framework, a diagnostic tool developed by the World Bank to evaluate land policies, monitor progress and point towards global best practices. Although presented as a neutral tool, the <b>Land</b> <b>Governance</b> Assessment Framework dispositif has the effect of distributing light and shadow on the complex and multifaceted politics of land. This article aims at conducting a close analysis of the <b>Land</b> <b>Governance</b> Assessment Framework standard in order to explore how it defines ontologies and norms. These two levels are successively explored by asking two questions: ‘what is land?’ and ‘land for which people?’. Thus, the analysis shows that, although the World Bank discourse has evolved towards the recognition of ‘a continuum of rights’ and multiple forms of proof of ownership, the main focus of the <b>Land</b> <b>Governance</b> Assessment Framework is to make land a productive and investible resource. In the process, it relegates to the shadow social movements’ normative claims and alternative land ontologies that this article proposes to untangle relying on the French school of pragmatic sociology...|$|E
40|$|This {{comparative}} analysis examines how large-scale agricultural land acquisitions are implemented in Ghana and Kenya, using embedded {{case studies of}} two specific investment projects. We find that insufficiencies in these countries' <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> systems are partly caused by discrepancies between de jure and de facto procedures and that powerful actors tend {{to operate in the}} legal grey areas. These actors determine the implementation of projects to a large extent. Displacement and compensation are highly emotive issues that exacerbate tensions around the investment. We also find that large-scale land acquisitions have a feedback effect on the <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> system, which suggests that large-scale land acquisitions can be drivers of institutional change. We suggest there may be a window of opportunity here to reform these <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> {{has become a}} major {{priority}} for the development community. 1 A particular focus has been on sub-Saharan Africa due to the recognized paradox of high levels of land availability and low productivity in the region (see Deininger et al. 2012). While poor <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> systems have long been identified as a key reason for this disjuncture, the relatively recent large-scale impetus to improve <b>land</b> <b>governance</b> emerged from the inclusion of land management in 2009 as one of the four pillars under the African Union’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Develop-ment Program (CAADP). Subsequently, {{in the wake of the}} G- 8 ’s launch of the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutri-tion in 2012, many international initiatives have emerged to promote better <b>land</b> <b>governance.</b> These include the African Union’s Land Policy Initiative (AULPI) and the World Bank’s <b>Land</b> <b>Governance</b> Assessment Framework (LGAF). At the national level in Africa, land registration and land titling are the most common approaches to reform (Sikor and Müller 2009), with governments selecting among a broad spectrum of modalities to pilot. These include rural land use plans in some francophone countries (e. g., Benin, Burkina Faso, and Côte d’Ivoire), systematic land tenure regularization (Ethio-pia, Madagascar, Rwanda), and communal land demarcation and registration (e. g., Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania) (see Byamugisha 2013).
