40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to decrease the emergence of specific intellectual property risks within the production process as well as increasing risk management performance of IP by preventing them. In order to achieve this, previous studies regarding the main specific intellectual property risks from industrial companies were analyzed together with their managerial methods as well as the possibility of reducing their emergence. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the research conducted were identified five types of intellectual property risks that have <b>a</b> high potential <b>of</b> emergence in the production process, namely: the risk of production of goods in violation of IP rights; the know-how, production knowledge and trade secret disclosure risk; the technological risk of unprotected utility models; the technological risk of unprotected integrated circuits topographies and finally the risk of product counterfeit. In order to achieve the {{main purpose of}} our investigation, we have proposed new formulas for estimating the specific intellectual property risks identified in the production process. Their purpose was to minimalize the risk’s negative effects on industrial companies and to increase the managerial performance from the intellectual property domain through <b>a</b> new type <b>of</b> management appropriately named: intellectual property management. The research is finalized with a case study regarding the <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> invention. Based on a case analysis, it was proved that the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invention without a contract represents a counterfeit...|$|R
