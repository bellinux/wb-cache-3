500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] {{was written}} by Kara DioGuardi, Steve Morales and David Siegal, and was {{produced}} by Morales and Ric Wake. The song became DioGuardi's first writing credit for an artist from her native country. Simpson's vocals were recorded by Dan Hetzel at Sony Music Studios, New York City, and the track was mixed by Hetzel along with Richie Jones at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York. Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is for guys {{to listen to the}} girl". [...] "A guy needs to give a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> himself, a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his time. It's about the love going so much further, the guy would actually be selfless," [...] she expanded on the song's theme. In the United States, [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was released as the second single from Irresistible. The song saw an airplay-only release there, while in Australia, a physical single was issued on October29,2001. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song was also utilized for the company's promotional advertisement campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series {{four out of}} five stars, opining that the series is [...] "what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not-trying-to-be-cool way." [...] She found the crude animation [...] "refreshing" [...] but joked that the series [...] "can kill" [...] viewers not used to the slow pace. Writing for AOL TV, Adam Finley regarded the show as [...] "the most simplistically drawn of all the Adult Swim shows, and yet the most complex in terms of story." [...] He contrasted it with other Williams Street productions, finding it to [...] "instead unrave slowly, revealing a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what's underneath the surface while also piling on more and more questions." [...] Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media called it [...] "the asymptote of the block's crude style".|$|E
500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted to get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E
500|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Humphreys {{said of the}} album's musical direction: [...] "We're {{still trying}} to {{maintain}} our connection with our roots, but we've tried to go a <b>bit</b> <b>more,</b> even more stripped-down than English Electric." [...] McCluskey added: [...] "There's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> sort <b>of</b> crunchy industrial sound in a few things, a bit glitchy-er. But you know, {{the bottom line is}} that we have a sense of melody that we just can't throw off." [...] In May 2017, McCluskey noted the band's use of [...] "noises and repetitive patterns".|$|R
5000|$|It was rumoured that Jerry Goldsmith would {{compose the}} theme tune for Enterprise, having {{previously}} created the themes for both The Next Generation and Star Trek: Voyager.

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and {{when it came to the}} small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would be a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music." ...|$|E
500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried {{to give people a}} <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," [...] said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; {{by the end of the}} beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{hoped to}} more {{accurately}} recreate {{the energy of}} their live shows on the album. [...] "We were taking those experience on stage as reference points, rather than shedding them when {{we go into the}} studio, which is what we would always do," [...] co-frontman Scott McMicken said. “We chose a batch of songs that are a little darker, or a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> heart-on-your-sleeve kind <b>of</b> stuff.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Kasey Kahne, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "I hung {{with him for}} about three laps running in his kind of dirty air. I was right there. Then he just slowly crept away. It felt good. We were close. That’s a huge improvement. I was pretty happy." [...] "We had a similar fuel issue {{at the start of}} the Pocono race last year where we broke a fuel cable," [...] Hamlin said after the race. [...] "I thought maybe that’s what we did. When I went to take off his stop, it immediately shut off. While it was [...] "a downer, I was pretty confident we weren’t going to have it again. Because Mike crew chief never really gave me an alarm we were going to be stretching it on fuel." [...] In the subsequent press conference, Hamlin's crew chief said,"Towards the end of last season, where I said the best is yet to come, I strongly felt that way because towards the end of last season we closed out the season strong.

5000|$|In early February 2009, Sessions {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment about the}} Republican Party legislative strategy in the House of Representatives: [...] "Insurgency, we understand perhaps a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> because <b>of</b> the Taliban," [...] he said, during the 60-minute sitdown. [...] "And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person's entire processes." [...] He continued: [...] "I'm not trying to say the Republican Party is the Taliban.... I'm saying {{an example of how}} you go about it is to change a person from their messaging to their operations to their frontline message. And we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side, the House leadership, does not follow the same commands, which we entered the game with." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Exposé" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Lindelof {{admitted that}} the episode [...] "created a varying degree of fan reaction", with some fans even describing it as [...] "filler". But Cuse defended [...] "Exposé", saying it was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an anthology episode for the show", and that he felt that [...] "it's unrealistic, in a show that is now 72 episodes in, that every episode is gonna be, you know, chock full of plot momentum. I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled." [...] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode [...] "was a complete waste of time", and that although he [...] "wanted Nikki and Paulo to die", {{he did not think}} their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think [...] "Exposé" [...] "will do much to change anyone's minds" [...] about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] for Lost. New York Magazine put [...] "Exposé" [...] at the top of its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes". However, TV Guides Matt Roush very much praised the episode for [...] "weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons", Roush {{went on to say that}} [...] "Exposé" [...] was [...] "a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what they're doing after all." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television". The IGN staff later ranked [...] "Exposé" [...] 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as [...] "one of the series' darkest and most fun episodes".|$|E
2500|$|In {{translating}} {{the show to}} animation, the characters' designs were solidified. [...] "Jim Jinkins is an illustrator and not an animator, so his initial drawings were a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a wiggly line," [...] said Yvette Kaplan. The designs were inspired by Jinkins' period working for R. O. Blechman at the Ink Tank, incorporating Blechman's nervous line quality.|$|E
2500|$|Alejandro Arbona, the Marvel editor {{tasked with}} {{overseeing}} the 2010 tie-in comics Iron Man 2: Public Identity and Iron Man 2: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., explained that Marvel [...] "want to show readers {{more of that}} world, that connective tissue between all the movies, and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> how the characters interact", so the publishing side worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics and what {{to leave for the}} films, and how to [...] "make these stories as strong as possible" [...] from their experience making the films.|$|E
5000|$|Kyle Busch, who {{qualified}} second, {{said his}} car [...] "was pretty good. We certainly felt pretty {{happy with it}} earlier today and through practice and having a fast car there. So that was really strong in showing the speed that we have. Just trying to mimic that here today in qualifying. I felt like we did {{a really good job}} of that in the second round and I felt even better about my lap in the third round but Matt was just able to get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> it.

5000|$|After a month-long break, Dream Theater {{started working}} on their third studio album in February 1994. The band's two-month writing {{sessions}} were located at Prince Studios, New York City. The lack of a leader within the band increased tensions in what were already tense sessions. Keyboardist Kevin Moore noted {{at the time that}} [...] "there are arguments that last forever because there's nobody to come in and draw the line". [...] "When it came to the music, you had guitarist John Petrucci and I playing the roles we still kind of play, and Kevin was also a forceful element," [...] drummer Mike Portnoy said. [...] "In those days, bassist John Myung was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> his shell, so the bass was a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> predominant in the band.

2500|$|Finger Eleven is a Canadian {{rock band}} from Burlington, Ontario, formed in 1990. They have {{released}} seven total studio albums (six as Finger Eleven and one as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), with their album The Greyest of Blue Skies bringing {{them into the}} mainstream. The 2003 self-titled album achieved Gold status in the United States and Platinum in Canada, largely from {{the success of the}} single [...] "One Thing", which marked the band's first placing on the US Hot 100 Chart at number 16. Their 2007 album, Them vs. You vs. Me, launched the single [...] "Paralyzer", which went on to top numerous charts including the Canadian Hot 100 and both US rock charts, as well as reaching No.6 on the US Hot 100 and No.12 on the Australian Singles Chart. They won the Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year in 2008. It was later certified gold status in the US and multi platinum in Canada. They released their sixth studio album, Life Turns Electric, on October 5, 2010; it was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Rock Album of the Year.

2500|$|The third One-Shot, Item 47, had {{a bigger}} scope and budget than the {{previous}} shorts. Marvel approached Christopher Lennertz to provide a [...] "big and fun and funny" [...] score; Lennertz described the One-Shots as [...] "a little quirkier than the movies, {{in terms of making}} sure that they’re fast and they usually have a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a comedic bent to it". Lennertz' score for the short is [...] "rock-based", with a lot of electronics and guitars. For the opening bank robbery, [...] "We had a big twangy low guitar theme, almost like a Jack White kind of a thing on guitar". At the end of the short, when money 'rains down', Lennertz paid homage to Ennio Morricone with vocals in a [...] "classic spoofy" [...] way.|$|E

2500|$|As with Lewis's debut album, Spirit, each of Echos {{producers}} were enlisted by her mentors Simon Cowell and Clive Davis. Unlike {{her debut}} album where she travelled between cities, Lewis remained in Los Angeles for {{the recording of}} Echo, which took nine months to produce. It contains ballads, racier tracks and dancefloor anthems. Lewis titled the album Echo [...] "since an echo describes a big, organic sound," [...] and it appealed to her love of fantasy as Echo was a nymph who, in Greek mythology, [...] "pined away till only her voice remained." [...] In August 2009 Lewis told her official website: [...] "I'm {{in the midst of}} the recording process, working with incredible songwriters and producers, and my music has really evolved. It's so exciting to create something new." [...] She also said, [...] "I'm actually more confident with this album than the last. I've taken more control this time and I feel more at ease with everything." [...] She told Variety magazine that she [...] "wanted the album to have a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a live feel to it, with a little more live instrumentation," [...] and described Echo as [...] "more guitar-driven" [...] compared to Spirit, with a [...] "harder edge" [...] in an interview with Seventeen.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{commented on}} the musical style of her debut album {{describing}} the album as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", with R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds. However, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends but can be performed acoustically. Lewis's second album, [...] "Echo", mixed pop and R during an interview with Variety magazine, she said on the album's sound that she [...] "wanted the album to have a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a live feel to it, {{with a little more}} live instrumentation." [...] In February 2011, talking about her third studio album [...] "Glassheart", Lewis said that the album would be more experimental than Spirit and Echo by embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going to be kind of a different sound – but still classic".

[...] Several years before Angel debuted, Joss Whedon {{developed}} the concept behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer to invert the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie." [...] The character Angel was first seen in the first episode and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons 2 and 3. According to the fictional universe first established by Slayer, the 'Buffyverse', Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually {{set out on a}} path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In Buffys Season Three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that [...] "Angel was the one character who was bigger than life {{in the same way that}} Buffy was, a kind of superhero." [...] Whedon has compared the series to its parent, [...] "It's a little bit more straightforward action show and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a guys' show." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her. She's done something in music {{that no one has}} done {{and when you look at}} her old references and just her references period, you wonder what the mind of that person is, and she's my friend, so I get to get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> that mind, and it's really cool." ...|$|R
30|$|Admittedly, GBPS {{may cause}} some adverse effects while {{reducing}} medical expenditure. For example, the average visits per capital for GBPS is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> than that <b>of</b> FFS. The increasing times of visit {{may be a}} side effect of decreased medical service per visit, for a sense of health care providers to reduce expense for meeting the goal of the global budget may sometimes hypercorrect the former unnecessary expense by FFS. This hypercorrection, for example, reducing the amount of drugs prescribed per visit, can make the needs of some of the patients that indeed have a high demand of service unsatisfied, which will lead to increasing times of hospital visits. However, the average expense per visit for GBPS is smaller, which on the whole makes its total medical expense significantly lower.|$|R

However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best".

[...] It was Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun that inspired Usher to produce the album's title track, with producer Rico Love, which led to the singer collaborating with producers he normally wouldn't work with or admired, such as Diplo. Usher's intention for the album was one [...] "that was not genre-specific but just experimental". During an episode of NBC's The Voice, Usher called the album [...] "by far one of my most risky records ... I wanted to challenge myself".

40|$|Abstract. Two {{explicit}} formulas for metric {{connections in}} the bundle of Dirac spinors are studied. Their equivalence is proved. The explicit formula relating the spinor curvature tensor with the Riemann curvature tensor is rederived. 1. Basic notations and definitions. Dirac spinors play crucial role in modern particle physics. However, this crucial application of Dirac spinors is based mostly on the special relativity, where the base manifold M is the flat Minkowski space. Passing to the general relativity, we get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> complicated theory <b>of</b> spinors. Let M be a space-time manifold of the general relativity. It is a four-dimensional orientable manifold equipped with a pseudo-Euclidean Minkowski-type metric g and with a polarization. The polarization of M is responsible for distinguishing the Future light cone from the Past light cone at each point p ∈ M (see [1] for more details). Let’s denote by DM the bundle of Dirac spinors over M (see [2] and [3] for detailed description). In addition to the metric tensor g inherited from M, the Dirac bundle DM is equipped with four other basic spin-tensorial fields...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2013, amidst their {{tour of the}} USA, Borland told Billboard, [...] "We're {{really trying}} to get it {{hammered}} out here. We're done with most of the music, pretty much all the music. I've mixed two songs and have a lot more mixing to do. The lyrics and vocals are probably 30 percent done, and Fred is working as we speak, on tour." [...] Describing the album's sound, he said, [...] " [...] It's a little more pressure-free and a little more fun. I think it's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> sort <b>of</b> playful, taking chances, a little less pop structured type of stuff. I don't want to say it (sounds) younger, but maybe a little more carefree, musically, to where we don't over-think what we're doing. We're leaving mistakes in and going, 'Oh, that sounds great, leave that in.' That's sort of the thinking instead of polishing too much or trying to stay within the parameters of a formula." [...] He also said that producer Ross Robinson (who previously produced the band's debut album and The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) [...] ) has worked on [...] "a little bit" [...] of the album, along with the label's producer Detail, although it was primarily [...] "a do-it-yourself affair." [...] He further explained the album title, saying, [...] "It's just from being stupid. I think we saw a disco ball elephant in the window of a shop somewhere. We were like, 'Look, it's a disco elephant. We should call our record Stampede of the Disco Elephants.' It's just a 10-second conversation that snowballed." ...|$|R
