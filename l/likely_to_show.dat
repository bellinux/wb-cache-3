5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium would be quite a reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E

25|$|SubglandularThe breast implant is emplaced to the retromammary space, {{between the}} breast tissue (the mammary gland) and the pectoralis major muscle (major muscle of the chest), which most approximates {{the plane of}} normal breast tissue, and affords the most {{aesthetic}} results. Yet, in women with thin pectoral soft-tissue, the subglandular position is <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying implant. Moreover, the capsular contracture incidence rate is slightly greater with subglandular implantation.|$|R

25|$|Caregiver {{sensitivity}} {{has also}} {{been found to have}} a connection with empathy in children. Generally, securely attached children {{have been found to be}} more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result is that because securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times that they themselves are distressed, they are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> empathy in a situation where someone else is distressed.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{incident}} debriefing {{has been}} criticized by many for its effectiveness on reducing harm in crisis situations. Some studies show that those exposed to debriefing are actually more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> symptoms of PTSD at a 13-month follow-up {{than those who are}} not exposed to the debriefing. Most recipients of debriefing reported that they found the intervention helpful. Based on symptoms found in those who received no treatment at all, some critics state that reported improvement is considered a misattribution, and that the progress would naturally occur without any treatment.|$|E
25|$|Different {{qualities of}} the male partner have also been found to affect the {{existence}} of resistance to mate guarding in females. Research has found women with partners who have a low genetic quality, as defined by low sexual attractiveness in comparison to available resources, are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> mate guarding resistant behaviours. This is supported as recent research by Abell and Brewer (2016) suggests that women who believe alternative mates compared to her pair bonded male are of a higher quality {{are also more likely}} to resist mate guarding too.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} explored how emotional display rules at work differed {{as a function}} of discrete emotions and specific work targets. Display rules for the positive emotion of happiness were most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> involve expressing the emotion as felt or expressing it with less intensity than is felt. Display rules for the negative emotions of sadness and anger were equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> involve <b>showing</b> nothing of the emotion or showing the emotion with less intensity than is felt. In contrast, display rules for fear, disgust, and contempt were most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> involve <b>showing</b> nothing of the emotions. Furthermore, display rules differed across organizational targets, with the most control over emotional displays occurring for customer targets and the least control occurring for coworker targets. In sum, emotional display rules at work appear to be much more complex and nuanced than has been shown in previous organizational research...|$|R
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shown</b> interacting with sons than daughters.|$|R
25|$|High {{need for}} {{cognition}} {{is associated with}} a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., chair if the original list contained table and legs). People high in NFC are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> false memory for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as {{they are more likely to}} think of semantically related (but non-studied) items.|$|E
25|$|Seyfert galaxies. Seyferts {{were the}} {{earliest}} distinct class of AGN to be identified. They show optical range nuclear continuum emission, narrow and occasionally broad emission lines, occasionally strong nuclear X-ray emission {{and sometimes a}} weak small-scale radio jet. Originally they {{were divided into two}} types known as Seyfert 1 and 2: Seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while Seyfert 2s do not, and Seyfert 1s are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> strong low-energy X-ray emission. Various forms of elaboration on this scheme exist: for example, Seyfert 1s with relatively narrow broad lines are sometimes referred to as narrow-line Seyfert 1s. The host galaxies of Seyferts are usually spiral or irregular galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can develop after {{a person is}} exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, {{and an increase in}} the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last {{for more than a month}} after the event. Young children are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> distress but instead may express their memories through play. A person with PTSD is at a higher risk for suicide and intentional self-harm.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} {{of individuals to}} be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition {{that should be considered}} during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes. To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels {{are more likely to be}} effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> improved team performance. Additionally, higher levels of cognitive ability of team members has been shown to consistently correlate to increased work group effectiveness. Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.|$|E
25|$|Host {{plants that}} are taxonomically related show more similar EcM fungal {{communities}} than do taxa that are more distantly related. Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} fungi derived from a common ancestor are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> host specificity to {{plants that are}} taxonomically related. Host successional status may also play a role in determining EcM fungal communities, as well as affecting the number of EcM fungal species associated with an individual host species. Other indirect factors can also {{play a role in the}} EcM fungal community, such as leaf fall and litter quality, which subsequently affect calcium levels and soil pH. Even establishment timeframe of the host species can have an effect, with lower EcM fungal richness associated with hosts from a secondary forest than from a primary forest.|$|E
25|$|Women {{married to}} more possessive, {{controlling}} or jealous husbands {{are more likely}} to be unfaithful as well. Women who experience this type of behaviour from their partners are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> mate guarding resistance particularly by using covert tactics. Females pair bonded with mates who have higher digit span ratios who have previously cheated are also more likely to resist mate guarding. Digit span ratio is a sexually dimorphic trait and male humans generally have lower ratios. This means their ring finger/fourth finger is usually longer than their index/second finger. It is suggested that this relates to the risks involved with mate guarding resistance and the aggression of the male. In those with higher digit span ratios their index finger is longer than their ring finger. Higher digit span ratios often mean the male has less testosterone and may act less aggressively because of this, meaning the risks of mate guarding resistance for females is lower.|$|E

5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shown</b> as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|R
25|$|The {{absence of}} a global review, and the {{language}} barrier having partially hindered the flow of international information has led some international groups to level criticism at some wolf advocates, claiming that they have extrapolated America's general lack of negative experiences with wolves {{to the rest of}} the world, whilst ignoring the differing histories and cultures which lead to diverse interactions with the animals. Hunting proponents argue that wolves with no negative experiences of humans are more likely to encroach upon human settlements and attack people, citing for example the differences in attitudes toward the public distribution of firearms in America and Eurasia as examples as to why nations on both continents have differing accounts of wolf aggression. Hunting wolves is reasoned to maintain shyness in wolves, an idea which is correlated by a modern account demonstrating that wolves in protected areas are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> no fear toward humans than ones in areas where they are actively hunted. Historical and recent accounts indicate that individual wolves or wolf packs that turn man-eater typically do not stop until hunted and destroyed.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{error model}} is to {{introduce}} a small error to the data probability term in the homozygous cases, allowing a small constant probability that nucleotides which don't match the A allele are observed in the AA case, and respectively a small constant probability that nucleotides not matching the B allele are observed in the BB case. However more sophisticated procedures are available which attempt to more realistically replicate the actual error patterns observed in real data in calculating the conditional data probabilities. For instance, estimations of read quality (measured as Phred quality scores) have been incorporated in these calculations, {{taking into account the}} expected error rate in each individual read at a locus. Another technique that has successfully been incorporated into error models is base quality recalibration, where separate error rates are calculated - based on prior known information about error patterns - for each possible nucleotide substitution. Research shows that each possible nucleotide substitution is not equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up as an error in sequencing data, and so base quality recalibration has been applied to improve error probability estimates.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{potential}} physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a blood chemical linked to heart disease. A 2006 study conducted by the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by John Cacioppo from the University of Chicago, is that doctors report providing better medical care to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs cognition and willpower, alters DNA transcription in immune cells, and leads over time to high blood pressure. Lonelier people are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people. Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.|$|E

It is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo, then used for the living. A dove is his attribute, from the well-known story attributed to his friend Peter the Deacon, who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on Ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself. As, however, the pope remained silent for long periods at a time, the servant made {{a hole in the}} curtain and, looking through, beheld a dove seated upon Gregory's head with its beak between his lips. When the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words; but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips.|$|E
500|$|There {{is also a}} {{distinct}} variety of ASL used by the Black Deaf community. Black ASL evolved {{as a result of}} racially segregated schools in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf. Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure. While African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs. Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space. Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAVE; for instance, the AAVE idiom [...] "I feel you" [...] is calqued into Black ASL.|$|E

This concordance indicated that genes influenced such behavior. He did point out that behavioral patterns were strongly influenced by the environment and not set by genes alone. [...] The conference, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was contentious, with detractors arguing that such studies would lead to minority groups, more likely to be criminals because they had lower social status or were poor, being targeted with gene therapy for violence.
