40|$|Through the law no. 28 / 2009, the {{regional}} governments {{are allowed to}} collect {{the regional}} taxes. The tax collection in a region can be adjusted with the potential and the regional policy which is established together with the regional regulation. The target of the income in street <b>lightening</b> taxes that always established every year is always raised by Semarang City government. However, if we see from the achievement, it is always exceed from the target. It indicates that {{the realization of the}} income from the street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang is not suitable with the potential. The aims of this research are to present the potential of street <b>lightening</b> taxes income and the effectiveness of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang from 2003 until 2009. Beside that, the writer did the identification on the factors that affect the street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang. This research uses the secondary data from 2001 until 2009 period. The method of analysis data used in this research is the descriptive quantitative method with the regression analysis in interpolation data. This research results in finding the number of customers, connected power, and the using of electricity that affect in the income of street <b>lightening</b> taxes significantly and on the whole, the independent variables can explain the income of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang. The result in counting the potential of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang showed that the potential in street <b>lightening</b> taxes income in Semarang is still high. The industry groups have the biggest potential in street <b>lightening</b> taxes income. The effectiveness in street <b>lightening</b> taxes shows that the collection and the management of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang are not effective yet...|$|R

5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be <b>lightened</b> it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the raid was to destroy three objectives: the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire {{together}} with the water pumping machinery and other installations, and any U-boats or other shipping in the area.

However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups <b>lightened</b> more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} <b>lightened</b> to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was {{achieved}} by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. The {{shipyard}} attempted to launch her on 16 July 1874, but she stuck fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and stuck, extensively damaging her bottom plating. She was finally launched on 10 September, after she had been <b>lightened,</b> and she was towed to Samuda Brothers for repairs and fitting out. The cost of the accident resulted in the bankruptcy of Dudgeons in 1875.|$|E

5000|$|The {{practice}} of skin <b>lightening</b> and bleaching is a lucrative industry in Ghana, where higher value is placed upon being light skinned. This practice has been present since {{the sixteenth century}} and was influenced by contemporary practices, {{and it is a}} very longstanding and controversial topic. Skin bleaching is a practice where women and men use various chemical and cosmetics products to attempt to <b>lighten</b> or whiten the color of the skin. These products often contain one or both of two chemicals: hydroquinone and mercury and can sometimes lead to negative physical effects, such as cancer and can cause rash and flaky skin, as well as uneven light and dark patches on the skin. Because of the health risks involved with skin <b>lightening,</b> Ghana has implemented legislation against the use of skin <b>lightening</b> products. Though the products have recently been banned, Ghanaian women can still acquire them through illegal means or use homemade skin <b>lightening</b> chemicals.|$|R
5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have <b>lightened</b> {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been <b>lightened</b> at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E

After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further <b>lightened,</b> as her draught was still too deep to allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E

40|$|It is very {{important}} for electric power transmission line to protect the electric surge due to <b>lightening.</b> It is therefore indespensable to forecast the <b>lightening.</b> The measurement of the electric charge of snow fragments and rain dorops is intended for examining the relations of the electric charge of them, the snow falling and the <b>lightening.</b> It is carried out successively by a simple method which consists of an accumulating metal plate of the snow fragments on the porcelain insulator column and a high sensitive electrometer. It is found from the measurements that snow fragments with both electric polarities fall down alternatively and the almost same charge fall down in one falling period. A simple theory of <b>lightening</b> in winter is proposed based on the charge measurements. 電力送電線にとって雷撃による電気的サージを防ぐことは非常に大切である。それ故，雷撃の予測は不可欠である。降雪の電気量，降雪と雷撃の関係を調べるために，降雪の荷電量の測定を意図した。これは簡単な方法により，成功裡に行われた。この方法は長幹碍子の上に乗せた雪を集める金属板と高感度のエレクトロメータから構成されている。これらの測定から，両方の電気的極性をもつ雪が交互に降って来ることおよび一回の降雪の間にほぼ等量の電荷が降りて来ることが分った。これらの電荷測定にもとずき，冬季雷撃に関する簡単な理論を提案する...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} and prevalence {{of the practice}} of skin <b>lightening</b> in South Asian communities is widespread and the ideas behind the practice are deep-rooted. Skin <b>lightening</b> products are promoted using lifestyle advertising and this technique attracts and makes the product more relatable to its target audience. The trend to use skin <b>lightening</b> products and the advertisements promoting them have branched out into Canada as well, however, few consumers realize the harm that is brought on by purchasing and using the skin <b>lightening</b> products that are available in today's market. The framework surrounding the regulation of skin <b>lightening</b> products in Canada is inadequate and there are several gaps that need to be filled in order to better protect consumers. Like skin <b>lightening</b> products, tobacco products were also widely promoted using lifestyle advertising. In addition, the consumption and use of tobacco products also presents significant risks to consumers. Yet, tobacco regulation in Canada has undergone a major overhaul to address some of the same types of gaps that were initially found during its inception. Therefore, given the similarities in the methods of promotion coupled with the potential harm caused to consumers, this paper makes a case for similar frameworks to be put in place to regulate both types of products...|$|R
5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be <b>lightened,</b> the tide would then lift her off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, from whence she could not be moved.|$|E

Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E

50|$|Arbutin {{is derived}} from the leaves of bearberry, cranberry, {{mulberry}} or blueberry shrubs, and also is present in most types of pears. It can have melanin-inhibiting properties. Arbutin and other plant extracts are considered safe alternatives to commonly used depigmenting agents to make the skin fairer. Medical studies have shown the efficiency of arbutin for skin <b>lightening.</b> There are patents controlling its use for skin <b>lightening.</b> Arbutin actually exists in two isomers, alpha and beta. The alpha isomer offers higher stability over the beta isomer and is the preferred form for skin <b>lightening</b> indications.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes have {{prominent}} horn-like structures called ossicones, {{which are}} formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularized, the ossicones {{may have a}} role in thermoregulation, and are also used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges {{at the front of the}} skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. A giraffe's skull is <b>lightened</b> by multiple sinuses. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The upper jaw has a grooved palate and lacks front teeth. The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Celia was a powerful, early-season Category5 {{tropical}} cyclone that existed over the open {{waters of the}} eastern Pacific Ocean during late June 2010. Forming out of a tropical wave about 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico on June18, Celia quickly organized as deep convection consolidated around the center, attaining hurricane status by June20. Over the following days, the hurricane's winds fluctuated as wind shear impeded significant development hindering it from becoming potientially dangerous. Once this shear <b>lightened</b> on June24, the storm rapidly intensified to attain its peak strength with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). Not long after reaching this strength, wind shear increased and the system entered a dry, stable environment. Over the following 42hours, Hurricane Celia's sustained winds decreased to tropical storm force and the system began to stall over the open ocean by June27. Despite highly unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to retain tropical storm status through June28 and degenerated into a non-convective remnant low that evening. The remnants of Celia drifted northward, completing a counter-clockwise loop, and dissipated on June30.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be <b>lightened</b> forward. Water casks used as ballast and {{passengers}} were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
