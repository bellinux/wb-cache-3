5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the <b>Latin</b> American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the <b>Latin</b> American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the <b>Latin</b> American tyrant and United States imperialism.

The French translation was never published. The <b>Latin</b> version was the initial introduction of Upanishadic thought to Western scholars. However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning.|$|E

50|$|In 390 a Gaulish warband first {{defeated}} the Roman army at the Battle of the Allia and then sacked Rome. According to Livy the <b>Latins</b> and Hernici, after {{a hundred years}} of loyal friendship with Rome, used this opportunity to break their treaty with Rome in 389. In his narrative of the years that followed, Livy describes a steady deterioration of relations between Rome and the <b>Latins.</b> In 387 the situation with <b>Latins</b> and Hernici {{was brought up in}} the Roman senate, but the matter was dropped when news reached Rome that Etruria was in arms. In 386 the Antiates invaded the Pomptine territory and it was reported in Rome that the <b>Latins</b> had sent warriors to assist them. The <b>Latins</b> claimed they had not sent aid to the Antiates, but had not prohibited individuals from volunteering for such service. A Roman army under Marcus Furius Camillus and P. Valerius Potitus Poplicola met the Antiates at Satricum. In addition to Volscians the Antiates had brought a large number of <b>Latins</b> and Hernicians to the field. In the battle that followed the Romans were victorious and the Volscians were slaughtered in great number. The <b>Latins</b> and Hernicians now abandoned the Volscians, and Satricum fell to Camillus. The Romans demanded to know from the <b>Latins</b> and Hernici why for the last few years' wars they had not furnished any contingents. They claimed not {{to have been able to}} supply troops due to fear of Volscian incursions. The Roman senate considered this defence to be insufficient, but that time was not right for war. In 385 the Romans appointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus Dictator to deal with the Volscian war. The Dictator marched his army into the Pomptine territory, which he had heard was being invaded by the Volscians. The Volscian army was once again swelled by <b>Latins</b> and Hernici, including contingents from the Roman colonies of Circeii and Velitrae, and in the battle that followed the Romans were once again victorious. The majority of the captives are found to be Hernici and <b>Latins,</b> including men of high rank, which the Romans take as proof that their states are formally assisting the Volscians. However the sedition of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus prevented Rome from declaring war on the <b>Latins.</b> When the <b>Latins,</b> Hernici, and the colonists of Circeii and Velitrae tried to persuade the Romans to release those of their countrymen who had been made prisoner, they were refused. That same year Satricum was colonized with 2,000 Roman citizens, each to receive two and a half jugera of land.|$|R
5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: <b>Latin</b> Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} <b>Latin</b> Christians were in power tended to favor <b>Latin</b> Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} <b>Latin</b> Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, <b>Latin</b> Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E

5|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the High Middle Ages, when <b>Latin</b> scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying <b>Latin</b> and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a <b>Latin</b> phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364–1437) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such <b>Latin</b> authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of such <b>Latin</b> literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.|$|E
