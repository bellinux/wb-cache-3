50|$|Some {{species of}} parrot bear his name, {{including}} the <b>lilac-crowned</b> <b>parrot</b> Amazona finschi and the grey-headed parakeet Psittacula finschii. The monitor lizard Varanus finschi {{is named after}} him, as he collected {{what would become the}} holotype for this species. The crater Finsch on the Moon is also named in his honor.|$|E
40|$|Nesting {{behavior}} of the <b>Lilac-crowned</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Amazona finschi) was observed over a three year period at 24 nests in the tropical dry forest of the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, western Mexico. Nest site characteristics and the pattern of parental care throughout the nesting cycle are described for this mainland Amazon parrot and compared with that reported for other Amazon parrot species. Nest sites were located in natural cavities of large mature trees characteristic of semi-deciduous forest. Nest sites were similar {{to one another in}} tree species, tree size, cavity height, and entrance width, indicating that Lilac-crowned Parrots may select nest sites based on these characteristics. Unlike most parrot species, Lilac-crowned Parrots showed low nest site reuse and high synchrony of nest initiation. Throughout the nesting cycle, females and nestlings were fed only twice a day on average. Nest attendance during feeding visits was short. The infrequent feeding visits and short nest attendance exhibited by Lilac-crowned Parrots corresponds with that found for other mainland Amazon parrots in northeastern Mexico, but contrasts with the multiple feedings and longer nest attendance observed for island Amazon species. The distinct aspects of <b>Lilac-crowned</b> <b>Parrot</b> nesting behavior may be related to predation rate and food resource availability during the extreme dry season...|$|E
50|$|Several species, {{including}} red-lored <b>parrots</b> (Amazona autumnalis), <b>lilac-crowned</b> <b>parrots</b> (Amazona finschi) and yellow-chevroned parakeets (Brotogeris chiriri), {{have become}} well established in Southern California and {{a population of}} mainly red-masked or cherry-headed parakeets/conures, a female mitred parakeet/conure and thus several inter-specific hybrids {{live in the area}} of Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, as depicted in the documentary The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill. In the greater San Francisco Bay Area, there are several populations of red-masked parakeets, including in Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Sunnyvale.|$|R
40|$|The Psittacidae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} families of birds in the world. Knowledge of its nutrition is important for understanding their survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate husbandry in captivity. Hand-rearing is a common practice for this group. However, research on their requirements is limited. Analysis of the crop content of chicks can provide new insights into psittacine nutrition, but it is limited by the small sizes of samples which can be obtained. We sampled the crops from free-living chicks of scarlet macaws and red-and-green macaws from southeastern Peru, Cuban parrots from the Bahamas, <b>lilac-crowned</b> <b>parrots</b> from northwestern Mexico, and thick-billed parrots from northern Mexico. The predicted metabolizable energy, protein, fat, minerals, profile of essential amino acids and profile of fatty acids of the crop samples, as well as from 15 commercial hand-rearing formulas, were analyzed and contrasted. Near Infrared Spectroscopy was shown to be a valid technique for the nondestructive, low cost prediction of a variety of nutritional attributes of crop samples as small as 0. 5 g dry weight, expanding the possibilities of wild animal nutrition research. The diets of the five studied species presented remarkable similarities and common patterns. The predicted dietary metabolizable energy and fat concentrations were particularly similar among species, the thick-billed parrot being the one with the most unique nutrient profile. The fatty acid profile of the crop contents differed markedly among genera, with the thick-billed parrot closer to the macaws than to the parrots. In comparison with the crop samples, the hand feeding formulas presented lower fat, Mg, arginine, and valine concentrations. The wide variation in nutrients suggests that there is not yet a consensus among manufacturers concerning the correct nutrition for growing psittacines. It is suggested that a single formulation could be used to hand-rear macaws and parrots from half its nesting time to fledging, and further research should focus on their nutrition during the first half. Our results suggest that manufacturers should evaluate if increasing the concentrations of crude fat, Mg, arginine, and valine in commercial formulas enhances psittacine chick growth and health...|$|R
