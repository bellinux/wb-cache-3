5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> mobility in stratified societies.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{symptoms}} of autism spectrum disorders {{can interfere with}} the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> skills. Children with autism {{have been found to be}} more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability. A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> skills that would usually inhibit friendships.|$|E

25|$|This {{group of}} artists, of whom Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt were the central figures, {{rejected}} the indulgent classicism, the materialism and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> responsibility that they perceived in the artistic trends of mid-19th-century painting. They sought to recreate in their works the simple forms, bright colours, religious devotion and artistic anonymity {{of the period}} of art that preceded {{the rise of the}} great and famous individuals of the Renaissance period.

25|$|About {{a decade}} after Karasek first {{introduced}} the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989), {{in the context of}} research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support “iso-strain.” The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand–control–support (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that {{one or more of the}} components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.|$|E

25|$|Although {{lessons and}} {{training}} may help peers {{of children with}} autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of The New York Times, bullying {{is most likely to}} occur against autistic children who have the most potential to live independently, such as those with Asperger syndrome. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> skills as children with full autism, but {{they are more likely to}} be mainstreamed in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to social cues, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.|$|E

Roosevelt and is unable to understand his indifference towards their insensitivity and shallow dismissal of political engagement. At the same time, his serenity is disturbed by her <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> graces and her polarizing postures. Hubbell breaks it off with Katie, but soon agrees to work things out, at least for a time.|$|E
25|$|For {{three years}} in a row, more than 30 percent of Mississippi's {{residents}} have been classified as obese. In a 2006 study, 22.8 percent of the state's children were classified as such. Mississippi had the highest rate of obesity of any U.S. state from 2005 to 2008, and also ranks first in the nation for high blood pressure, diabetes, and adult inactivity. In a 2008 study of African-American women, contributing risk factors were shown to be: lack of knowledge about body mass index (BMI), dietary behavior, physical inactivity and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> support, defined as motivation and encouragement by friends. A 2002 report on African-American adolescents noted a 1999 survey which suggests that a third of children were obese, with higher ratios for those in the Delta.|$|E
