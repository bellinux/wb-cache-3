5|$|Anderitum {{appears to}} have been a {{particularly}} important <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted in coordination with naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through the Channel. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to control access to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland. It was linked by a road built in the late Roman period, probably at the same time as the fort.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, DSHD {{initiated}} traffic {{surveys and}} studies to inform plans {{to construct a}} four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DoverDelmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, {{only a small portion}} of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.|$|E

5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E
5|$|The Landing on Emirau was {{the last}} of the series of {{operations}} that made up Operation Cartwheel, General Douglas MacArthur's strategy for the encirclement of the major Japanese base at Rabaul. A force of nearly 4,000 United States Marines landed on the island of Emirau on 20 March 1944. The island was not occupied by the Japanese and there was no fighting. It was developed into an airbase which formed the final <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chain of bases surrounding Rabaul. The isolation of Rabaul permitted MacArthur to turn his attention westward and commence his drive along the north coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|As {{industry}} and railroads left the Mississippi riverfront, people gradually {{became aware that}} the riverfront could be a destination for living, working, and shopping. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board acquired land along the river banks, including much of Nicollet Island, all of Boom Island, and the West River Parkway corridor. These properties were developed with trails and parkways, and this spurred the development of private land adjacent to the riverfront, creating the new Mill District neighborhood. The Stone Arch Bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic in 1994, creating a <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trail system and providing spectacular views of Saint Anthony Falls. Some of the old commercial buildings were adapted to new uses. The Whitney Hotel was built {{in what used to}} be the Standard Mill, while the North Star Lofts was a new use for the former North Star Woolen Mills building. Other projects, such as Saint Anthony Main and a number of condominium and townhouse projects, provide residents with the opportunity to live within view of Saint Anthony Falls.|$|E
5|$|Desertion had {{continued}} to be a problem for the 24th Infantry, a de facto segregated unit. Statistics compiled by the Eighth Army found the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 25th Infantry throughout August, compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. The regiment had already been criticized for its poor performance at the Battle of Sangju several weeks earlier. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, and found its poor performance was starting to bring other units of the division down as well. Kean considered the regiment a weak <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chain, and after its poor performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, he suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{training}} camp, {{a series of}} selection trials were held in Brisbane and Melbourne. In three 100-metre races, Morgan came third, fifth and fourth respectively, with a best time of 1 minute 7.3 seconds. She recorded a best performance of third {{in a time of}} 5 minutes 10.0 seconds in the 400-metre freestyle behind Crapp and Fraser. Australia was entitled to three representatives in each individual event, thus allowing Morgan to compete in her first Olympics. Morgan missed out in the 100-metre freestyle as Fraser, Crapp and Leech were selected, but she gained an individual berth in the 400-metre along with Fraser and Crapp. She was one of six swimmers selected for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad, the first from Australia to compete at Olympic level. Morgan was placed under substantial pressure by media commentary that regarded her as the weak <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relay team.|$|E
5|$|Great Northern Highway {{travels to}} remote areas of Western Australia, {{including}} the Munjina Roadhouse near the Hamersley Ranges, and {{the communities of}} Eighty Mile Beach, Wallal, Sandfire and Mandora, which are located between Broome and Port Hedland. It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres {{in the north of}} the state. Economically, Great Northern Highway is also a vital <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt, Mid West, Pilbara, and Kimberley. The key industries of mining, agriculture, and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport. Tourism accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} road's traffic, and is a growing part of or potential growth source for the regional economies. The highway provides access to a variety of tourist attractions, including New Norcia, the Yilgarn area, and various national parks, including Karijini. Parts of the highway itself are included in the tourist routes Swan Valley Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive203) in Perth, Chittering Valley Tourist Way (Tourist Drive359) in Bullsbrook, Midlands Tourist Way (Tourist Drive360) from Upper Swan to Walebing, and Geikie–Windjana Tourist Way (Tourist Drive350) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{construction}} {{continued on}} {{the western part of}} the US 80 freeway. On August 27, 1951, the final <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new freeway between Point Loma and La Mesa was dedicated. The next year, planning continued for the possibility of a freeway bypass of El Cajon that would connect to the existing US 80 freeway. However, many El Cajon Boulevard motel owners raised objections over the reassigning of the US 80 designation to the new freeway, as it would potentially harm business. In response, the Highway Development Association proposed designating El Cajon Boulevard as a business route. But in order to obtain funding for the construction, the new route would have to be added to the state highway system by the California State Legislature, or be designated as US 80. Later, a Freeway 80 Association was formed to encourage public support for the construction of the bypass of El Cajon, and the conversion of the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley roads into a freeway. Following the city of San Diego council and county approval, the California State Assembly transportation committee heard complaints from citizens claiming that they had not been adequately notified about the plans for US 80 or SR 94, or given enough time to provide input.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder still fulfils its {{original}} purpose of linking Leeds and Wakefield with York and the Humber (and thence the Trent), although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly. More recent canals now {{also make the}} Navigation a vital <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English and Welsh connected inland waterway network. Beyond Leeds, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal carries boats over the Pennines. The Calder and Hebble Navigation, which connects to the Navigation at Wakefield, allows boats to reach the Huddersfield Broad and Narrow Canals, and the Rochdale Canal. The Selby Canal connects to the Ouse, from where boats can travel upstream to reach York, Boroughbridge and Ripon, or downstream to the River Derwent. Beyond Goole are the Humber and hence Hull, Immingham, and the North Sea. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, which {{can be reached via}} the New Junction Canal, forms a link with Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield to the south west, and the tidal River Trent at Keadby to the east.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key <b>link</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
