5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E

HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} ability of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and liver imaging tests to detect hepatic metastases was performed. Eighty patients at risk for hepatic metastases but without clinical evidence of disease were <b>tested</b> with 13 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and three liver imaging <b>tests.</b> No single <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> had greater than 65 % accuracy in the detection of hepatic lesions. No combination of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> increased this accuracy. If the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were used {{with one of the}} liver imaging tests, the accuracy was improved in some combinations to 76 %. The CEA assay when analyzed in patients with colorectal primaries had an accuracy of 79 %. The results show that the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> alone are not sufficiently accurate to detect liver metastases.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:Because of the {{increase}} in diagnostic resources, <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> have become an essential tool in diagnostic elucidation. Therefore, we observe {{an increase in the number}} of tests request. Objectives:To determine the prevalence of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> requests by the intensive care unit (ICU) of the General Hospital at southwest Bahia, and to anticipate the expenses with unnecessary <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests,</b> indicating avoidable costs, and aiming at rationalization of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> use. Methods:This is a cross-sectional retrospective study, in which a survey on medical records and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> results of patients admitted to the ICU was conducted, in the period from August to September 2013. Results:The sample consisted of 105 patients, 58. 1 % males, 47. 6 % aged between 18 - 59 years. During the period, 12. 217 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were ordered, of which 49. 4 % was within the normal limits. The more requested exams were: complete blood count, sodium, and potassium. A number of 1. 750 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> could be evaluated according to criteria established in the literature, among them, 719 (41 %) were considered unnecessary. A greater number of requests (29 %) were observed on Mondays, compared with the average of the rest of the week. Conclusion:Significant number of unnecessary testing was found, with occurrence pattern on Monday and not dependent on age or length of stay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patient {{safety and}} {{the life cycle of}} a drug are {{negatively}} influenced by the still increasing occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Clinical risk management of potential DDIs is required in patients using drugs to influence the benefit-risk profile positively. Information about <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> results, in particular, may be useful in the assessment of potential DDIs for the individual patient. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the frequency and nature of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> required for the assessment of the clinical relevance of potential DDIs in Dutch community pharmacies. In addition, the nature and clinical relevance of these potential DDIs is analysed. METHODS: All patients from 100 Dutch community pharmacies using, according to dispensing information, two or more drugs concomitantly on a specified date (Wednesday, 4 April 2007), were included (n = 223, 019). The anonymous dispensing data of the included patients were analysed against a list of DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> for the assessment of their clinical relevance. The number of patients at risk for these potential DDIs with severe adverse reactions was calculated. The frequency of potential DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were stratified by age, sex and degree of polypharmacy. RESULTS: Of the included patients, 24. 4 % had one or more potential DDIs (n = 54, 427). In 9. 0 % of the included patients, one or more <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> for the assessment of clinical relevance of the potential DDI were required (n = 19, 968). The frequency of DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> increased with increasing age and number of drugs, but was not related to sex. The most commonly required <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were for renal function (42. 2 %), electrolytes (20. 1 %) and coagulation (13. 1 %). The percentage of patients at risk for potential DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> with adverse reaction category F (serious, irrecoverable disablement or death) was 2. 5 %; category E (increased risk of failure of life-saving therapy) was 0. 6 %; and category D (inconvenience with residual symptom and failure of therapy concerning serious but non-fatal diseases) was 3. 8 %. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of patients in Dutch community pharmacies are at risk for potential DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> for the assessment of the clinical relevance of the interaction. There is a strong relationship between the frequency of DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and age and the number of drugs concomitantly used. In the clinical risk management of potential DDIs, information about <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> results is of additional value. Future research is necessary in order to obtain more evidence on using <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> in terms of which tests should be linked to pharmacy data, in which patients they should be done, how often and what actions should be taken when an abnormal value is found...|$|R
