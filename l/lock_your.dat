5000|$|He was the [...] "first Magnus" [...] to rule Sweden for {{any length}} of time, not {{generally}} regarded as a usurper or a pretender (but third Magnus to have been proclaimed Sweden's king and ruled there).

50|$|From Ubin Jetty, one {{can reach}} Chek Jawa by walking (about one hour) or on bicycle. Bikes can be rented at the vendors in Kampong Ubin next to Ubin Jetty. Make {{sure to get}} a {{mountain}} style bike with a basket for your water and a bike lock (It {{is a good idea}} to bring water over from Changi Village). The bike trail is rather rigorous, hilly and is not for the faint-hearted or inexperienced. The paths are clear and the bike trails are paved to a point, then continue unpaved the second half of the way to Chek Jawa. You may come across dogs, monkeys and large, wild chingale boars, all of which are harmless if left alone. Do not feed them. You must park and <b>lock</b> <b>your</b> bike at the entrance to Chek Jawa Wetlands and enter on foot.|$|E
5000|$|The motif is {{not merely}} a {{historical}} phenomenon: it continues in contemporary songwriting. Steve Earle's song [...] "More Than I Can Do," [...] for example, gives a typical paraklausithyronic situation with such lines as [...] "Just because you won't unlock your door /That don't mean you don't love me anymore" [...] as does his song [...] "Last of the Hardcore Troubadours," [...] in which the singer addresses a woman, saying [...] "Girl, don't bother to <b>lock</b> <b>your</b> door / He's out there hollering, [...] "Darlin' don't you love me no more?" [...] Similarly, the first two verses of Jimi Hendrix's [...] "Castles Made of Sand" [...] involve paraklauithyronic situation of a man kicked out by his lover. Likewise, Bob Dylan's song Temporary Like Achilles contains many features typical of the ancient motif (lament at the door, long wait, presence of a guard as a further obstacle, etc.) and recalls the pathos and rhetoric of the Roman elegiac paraclausithyron.|$|E
