50|$|On 18 July 2012, two Chinese workers {{died after}} a {{temporary}} scaffolding, about 4 m high, {{used for the}} construction of the new Downtown Line Bugis station subway <b>link</b> <b>roof</b> slab gave way. The incident happened at about 6.50 am. The eight other injured workers who were working on top of the structure, were sent to the nearby Raffles Hospital before rescuers arrived. They had minor injuries and five of them have since been discharged. Of the remaining three workers who were warded, one suffered from abdominal and chest injuries, while another suffered a back injury and the last had a finger injury. Seven of the injured are from Bangladesh while the eighth is from China. The Ministry of Manpower(MOM) has ordered all construction work to stop, while the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has revoked the construction permit for the site while investigations are underway. MOM said that based on preliminary information gathered, workers were pouring concrete, also known as the casting process, into the formwork when the structure supporting the formwork collapsed. The formwork, located between the new and old sections of the station, was part of the structure being built to form the underground linkway, which is about three to four metres deep. The area affected is localised, measuring about five metres by 10 metres and the entire station is about 7,500 square metres. The Land Transport Authority said the station structure is substantially complete and structurally sound, and that the incident posed no risk to surrounding developments and the public.|$|E

50|$|The {{inscription}} on the rainwater {{head of the}} hall indicates the hall was built in 1792. According to records the hall was raised and altered in about 1845 and in 1889-90 additions were made by Robert Evans. The square plan building is built in three storeys and features stucco, with ashlar dressings and hipped slate roofs with various coped stacks. The windows mainly have glazing bar sashes and include a Venetian window and 4 reglazed French windows. At the rear, {{north end of the}} property, is a square service building with pyramidal <b>roof,</b> <b>linked</b> by a curved corridor.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the magazine and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The garrison of 24 men and one officer lived in a casemate on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating. The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size.A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water. An internal drainage system <b>linked</b> to the <b>roof</b> enabled rainwater to refill the cistern.|$|R
50|$|Among {{its public}} {{projects}} is the Savill Building at Windsor Great Park, shortlisted for the 2007 RIBA Stirling Prize. The competition winning scheme run by The Crown Estate, {{was intended to}} create a gateway to the listed gardens reflecting the character {{and quality of the}} park. The building grouped all visitor facilities under a grid shell roof creating a series of <b>linked</b> spaces. The <b>roof</b> is constructed from larch and clad with green oak from sustainable sources from the Windsor Estate. It is supported by an earth structure on the entrance side which houses ancillary facilities, while the garden side is elevated on legs {{to take advantage of the}} views. It opened to the public in June 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The big {{question}} that engineers and workers were tested {{for their ability}} to perform a superstructure - a false ellipse, measuring the major axis of 275 meters and the lowest 217 meters - using conventional equipment. To evaluate and eliminate uncertainties, a [...] "mini-Mineirão" [...] was designed, called the experimental sector 15, where a <b>link</b> bleachers and <b>roof</b> would be subjected to all sorts of evidence. Concrete plants, conveyors, degrees, loaders and shuttle were tested. The complexity of the work required iron bars into lengths that the industry was unable to attend. The solution came in the actual construction site, where engineers and workers solder used to promote the extension of the bars.|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating low {{pressures}} {{near the}} edges of flat roofs are often caused when the wind impinges on {{one corner of the}} building so that conical vortices form above the diagonal roof edges. In turbulent flow, these vortices vary in position and strength and the underlying surface pressures fluctuate accordingly. A preliminary approach {{to the study of the}} mechanism <b>linking</b> instantaneous <b>roof</b> edge pressures with the wind vortical structures involves the evaluation of mean characteristics and positions of the latter. However the flow examination has so far been severely limited by the restriction of available anemometers to single–point sampling. In this experimental study, a 200 mm cube has been used to model a building with a flat square roof set at an angle of 45 ° to the oncoming flow direction, and a Particle Image Velocimetry system was used to capture instantaneous two–dimensional velocity vector images of entire flow cross–sections, both normal to the vortex axis and in planes parallel to that axis. The se vector maps were used to estimate the mean characteristics of the vortices and appropriate observation–plane directions to measure wind velocities in the study of the instantaneous problem...|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was built}} as an {{administrative}} center and manor house {{rather than as}} a pure defensive structure. The main building is a three-story rectangular building with a half-hipped roof. An octagonal staircase tower topped with a pointed <b>roof</b> <b>links</b> the levels together. An enclosed courtyard links the main building to a gatehouse and the granary. However, the walls, towers and gatehouse were built to make it into an impressive government building, not for defensive purposes. Many of the rooms still feature the original coffered ceilings from 1575. The main entrance moved to the north side in the 18th century. The new entrance was decorated in the Louis XVI style and a fountain topped with an obelisk. The attached granary was rebuilt in the mid-18th century and again in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The funerary complex has a {{remarkable}} layout as a double architectural composition, with two blocks straddling {{the main street}} {{in the heart of}} medieval Cairo. There are two blocks: the western - consisting of a Mosque with its minaret; the eastern one is a funerary complex, consisting of a mausoleum, a hall called Khanqah, a maq'ad, a graveyard and a sabil-maktab. Both the buildings are built above shops connected to markets stretching along the side street. To provide shade for the street a wooden <b>roof</b> <b>links</b> the buildings. Although the dome and the minaret are separated by the street, they were conceived as a single, harmonious composition and were united by blue ceramic decoration. These blue ceramics is similar to the blue ceramic decoration other the sultan's minaret at Al-Azhar.|$|R
25|$|The {{lower section}} of the {{building}} had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window {{in the end of}} the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the Baptistery of San Giovanni, the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window. For the first time, Alberti <b>linked</b> the lower <b>roofs</b> of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|The 2007 Delica D:5 {{is built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). It employs a [...] "rib bone frame" [...] design that uses closed-section joins to <b>link</b> the pillars, <b>roof</b> bows and underfloor cross members in hoops at the pillars and the rear door opening to realize significant improvements in body rigidity and durability {{as well as to}} provide better crashworthiness. It makes more extensive use of rust-resistant steel in the floor structure than the previous generations. Body corrosion resistance has also been significantly improved through the more extensive use of underfloor sealing and with the application of more undercoat. It uses fender panels made of a plastic resin that is flexible and can recover its shape. The switch to this material reduces weight by about 4 kg and makes the fenders more resistant to damage in minor impacts.|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila eggshell {{constitutes}} a remarkable {{system for the}} study of epithelial patterning, both experimentally and through computational modeling. Dorsal eggshell appendages arise from specific regions in the anterior follicular epithelium that covers the oocyte: two groups of cells expressing broad (roof cells) bordered by rhomboid expressing cells (floor cells). Despite the large number of genes known to participate in defining these domains and the important modeling efforts put into this developmental system, key patterning events still lack a proper mechanistic understanding and/or genetic basis, and the literature appears to conflict on some crucial points. We tackle these issues with an original, discrete framework that considers single-cell models that are integrated to construct epithelial models. We first build a phenomenological model that reproduces wild type follicular epithelial patterns, confirming EGF and BMP signaling input as sufficient to establish the major features of this patterning system within the anterior domain. Importantly, this simple model predicts an instructive juxtacrine signal <b>linking</b> the <b>roof</b> and floor domains. To explore this prediction, we define a mechanistic model that integrates the combined effects of cellular genetic networks, cell communication and network adjustment through developmental events. Moreover, we focus on the anterior competence region, and postulate that early BMP signaling participates with early EGF signaling in its specification. This model accurately simulates wild type pattern formation and is able to reproduce, with unprecedented level of precision and completeness, various publishe...|$|R

40|$|Valeriani {{was invited}} to {{contribute}} to this volume following the publication of her 2006 monograph, ‘Kirchendächer in Rom - Capriate Ecclesiae’, which has subsequently been regularly cited {{in the field of}} construction history (e. g. Klein 2012, Holzer 2009, Zalewski 2009). The research presented in this chapter develops the above work to make an original argument about the <b>link</b> between <b>roof</b> structures and ceilings, which in turn influence enormously the spacial qualities of church interiors of early Christian origin. The space of the early Christian basilica is usually characterised as being ‘closed’ by a richly decorated horizontal surface reflecting the light, but Valeriani shows how a darker, less defined space which might be described as a ‘forest’ of beams and timbers was actually common. Valeriani’s work presents research in Roman archives (Vatican and individual churches), as well as her analysis of early modern printed sources, and new fieldwork, to show how some of the prevailing ideas about early Christian basilicas were formed in the Renaissance and in the 18 th century. Valeriani’s approach is to consider in detail the technical solutions adopted to achieve different spatial effects. In this, she supports the general aim of this much-praised volume, the second in a series edited by Gargiani which sets out to develop a new approach to the history of architecture, one that concentrates on a history of construction problems, thereby de-constructing the history of architecture into the history of its constitutive parts. She has been invited to present on this theme at various institutions, including the Institute of Structural Engineers, London and the University of Hamburg (2008), and at the Istitituto Storia della Cultura Materiale (Genova, 2012). Valeriani’s work on a closely-related topic was published as ‘Behind the Façade: Elias Holl and the Italian influence on building techniques in Augsburg’ in ‘architectura’ (2008) ...|$|R

40|$|Green roofs {{could act}} as a thermal buffer in {{buildings}} and offer potential energy savings. However, the energy benefits from green roofs are not usually properly recognised by traditional building energy regulations. Building energy regulations are traditionally over-simplistic during {{the assessment of the}} energy performance of complex building constructions. In the case of green roof designs, it is essential that the assessment mechanisms should not ignore the complex heat and moisture balances within the green roof layers. In this paper, dynamic energy modelling that considers the complexity within the green roof layers is adopted to guide policy makers in China on the relationship between using specific thicknesses of roof insulation against green roof layers. Simulations are run for a residential building type by also considering different thermal envelope characteristics across eight large Chinese cities and within the five main climatic zones of China. Results that <b>link</b> the green <b>roof</b> characteristics with respective traditional insulation layers are produced for all cities and it is found that optimising the plant and soil characteristics of green roofs in some climates could substitute more than 125 mm of roof insulation, while less optimum green roof types could only replace about 25 mm of roof insulation...|$|R

Feroz Shah is said to have embellished the top of the pillar with frescoes in black and white stone topped with a gilded copper cupola. But at present, what is visible is the smooth polished surface of the pillar, and an elephant carving added much later. It has also been noted that this pillar, apart from the Ashokan edict, has another set of text inscribed in Sanskrit [...] "below and around Ashokan edict", in nagari script.
