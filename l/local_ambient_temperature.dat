Initial validation of the accuracy of the depth measurements as a measure of respiratory level was performed on a single healthy volunteer. He was positioned on a vacuum mattress (BodyFIX BlueBAG, Elekta, Crawley, UK) to limit movement and maximise the respiratory surface motion on the skin surface and asked to perform several respiratory manoeuvres, in the supine and prone positions. During these manoeuvres, the mean depth measurements were recorded and a Jaeger Masterscope with spirometry software (SentrySuite V 2.13, CareFusion, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to measure the respiratory level. The spirometer was calibrated using a 3 L calibration syringe. <b>Local</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> humidity and air pressure were updated in the system. The respiratory manoeuvres consisted of a complete inspiration, resulting in a peak in both signals to temporally align them, and several tidal volumes. The volume and inverted mean distance measurements for the supine and prone positions were superimposed plotted in graphs and assessed visually.|$|E

The analyzed data were obtained from three distinct data sets: 32 Si and 36 Cl decays reported by an experiment performed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), 56 Mn decay reported by the Children's Nutrition Research Center (CNRC), but also performed at BNL, and 226 Ra decay reported by an experiment performed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany. All three data sets exhibit the same primary frequency mode consisting of an annual period. Additional spectral comparisons of the data to <b>local</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, Earth-Sun distance, and their reciprocals were performed.

This suggests that either a combination of factors was responsible, or that, if it was a single factor, its effects on the decay rate experiments are not a direct synchronous modulation. We conclude that the annual periodicity in these data sets is a real effect, but that further study involving additional carefully controlled experiments will be needed to establish its origin...|$|E

Southern ground-hornbills are listed as Endangered in South Africa, with reintroductions into suitable areas highlighted as a viable conservation intervention for the species. Nest microclimate, and the possible implications this may have for the breeding biology of southern ground-hornbills, have never been investigated. We used temperature dataloggers to record nest cavity <b>temperature</b> and <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> for one artificial and 11 natural southern ground-hornbill tree cavity nests combined, spanning two breeding seasons. Mean hourly nest temperature, as well as mean minimum and mean maximum nest temperature, differed significantly between southern ground-hornbill nests in both breeding seasons.

However, it is contentious whether behavioural variations are primarily moulded by the environment, caused by genetic differences, {{or a combination}} of both. Here we establish that biparental care, a complex social behaviour that involves rearing of young by both parents, differs between closely related populations, and then test two potential sources of variation in parental behaviour between populations: ambient environment and genetic differentiation. We use 2904 hours behavioural data from 10 geographically distinct Kentish (Charadrius alexandrinus) and snowy plover (C. nivosus) populations in America, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa to test these two sources of behavioural variation. We show that <b>local</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> has a significant influence on parental care: with extreme heat (above 40 °C) total incubation (i. e. % of time the male or female incubated the nest) increased, and female share (% female share of incubation) decreased.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a joint numerical and experimental investigation of flame lift-off and stabilization mechanisms in heavy-duty diesel engines. The injection strategy, employing different nozzle configurations, allows for quantification {{of the impact}} of varying inter-jet angle spacing in the presence of swirl. For this purpose, three different inter-jet angles are chosen in this study; 45 °, 90 ° and 135 °. Large-eddy simulations are performed utilizing a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for n-heptane to resolve the turbulent fuel and air mixing and to capture the important species surrounding the ignition and flame-fronts to describe the flame stabilization process. Measurements are carried out for OH chemiluminescence to identify the flame lift-off position in an optical accessible engine. In general, the swirl flow in the ambient air shows a great impact on the lift-off, with a 15 % difference in the lift-off lengths on the upwind and downwind side of the jet. The LES results show that important ignition reactions undergo in a broad region in front of the lift-off position. With decreasing inter-jet angle, it is shown that the impact of transportation of hot products from adjacent jets becomes more prominent.

To {{determine the extent to}} which this hypothesis applies to reef corals, we compared thermal tolerance of the early life stages of five scleractinian species from three locations spanning 17 ° of latitude along the east coast of Australia. Embryos were exposed to an 8 °C temperature range around the <b>local</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> at the time of spawning. Upper thermal thresholds, defined as the temperature treatment at which the proportion of abnormal embryos or median life span was significantly different to ambient controls, varied predictably among locations. At Lizard Island, the northern-most site with the least annual variation in temperature, the proportion of abnormal embryos increased and life span decreased 2 °C above ambient in the two species tested. At two southern sites, One Tree Island and Lord Howe Island, where annual temperature variation was greater, upper temperature thresholds were generally 4 °C or greater above ambient for both variables in the four species tested. The absolute upper thermal threshold temperature also varied among locations: 30 °C at Lizard Island; 28 °C at One Tree Island; 26 °C at Lord Howe Island. These results support previous work on adult corals demonstrating predictable differences in upper thermal thresholds with latitude. With projected ocean warming, these temperature thresholds will be exceeded in northern locations in the near future, adding to a growing body of evidence indicating that climate change is likely to be more detrimental to low latitude than high latitude corals...|$|E

The greater the pressure difference which involved in the increase of the compressor work will lead to a higher rate of irreversibility. It is found that the evaporator and compressor loss contributed to the performance of the whole plant. The plant efficiency reduces about 52 % when the inlet pressure at the compressor decreased from 2 bar to 1 bar.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} effect of heat {{transfer}} by boiling on the cooling rates of pyroclasts produced during hydromagmatic eruptions. A numerical heat transfer model has been developed for spherical particles that combines intraparticle conduction with heat transfer from the particle surface by boiling water. This model is used to explore heat loss with time {{for a range of}} particle diameters. The results are combined with estimates of time available for cooling in order to calculate the heat removed during the eruption. The results of this model are applied to a sample with the same particle size distribution as material recovered from the Icelandic Gjálp eruption which took place under the Vatnajökull ice cap in October 1996. The model calculation of heat removed during the eruption is relative to the <b>local</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> of meltwater in the ice cavity. It may be adjusted to the ice melting temperature datum, to allow comparison with the values estimated for the Gjálp eruption that are reported in Gudmundsson et al. [1]. The heat transfer model indicates that, relative to 0 °C, the sample transfers around 70 % of its heat during the eruption. This can be compared with 63 - 77 % determined by heat balance calculations (Gudmundsson et al. 2004) based on volumes of ice melted. Although there are significant areas of uncertainty in the calculations, this model gives insight into the processes involved. In particular, both incomplete heat transfer and elevated local cavity fluid temperature appear to limit heat removed during the eruption.

Frequently, at the very start of the winter, we find that synoptic-scale depletion of HNO 3 can be detected in the inner vortex before the first lidar detection of geophysically associated PSCs. The generation of "sub-visible" PSCs can be explained as arising from the development of a solid particle population with low number densities and large particle sizes. Assumed to be composed of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT), the sub-visible PSCs form at ambient temperatures well above the ice frost point, but also above the temperature at which supercooled ternary solution (STS) grows out of the background supercooled binary solution (SBS) distribution. The temperature regime of their formation, inferred from the simultaneous uptake of ambient HNO 3 into NAT and their Lagrangian temperature histories, is at a depression of a few kelvin with respect to the NAT existence threshold, T NAT. Therefore, their nucleation requires a considerable supersaturation of HNO 3 over NAT, and is consistent with a recently described heterogeneous nucleation process on solid foreign nuclei immersed in liquid aerosol. We make a detailed investigation of the comparative limits of detection of PSCs and the resulting sequestration of HNO 3 imposed by lidar, mid-infrared, and microwave techniques.

They additionally release no green house gases such as carbon dioxide, which is harmful for the planet as it depletes the ozone layer. Examples of renewable energy can be seen by wind turbines, solar energy such as solar panels and kinetic energy from waves. These energies are regarded as a technological fix as they have been designed and innovated to overcome issues with energy insecurity, as well as to help protect Earth from the harmful emissions released from non-renewable energy sources, and thus overcome global warming.

Influenza surveillance in Okinawa is important for clarifying transmission patterns in both temperate and tropical regions. Using surveillance data, collected over 7  years in the subtropical region of Japan, this study aims to characterize the epidemic patterns of influenza B infection and its association with <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity, in a parallel comparison with influenza A. Methods From January 2007 until March 2014, two individual influenza surveillance datasets were collected from external sources. The first dataset, included weekly rapid antigen test (RAT) results from four representative general hospitals, located {{in the capital city}} of Okinawa. A nation-wide surveillance of influenza, diagnosed by RAT results and/or influenza-like illness symptoms, included the age distribution of affected patients and was used as the second dataset. To analyze the association between infection and <b>local</b> climate conditions, <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity during the study period were retrieved from the Japanese Meteorological Agency website. Results Although influenza A maintained high number of infections from December through March, epidemics of influenza B infection were observed annually from March through July. The only observed exception was 2010, when the pandemic strain of 2009 dominated. During influenza B outbreaks, influenza patients aged 5 to 9  years old and 10 to 14  years old more frequently visited sentinel sites. Although both <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity are inversely associated with influenza A infection, influenza B infection was found to be directly associated with high relative humidity. Conclusion Further studies are needed to elucidate the complex epidemiology of influenza B and its relationship with influenza A. In the subtropical setting of Okinawa, epidemics of influenza B infection occur from March to July following the influenza A epidemic, and primarily affect school-age children. These findings help to define unknown aspects of influenza B and can inform healthcare decisions for patients located outside temperate regions...|$|R

But finally soot mass concentration reduced with decreasing initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> Although the drop in <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> did not cool the mean in-cylinder temperature during the combustion, it did shrink the total area of local high equivalence ratio, in which soot usually generated fast. At 700 K initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> soot emissions were almost negligible, which indicates that sootless combustion might be achieved at super low initial temperature operation conditions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} how the initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> affects the response of behavioral thermoregulation, and to clarify if there is a shift in temperature selected by thermoregulatory behavior after the animals are moved to the new <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> from the temperature already adapted. It was revealed that the temperature selected by thermoregulatory behavior was affected by the initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> at which animals adapted before the exposure to new <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|R

Gas turbine is {{sensitive}} to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> Different <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> could change {{the state of the}} inlet air of compressor and make the gas turbine work in off design conditions. Research the effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on gas turbine performance is valuable to the long-term safe operation of gas turbine. In this paper, a thermodynamic model of a simple cycle gas turbine which has three shafts was established, and steady-state performance simulation under different <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> was carried out. In the two conditions of 1. 0 and 0. 35 work states, the effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on thermodynamic parameters, specific power and thermal efficiency of gas turbine were analyzed. The result shows that: effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on three-shaft gas turbine is different under different work state, and relevant factors must be considered to select the appropriate control strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{the health}} effects of {{extremely}} low/high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) on mortality as representative indices of temperature variability is growing. Although numerous studies have reported on these indices independently, few studies have provided the attributes of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and DTR related to mortality, concurrently. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the mortality risk attributable to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and DTR. The study included data of 63 cities in five East-Asian countries/regions during various periods between 1972 and 2013. The attributable risk of non-accidental death to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> was 9. 36 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 8. 98 – 9. 69 %) and to DTR was 0. 59 % (95 % CI: 0. 53 – 0. 65 %). The attributable cardiovascular mortality risks to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> (15. 63 %) and DTR (0. 75 %) are higher than the risks to non-accidental/respiratory-related mortality. We verified that <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> plays a larger role in temperature-associated mortality, and cardiovascular mortality is susceptible to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and DTR...|$|R
