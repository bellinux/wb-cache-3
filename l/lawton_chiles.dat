5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|When {{high levels}} of {{phosphorus}} and mercury were discovered in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lawton</b> Mainor <b>Chiles,</b> Jr. (April 3, 1930 - December 12, 1998) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} U.S. state of Florida. He {{served as a}} United States Senator from 1971 to 1989 and as Governor of Florida from 1991 to 1998.|$|R

5|$|Governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> {{declared}} a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the Florida National Guard. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Sarasota counties. A total of 142shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340people. In Dade County alone, 515,670people were ordered to evacuate. As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,00030,000tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County). Overall, almost 1.2million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm. Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as Ocala. Ultimately, the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along Interstate 95. United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea. Government offices and public and private schools were closed from Monroe County northward to St. Lucie County. Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed, including Barry University, Broward Community College, Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami. Major airports such as the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood, Key West, Miami, and Palm Beach international airports closed.|$|E
25|$|Hagan {{was first}} elected to the North Carolina General Assembly as state Senator for the 32nd {{district}} in 1998 (due to redistricting, her constituency later became the 27th district). During the 1998 campaign, her uncle <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> walked the district with her. She represented most of central Guilford County, including most of Greensboro.|$|E
25|$|Though Carswell and Eckerd {{endorsed}} Cramer and Kirk, {{they were}} not active in the fall campaign. Unlike the Republicans, Democratic State Senators <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> of Lakeland and Reubin Askew of Pensacola, had healed philosophical division within their own ranks. Republican Representative Louis Frey, Jr., of Winter Park, addressing the Republican state convention in Orlando implored the factions to unite for the general election.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, <b>Lawton</b> and Rhea <b>Chiles</b> were visiting Washington D.C. on {{vacation}} with their young children. They got {{lost and found}} themselves on Embassy Row. One of the children said, [...] "Let's go to Florida's embassy, and they will tell us where we are." [...] They explained that only foreign countries had embassies and that states did not. The idea, however, intrigued Chiles.|$|R
50|$|Her {{tenure as}} First Lady of Florida {{was marked by}} {{numerous}} contributions to Florida, particularly focusing on the health and welfare of the state's children.

40|$|This study {{examines}} patterns of appointments to Florida boards and commissions as that system developed a dominant form. The research describes the constitutional history of Florida politics as it affected a sustained system of appointed boards and commissions. It examines the racial {{impact of the}} concurrent appointment system with {{particular attention to the}} representation of African Americans on state boards and commissions and the racial politics that developed on selected boards as African Americans became more representative on these bodies. In this study, 2 ̆ 2 concurrent appointments 2 ̆ 2 are defined as complicated appointment procedures in which multiple authorities, such as the governor, executive officials, legislative leaders, nominating commissions, state judges, department heads, and members of local councils and commissions simultaneously appoint members to boards 1 and commissions. African Americans comprise 14. 6 percent of the Florida population and have historically been excluded from full participation in the political system. In order to measure inclusion of the group, this work studied concurrent appointment schemes and the racial politics and agendas of Florida boards and commissions during the tenure of two Florida governors, <b>Lawton</b> Mainor <b>Chiles,</b> Jr. (1991 - 1998) and John Ellis 2 ̆ 2 Jeb 2 ̆ 2 Bush (1999 -Present). Three Florida boards were selected for this study because of their prominence in appointment politics, diversity issues, and racial conflicts during this period. The boards selected were (1) the Florida Supreme Court Racial and Ethnic Bias Study Commission and its critique of the Florida system that uses concurrent appointments to select judicial nominating commissions, (2) the Florida Board of Regents (3) and, the Board of Trustees, Florida Community College at Jacksonville. This study concludes that the concurrent appointment process limits African- American representation on boards and commissions in the state of Florida, and it also finds that racial politics are significant and very often prevalent on boards that are designed to be neutral and free from partisan considerations...|$|R
25|$|In 1990, Nelson ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic {{nomination}} for Governor of Florida. He lost to former U.S. Senator <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles,</b> {{who went on}} to win the general election. During the primary campaign, Nelson tried to make an issue out of Chiles' health and age, a strategy that backfired on him in a state with a large population of retirees and senior citizens.|$|E
25|$|Hagan {{also spent}} summers on her grandparents' farm in Chesterfield, South Carolina, where she helped string tobacco and harvest watermelons. Her uncle is the late Lakeland native and U.S. Senator <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> (D-Fla.), {{who later became}} Florida Governor {{following}} his service in the U.S. Senate. In the 1970s, she was an intern at the Capitol, operating an elevator that carried senators, including her uncle, {{to and from the}} Chamber.|$|E
25|$|The Seminole Tribe of Florida {{requested}} that the state enter into such a negotiation. When the state refused, the Tribe filed suit, as allowed by the statute, against both the state of Florida and the governor, <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles.</b> The District Court declined to dismiss the case, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred the suit, and that the doctrine of Ex parte Young {{could not be used}} to force good faith negotiation.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Bush {{made his}} first run for office, losing the {{election}} for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent, <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles.</b> Bush ran again in 1998 and defeated Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the vote. He ran for reelection in 2002, defeating Bill McBride and winning with 56 percent, to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush pushed an ambitious Everglades conservation plan, supported caps for medical malpractice litigation, launched a Medicaid privatization pilot program, and instituted reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Askew was re-elected, with J. H. Williams as {{his running}} mate. He is one of just five Florida Governors to have been elected for two terms (the others were LeRoy Collins, Bob Graham, <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles,</b> Jeb Bush, and Rick Scott). Askew was the first Governor to serve two full {{four-year}} terms (Collins was elected to a two-year term followed by a four-year term, Graham resigned shortly {{before the end of}} his second term to become U.S. Senator, and Chiles died in office {{near the end of his}} second term; Bush would later become the second Florida Governor to serve two full four-year terms, while Scott is as of 2016 in the midst of his second four-year term).|$|E

500|$|Browner {{grew up in}} Florida and {{graduated}} from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. [...] After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. [...] She became a legislative assistant for Senators <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> and Al Gore. [...] Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it {{into one of the}} most active departments in the state government.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{political}} quagmire over water quality, Governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> introduced a bill in 1994 to clean up water within the EAA that was being released to the lower Everglades. The bill stated that the [...] "Everglades ecosystem must be restored {{both in terms of}} water quality and water quantity and must be preserved and protected {{in a manner that is}} long term and comprehensive". It ensured the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) would be responsible for researching water quality, enforcing water supply improvement, controlling exotic species, and collecting taxes, with the aim of decreasing the levels of phosphorus in the region. It allowed for purchase of land where pollutants would be sent to [...] "treat and improve the quality of waters coming from the EAA".|$|E
500|$|In Florida, President Bush {{assessed}} {{damage in}} areas south of Miami with Florida Governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles.</b> The president quickly declared the region a disaster area, which provided public assistance {{to victims of}} the storm in Broward, Collier, Dade, and Monroe Counties. Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking [...] "like a war zone". Governor Chiles considered asking the Florida State Legislature to raise taxes, stating that [...] "No matter how much Congress appropriates to repair damage from Hurricane Andrew, the state will face a substantial cleanup bill". Instead of raising taxes, Chiles signed a bill into law on December17 that created a three-year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes, as well as government and school buildings and functions. Additionally, the bill allowed South Floridians to keep an estimated $500million in sales tax generated by rebuilding efforts.|$|E
500|$|Though {{scientists}} made headway in decreasing {{mercury and}} phosphorus levels in water, {{the natural environment}} of South Florida continued to decline in the 1990s, and life in nearby cities reflected this downturn. To address {{the deterioration of the}} Miami metropolitan area, Governor <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> commissioned a report on the sustainability of the area. In 1995, Chiles published the commission's findings in a report that related the degradation of the Everglades ecosystems to the lower quality of life in urban areas. The report noted past environmental abuses that brought the state to a position to make a decision. Not acting to improve the South Florida ecosystem, the report predicted, would inevitably cause further and intolerable deterioration that would harm local tourism by 12,000jobs and $200million annually, and commercial fishing by 3,300jobs and $52million annually. Urban areas had grown beyond their capacities to sustain themselves. Crowded cities were facing problems such as high crime rates, traffic jams, severely overcrowded schools, and overtaxed public services; the report noted that water shortages were ironic, given the [...] of rain the region received annually.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the successes}} of the Everglades Forever Act and the {{decreases}} in mercury levels, the focus intensified on the Everglades in the 1990s as {{quality of life in}} the South Florida metropolitan areas diminished. It was becoming clear that urban populations were consuming increasingly unsustainable levels of natural resources. A report entitled [...] "The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida", submitted to <b>Lawton</b> <b>Chiles</b> in 1995, identified the problems the state and municipal governments were facing. The report remarked that the degradation of the natural quality of the Everglades, Florida Bay, and other bodies of water in South Florida would cause a significant decrease in tourism (12,000jobs and $200million annually) and income from compromised commercial fishing (3,300jobs and $52million annually). [...] The report noted that past abuses and neglect of the environment had brought the region to [...] "a precipitous juncture" [...] where the inhabitants of South Florida faced health hazards in polluted air and water; furthermore, crowded and unsafe urban conditions hurt the reputation of the state. It noted that though the population had increased by 90% over the previous two decades, registered vehicles had increased by 166%. On the quality and availability of water, the report stated, [...] " [...] frequent water shortages... create the irony of a natural system dying of thirst in a subtropical environment with over 53 inches of rain per year".|$|E
