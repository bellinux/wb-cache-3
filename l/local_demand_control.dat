Therefore, such QC schemes typically <b>demand</b> <b>local</b> <b>control</b> of {{the interaction}} strength between each pair of neighboring qubits. Here we demonstrate that this degree of control is not necessary: it suffices to switch the interaction collectively - something that can in principle be achieved by global fields rather than with local manipulations. This observation may offer a significant simplification for various solid state, optical lattice and NMR implementations. Comment: 3 pages inc. 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{is found}} in {{relatively}} high levels in all excreted animal manures. It can exist in many chemical forms and can move easily in the environment as a gas in air, a dissolved constituent of ground or surface water, or {{in combination with other}} materials. Nitrogen in the form of ammonia (NH 3) is of particular concern because of its potential to create odors and negatively impact air and water quality and animal and human health. The purpose of this fact sheet is to provide an overview of ammonia production associated with animal agricultural operations and why it is receiving greater attention from regulators and other individuals who are concerned with environmental quality. In particular, {{it is important to recognize}} that efforts to satisfy <b>local</b> <b>demands</b> for <b>control</b> of odors from animal feeding operations (AFOs) do not guarantee control of ammonia emissions. How does ammonia impact animal and worker health? Traditionally, the agricultural community has considered ammonia as a problem inside poorly ventilated or managed livestock facilities. In particular, ammonia that accumulates within animal housing systems can have a negative impact on animal health and, consequently, production. For example, reduced final body weights have been observed in poultry produced i...|$|R

The concept of a DES is that demand is supplied by local DG either using privately owned distribution assets or a public distribution network owned by a Distribution Network Operator (DNO). Operation of a DES can help manage variability in DG output, reduce curtailment in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes, and assist the DNO in managing network constraints. They also provide a move towards local trading of electricity with potential financial and non-financial benefits to both distributed generators and <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> customers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Growing {{awareness}} on {{the subject}} of classroom’s indoor air quality and concerns regarding the probable link between indoor air quality, student’s attendance and academic performance, support recent legislation limiting classroom’s indoor pollutant concentrations. A consequence of this legislation is the generalized shift towards air-conditioned classrooms and increased budgets for schools energy running costs. According to the scientific literature, <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> ventilation systems are suited for classrooms, ensuring indoor air quality and thermal comfort with significant energy savings. Based on detailed building energy simulation this paper compares a <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> ventilation system and a (traditional) constant air volume system considering a typical classroom located in two distinct climatic regions: Portugal and Macao. Based on hourly results of classroom’s indoor CO 2 concentrations and indoor air temperatures, and on annual air-conditioning energy consumptions, advantages of the <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> ventilation system are discussed.

40|$|<b>Demand</b> <b>control</b> is {{the concept}} of {{regulating}} the peak electrical demand of a commercial, industrial or residential power system so as to minimize the peak demand charges that must be paid by the customer to the electric utility providing the power. This peak demand is usually defined as the maximum average demand over a 15, 30 or 60 minute interval during the billing period. The attention given to <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> has been rapidly increasing due to increasing electricity rates and the application of microprocessor technology to this concept. In regulating his peak demand,- the customer desires to accomplish the same amount of work as before. Some <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> has been achieved through the optimum scheduling of electrical use while additional savings can be achieved through conservation practices (conservation practice also reduce the total energy consumed). The practice of <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> by commercial and industrial customers of electric utilities is experiencing increasing popularity.

40|$|Summary This article {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} significant dimension of technological catching-up and {{the transition to}} leadership lies in the quality and dynamics of the local market, {{rather than in the}} export market demand as traditionally stressed in catch up studies. Based on an exploratory analysis of the Korean mobile handset industry over the period of the late 1980 s to 2005 the paper shows that a transition to leadership in handsets was shaped and driven by domestic users, local service suppliers (mobile telecommunications operators), favorable government policies, and strong producer-user links forged by manufacturers and operators. Traditionally, <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> in latecomer economies has been considered too small and unsophisticated to stimulate innovation and to enable catching up. However, in this case, <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> evolved and acted as an important "test bed" for new products, services, and technologies, shaping the rate and direction of the technological development of both local suppliers and operators. The conclusion argues that while direct implications for other developing countries cannot be drawn from a single case, future research could identify whether, under certain circumstances, the role of <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> and test bed markets could have wider relevance for other advanced developing nations and other sectors approaching the technology frontier. catch up transition Korea <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> test bed market Asia...|$|R

40|$|The State of Kuwait is {{has been}} a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) since its {{establishment}} in 1980. Kuwait is a geographically small but oil-rich country, whose economic development in recent years is the result of an increase in both the production and prices of oil, which now accounts for almost 90 % of exports. Meanwhile Kuwait imports almost all its local market needs from abroad. In 2010 the Kuwaiti government passed a development plan which was intended to diversify the Kuwaiti economy and promote non-oil economic sectors. Kuwait has an open economy, and is an ally of its GCC neighbours and the West. It is a member of the World Trade Organisation, which helps to enhance the country’s exports and imports. At the same time Kuwait is committed to advancing Economic and Monetary Integration with the GCC countries, and put into practice the guidelines which will make the Currency and Economic Union successful. This study will extend the literature on Economic and Monetary Integration in the context of the GCC monetary union. A literature review of the theory of Optimum Currency Areas (OCA) examines the development of exchange rate policy and monetary unions. Investigating and assessing Kuwait’s national interest in joining the GCC currency union is the main objective of this thesis. The study applies both quantitative and qualitative approaches to estimating the likely costs and benefits. In the study annual published data is used to analyse the country’s main economic structure and indicators, and semi-structured interviews are used to ascertain the opinions of Kuwaiti nationals working in financial institutions concerning monetary union. The conclusion of our study is that Kuwait is ready to join the GCC monetary union, the benefits of membership outweighing the costs. Having an oil-based economy like that of other GCC countries will make it easier for Kuwait to join the GCC monetary union. In addition, Kuwait imports products from abroad to meet <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> and <b>controls</b> inflation through its exchange rate regime. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) is the sole authority managing the country’s monetary policy and the financial sector. However, GCC monetary union will subordinate the CBK to the Gulf Central Bank and reduce its flexibility to use its own monetary tools. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the current health care reform in the Netherlands is to {{strengthen}} demand orientation. Community based primary health care provision should be tuned to <b>local</b> <b>demand.</b> Information on <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> is missing, however. Research goal is to provide local decision makers (patient organizations, insurers, providers) with a tool to analyse <b>local</b> <b>demand,</b> thus creating a basis for an informed discussion. Methods: Known sociodemographic characteristics of local areas on age, gender, household composition, income, ethnic composition and degree of urbanization are used as predictors for <b>local</b> <b>demand.</b> The relationship with demand for primary health care was computed with national, sample based data. Both population surveys (of the Central Statistics Office Nemesis) and electronic medical record registries were used (National Information Network in General Practice, National Information Service for Allied Health Care). Multiple regression techniques were used. Results: Demand for primary care for people with chronic disease proved to be higher in areas with more elderly, with a high percentage of people of non-western origin, a low percentage of one-person households and a high percentage of low income households. Demand for primary care for people with infectious disease proved to be higher in areas with young children (0 – 4 years) and elderly over 75 years. Also, the presence of people with non-western ethnic origin and low income households increased demand for care for infectious disease. These and more results will be presented. Conclusions: National, sample based data can be used to predict <b>local</b> <b>demand</b> for primary health care. This can be a starting point for discussion on primary care service provision in local communities. Adding information on supply would enhance the analysis further, making detection of underserved areas possible. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
