The reinforcing effect obtained is determined by the stiffness of the unidirectional CFRP laminate which has twice the elastic modulus of aluminum. One can therefore easily follow that an unstressed CFRP <b>laminate</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of welded beams made of steel will not lead to a substantial increase in fatigue strength of the steel structure.

Experimental results (Wöhler-fields) of shear-lap-specimens and welded steel beams reinforced with prestressed CFRP laminates are presented.

40|$|The signal {{channels}} that link high speed processors to memory {{and various other}} peripherals, are limited by the inherent characteristics of the printed circuit board. These are what ultimately connect information to the outside world. One limiting factor {{is the effect of}} nonuniformity of the glass fiber distribution in the printed circuit substrate material, also known as fiber weave effect (FWE). FWE introduces signal skew and timing errors which place an upper limit on bit rate and trace length. Using unique fabrication techniques and a proprietary low dielectric constant glass composition, a revolutionary glass fabric is presented that is essentially free of fiber weave effect while demonstrating inherently improved resistance to conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation. Improved laminate performance is demonstrated with finite element modeling and HyperLynx simulations, and corroborated with dielectric property measurements on prototype substrates. A printed circuit board using this material demonstrates superior signal integrity performance over the traditional glass-based solution. By uniformly distributing glass fibers the maximum surface area becomes available to bond with the resin, which is enhanced by direct application of a finish to provide a high quality interface between glass and resin.

40|$|Composite parts {{reinforced}} with unidirectional or 2 D woven reinforcements {{have been widely}} used for many years in numerous industries from aerospace to automotive parts. Although their use is widespread, <b>laminated</b> <b>reinforcements</b> have some significant weaknesses that limit their usefulness, including poor interlaminar strength and high cost driven by the need for lengthy hand lay-up to create complex parts. Considerable effort has been put into developing three-dimensional composite reinforcement in order to alleviate these problems. This thesis focuses on materials produced via the weaving method. " 3 D weaving" can produce fabrics with interlacing yams that provide genuine through thickness reinforcement. The weaving process can also produce multi-layer fabrics, reducing the amount of lay-up required to produce thick parts. A review of current literature showed that 3 D woven composites have good interlaminar properties but can have poor in-plane mechanical properties, the main cause being architectural distortions such as local yam crimp and resin rich regions. It was evident that there has been relatively little study into the detail of 3 D woven architecture and how it is affected by forming forces and in turn how this affects mechanical properties. In addition, [mite element modelling of 3 D woven fabrics has been limited by idealised mesh generation, hampering predictive fabric analysis. The work presented here addresses the issue by developing a fundamental understanding of 3 D woven composite architecture via a detailed characterisation of yam crimp and resin channels for a selection of angle-interlock weaves. The effect of compaction on these architectural features was also investigated and coupled with an innovative use of kinematic modelling that could help predict the final internal state of a compacted 3 D woven fabric. Finally, compression testing of specimens reinforced using 3 D woven fabrics at a range of compaction levels was used to ascertain the influence of fabric architecture on mechanical properties.

Despite of these advantages, other challenges to overcome are the {{development of}} cheaper production process and new techniques of processing to the manufacturing of components with structural functions; one of them is the resin infusion which is based on the impregnation of thin films of dry fabrics through resin, this technique uses vacuum pressure to drive resin into laminate.

This process improves the quality and strength of the <b>laminate</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (fiberglass) of the parts.

The properties of this method and its advantages in comparison to externally bonded <b>reinforcement</b> <b>laminate</b> method (EBR) have been analyzed. The results of measured deflections and width of the cracks of the beams reinforced by FRP bars, depending on the load are presented and discussed, in comparison to the results obtained from the non-reinforced beams. The experimental research was published at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture of Niš in 2009...|$|R
40|$|Limiting {{cases and}} length scales are {{detailed}} for Mode II delamination cracks bridged by through-thickness reinforcement. Analytical results are found for two limits: a steady-state configuration indicative of noncatastrophic failure and a small-scale bridging configuration indicative of catastrophic failure. General large-scale bridging conditions are studied numerically using bending theory for anisotropic plates. The {{effects of the}} mechanical properties of the <b>laminate</b> and the <b>reinforcement,</b> notch length, and plate thickness on the transition between the two limiting configurations, notch sensitivity and mechanical behavior are analyzed. All of these effects can be expressed succinctly {{in terms of a}} few length scales which are material-structure parameters involving the plate thickness. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
