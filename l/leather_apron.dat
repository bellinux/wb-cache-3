25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the <b>leather</b> <b>apron</b> of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E

60|$|He rose at {{last from}} his chair and, {{stretching}} his long, gaunt frame, removed his <b>leather</b> <b>apron,</b> and after a wash at the pump went into the house.

6000|$|... "Fail quotha!" [...] said a third man, {{who had not}} yet spoken, old, {{tall and}} sour of visage and wearing a printer's <b>leather</b> <b>apron.</b> He had moved over from the further side of the room where a little group of {{apprentices}} stood beside the wooden presses that occupied the corner, and he was looking over the shoulder of Master Brenton Caxton.|$|E

The Pioneers wear <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> and carry special tools and weapons: axes or hatchets, picks, and halberds. Along with the Pioneers there are also Skirmishers who wear the {{traditional}} uniform of a 90th Battalion rifleman circa 1885. The Skirmishers often appear in ceremonies and memorials such as Remembrance Day and events.|$|R
50|$|In September 2010, Cox opened 'Cox Cookies & Cake', a pâtisserie in London's Soho district, with Eric Lanlard {{to whom he}} was {{introduced}} by Elizabeth Hurley. In keeping with the area's history of seedy business, the décor was black and neon while the staff wore studded <b>leather</b> <b>aprons.</b> Delicacies included titty and bum cupcakes along with his mother Maureen's recipe for traditional Canadian Nanaimo bars. After 2 successful years trading Cox decided to close the business to return to shoe design.|$|R

50|$|The Pionniers (pioneers) are {{the combat}} {{engineers}} and a traditional {{unit of the}} Foreign Legion. The sapper traditionally sport large beards, wear <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> and gloves and hold axes. The sappers were very common in European armies during the Napoleonic Era but progressively disappeared during the 19th century. The French Army, including the Legion disbanded its regimental sapper platoons in 1870. However, in 1931 {{one of a number}} of traditions restored to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Legion's founding was the reestablishment of its bearded Pionniers.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} hotel, not without relief, for {{to be under}} the eyes of strangers while he conversed with his lost child had embarrassed him much. His search-party, too, had looked awkward there, having rushed to the task of investigation--some in their shirt sleeves, others in their <b>leather</b> <b>aprons,</b> and all much stained--just as they had come from their work of barking, and not in their Sherton {{marketing}} attire; while Creedle, with his ropes and grapnels and air of impending tragedy, had added melancholy to gawkiness.|$|R
50|$|Since the 18th century, every {{grenadier}} battalion in the French Army had a {{small unit}} of pioneers, sometimes called sappers-pioneers (sapeurs-pionniers). They had the mission to advance under enemy fire in order to destroy the obstacles drawn by the enemy and {{to clear the way}} {{for the rest of the}} infantry. The danger of such missions resulted in pioneers having short life expectancies. Because of this, the army allowed them certain privileges such as the authorization to wear beards. In addition to their beards and axes, they traditionally wear <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> and gloves.|$|R
60|$|If only Adrian {{could have}} been a witness to the scene which at that very moment was in {{progress}} at the works! Martin having delivered the key of the box, sought out Foy, and proceeded to tell him the story. More, perfidious one, he handed over a rough draft of the sonnet which he had surreptitiously garnered from the floor, to Foy, who, clad in a <b>leather</b> <b>apron,</b> and seated {{on the edge of a}} casting, read it eagerly.|$|E
60|$|In 1737 the Mayor was George Norton, a saddler, who {{frequently}} took, the chair with his <b>leather</b> <b>apron</b> on. His immediate predecessor {{seems to have}} been the Earl of Derby, who gave the above-mentioned entertainment during his mayoralty. Where George's Dock now is, {{there used to be a}} battery of fourteen eighteen-pounders for the defence of the town, and the old sport of bull-baiting was carried on in that vicinity, close to the Church of St. Nicholas.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning he}} {{could see through the}} iron grating in front of his little window how the people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged. He heard the drums and saw the {{soldiers}} marching; all the people were running to and fro. Just below his window was a shoemaker's apprentice, with <b>leather</b> <b>apron</b> and shoes; he was skipping along so merrily that one of his shoes flew off and fell against the wall, just where the Soldier was sitting peeping through the iron grating.|$|E
5000|$|The legionnaires of the French Foreign Legion wear white kepis, blue sashes {{and green}} and red epaulettes as dress uniform, while the Troupes de marine wear blue and red kepis and yellow epaulettes. The pioneers of the French Foreign Legion wear the basic legionnaire uniform but with <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> and gloves. The Chasseurs Alpins wear a large beret, known as the [...] "tarte" [...] (the pie) with dark blue or white {{mountain}} outfits. The Spahis retain the long white cloak or [...] "burnous" [...] of the regiment's origin as North African cavalry.|$|R
5000|$|The Master, Upper Warden and Other Warden {{are elected}} and sworn into office [...] "on 24th June or {{fourteen}} days thereafter" [...] by {{and from the}} Court of Assistants who number between 14 and 24 members. The Clerk {{is meant to be}} 'learned in the Law'; the senior members do not wear gowns but Tanned <b>Leather</b> <b>Aprons.</b> This is done after a Thanksgiving Service in the ancient guild church of St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey and is followed a procession along Bermondsey Street to the Leather Exchange were a feast is held.|$|R
60|$|The little blacksmiths were clad in <b>leather</b> <b>aprons,</b> which {{covered them}} from their necks to their feet in front, and left their backs naked. On a high stool against the wall sat {{the man with the}} {{pinewood}} staff, watching sharply the way the little fellows did their work, and near him stood a large can, from which every now and then the workers would come and take a drink. The master no longer wore the white garments of the day before, but a black jerkin, held in its place by a leathern girdle with huge clasps.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. I don't {{want to have}} to do with clergymen and doctors--we colonists {{are pretty}} rough and ready fellows, and it's no odds to us what a man is. A man stops at your door, and in he comes, and he is welcome--though he is only a {{shepherd}} on the look-out for work; sometimes one of the Kaffir chiefs with nothing on but a blanket and a <b>leather</b> <b>apron,</b> will stalk in and squat down and make himself at home. Oh, no. It's tradesmen I mean, and perhaps the small farmers round." ...|$|E
60|$|Queen Zixi of Ix came after; then John Dough and the Cherub, {{with the}} rubber bear named Para Bruin {{strutting}} between them {{on its hind}} legs; then the Queen of Merryland, escorted by her wooden soldiers; then King Bud of Noland and his sister, the Princess Fluff; then the Queen of Ev and her ten royal children; then the Braided Man and the Candy Man, side by side; then King Dox of Foxville and King Kik-a-bray of Dunkiton, who by this time had become good friends; and finally Johnny Dooit, in his <b>leather</b> <b>apron,</b> smoking his long pipe.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed into}} a large room, crowded with men all women; Swithin noticed that they all looked fit him. He stared at them in turn--they seemed of all classes, some in black coats or silk dresses, others in the clothes of work-people; one man, a cobbler, still wore his <b>leather</b> <b>apron,</b> {{as if he had}} rushed there {{straight}} from his work. Laying his hand on Swithin's arm, Boleskey evidently began explaining who he was; hands were extended, people beyond reach bowed to him. Swithin acknowledged the greetings with a stiff motion of his head; then seeing other people dropping into seats, he, too, sat down. Some one whispered his name--Margit and Rozsi were just behind him.|$|E
60|$|The {{man nodded}} and hurried away, and Leigh {{went to the}} end of the stores {{abutting}} on the house, and stopped at the door he found there. In a minute the men began to arrive. They had, as he directed, thrown aside their <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> and put on blouses; so that they differed in no way, in appearance, from ordinary working men. One or two were armed with hammers, others with long knives. Each carried a piece of black handkerchief in his hand, long enough to go from the forehead down to the mouth. Leigh tied these on with strings, cutting holes with his knife through which they could see.|$|R
50|$|The {{wearing of}} beards by Assault Pioneers {{has also been}} a {{traditional}} practice at various times in infantry battalions of British and Commonwealth armies, such as those of Australia and Canada. This tradition began in the French Army (possibly in Napoleonic times) {{and was one of the}} dress practices adopted by the British after their defeat of Napoleon in 1815 (along with the Foot Guards bearskin headdress). In the Australian and Canadian armies, on special occasions some battalions may still parade a ceremonial detachment of assault pioneers in historical uniforms wearing <b>leather</b> <b>aprons,</b> gauntlets and gaiters, and carrying the various tools of their trade such as felling axes, crosscut saws, hatchets and billhooks, picks and shovels.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{organizational}} {{meeting was}} held on August 28, 1837, and on September 18, seventy-eight men joined the active company. At {{the time of its}} founding, the unit was called The Cleveland City Guards but within the next year the membership decided that their organization would be known by reference to the gray color of their uniforms. [...] On November 29, 1838 the Grays made one of the first of their many parade appearances fully dressed in their distinctive gray uniforms and tall black bearskin caps. As the years passed, those who had earned the status of [...] "Pioneer" [...] for their membership of twenty-five or more years were entitled to add <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> to their uniforms and to carry axes when on parade.|$|R
6000|$|We walked on, enraptured by {{the sights}} around us, by the heavy {{scent of the}} roses and the blossoms. Here was a quaint stone horse-mill, a stable, or a barn set uncouthly on the street; a baker's shop, with {{a glimpse of the}} white-capped baker through the shaded doorway, and an appetizing smell of hot bread in the air. A little farther on we heard the tinkle of the blacksmith's hammer, and the man himself looked up from where the hoof rested on his <b>leather</b> <b>apron</b> to give us a kindly [...] "Bon soir, Messieurs," [...] as we passed. And here was a cabaret, with the {{inevitable}} porch, from whence came the sharp click of billiard balls.|$|E
6000|$|One went in, not as into most shops, in {{the mood}} of: [...] "Please serve me, and let me go!" [...] but restfully, as one enters a church; and, sitting on the single wooden chair, waited--for there was never anybody there. Soon, over {{the top edge of}} that sort of well--rather dark, and smelling soothingly of leather--which formed the shop, there would be seen his face, or that of his elder brother, peering down. A {{guttural}} sound, and the tip-tap of bast slippers beating the narrow wooden stairs, and he would stand before one without coat, a little bent, in <b>leather</b> <b>apron,</b> with sleeves turned back, blinking--as if awakened from some dream of boots, or like an owl surprised in daylight and annoyed at this interruption.|$|E
60|$|Happily he did {{not accept}} the wager. In huge disgust they hustled him from the inn and put forward the blacksmith, who was {{standing}} at the door in his <b>leather</b> <b>apron.</b> Now I had not bargained with the smith, who seemed a well-natured enough man, and grinned broadly at the prospect. But they made a ring on the floor, I going over it at one end, and he at the other, when a cry came from the street, those about the entrance parted, and in walked John Paul himself. At sight of him my new adversary, who was preparing to deal me out a blow to fell an ox, dropped his arms in surprise, and held out his big hand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{battle dress}} of the French Armed Forces is the FÉLIN system {{combined}} with SPECTRA helmets. France {{has adopted a}} light beige dress uniform which is worn with coloured kepis, sashes, fringed epaulettes, fourragères and other traditional items on appropriate occasions. As an alternative parade dress, camouflage uniforms can be worn with the dress items noted above. The legionnaires of the French Foreign Legion wear white kepis, blue sashes and green and red epaulettes as dress uniform, while the French Marines wear blue and red kepis and yellow epaulettes. The sappers of the French Foreign Legion wear the basic legionnaire uniform but with <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> and gloves. The Chasseurs alpins wear a large beret, known as the [...] "tarte" [...] (the pie), and mountain outfits. Sailors of the French Navy and Fusiliers Marins wear a dress uniform dating from the 19th century with a distinctive red pom-pom on the round cap.|$|R

5000|$|Music was {{important}} to Chautauqua, with band music in particular demand. John Phillip Sousa protégé Bohumir Kryl’s Bohemian Band was frequently seen on the circuit. One of the numbers featured by Kryl was the “Anvil Chorus” from Il Trovatore with four husky timpanists in <b>leather</b> <b>aprons</b> hammering on anvils shooting sparks (enhanced through special effects) across the darkened stage. Spirituals were also popular. White audiences appreciated seeing African-Americans performing other than minstrelsy. Other musical features of the Chautauqua included groups like the Jubilee Singers singing a mix of spirituals and popular tunes, and other singers and instrumental groups like American Quartette playing popular music, ballads and songs from the [...] "old country". Entertainers on the Chautauqua circuit such as Charles Ross Taggart, billed as [...] "The Man From Vermont" [...] and [...] "The Old Country Fiddler", played violin, sang, was a ventriloquist and comedian, and told tall tales about life in rural New England.|$|R
