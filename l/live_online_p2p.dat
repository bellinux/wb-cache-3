In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is [...] "a crucial factor" [...] in encouraging users to participate in an <b>online</b> <b>P2P</b> community, particularly because the [...] "lack of a critical mass of active users" [...] in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly.|$|R
