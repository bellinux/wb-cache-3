Echinacea was given as <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> <b>supplement</b> during the whole pregnant and suckling period of sows in six intervalls (5 days of treatment, followed by 2 weeks of break, respectively). During the treatment time the daily dosage per sow in echinacea-group was 0. 125 ml preparation of echinacea extract (incl. solution) /kg body weight. To measure the concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum, blood samples were taken by punction of V. cava cranialis (sows and piglets) at different times. The treatment of sows resulted in immunostimulatory effects both in sows and piglets with highest changes in peripartal period. In one day old piglets, the concentrations of IgG, IgA and CRP were significantly increased in echinacea-group (P = 0. 0004, P < 0. 0001, P = 0. 05, respectively). Up to day 70 of age, the rate of therapeutical treatments of piglets from echinacea-treated sows was decreased in tendency (P = 0. 08).

40|$|The {{demand for}} beef has risen {{substantially}} in Egypt, but the restricted land base {{will not allow}} for a major expansion of the national herd. The development of local production must therefore involve measures to increase livestock productivity. The purpose of these projects was to introduce improved feeding systems in existing or proposed feedlots {{that would make the}} most effective use of agro-industrial by-products and home-grown feeds. Working through the Animal Production Research Institute (APRI) and the Meat and Milk Company (MMC), the projects were designed to advise on the development of practical commercial feedlot operations; to define methods for the on-farm use of molasses and processing of treated straw; and to link the activities of various organizations in research, extension and training with a view to promoting the adoption of the new technologiesThe results of preliminary trials carried out during Phase I on the ammoniation of rice straw showed that the technique was practical, and that feeding ammoniated straw could enhance liveweight gain and also reduce the requirement for concentrated feed. Further feeding trials and pilot feedlot studies were conducted under the second phase: the results indicate that ammoniation increased the intake of straw by 27 percent and liveweight gain by 45 percent, with a saving of up to 11 tons of feed concentrate for every ton of ammonia used. Good results were also obtained by feeding ammoniated straw together with a molasses supplementThe MMC mixing plant was used to manufacture a <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> <b>supplement,</b> `El Mufeed', based on molasses and urea, and two centres were constructed in the New Lands (desert) and the delta area of Beheira Governorate for the storage and distribution of `El M- ufeed' and anhydrous ammonia. Work was initiated on the specification and manufacture of gelled-molasses blocks which are of particular benefit to smaller-scale farmers who are {{not in a position to}} buy the usual minimum of 200 litres of liquid feedThe findings show that, prior to finishing in feedlots, cattle should be backgrounded by using the recommended diet of ad libitum ammoniated straw with liquid molasses supplements. However, if the new feed technologies developed by the projects were to be widely adopted, with an associated reduction in the need for imported feedstuffs, then it was recommended that the current subsidy on 'unified feed' (the government standard compound feed) be kept at a low level or removed altogether: the existence of a subsidy offset the economic advantage to farmers of substituting ammoniated straw and liquid molasses for concentrated feedIn view of the projects' achievements, it was recommended that activities be continued, with the aim of expanding the sale of ammonia and liquid molasses supplement, as well as of molasses-based feed blocks. Assistance for the implementation of this recommendation was being provided under a follow-up project on animal feed improvement funded by the European Economic Community. The follow-up was formulated on the basis of the experiences of these two UNDP/FAO projects, and its purpose was to develop, demonstrate and promote the use of feed for improving the nutrition of ruminant animals through the use of the by-products of agricultural production.

40|$|Crude {{glycerin}} is {{the principal}} byproduct of biodiesel production. The raw feedstocks, animal fats and vegetable oils, yield approximately 90 lb of biodiesel and 10 lb of crude glycerin for each 100 lb of input. When ingested by cattle, glycerin has two major fates: (1) direct absorption by the rumen epithelium, and (2) fermentation by microorganisms within the rumen to generate volatile fatty acid, mainly propionate. Using glycerin in feedlot cattle diets has become common, particularly {{as a component of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> <b>supplements.</b> We have evaluated the use of crude glycerin in cattle diets in previous studies and generally have observed positive effects on dry matter intake and feed efficiency when fed up to 8 % of the diet on a dry matter basis. Crude glycerin can be highly variable in its composition, however, containing varying proportions of residual alcohol, soaps, and salts. Our focus in the present experiment was on the sodium content of crude glycerin. We hypothesized that the high concentration of sodium in glycerin, when combined with salt that normally is incorporated into feedlot diets, would result in abnormally high levels of sodium that could have deleterious consequences for feed consumption. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of finishing heifers fed diets containing high levels of crude glycerin in the presence and absence of added salt...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of Salmonella in chickens {{is a problem}} because poultry meat is recognized {{as a source of}} human salmonellosis. Fermented feed has characteristics like a high number of lactobacilli and high concentration of lactic acid, which could make chickens less susceptible for infection with Salmonella. Fermented feed might therefore prevent the colonization of chickens with Salmonella. Two studies were performed to quantify the effect of fermented <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> on the susceptibility of broilers for Salmonella. The fermented feed was prepared by fermenting a dry broiler <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with 1. 4 parts of water. Lactobacillus plantarum was used for fermentation. The fermented <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> (FLF) contained 10 (9) to 10 (10) cfu lactobacilli per gram, and the pH was 4. Individually housed control chickens and FLF-fed chickens were inoculated with 10 (2) to 10 (7) cfu Salmonella enteritidis (SE). Colonization was estimated by cloacal swabs and quantitative caecal culture. The proportion of SE-shedding chickens was decreased in FLF-fed chickens. FLF-fed chickens required a longer time after inoculation or a higher inoculation dose to get the same proportion of infected chickens in comparison with dry feed-fed chickens. The level of cecal colonization with Salmonella in the ceca was not different {{at the end of the}} experimental period. The results indicate that FLF can hamper the introduction of Salmonella in broiler flocks because the chickens are less susceptible for infection.

To {{study the}} effect of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® {{on the results of}} rearing the {{multiple}} age groups of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus Rafinesque). Methodology. The study of effect of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® on the results of rearing the multiple age groups of channel catfish have been carried out according to conventional methods. The experiments were conducted in the conditions of Pridneprovsky industrial fish farm of Dnepropetrovsk region. Channel catfish larvae were reared in standard trays. Water volume in trays was maintained at a level of 1. 4 m 3, stocking density of larvae was 20 thousand fish/tray. Rearing of young-of-the-year channel catfish was conducted in 1 m 3 cages, stocking density of grown up larvae was 1000 fish/m 3. Age 1 + channel catfish was reared in 1 m 3 cages, stocking density was 150 fish/m 3. Findings. The studies demonstrated that feeding of multiple age groups of channel catfish with balanced combined feeds with the addition of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® compared to the control group, which was fed with the combined <b>feed</b> but without <b>supplements,</b> increased their growth intensity.
