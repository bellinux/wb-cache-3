5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four <b>largest</b> <b>companies</b> in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the <b>largest</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} whether or not leadership styles have a statistically significant influence on the effectiveness of private enterprises. An empirical study was carried out with the participation of 21 <b>large</b> <b>companies</b> and 98 small and medium-sized enterprises in the north of Chile. Results indicated that the transformational leadership style has a positive impact on the effectiveness of <b>large</b> <b>companies,</b> while the transactional leadership style does not show a statistically significant impact on the effectiveness of <b>large</b> <b>companies.</b> For small and medium enterprises, the transformational leadership style has a positive impact, but the transactional leadership style has a negative impact on the organizational effectiveness of this type of organization. Consequently, conclusions are that transformational leadership is a positive style and is desirable for leaders of small and medium enterprises as well as for directors of <b>large</b> <b>companies.</b> On the other hand, transactional leadership is not a desirable style, because it affects small and medium enterprises negatively and has no statistical relevance in the case of <b>large</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Guerrilla {{marketing}} {{is a relatively}} new way of doing marketing. It is initially used by small companies and/or individuals allowing them to act like <b>large</b> <b>companies.</b> However, more and more <b>large</b> <b>companies</b> use Guerrilla marketing these days. The usage of Guerrilla management can bring advantages but can also increase risks. At this moment little research is done about the way how <b>large</b> <b>companies</b> manage the reputational risk associated with Guerrilla marketing. This is a problem in both science and practise. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to contribute to the understanding of how <b>large</b> <b>companies</b> manage the possible reputational risk that Guerrilla marketing and the communication of Guerrilla marketing brings along. This research is based on several theories, both emerging and dominant about Guerrilla marketing, Viral Marketing, Buzz marketing, Reputational risk and Reputational Risk Management. To do the research, in-depth interviews were held with experts when it comes to managing reputational risk and new marketing tools of four <b>large</b> <b>companies</b> based in Sweden. The analyses show that <b>large</b> <b>companies</b> manage the increasing reputational risks in some extend. Main findings are that the companies do not monitor Guerrilla marketing processes and do not have a central coordination for reputational risk management. This shows that not all companies are really aware of the risk that new marketing tools bring along and do not have a solid reputational risk management...|$|R
