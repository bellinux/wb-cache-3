2500|$|Some materials, notably {{high-strength}} steels, aluminium, and titanium alloys, {{are susceptible}} to hydrogen embrittlement. If the electrodes used for welding contain traces of moisture, the water decomposes {{in the heat of}} the arc and the liberated hydrogen enters the lattice of the material, causing its brittleness. Stick electrodes for such materials, with special <b>low-hydrogen</b> <b>coating,</b> are delivered in sealed moisture-proof packaging. New electrodes can be used straight from the can, but when moisture absorption may be suspected, they have to be dried by baking (usually at [...] ) in a drying oven. Flux used has to be kept dry as well.|$|E
