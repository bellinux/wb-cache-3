50|$|The abscopal {{effect is}} a {{phenomenon}} {{in the treatment of}} metastatic cancer where <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> of a tumor causes not only a shrinking of the treated tumor, but also a shrinking of tumors outside the scope of the <b>localized</b> <b>treatment.</b> R.H. Mole proposed the term “abscopal” (‘ab’ - away from, ‘scopus’ - target) in 1953 to refer to radiation’s effects “at a distance from the irradiated volume but within the same organism.” Initially associated with single-tumor, localized radiation therapy, the term has also come to encompass other types of localized treatments such as electroporation and intra-tumoral injection of therapeutics. While this phenomenon is extremely rare, its effect on the cancer can be stunning, leading to the disappearance of malignant growths throughout the entire body. Such success has been described for a variety of cancers, including melanoma, cutaneous lymphomas, and kidney cancer.|$|E
50|$|Friction stir {{processing}} {{can also}} be used to improve the microstructural properties of powder metal objects. In particular, when dealing with aluminium powder metal alloys, the aluminium oxide film on the surface of each granule is detrimental to the ductility, fatigue properties and fracture toughness of the workpiece. While conventional techniques for removing this film include forging and extrusion, friction stir processing is suited for situations where <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> is desired.|$|E

50|$|Scientists are {{not certain}} how the abscopal effect works to {{eliminate}} cancer in patients. Studies in mice {{suggest that the}} effect may depend upon activation of the immune system. In a case study reported at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, changes in a metastatic melanoma patient’s immune system were measured {{over the course of}} treatment. The team observed changes in tumor-directed antibody levels and immune cell populations that occurred {{at the time of the}} abscopal effect. These findings support the idea that a <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> may broadly stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. At this time, various immune system cells, including T-cells and dendritic cells, are believed to play a primary role.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} Ethiopia to test cost {{effectiveness}} {{of two different}} methods of treating malnutrition in children was done by Tekeste Asayehegn. In the study the compared two different methods of long term care for the malnourished children. In the first method children were brought to Therapeutic Feeding Centers where they remained as in-patients. The alternative method involved the supplies to treat malnourished children being sent to local clinics and healthcare facilities where the children were brought on a weekly or fortnight basis for treatment. The nutritional supplements were then sent home with the children. Volunteers checked on the patients at home and {{brought them to the}} facilities for treatment. This <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> program was found to cut the cost of treating a malnourished child in half.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{biomedical}} {{devices that}} {{come into contact with}} bodily fluids are susceptible to adverse foreign body response, or rejection and thus, failure of the device. The main mechanism of infection is the formation of a biofilm, which is a matrix of sessile bacteria consisting of around 15% bacterial cells by mass and 85% hydrophobic exopolysaccharide fibers. [...] One way to eliminate this risk is to apply <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> to the area {{in the vicinity of the}} implant. This can be done by applying a drug-impregnated polyelectrolyte multi-layer to the medical device prior to implantation. The goal with this technology is to create a combination of polyelectrolyte multi-layers where one multi-layer prevents the formation of a biofilm and another releases a small-molecule drug through diffusion. This would be more effective than the current technique of releasing a high dose of drugs into the body and counting on some of it to navigate to the afflicted area. The base layer for an effective coating for an implant is DMLPEI/PAA, or linear N, N-dodecyl,methyl-poly(ethyleneimine) / poly (acrylic acid).|$|E

40|$|A drug {{delivery}} system refers to a dosage form that is able to control or modify {{the availability of the}} active ingredient to the body due to its construction as well as temporal or spatial arrangement. An efficient {{drug delivery}} system should <b>localize</b> <b>treatment</b> to diseased cells or the site of injury. This can be achieved by increasing the adhesion of the drug delivery vehicle to biological surfaces of interest, such as specific cells or tissues. Enhanced adhesion can ultimately increase drug residence time, concentration, and absorption by target tissues. I explored such benefits of enhanced adhesion in two contexts: tumor targeted drug delivery and tissue repair. ^ This thesis is divided into two chapters. Chapter 1 describes tumor targeted drug delivery by nanoparticulated systems and is subdivided to Part 1 —Quinic acid conjugated nanoparticles for tumor specific therapy and Part 2 —pH-responsive and stealth chitosan coated nanoparticles for tumor therapy. Chapter 2 describes bioadhesive hydrogels for tissue repair. ...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 7212 The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} number of novel {{products}} for use in the oral cavity. Periodontitis is a condition characterized by the loss of clinical attachment to the gum, along with resorption of the alveolar bone. This process results in the formation of a periodontal pocket, increased tooth mobility and ultimately tooth loss. The condition develops {{as a result of a}} localized bacterial infection of mixed pathogenic microflora, due to the accumulation of subgingival plaque. A novel drug delivery system was developed, for the <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> of periodontitis. The <b>localized</b> <b>treatment</b> of the condition is considered preferable as high local concentrations can be achieved, without concomitant side effects. It used the novel excipient, halloysite, to offer a controlled release of tetracycline base. Halloysite is a microtubular material and it is possible to load drug into the lumen of the microtubules, after which a chitosan coating can be applied, which further retards release from the halloysite. Tetracycline was the antibiotic chosen for the product, as it has been widely shown to be efficacious against periodontal pathogens. A delivery system based on a thermoresponsive polymer, poloxamer 407, was developed, as it offered ease of administration. Both the gelling temperature and the adhesive ability of the polymer system was modified, to produce the most suitable system. The final product was tested in vivo in a dog model, and showed good retention and positive antimicrobial activity, with drug release occurring over a 6 - week period...|$|E

30|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a common}} source of many {{cardiovascular}} diseases that cause stroke and heart attack. Atherosclerosis inflammation starts in the intima and media layers of the arterial wall section by forming a plaque, eventually leading to an abrupt rupture of the arterial wall. Although many pharmaceutical agents are available to treat different manifestations of atherosclerosis, their systemic delivery has serious disadvantages, including considerable side effects and low efficacy at tolerated doses [1]. Recent advances in nanotechnology have provided new tools for the efficient diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis [2 - 7].

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{three-dimensional}} brushite crystals were prepared through palm olein-in-water high internal phase emulsion processing route {{for the first}} time. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the powders possessed brushite crystalline phase with trace amount of hydroxyapatite.

These factors governed the rate of nucleation and crystal growth, resulting in flower-like morphologies. The petal-like flakes grew radially from the centre which gave rise to porosity of less than 2 Î¼m. A plausible mechanism of crystal growth is discussed and postulated schematically. Sodium ampicillin, a broad spectrum antibiotic, was loaded into the pores of the crystals, which was subsequently released in vitro.

40|$|When {{leaves are}} exposed to low temperature, sugars {{accumulate}} and transcription factors in the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) family are expressed, which, together with CBF-independent pathways, are known {{to contribute to the}} cold acclimation process and an increase in freezing tolerance. What is not known, however, is whether expression of these cold-regulated genes can be induced systemically in response to a <b>localized</b> cold <b>treatment.</b> To address this, pre-existing, mature leaves of warm-grown Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to a <b>localized</b> cold <b>treatment</b> (near 10 ° C) whilst conjoined newly developing leaves continued only to experience warmer temperatures. In initial experiments on wild-type A. thaliana (Col- 0) using real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) we observed that some genes— including CBF genes, certain downstream cold-responsive (COR) targets and CBF-independent transcription factors— respond to a direct 9 ° C treatment of whole plants. In subsequent experiments, we found that the treatment of expanded leaves with temperatures near 10 ° C can induce cold-associated genes in conjoined warm-maintained tissues. CBF 1 showed a particularly strong systemic response, although CBF-independent transcription factors also responded. Moreover, the <b>localized</b> cold <b>treatment</b> of A. thaliana (C 24) plants with a luciferase reporter fused to the promoter region of KIN 2 indicated that in warm-maintained leaves, KIN 2 might respond to a systemic signal from remote, directly cold-treated leaves. Collectively, our study provides strong evidence that the processes involved in cold acclimation are partially mediated by a signal that acts systemically. This has the potential to act as an early-warning system to enable developing leaves to cope better with the cold environment in which they are growing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{significant}} problem in planning of volumetrically prescribed <b>localized</b> <b>treatments</b> is the mathematical impossibility {{to determine the}} exact three dimensional shape and volume of a target object from its projected images. Reconstruction accuracy also varies with viewing angle, depending on the convexity and aspect ratios of the target object. In response to this problem, we are developing a robust and efficient technique for approximate volumetric reconstruction, which (A) uses no prior information of the shape and volume of the target, (B) does not require exact silhouettes, (C) accepts arbitrary number of images, (D) produces solid object and measure of its volume, (E) provides confidence measure of the reconstruction and drawing of silhouettes, (F) is robust, fast and easy to implement. Preliminary tests suggest that fairly convex objects can be reconstructed from four views, and typically six views with table rotation allow us to reconstruct fine details as small as 1 mm. The method is applicable for any X-ray guided volumetric treatment. Pilot applications will be planning of radiosurgery of arterioveneous malformations (AVMs) and radiofrequency ablation of soft tissue lesions. ...|$|R
