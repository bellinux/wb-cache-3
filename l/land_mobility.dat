40|$|For {{political}} reasons, {{food self-sufficiency}} still plays {{a central role}} in Taiwan’s agricultural policy. With production costs being high as compared to world market prices, protection by tariffs and subsidies were used to try keeping up domestic food production at a desired level. Yet, since Taiwan {{became a member of the}} WTO, such forms of shelter are no longer feasible. In order to increase domestic food production by enhancing productivity and making use of economies of scale, significant changes in the country’s farm structure will be necessary. Three major interdependent structural obstacles stand in the way of efforts to modernize Taiwan’s agriculture and achieve a higher and more competitive food production: the small size of the farm plots, the ageing of Taiwan’s farming population, and the high proportion of farm-family income derived from non-agricultural sources. In spite of high and increasing urbanization, an unfavourable farm structure persists, with farms holding on average less than 1 ha, and farmers ’ average age being almost 60 years. In addition, “land to the tiller ” regulations imbedded in the Land Reform Act, land speculation around big cities and an attitude which considers the selling of a piece of land which has been in family property for decades an dishonest act prevent <b>land</b> <b>mobility.</b> Programmes to support small farms might in the short run keep small farms alive by off-farm income but might in the long run be counter-productive.

By doing this, it considers experiences made with <b>land</b> <b>mobility</b> programmes in the EU, and in particular in Germany, which in former times experienced many of the structural problems now being encountere...|$|E
40|$|Irelands {{agriculture}} is characterised by an ageing farmer population and small average farm sizes. Past policy schemes developed {{to address these}} issues have been targeted at accelerating succession and retirement processes in agriculture. Their success however was limited. The process of succession, inheritance and retirement is complex and the decision-making of farm families in these situations is influenced by many factors. In order to develop more successful policies to encourage the early transfer of land and to increase farm sizes a better understanding of these factors is necessary. The paper addresses this question by employing a Neural Network Analysis with data collected through a survey of Irish farmers perception on succession and <b>land</b> <b>mobility</b> measures in 2012. The analysis shows that while many farmers in general are in favour of various <b>land</b> <b>mobility</b> measures, they would not consider taking advantage of any of them, which in part could be explained by a large number of farmers being unwilling to totally retire from farming...|$|E

After a preliminary work, to define {{the state of the art}} in the field of sustainable urban mobility strategies, the problem has been theoretically set up in terms of transport economy, introducing the external costs' concept duly translated into the principle of pricing for the use of public infrastructures. The research is based on the definition of a set of direct and indirect indicators to qualify the urban areas by <b>land</b> use, <b>mobility,</b> environmental and economic conditions. These indicators have been calculated for a selected set of typical urban areas in Europe on the basis of {{the results of}} a survey carried out by means of a specific questionnaire. Once identified the most typical and interesting applications of the road pricing concept in cities such as London (Congestion Charging), Milan (Ecopass), Stockholm (Congestion Tax) and Rome (ZTL), a large benchmarking exercise and the cross analysis of direct and indirect indicators, has allowed to define a simple general model, guidelines and key requirements for the implementation of a pricing scheme based traffic restriction in a generic urban area.

30|$|In this article, {{natural factors}} in the farming-pastoral ecotone that might have {{influenced}} the blown sand hazards in Beijing in 2000 are analyzed. In the farming-pastoral ecotone, blown sand activities took place primarily in springtime, during which 39.8 percent of the annual frequency of erosive winds above threshold occurred. The prevailing directions of the erosive winds were NNW, NW, NWW, and N, with frequencies of 47, 20, 13, and 9 percent respectively. Sand entrainment and dust emission are influenced by erosive wind frequency, soil moisture, and land use and cover change. Favorable wind characteristics and a lasting drought in 1999 and 2000 may have produced ideal conditions for land surface desiccation, vegetation degradation, and <b>land</b> surface <b>mobility</b> and the occurrence of intense sand- and dust storms in Beijing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the Dutch LUTI model TIGRIS in the planning process. TIGRIS is a long-term, incremental, time-based interaction and allocation model for <b>land</b> use, <b>mobility,</b> congestion and accessibility. In TIGRIS accessibility is described as a location factor for land-use that generates mobility. This increased mobility leads to congestion and changes in accessibility, and afterwards to new changes in land use. The model is used for regional and national forecasting, and follows a learning-by-doing approach. In this paper four applications of TIGRIS are described with a focus on assessing impacts and the role in the planning process. Because TIGRIS was originally developed as a sketch planning model with limited detail and the calibration on the basis of empirical data was rather limited, a new version, TIGRIS XL, is currently being developed...|$|R
30|$|Mobility {{was another}} {{strategy}} used {{to cope with}} drought, because Bokspits area exhibits spatial vegetation heterogeneity between sand dunes, which influences forage availability for grazing animals (Scoones [1995]). Therefore, livestock mobility is necessary to effectively use the heterogeneous vegetation and widely practised in communal rangelands of Africa to cope with drought (Samuels et al. [2013]). But pasture land reforms such as the Tribal Grazing Land Policy (TGLP) of Botswana, which promotes fencing and privatization of communal land, limit the ability of pastoralists and farmers to move their livestock between grazing areas. This could also explain why this strategy was least used by pastoralists at Bokspits as there are fenced ranches around their grazing <b>lands.</b> Though <b>mobility</b> is widely practised across Africa, {{it needs to be}} well-planned; otherwise, animals could be crowded in one area especially during droughts, leading to overgrazing, range degradation and eventually increased livestock mortality (Nkedianye et al.

Traffic psychology, defined as ''the study of the behaviour of road users and the psychological processes underlying that behaviour'', attempts to identify the determinants of road user behaviour with the aim of developing effective accident countermeasures. Models of road user behaviour involve driver task analyses, functional control models, and motivational models focused on risk taking and risk acceptance. The relation between accident occurrence and the preceding behaviour is largely unclear; performance aspects as well as motivational aspects, individual differences and momentary state variables all appear to be relevant. Attempts to modify road user behaviour involve driver training, enforcement, and rehabilitation.

The data reveal considerable social and cultural obstacles to an efficient system of land transfer resulting in a low level of <b>land</b> <b>mobility.</b> The policy response to such marginal conditions has not been encouraging either at EEC or National government level. Inadequate EEC directives have resulted in failure and while some positive intervention has been achieved by Irish agenicies such as the Land Commission, there has been a general failure to show awareness of conditions on the ground.

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the main {{obstacles}} that hamper the development of agricultural <b>land</b> <b>mobility</b> and investment incentives in agriculture land, mainly in conjunction to agriculture land rights property. There were interviewed 621 farms (households – HH) that possess 2, 529 land plots, {{from different parts of}} Albania, representing different types of agriculture land distribution and land use. The interviewed farmers state that they perceive property rights of 20 % of the plots as unsecure. Property insecurity perception tends {{to be related to the}} form of the land acquisition – it is higher among farmers who received their land through the implementation of the Law 7501 (thus, that did not own that land before communism), as compared to farmers who got “father’s land”, that was owned by them (or their ancestors) before WW 2 (land distribution was done according to community will, respecting old property boundaries). The clash among customary and legal institutions for land tenure in the villages (former land rights by inheritance and new land rights distributed by Law 7501) is also a cause of social tensions in rural communities, which in some cases are associated with heavy consequences. Conflicts per se also influence further in the land security perception in the villages...|$|E
40|$|Assured <b>land</b> <b>mobility</b> of {{military}} forces may be adversely impacted by unexpected discontinuities in terrain that {{fall within the}} relative vertical error limits of standard terrain elevation models. We define terrain gaps as consisting of such anomalies, within the context {{of military}} maneuver, having characteristic dimensions on the order of ten meters or less and minimum slope of approximately 40 degrees, which may impede or constrain the movement of manned or unmanned ground vehicles. Gaps may be natural or man-made, wet or dry, permanent or transient. They may include irrigation ditches, stream banks, short but steep escarpments, canals, walls, berms, excavation overburden, and other micro-terrain features with a positive or negative elevation difference from immediately surrounding terrain. We examined LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) data over southwestern Montana to capture detailed elevation profiles over suspected terrain gaps, and derived geometric attributes from profile subsets to characterize gap morphology from the perspective of critical military parameters. These data were captured as geospatial information in a GIS environment containing gap linear feature classes with associated attribute data. The profile subsets for each gap feature lend themselves to automatic extraction of elevation breaklines in defining the spatial limits of the gap in the direction of maximum slope change. The distribution of gap features with attribution within the study area demonstrates the critical role that micro-terrain gaps can play in tactical military routing and maneuver models, by obviating bridging, crossing, and avoidance decisions on the ground with advance knowledge of gaps from tactical remote sensors...|$|E

This paper aims {{to find out if}} the statistical analysis of <b>land</b> use and <b>mobility</b> can help to answer the question of what happens during economic crisis on both land use and transport system, and unveiling key spatial relationships between them. The methodology for the analysis was developed accordingly with the data and resources available. First, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed in order to identify the <b>land</b> use and <b>mobility</b> pattern during the last decade. It focuses on six aspects, which are distribution of population and dwellings, employment and jobs, GDP, motorization and modal split. The second aspect consists on crossing the spatial patterns of the different aspects in order to find some explanatory relationships that indicate the presence of the key characteristics. Through the exploration analysis, we find that there is a close relationship between the land-use system and travel behaviour in Madrid Region. With an increasing of new dwellings constructed in the outer periphery of Madrid Region, it leads longer trips distance and more travel cost particularly by car mode. Moreover, during the economic crisis, we also find the motorization level of Madrid keeps the same, as a result of the decreasing GDP and relatively decreasing household income...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{prehistory}} of Central Oregon is explored {{through the}} examination of six archaeological sites and two isolated finds from the Upper Deschutes River Basin. Inquiry focuses on the <b>land</b> use, <b>mobility,</b> technological organization, and raw material procurement of the aboriginal inhabitants of the area. Archaeological data presented here are augmented with ethnographic accounts to inform interpretations. Eight stone tool assemblages and three debitage assemblages are analyzed in order to characterize technological organization. Diagnostic projectile points recovered from the study sites indicate the area was seasonally utilized prior to the eruption of ancient Mt. Mazama (> 6, 845 BP), and continuing until the Historic period (c. 1850). While {{there is evidence of}} human occupation at the study sites dating to between > 7, 000 - 150 B. P., the range of activities and intensity of occupation varied. Source characterization analysis indicates that eight different Central Oregon obsidian sources are represented at the sites. Results of the lithic analysis are presented in light of past environmental and social phenomena including volcanic eruptions, climate change, and human population movements. Chapter One introduces the key questions that directed the inquiry and defines the theoretical perspective used. Chapter Two describes the modem and ancient environmental context of study area. Topics of discussion include physiography, fauna, vegetation, geology, and climate. Chapter Three introduces the aboriginal inhabitants of the Upper Deschutes River Basin and summarizes past archeological investigations in the area.
