40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the use of}} personal lubricants for sexual intercourse is limited and has primarily focused on condom compatibility and breakage, with only recent limited assessment of lubricant safety and possible epidemiologic implications. This article discusses the global evidence of <b>lubricant</b> <b>compatibility</b> with latex condoms and biological safety of lubricants, as well as documentation of lubricant use and current guidelines for HIV prevention programming in Africa. Data on <b>lubricant</b> <b>compatibility</b> with condoms are less available than commonly realized, and many lubricant products may not have been thoroughly tested for safety due to flexible regulatory environments. Recent laboratory and study findings from microbicides research also suggest that some water-based lubricants may have safety issues. Some African populations are using several types of lubricants, especially oil-based petroleum jellies, and receive little evidence-based guidance. More research is needed from the medical community to guide prevention programming...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} experimental methods {{used during the}} materials <b>compatibility</b> and <b>lubricants</b> research program (MCLR). The MCLR program was jointly sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy and the air-conditioning and refrigeration industry. The individual projects were managed by the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute. The projects presented in this report are: Chemical and Thermal Stability of Refrigerant/Lubricant Mixtures with Metals, Miscibility of <b>Lubricants</b> with Refrigerants, <b>Compatibility</b> of Refrigerants and Lubricants with Motor Materials, Compatibility of Refrigerants and <b>Lubricants</b> with Elastomers, <b>Compatibility</b> of Refrigerants and Lubricants with Engineering Plastics and Sealed Tube Comparisons of the Compatibility of Desiccants with Refrigerants and Lubricants...|$|R

Water-based lubricants are generally recommended. Typically it is recommended to avoid any lubricant that contains silicone since it is an insulator and hence reduces conductivity. Practitioners of electrostimulation select <b>lubricants</b> for <b>compatibility</b> with the material of the electrodes, as well as for desirable conductive properties, which can maximize the strength and quality of the signal.|$|R
40|$|A {{technological}} {{break through}} for supporting rotating shafts is the {{active magnetic bearing}} (AMB). Active magnetic bearings offer some important advantages over conventional ball, roller or journal bearings such as reduced frictional drag, no physical contact in the bearing, no need for <b>lubricants,</b> <b>compatibility</b> with high vacuum and ultra-clean environments, and ability to control shaft position within the bearing. The disadvantages of the AMB system are the increased cost and complexity, reduced bearing stiffness {{and the need for}} a controller. Still, there are certain applications, such as high speed machining, biomedical devices, and gyroscopes, where the additional cost of an AMB system can be justified. The inherent actuator capabilities of the AMB offer the potential for active balancing of spindles and micro-shaping capabilities for machine tools, The work presented in this paper concentrates on an AMB test program that utilizes the actuator capability to dynamically balance a spindle. In this study, an unbalanced AMB spindle system was enhanced with an LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm combined with an existing PID (proportional, integral, differential) control. This enhanced controller significantly improved the concentricity of an intentionally unbalanced shaft. The study included dynamic system analysis, test validation, control design and simulation, as well as experimental implementation using a digital LMS controller...|$|R
40|$|Although {{mineral oils}} are {{commonly}} used as lubricants their emission particularly in marine environments can cause significant impact. In the current study the properties of water miscible deep eutectic solvents and ionic liquids are compared with a typical mineral base oil to ascertain their efficacy for potential marine <b>lubricants.</b> The environmental <b>compatibility</b> {{of some of the}} liquids, particularly choline chloride and glycerol, makes it an interesting potential base lubricant. Surprisingly some DESs showed very low corrosion rates with steel, nickel and aluminium even when the liquids contained water. This is a surprising result given that the chloride ion concentration is approximately 5 mol dm[superscript âˆ’ 3]. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
