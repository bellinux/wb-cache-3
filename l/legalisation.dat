5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} <b>legalisation</b> of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its <b>legalisation</b> through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{continued}} to be {{an active member of}} the cricket community, voicing his support in late April 2009 for Pakistan player Saeed Ajmal, and calling for the <b>legalisation</b> of the doosra spin-bowling delivery. He levelled criticism in July 2009 against Kevin Pietersen for his captaincy difficulties and in September against Andrew Flintoff for his apparent favour of club cricket over internationals.|$|E
5|$|Following Ireland's <b>legalisation</b> of {{same-sex}} marriage in 2015 (see below), {{the ability to}} enter into a civil partnership was closed off. As of 16 November 2015, no further civil partnerships are granted in Ireland and existing civil partners only retain that status if they do not marry. Any civil partnership converted into a marriage is dissolved.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, {{the eldest}} son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the third prime {{minister}} of Singapore. He introduced several policy changes, including the reduction of national service duration from {{two and a half}} years to two years, and the <b>legalisation</b> of casino gambling. Other efforts to raise the city's global profile included the reestablishment of the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008, and the hosting of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Until the <b>legalisation</b> of {{opposition}} parties in 1992, Déby's MPS {{was the sole}} legal party in Chad. Since then, 78 registered political parties have become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted them.|$|E
25|$|The Voluntary Euthanasia <b>Legalisation</b> Society {{was founded}} in 1935 by Charles Killick Millard (now called Dignity in Dying). The {{movement}} campaigned for the <b>legalisation</b> of euthanasia in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|While {{prostitution}} controls {{have been}} relaxed {{at a local}} level, there is no impetus for <b>legalisation</b> at the central government level. Importantly, <b>legalisation</b> does not have much public support. Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that <b>legalisation</b> would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women. Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of social sanctions against working or patronising a red-light district. Problems associated with female employment also limit the effectiveness of <b>legalisation.</b> These include the lack of independent trade unions, and limited access of individuals to civil redress with regard to {{occupational health and safety}} issues.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, Medha Patkar of the Aam Aadmi Party {{stated that}} her party {{supports}} the <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|During {{the post-war}} years, {{there was a}} {{discernible}} shift towards the adoption of roundarm bowling and questions about <b>legalisation</b> of roundarm dominated the sport for thirty years.|$|E
25|$|A Member of Parliament from Denmark {{translated}} the thesis into Danish; and the translation {{laid the foundation}} for the <b>legalisation</b> of pornography in Denmark on 4 June 1969.|$|E
25|$|Tokyo Rainbow Pride {{has been}} held {{annually}} since 2012, with attendance increasing every year. A 2015 opinion poll found {{that a majority of}} Japanese support the <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|D66 is {{a social}} liberal party. The first Kok cabinet, in which it participated {{introduced}} several liberal reforms in the past, such as the <b>legalisation</b> of euthanasia, same-sex marriage, and prostitution.|$|E
25|$|Muldoon also {{opposed the}} <b>legalisation</b> of {{homosexual}} behaviour when Labour MP Fran Wilde introduced the Homosexual Law Reform Bill in 1985. The Bill passed as the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986.|$|E
25|$|As of 31 December 2015, {{approximately}} 15,750 {{same-sex marriages}} were performed in Washington state, {{a significant proportion}} of which occurred in the first 12 months of <b>legalisation.</b> Statistics for marriages post 2015 are not available.|$|E
25|$|Central {{guidelines}} {{laid down}} by the CPC do not permit the public advocacy of the <b>legalisation</b> of prostitution. Arguments concerning <b>legalisation</b> are not absent, however, from mainland China. On the contrary, some commentators contend that legally recognising the sex industry, in conjunction with further economic development, will ultimately {{reduce the number of}} women in prostitution. Domestic commentators have also been highly critical of the PRC's prostitution controls, with a consistent Marxist-informed focus of complaint being the gender-biased and discriminatory nature of such controls, as well as human rights abuses. Some commentators in China and overseas contend that the PRC's policy of banning prostitution is problematic because it hinders the task of developing measures {{to prevent the spread of}} HIV.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands has a {{long history}} of social {{tolerance}} and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering its drug policy and its <b>legalisation</b> of euthanasia. On 1 April 2001, the Netherlands became the first nation to legalise same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1827, to {{test the}} {{validity}} of roundarm bowling, three All-England v Sussex roundarm trial matches were arranged, but no immediate decision was made about <b>legalisation.</b> Lillywhite and Broadbridge used roundarm to great effect against the England batsmen who made loud objections.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the French Parliament's vote results, those in opposition to the <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex marriage in France participated in public protests. In both Paris and Lyon, violence erupted as protesters clashed with police; the issue has mobilised right-wing forces in the country, including neo-Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Adoption by {{same-sex}} couples is legal within all jurisdictions within Australia, {{with the exception}} of the Northern Territory. Debate regarding religious exemptions for faith-based adoption agencies occurred during Victoria's <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex adoption in December 2015. New South Wales and Victoria include such exemptions in their adoption laws.|$|E
25|$|Roundarm was {{a natural}} {{reaction}} to the growing predominance of batsmen over the age-old underarm style of bowling. Its adherents argued that the <b>legalisation</b> of roundarm was essential to restore the balance between batting and bowling. However, high-scoring matches were still comparatively rare owing to vagaries in pitch conditions.|$|E
25|$|Frederick William Lillywhite (13 June 1792 – 21 August 1854) was an English cricketer {{during the}} game's roundarm era. One {{of the main}} protagonists in the <b>legalisation</b> of roundarm, {{he was one of}} the most {{successful}} bowlers of his era. His status is borne out by his nickname: The Nonpareil.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>legalisation</b> of male {{homosexuality}} in the UK {{with the}} implementation of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 other more political organisations had appeared, such as the Campaign for Homosexual Equality which focuses on equal rights for all homosexuals. These superseded the objectives of Minorities Research Group and helped bring about its demise and evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} roundarm in the 1820s {{was a natural}} {{reaction}} to the growing predominance of batsmen over the age-old underarm style of bowling. Its adherents argued that the <b>legalisation</b> of roundarm was essential to restore the balance between batting and bowling. However, high-scoring matches were still comparatively rare owing to vagaries in pitch conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, another bowling {{revolution}} {{resulted in}} the <b>legalisation</b> of overarm {{and in the same}} year Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was first published. W. G. Grace began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s Moama {{received}} {{thousands of}} visitors each week from Melbourne, due to New South Wales' more liberal gambling laws {{and the presence of}} poker machines in some of Moama's entertainment venues. The <b>legalisation</b> of poker machines in Victoria killed off these day tours, although poker machines are still a significant tourist drawcard in the town.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{support the}} {{implementation}} of the Portuguese model when it comes to drug law reform - specifically, the decriminalisation of all drugs and treating drug addiction as a health issue rather than a law and order issue. Their approach to drug <b>legalisation</b> is on a case by case basis. They support legalising cannabis for medical use.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine criticised the Coalition's {{policy on}} Europe, {{but he did}} support the {{tightening}} of immigration laws. He also supported George Osborne's Budget measures in 2013 and Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, but showed concerns over the <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex marriage. In June 2013, he voted against Lord Dear's wrecking amendment, thus ratifying the same-sex marriage act.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012, a poll {{commissioned}} by MaltaToday news website found {{that support for}} same-sex marriage had increased significantly, with 41% {{of the population in}} favour of same-sex marriage and 52% against it. The 2012 data also showed a generational gap, with only 23% of people older than 55 supporting the <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex marriage while 60% of those aged 18–35 did so.|$|E
25|$|A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China {{lasted from}} 1856 until 1860 {{and led to}} the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the {{importation}} of opium. <b>Legalisation</b> stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the <b>legalisation</b> of {{same-sex}} marriage, Germany {{was one of}} the first countries to legislate registered partnerships (Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) for same-sex couples, which provided most though not all the rights of marriage. The law came into effect on 1 August 2001, and the act was progressively amended on subsequent occasions to reflect court rulings expanding the rights of registered partners.|$|E
25|$|Support for LGBT rights such as {{same-sex}} marriage from Australia's second-largest religion was confirmed in 2012 by the Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils, which represents Buddhist laypeople, and the Australian Sangha Association, which represents religious leaders. Bodhinyana Monastery abbot Ajahn Brahm also wrote to parliament {{in support of}} {{same-sex marriage}}, noting that {{the institution of marriage}} pre-dates religion and that <b>legalisation</b> would alleviate human suffering.|$|E
25|$|Constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos has {{questioned}} {{the notion that}} the <b>legalisation</b> of same-sex marriage in South Africa represents the pinnacle of the human rights struggle of members of the LGBT community. He argues that those who are not involved in long term monogamous relationships and those who cannot {{come out of the closet}} and get married because of the threat of victimisation may not see any benefit from the legislation.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade), Cohn-Bendit {{attracted}} controversy for his independent views. He was criticised {{from the}} political right for being a strong proponent of freer immigration, the <b>legalisation</b> of soft drugs, and the abandonment of nuclear power and from the left for his pro-free market policies, his support for military interventions in Bosnia and Afghanistan and frequent collaboration with centrist personalities (Bernard Kouchner and François Bayrou for instance).|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Applicant {{along with}} several others began organising a march in Moscow, the capital of Russia, to {{demonstrate}} against discrimination against LGBT people in Russia. The march was to be held on 27 May that year, {{the anniversary of the}} <b>legalisation</b> of homosexuality in Russia. On 16 February, a statement was released by the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, stating that any proposed LGBT rights march would not be permitted to go ahead.|$|E
25|$|According to many Rastas, the {{illegality}} of cannabis in {{many nations}} {{is evidence of}} persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest {{the rules and regulations}} of Babylon. Rastas have advocated the <b>legalisation</b> of cannabis. The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.|$|E
25|$|The first {{general post}} office in London opened in 1643, just 8 years after King Charles I legalised use of the royal posts for private correspondence. It was {{probably}} on Cloak Lane near Dowgate Hill. Coffee houses in the City such as Lloyd's and Garraway's organised private transport of mail among their patrons. The Royal Mail (which, following its <b>legalisation,</b> held a nominal monopoly on such delivery services) moved its headquarters to Lombard Street in the City in 1678 to better curtail such practices.|$|E
