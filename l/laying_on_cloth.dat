60|$|And what a {{business}} they had, to be sure, with the spreading of the viands and the kindling of the fire! The latter {{was the first}} duty. Hector said he would undertake it, but after attempting to light it with damp sticks he gave it up and assisted the ladies to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> <b>on</b> the grass. Then George and Fred got the fire to kindle, and Mr Sudberry, in attempting to mend it, burnt his fingers and put it out; whereupon McAllister came to his rescue and got it to blaze in right earnest. Jacky thereafter tried to jump over it, fell into it, and was saved from premature destruction by being plucked out and quenched before having received any further damage than the singeing of his hair and eyelashes. He was thus rendered a little more hideous and impish-like than Nature had intended him to be.|$|R
