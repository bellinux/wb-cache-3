Vacuum systems are seen as a priority in many environmentally sensitive areas such as the Couran Cove Eco Resort close to the Barrier Reef in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of lidding films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the <b>leak</b> resistance (<b>tightness)</b> of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays and multi-layer polymer lidding films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process and lid sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|R

50|$|A {{metal hose}} is a {{flexible}} metal line element. There {{are two basic}} types of metal hose that differ in their design and application: stripwound hoses and corrugated hoses. Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. tensile strength and tear strength). Corrugated hoses can withstand high pressure and provide maximum <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> on account of their material. Corrugated hoses also exhibit corrosion resistance and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive seawater or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.|$|E
5000|$|The hollow axles, {{made from}} a chrome-molybdenum alloy, carry the massive wheels and the wheel set {{bearings}} at each end. The wheels are the typical German size, 1,250 mm, {{with a minimum of}} 1,170 mm after wear. The axles are mounted via hollow shafts into the gearbox casing, which, together with the traction motor, are designated the [...] "integrated common drive train", or IGA.

50|$|For vacuum applications, {{demanding}} {{very low}} contamination (out-gassing and particle emission) {{as well as}} high temperature operation (200 - 300 °C) for prolonged out-baking or processing times and where a copper or metal sealing is not possible or very inconvenient/expensive, a custom-made, clean-room manufactured, sealing such as Kalrez 9100, SCVBR or Perlast can be used. After manufacturing, they are O-plasma vacuum cleaned (and/or vacuum baked) to reach out-gassing performance similar to Teflon while reaching vacuum <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> (permeability rates) similar to FKM (Viton) compounds. This combination of properties allows FFKM seals to reach well into UHV pressures {{without the use of}} metal sealing. However, they are significantly more expensive than standard FKM O-rings.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{the engine}} {{itself can be}} {{essentially}} similar, thus making many petrol and diesel vehicles in principle convertible to natural gas use, safe, convenient and cost effective gas storage and fuelling {{is more of a}} challenge compared to petrol and diesel as the natural gas is pressurized and/or - in the case of LNG - the tank is insulated. The lower energy density of gases compared to liquid fuels, whilst mitigated to a great extent by high compression or gas liquification, requires a trade-off in terms of size/ complexity/ weight of the storage container, range of the vehicle between refuelling stops, and time to refuel. Although similar storage technologies may be used for, and similar compromises would apply to, a Hydrogen vehicle as part of a proposed new Hydrogen economy, Methane as a gaseous fuel is safer than Hydrogen due to its lower flammability, low corrosivity and better <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> due to larger molecular weight/ size, resulting in lower price hardware solutions based on proven technology and conversions.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{of one of}} the parts in a particle detector, called the RF Foil, has been a very intensive process in the past. The design and production process, which had a trial and error character, led eventually to an RF Foil that met the most important requirement: a sufficient <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> value. Since these kinds of foils have to be produced in the future, it is desirable to shorten the development stage with a view to cost reduction. This research project investigates how this part can be optimized with respect to the radiation length. An important limiting factor within this optimization process is the <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> of the foil. The intended production method this research will investigate is superplastic forming (SPF). On the one hand, the goal is to use finite element calculations to predict the forming behavior. The <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> of the formed foil must also be predicted within these calculations. On the other hand, an optimization strategy is necessary to reduce the radiation length of the RF Foil while maintaining the <b>leak</b> <b>tightness...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The fuel {{injector}} acts a double role: {{it is the}} valve of the pump supplying fuel to the combustion chamber and the device spraying a supplied dose. As the valve it may operate as a self-opening or self-closing valve, depending on the pressure produced by the fuel pump, or the valve controlled by external signals. Techniques and diagnosis methods for {{fuel injector}}s depend on a fuel injector’s control system and construction details. For practical reasons the fuel injector is a sectional valve with a separated component called atomizer. Atomizers must be cooled. It is possible to cool with fuel or with external water- or oil-cooling system. In case of liquid-cooled fuel injectors, apart from malfunctions causes known from literature, decrease of the cooling efficiency may appear, as {{the effect of the}} penetration of fuel from injector to the cooling system of injector. There are no reports concerning detectability of fuel leakage into cooling liquid with known techniques and diagnosis methods of injection systems and fuel injectors. In the article there will be presented as follows: a connection of the atomizer and injector body as the place of fuel leakage into the cooling system, reasons for loss of <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> in connection of atomizer with the body of atomizer and methods applicable for the <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> analysis, mechanisms of injector’s malfunction caused by the loss of <b>leak</b> <b>tightness.</b> The analysis of applied and possible methods of injectors diagnosis in the aspect of identification of said leakiness will be carried out...|$|E
