The actor wanted {{primarily}} a film that would deepen the Wolverine character, but “somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fourth X-Men — just with different characters.” He tried to avert the same results while doing the next solo film for the character, 2013's The Wolverine.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed. This includes the use of high-contrast disruptive patterns as used on military uniforms, but anything that delays recognition {{can be used as}} camouflage. Camouflage involves deception, whether by <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> background or by resembling something else, which may be plainly visible to observers. This article lists methods used by animals and the military to escape notice.|$|E
5|$|What was {{ultimately}} {{included in the}} constitution was a modified form of this plan. In the Grand Committee, Benjamin Franklin successfully proposed the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house. But the final July 16 vote on the compromise still left the Senate <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this reason. Then on July 23, just before most of the convention's work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as {{they had in the}} Confederation Congress. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a leading proponent of the compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it. As the personally powerful senators were to receive terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed them, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who were assured of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.|$|E

25|$|Cistern 16/17 (located at {{the centre}} of the far {{northern}} end of the Temple Mount). Despite the currently narrow entrances, this cistern (17 and 16 are the same cistern) is a large vaulted chamber, which Warren described as <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> inside of the cathedral at Cordoba (which was previously a mosque). Warren believed that it was almost certainly built for some other purpose, and was only adapted into a cistern at a later date; he suggested that it might have been part of a general vault supporting the northern side of the platform, in which case substantially more of the chamber exists than is used for a cistern.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{into account}} of the recent {{suggestion}} that the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first 1 sec of the long GRB, we propose that the jet of the GRB consists of multiple sub-jets or sub-shells (i. e., an inhomogeneous jet model).
