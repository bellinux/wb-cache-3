Having {{spent most of}} his professional life in radio or recording studios and on television soundstages, he was enjoying doing live performances.

Gone, however, were the cardigan sweaters which had been a staple of his weekly television shows, and which he had actually hated having to wear.

According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> and playful."

At first he tried doing a special voice, but was told to [...] "just be yourself." [...] Rocco was one of Bill Oakley's and Josh Weinstein's favorite guest stars, and they liked including him in their episodes so they could [...] "have a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with him." [...] On occasions when Rocco was unavailable to do a voice over, Meyers was voiced by Hank Azaria in [...] "The Front" [...] (season four, 1993), [...] "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] (season five, 1994) and [...] "Itchy & Scratchy Land." ...|$|E
500|$|Nikisch {{was invited}} to tour North America in 1912, and despite his long {{association}} with the Berlin Philharmonic and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, he insisted that the LSO should be contracted for the tour. The orchestra, 100-strong (all men except for the harpist), was booked to sail on the Titanic, but the tour schedule was changed at the last minute, and the players sailed safely on the Baltic. The tour was arduous, but a triumph. The New York Press said, [...] "The great British band played with a vigor, force and temperamental impetuousness that almost lifted the listener out of his seat." [...] The New York Times praised all departments of the orchestra, though, like The Manchester Guardian, it found the strings [...] "brilliant rather than mellow". The paper had a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> at the LSO's expense: {{from the viewpoint of}} a country that had long enjoyed permanent, salaried orchestras such as the Boston Symphony, it gently mocked the LSO's [...] "bold stand for the sacred right of sending substitutes" ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> [...] who wants to come up here and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
500|$|The Sentinels had two {{separate}} versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s {{evolved into the}} adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future. Singer described the 1973 version as [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> and stylish but also a little retro", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period, and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and [...] "those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels". The overall style was bulky to fit [...] "the traditional idea of a robot looks like", and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design. The robots' ability to fly was compared to a Harrier Jump Jet, as the Sentinels had vertical takeoff and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by Legacy Effects to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding woof effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Hayes {{quit the}} serial and her exit storyline played {{out the same}} year. It was {{initially}} left unclear what impact her departure would have on Miles'. Their relationship deteriorates after Kirsty miscarries their unborn baby. Kirsty is left distraught and feels she has to move with her life without Miles. However, Kirsty does not tell Miles she is leaving and leaves him a goodbye letter. Speaking of the scenes, Hayes said [...] "I don't agree with what she did or how she did it but Kirsty in her warped, grieving mind thinks it's best for everybody." [...] She felt that Kirsty's actions were [...] "horrible and selfish." [...] She also described her as [...] "emotionally detached" [...] and Miles {{would have tried to}} talk her out of leaving if he had been made aware of her departure. Viewers were not shown the full content of the goodbye letter. Hayes said it was good because she wrote a private goodbye letter to Quong Tart, and noted the personal element was best left between the two. After Miles chances of a family are again ruined, Miles loses control. He starts drinking and on one occasion he tries to kiss Leah. Producers decided to introduce a character named Rabbit (Mitzi Ruhlmann), who [...] "brings a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> back into Miles' life." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with.

500|$|In 2010, Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in the science fiction sequel [...] Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, [...] "I was paid to show off basically". The Wall Street Journal found <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> in the movie [...] "except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen" [...] while The New York Times said he [...] "shows up to deliver {{the closest thing to}} a performance in the movie". The Daily Telegraph felt his [...] "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is". However, USA Today felt his [...] "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable. On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, The Special Relationship, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the [...] "special relationship" [...] between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; both parties have since said they will not work together again [...] "for the foreseeable future". Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC's 30 Rock as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom's star and creator, has said that [...] "he was so funny and delightful to work with". In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huxley {{said that}} Brave New World was {{inspired}} by the utopian novels of H. G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905) and Men Like Gods (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel, which became Brave New World. He {{wrote in a letter to}} Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had [...] "been having a <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> pulling the leg of H. G. Wells," [...] but then he [...] "got caught up in the excitement of [...] own ideas." [...] Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to Brave New World as a [...] "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own The Sleeper Awakes (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.|$|E
