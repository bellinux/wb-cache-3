50|$|First {{described}} by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776, the <b>little</b> <b>bunting</b> is a monotypic species, with no geographical variation across its extensive Eurasian range.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{species on}} the island include pale-bellied brent geese, Eurasian curlews, Eurasian oystercatchers, grey plovers, {{northern}} shovellers, <b>little</b> egrets, reed <b>buntings</b> and <b>little</b> terns.|$|R
60|$|Meantime the {{agitation}} of the Spaniard had a <b>little</b> loosened the <b>bunting</b> {{from around}} him, {{so that one}} broad fold swept curtain-like over, the chair-arm to the floor, revealing, amid a profusion of armorial bars and ground-colors--black, blue, and yellow--a closed castle in a blood red field diagonal with a lion rampant in a white.|$|R
40|$|In 2014, 162 {{bird species}} were {{recorded}} during the bird ringing activities in Slovenia. Of 155 species, 62, 275 birds were ringed, and 107 recoveries of birds ringed in Slovenia and found abroad, 148 foreign recoveries in Slovenia and 1395 local recoveries were recorded. The most frequently ringed species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Great Tit Parus major. As far as ringed nestlings are concerned, Great Tits and Barn Swalllows Hirundo rustica predominated. Considering the recoveries ringed of found birds abroad, the commonest were Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Mute Swans Cygnus olor. The farthest recovery was a Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica {{found in the}} Democratic Republic of Congo (5171 km away). Among the more interesting finds was also the so far southernmost recovery of a Sand Martin Riparia riparia found in Israel. Let us also mention the first recovery of a Corncrake Crex crex, which bred and was ringed in 2013 at Planinsko polje (central Slovenia) and {{was found in the}} 2014 breeding season in the Czech Republic. Among rare species, two <b>Little</b> <b>Buntings</b> Emberiza pusilla were caught and ringed. After nine years, the Roller Coracias garrulus bred again in Slovenia in 2014 and its nestlings were ringed. The paper also brings the description of the migration route of the first African migrant, the Black Stork Ciconia nigra, marked with a GPS/GSM telemetric device, which migrated across the Adriatic Sea, Sicily and Sahara to Nigeria...|$|R

50|$|A {{valuable}} habitat {{has been}} generated on the Große Aue for {{plants and animals}} typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large marsh grasshoppers. Threatened dragonflies, such as the banded darter, southern emerald damselfly live here as do birds like the whitethroat and <b>little</b> grebe. Reed <b>buntings,</b> reed warblers and snipe also occur here.|$|R
50|$|Today Mire Loch is {{a valued}} part of St. Abbs Head National Nature Reserve {{providing}} {{a home for}} freshwater birds such as <b>little</b> grebe, reed <b>bunting,</b> heron, mute swan, moorhen and sedge warbler. The fringing vegetation which is composed mostly of high reeds provides shelter and food for nesting birds {{as well as for}} migrants in spring and autumn. In early summer hundreds of herring gulls and kittiwakes bathe in the loch. In recent years the NTS has planted almost 1000 trees around the loch in an effort to provide extra cover for migrant birds. Most of these trees have been planted on the SW shore in a plantation dedicated to a diver who died off St. Abbs Head in 1981.|$|R
60|$|Now that Mabel's {{fears were}} awakened, June herself {{could not have}} {{manifested}} greater quickness in analyzing facts that she believed might affect {{the safety of the}} party. She saw at a glance that this bit of cloth could be observed from an adjacent island; that it lay so near the line between her own hut and the canoe as to leave no doubt that June had passed near it, if not directly under it; and that it might be a signal to communicate some important fact connected with the mode of attack to those who were probably lying in ambush near them. Tearing the <b>little</b> strip of <b>bunting</b> from the tree, Mabel hastened on, scarcely knowing what her duty next required of her. June might be false to her, but her manner, her looks, her affection, and her disposition as Mabel had known it in the journey, forbade the idea. Then came the allusion to Arrowhead's admiration of the pale-face beauties, some dim recollections of the looks of the Tuscarora, and a painful consciousness that few wives could view with kindness one who had estranged a husband's affections. None of these images were distinct and clear, but they rather gleamed over the mind of our heroine than rested in it, and they quickened her pulses, as they did her step, without bringing with them the prompt and clear decisions that usually followed her reflections. She had hurried onwards towards the hut occupied by the soldier's wife, intending to remove at once to the blockhouse with the woman, though she could persuade no other to follow, when her impatient walk was interrupted by the voice of Muir.|$|R

50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>bunting</b> breeds {{across the}} taiga {{of the far}} {{north-east}} of Europe and northern Asia. It is migratory, wintering in the subtropics in northern India, southern China and the northern parts of south-east Asia. The birds remain in their winter quarters for quite long; specimens were taken in Yunnan in late March. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe. This species is adaptable; {{in the mountains of}} Bhutan for example, where small numbers winter, it is typically found in an agricultural habitat, mostly between 1000 and 2000 m ASL.|$|E
