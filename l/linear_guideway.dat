From statics analysis, vibration model analysis, dynamic experiment, and parameter identification, the dynamic modeling of <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> is synthetically studied. Based on contact mechanics and elastic mechanics, the mathematic vibration model and the expressions of basic mode frequency are deduced. Then, equivalent stiffness and damping of guideway are obtained in virtue of single-freedom-degree mode fitting method. Moreover, the investigation above is applied in a certain gantry-type machining center; and through comparing with simulation model and experiment results, both availability and correctness are validated...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{precision}} of <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> {{is very important}} performance for mechatronic equipments. The dynamic errors for the <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> of machine tools can reduce machining precision. In according with the advantage of high-speed response, high detection accuracy and non-contact measurement, position sensitive detector (PSD) is widely used in industrial dynamic measurement. In this paper an approach for measuring the motion stability based on PSD is proposed. The measurement system based on PSD is designed and the measurement errors are analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} {{the solution of the}} rigidity and structural vibration for system of <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> type based on ANSYS workbench. By comparing the results derived from the simulation of the model and the corresponding theoretical results, the validity of the theoretical solution can be verified. The analysis includes the system rigidity and the natural vibration frequency in the direction of vertical slider (Vertical), rolling (Rolling) and swing (Pitching), the structural vibration frequency for system of <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> type is carried out, the model is built according the true dimensions, what is more, the rollers are not necessary replaced by springs, because there is not so much difficulties by using ANSYS workbench and more accurate results can be obtained in this way. Two different types of simulation are carried out, and the simulation results show that different geometric sizes of slider, which mean different numbers of rollers, will change the resonance frequencies and mode shapes, and more rollers can enhance the stiffness of the LGT model, then reduce the possibility of resonance happening...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{has gained}} increasing {{importance in the}} last years due to the introduction of High Strength Steels (HSS) to improve the strength-to-mass ratio of stamped components. Despite the advantages in terms of load decrease, springback reduction and increased formability, the elevated temperatures the tools are subjected to may determine severe thermal-mechanical cycling, increased oxidation and wear, which influence the tools service life {{and the quality of the}} produced parts. In addition, the frictional behaviour is also changing with temperature, thus affecting the performance of the forming operation itself. In this paper a novel experimental apparatus suitable for reciprocating sliding wear tests at elevated temperatures is presented. It consists of a <b>linear</b> sliding <b>guideway</b> connected to an electrical actuator and equipped with a heating plate to heat metal sheets. A solid frame embeds a screw device used to apply normal load. Thermocouples placed both on the plate and on sheet sample are used to control temperature during the test. The machine is also equipped with two load cells to record the normal and the tamgential loads. The 22 MnB 5 high strength steel was chosen as reference material for the machine testing. The results showed the capability of the new equipment and the good stability of the mechanical and thermal condition during testing...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{behaviors}} of the contact surface between ball and raceway in a guideway mechanism vary with the applied loads and hence affect the mechanical responses of machine tools. The study aims to investigate the nonlinear characteristics of dynamic behaviors at the rolling contact interface in <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> mechanisms. Firstly, analytical method was introduced to understand the contact behaviors based on Hertz contact theory in a point-to-point way. Then, the finite element approach with a three-dimensional surface-to-surface contact model and appropriate contact stiffness was developed to study the dynamic characteristics of such linear guideways. Finally, experiments with modal test were conducted to verify the significance of both the analytical and the numerical results. Results told that the finite element approach may provide significant predictions. The study results also concluded that the current nonlinear models based on Hertz's contact theory may accurately describe the contact characteristic of a <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> mechanism. In the modal analysis, it {{was told that the}} natural frequencies vary a little with different loading conditions; however, the mode shapes are changed obviously with the magnitude of applied loads. Therefore, the stiffness of contact interface needs to be properly adjusted during simulation which may affect the dynamic characteristics of the machine tools...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the linear guideways is very extensive, such as automation equipment, heavy-duty carry equipment, heavy-cut machining tool, CNC grinding machine, large-scale planning machine and machining center with the demand of high rigidity and heavy load.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyse a drilling process of an automatic {{horizontal boring machine}} the SVD 2 for drilling of bearing holes. There were problems with vibrations during drilling process, causing an extreme noise and this dissertation solves them. First of all {{it was necessary to}} analyse the vibrations, to examine a machining process and measure machine dynamics and statics. Another task was to compare measured results with mathematical models and after their analysis to design structural and other solutions. The SVD 2 machine was designed {{on the basis of a}} previous type the SVD. Its conversion to a new one was based on adding of six spindles. As a result a number of drilled bodies was increased from one to four, so a performance was increased four times. That is why there was an original intention to rebuilt the other two spindle machines. To leave the basical parts of the machine without any modification (such as a reinforcement of a mount and adjusting of a bigger distance of a side linear spindle guideway and a cross <b>linear</b> <b>guideway</b> of a support for clamping devices), would be unsuitable solution, which was confirmed after a measurement and a following analysis...|$|E
40|$|Promising {{techniques}} such as micro-stereolithography (MSL) are opening up practical potential for exploiting new ideas for specialized polymer-based Micro-Electromechanical systems (MEMS) through small-batch production. As the field matures and grows, substantial research and commercial development demands better understanding of mechanical properties of MEMS materials to fully explore the potential of this technology. Bulk properties derived from conventional testing of large specimens (at 10 mm order) cannot be trusted. However, small-scale specimens (less than 1 mm) introduce major challenges, such as handling and mounting. The {{aim of this study}} was to contribute towards an improved understanding of the mechanical properties of the polymers (MSL materials) with a strong emphasis on developing new metrology. It proposed and described a special form of test-rig and compatible special MSL specimen design. A uniaxial tensile approach was chosen, partly because it offered simpler uncertainty models. The prototype used deadweight loading through a notch flexure, which acted both as a spring in parallel sharing the same displacement with the specimen and as a <b>linear</b> <b>guideway.</b> The specimen was integrally fabricated with large clamping regions and support bars released by cutting. Stiffly constrained mounting and loading surfaces were used to clamp MSL specimens to the flexure, protecting them against parasitic motions during the test in combination. Strain was measured through an elongation measurement by high-sensitivity capacitive micrometry, knowing the specimen dimensions. Verification tests on the clamping conditions showed no significant evidence of sudden slip or creep. MSL specimens were fabricated by a projection-based Envisiontec Perfactory system using a commercial acrylate-based R 11 resin. Substantial shrinkage and curl distortion had been observed, which greatly reduced the fabrication accuracy of the MSL specimens. Specimens with different UV exposures and different sizes were fabricated and tested for better understanding of the MSL fabrication process. Typically, Young’s Modulus was a little smaller than expected and certainly dependent on both size and process parameters (in the region studied) ...|$|E
