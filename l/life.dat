It is believed that a number of his compositions may have had their signature removed so that they could pass as works by Frans Snyders or his master Jan Fyt.

5|$|The earthly authority, whose {{words and}} actions should be cleaved to both in <b>life</b> (agriculture) and death (funerals), is called to minaa (an aluk priest).

The details of aluk may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and <b>life</b> rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with <b>life</b> rituals. The two rituals are equally important. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing <b>life</b> rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practised today, while <b>life</b> rituals have diminished.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of an internal global salty ocean with an aquatic environment supported by global ocean circulation patterns, with an energy source and simple organic compounds in contact with Enceladus's rocky core, may advance the study of astrobiology {{and the study of}} potentially habitable environments for microbial extraterrestrial <b>life.</b> The {{presence of}} a wide range of organic compounds and ammonia indicates their source may be similar to the water/rock reactions known to occur on Earth and that are known to support <b>life.</b> Therefore, several robotic missions have been proposed to further explore Enceladus and assess its habitability; some of the proposed missions are: Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), Enceladus Explorer (En-Ex), Enceladus <b>Life</b> Finder (ELF), <b>Life</b> Investigation For Enceladus (<b>LIFE),</b> and Enceladus <b>Life</b> Signatures and Habitability (ELSAH).|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal intrafascicular {{electrodes}} (<b>LIFEs)</b> are electrodes {{designed to}} be placed inside the peripheral nerve to improve stimulation selectivity and to increase the recording signal-to-noise ratio. We evaluated the functional and morphological effects of either Pt wire <b>LIFEs</b> or polyimide-based thin-film <b>LIFEs</b> implanted in the rat sciatic nerve for 3 mo. The newly designed thin-film <b>LIFEs</b> are more flexible, can be micromachined and allow placement of more active electrode sites than conventional Pt <b>LIFEs.</b> Functional results at 1 mo indicated an initial decline in the nerve conduction velocity and in the amplitude of muscle responses, which recovered during the following 2 mo towards normal values. Morphological results showed that both types of <b>LIFEs</b> induced a mild scar response and a focal but chronic inflammatory reaction, which were limited to a small area around the electrode placed in the nerve. Both types of <b>LIFEs</b> can be considered biocompatible and cause reversible, minimal nerve damage...|$|R
