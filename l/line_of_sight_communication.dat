Due to relatively low heights of the antennas, V 2 V {{communication is}} often influenced by topographic features, man-made structures, and other vehicles located between the communicating vehicles. On highways, {{it was shown}} experimentally that vehicles can obstruct the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (LOS) <b>communication</b> up to 50 % of the time; furthermore, a single obstructing vehicle can reduce the power at the receiver by more than 20 dB.

The idea is to generate a chaotic signal in the form of current and adding it to the message at the transmitter where the whole of this current drives an optical source-laser. At the receiver the same chaos signal is generated by prior synchronization. The received signal is photodetected to get the equivalent current.

Besides, wireless backhaul links like satellite and microwave are either expensive or require strict <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>communication</b> making them unattractive. TV white space channels with their desirable radio propagation characteristics can provide an excellent alternative for engineering backhaul networks in areas that lack abundant infrastructure. Specifically, TV white space channels can provide “free wireless backhaul pipes ” to transport aggregated traffic from broadband sources to fiber access points. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of multi-hop wireless backhaul in the available white space channels by using noncontiguous Orthogonal Frequency Divi-sion Multiple Access (NC-OFDMA) transmissions between fixed backhaul towers. Specifically, we consider joint power control, scheduling and routing strategies to maximize the minimum rate across broadband towers in the network. Depending on the population density and traffic demands of the location under consideration, we discuss the suitable choice of cell size for the backhaul network. Using the example of available TV white space channels in Wichita, Kansas (a small city located in central USA), we provide illustrative numerical examples for designing such wireless backhaul network.

Since the expansion of the traffic network is no longer a socially attainable solution, the existing control systems have to be used in a more intelligent way, in order to increase the traffic throughput and decrease total travel times. Intelligent transportation systems ITS had been developed to overcome the congestion problem, undertake to identify the real number of cars present in the street, but there is some limitation arises (existing of blind spots, counting the car more than one and such problems). So the necessity for smarter ITS technology based on an elegant way to identify the real number of cars is emerged via using RFID technology, Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a generic term that is used to describe a system that transmits the identity (in the form of a unique serial number) of an object wirelessly, using radio waves.

Applications of this work cover {{search and rescue}} for first responders, monitoring and surveillance, and infrastructure protection. We combine networking, sensing, and control to control the flow of information in search and rescue in unknown environments. Specifically, this research examines (1) localization in an environment with no infrastructure such as a burning building (for both sensors and robots) (2) information flow across a sensor network that can localize on the fly for delivering the most relevant and current information to its consumer, maintaining current maps, and automating localization; (3) using feedback from the sensor network to control the autonomous robots for placing sensors, collecting data from sensors, and locating targets; and (4) delivering the information gathered from the sensor network (integrated as a global picture) to human users. The paper will detail our technical results in these 4 areas and describe an integrated experiment for navigation in burning buildings...|$|R
