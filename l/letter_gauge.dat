UNIVERSIDAD SIMON BOLIVAR – 2 – The physical and mathematical properties of topological field theories have raised much interest in recent times (see for example Refs. [1 - 5]). In this letter we discuss an alternative approach {{for the construction of}} Witten’s Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) [1] using BRST techniques and starting from a new action principle different from the ones discussed in Refs. [2] and [3]. In Ref. [1] starting from a BRST-like supersymmetric principle Witten constructed a quantum effective action from which Donaldson invariants may be computed as correlation functions of adequatly choosen observables. In particular he showed, in the context of quantum field theory, the relation of Floer homology and Donaldson invariants. Specifically the topological invariant path integral formula he obtained was Z(γ 1, · · ·, γN) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sir Ernest Gowers, {{a senior}} civil servant, {{was among those}} who wished to see officialese {{replaced}} by normal English. In 1929 he remarked in a speech about the civil service, [...] "It is said... that we revel in jargon and obscurity". During the Second World War, with the role of government greatly expanded, official communications proliferated, and in Gowers's view were full of [...] "mistiness and grandiloquence". He called for a new style of official writing, friendly in tone and easy to understand. His views came to the notice of the head of the civil service, Sir Edward Bridges, permanent secretary to the Treasury. After Gowers retired from the civil service {{at the end of the}} war, Bridges asked him to write a short pamphlet on good writing, for the benefit of the new generation of officials. Bridges called on his senior colleagues throughout the civil service to cooperate; some had already made efforts in the same cause, including the Inland Revenue, whose advice to staff included [...] "one golden rule to bear in mind always: that we should try to put ourselves in the position of our correspondent, to imagine his feelings as he writes his <b>letters,</b> and to <b>gauge</b> his reaction as he receives ours." ...|$|R

PowellThe World Health Organization {{estimates}} {{that up to}} 30 % of individuals in developed countries become ill from food or water each year, with up to 70 % of these illnesses estimated {{to be linked to}} food service. Restaurant inspections aim to prevent restaurant-associated foodborne outbreaks while enhancing consumer confidence in the safety of food prepared in these establishments. Inspection disclosure systems have been developed as a tool for consumers and incentive for foodservice operators. Disclsosure systems are common in developed countries; however, they are inconsistent. Previous research has not determined the best format to disclose inspection results to the public while providing incentives for operators. This research aimed to develop a consistent, compelling and trusted disclosure system for New Zealand. The research evaluated existing disclosure systems operating internationally and nationally. The national review interviewed with Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) (n= 8), operators (n= 109) and consumers (n= 244), and findings were used for card designs. Cards were evaluated internally (n= 43), then by 11 focus groups (n= 68). Two cards, <b>letter</b> and <b>gauge,</b> were introduced to food premises (n= 371) in six districts for three months for evaluation. Operators (n= 269) and consumers (n= 991) were interviewed to determine which design best communicated inspection results. The majority of operators indicated they had not received consumer feedback about the card, and half felt the card was something consumers would use. Less than half of consumers indicated they noticed cards prior to entering a premises; from these data it appeared the letter attracted more initial attention (78 % of respondents) than the gauge (45 %). Consumers indicated card placement was an important factor in noticing cards. Nearly all interviewed consumers indicated they expected cards at restaurants, take-aways and fish n’ chips shops. When asked which card they preferred, 58 % (n= 38) of operators with the gauge preferred the letter; and 79 % (n= 47) of operators with the letter preferred the letter. Consumer preference was for the letter, with 88 % (n= 133) of those in gauge districts preferring the letter, and 72 % (n= 161) of those in letter districts preferring the letter. Based on these data the letter card was recommended for a national inspection disclosure system for New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Reducing a 3 -dimensional Chern–Simons term by a {{symmetry}} yields other topologically interesting structures. Specifically, reducing by radial symmetry {{results in}} a 1 -dimensional quantum mechanical model, which has recently been used {{in an analysis of}} finite-temperature Chern–Simons theory. The radially symmetric expression may be inserted into 3 -dimensional monopole or (2 + 1) -dimensional instanton equations, where it eliminates the monopole or instanton solutions. Submitted to Physics <b>Letters</b> B The <b>gauge</b> dependence of the induced Chern–Simons term at finite temperature has been recently explained [1, 2]. Original calculations seemed to indicate that the magnitude of this topological entity varies smoothly with temperature [3], contradicting the integrality of the Chern–Simons coefficient, as is required in the quantum theory by gauge invariance [4]. The puzzle became resolved once it was realized that finite-temperature calculations to fixed perturbative order (like the original ones [3]) necessarily violate gauge invariance, which is restored only after all orders are summed. (At zero temperature, finite order calculations suffice to exhibit the complete, induced Chern–Simons term [4, 5].) The all-order summation was first accomplished in a toy quantum mechanical model, which had been introduced a decade earlier for the purpose of exhibiting in a simple setting some of the peculiar topological/geometrical effects of quantized Chern–Simons theory [6]. In this Letter, we demonstrate that this model is not merely a pedagogical toy; in fact it coincides with the three-dimensional Chern–Simons term, reduced by spherical symmetry. This work is supported in part by funds provided by the U. S. Department of Energy (D. O. E.) under contract #DE-FC 02 - 94 ER 40818 and under contract #DE-FG 02 - 91 ER 40676.
