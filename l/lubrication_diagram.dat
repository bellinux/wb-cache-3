40|$|The {{relationship}} between a <b>Lubrication</b> Mode <b>Diagram</b> (LMD) for concentrated contacts (LCC's) and the IRG transition diagram has been studied. In addition, scuffing results, obtained by the IRG (International Research Group) have been analysed, {{as well as the}} results of scuffing tests performed by different workers using a two-disc apparatus. It has been found that in Region I of the IRG transition diagram, three sub-regions can be distinguished, representing elastohydrodynamic lubrication, mixed lubrication, and boundary lubrication, respectively. Thus, the IRG transition diagram is not comparable to a <b>lubrication</b> mode <b>diagram.</b> Furthermore, it has been found that failure of LCC's by scuffing most frequently occurs under conditions of mixed lubrication. Therefore, scuffing criteria based upon the assumption that the load at failure is carried entirely by the micro-contacts are doubtful, and probably wrong...|$|R
