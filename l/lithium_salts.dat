5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other <b>lithium</b> <b>salts</b> with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple <b>lithium</b> <b>salts</b> are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E

5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that <b>lithium</b> <b>salts</b> give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

While the citrate, carbonate, and orotate salts are {{currently}} used to treat bipolar disorder, other <b>lithium</b> <b>salts</b> including the chloride were used in the past.

25|$|The {{concentration}} of butyllithium in commercially available solutions tends to decrease {{over time as}} the BuLi reacts with air. Subsequently, butyllithium is often titrated prior to use to ascertain its true concentration. The BuLi is added to a known amount of a weakly acidic compound, such as an alcohol. Because butyllithium is a strong base, it quickly and quantitatively reacts with weak acids to give the corresponding <b>lithium</b> <b>salts</b> and butane. An indicator, such as 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine, is commonly used to signal the endpoint of the titration. Both compounds form colored complexes with butyllithium once the titrant is consumed.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>lithium</b> <b>salts,</b> {{which can}} be {{produced}} in LiH reactions, are toxic. LiH fire should not be extinguished using carbon dioxide, carbon tetrachloride, or aqueous fire extinguishers; they should be smothered by covering with a metal object or graphite or dolomite powder. Sand is less suitable, as it can explode when mixed with burning LiH, especially if not dry. LiH is normally transported in oil, using containers made of ceramic, certain plastics or steel, and is handled {{in an atmosphere of}} dry argon or helium. Nitrogen can be used, but not at elevated temperatures, as it reacts with lithium. LiH normally contains some metallic lithium, which corrodes steel or silica containers at elevated temperatures.|$|E
500|$|The {{demand for}} lithium {{increased}} dramatically during the Cold War {{with the production}} of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful {{for the production of}} tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid 1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some [...] "natural sources" [...] of lithium ion which had been [...] "contaminated" [...] by <b>lithium</b> <b>salts</b> discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.|$|E
