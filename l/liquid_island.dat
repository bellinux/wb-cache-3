40|$|The {{impact of}} vapor {{diffusion}} {{and its potential}} enhancement are of concern {{with respect to the}} performance of the potential nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Under non-isothermal conditions, such as those prevailing in the near-field environment, gas-phase diffusion of water vapor (a condensable component) may be enhanced as compared to isothermal conditions. Two main phenomena are responsible for this enhancement (Philip and DeVries 1957, p. 226). Normally, diffusive transport of water vapor is obstructed by the presence of liquid islands in the pore throats, and diffusion is reduced at higher saturations. However, under a thermal gradient, a vapor-pressure gradient develops in the gas phase, causing water to evaporate {{from one side of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>island</b> and to diffuse in the gas phase to a <b>liquid</b> <b>island</b> of lower temperature, where it condenses (Figure 1). Water flows through the <b>liquid</b> <b>island</b> as a result of differences in meniscus curvature between the two sides. This difference is caused by the temperature gradient between the liquid-vapor interfaces on the two ends of the <b>liquid</b> <b>island.</b> The evaporation-condensation process repeats itself on the other side of the liquid island; the result is an enhanced diffusive flux through the medium...|$|E
40|$|Vapor {{diffusion}} in porous {{media in}} the presence of its own liquid may be enhanced due to pore-scale processes, such as condensation and evaporation across isolated liquid islands. Webb and Ho (1997) developed a mechanistic pore-scale model of these processes under steady-state conditions in which condensation and evaporation on the <b>liquid</b> <b>island</b> were equal. The vapor diffusion rate was significantly enhanced by these <b>liquid</b> <b>island</b> processes by up to an order of magnitude compared to a dry porous media. However, vapor transport by diffusion is often complicated by transient effects, such as in drying applications, in which net evaporation of liquid may further augment the vapor flux from diffusion. The influence of transient effects on the enhancement factors for vapor diffusion is evaluated in this paper. In addition, the effect of vapor pressure lowering on the enhancement factor and on porescale vapor fluxes is shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundary}} {{that separates}} the earth from the atmosphere is a crucial zone of study for meteorology and hydrology. Here, solar energy is partitioned into sensible heat which drives atmospheric circulation, latent heat needed for evaporation from the soil and transpiration of vegetation, and soil heat which warms the subsurface. Precipitation is partitioned into interception that evaporates directly into the atmosphere, surface runoff that discharges quickly into water courses and infiltration which resides longer in the subsurface. Soil moisture influences all these processes and is therefore considered a key variable in land-atmosphere interaction. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the heat and water balance of topsoil, observations are key, but challenging with in situ point sensors. Recent rapid developments in remote sensing have tremendously increased our ability to observe the boundary between soil and atmosphere. Retrieving state variables such as soil temperature and moisture from remote sensing is far from trivial: detected signals originate not only from the soil, but also from the atmosphere and vegetation, the depth of the detection is a function of the soil moisture itself, and pixels are large and heterogeneous. Field validation is difficult, because of scale disparity between in situ point sensors and remote sensing pixels. Still, given the limitations, remote sensing provides an opportunity to improve understanding of heat and moisture transfer in the topsoil. The central question of this research is: What can be learnt from (remote sensing) observations about the heat and moisture balance of the topsoil? First a cross validation of different soil moisture products based on remote sensing was performed to investigate similarities and differences between these products. The differences were significant and could be attributed to differences in land use and vegetation, but not fully explained. This illustrated that retrieval algorithms for soil moisture are far from converged. One prerequisite for improving retrieval algorithms is ground truth, ground observations at scales relevant for remote sensing. Second, a field technique was developed that can potentially be used for bridging the observation gap between point sensors and remote sensing pixels. This technique uses Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) over horizontal extents up to kilometers to infer soil moisture at this intermediate scale. Propagation of variations in atmospheric temperature and radiation with depth is a function of soil moisture. By using DTS observations at three depths, it is possible to infer soil moisture, assuming that heat conduction is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. The heat diffusion equation is inverted to obtain estimates of soil heat diffusivity and soil moisture. Since this technique relies on observations of the passive thermal response of the soil to atmospheric temperature and radiation variations, this technique is called passive SoilDTS in contrast to active soil DTS, which relies on active heat pulses. The feasibility of passive SoilDTS for soil moisture estimation was asserted in a field experiment conducted in Monster in the Netherlands. The analysis of the experimental results of this feasibility study pointed out a number of technical and modeling issues that needed to be investigated further in order for passive SoilDTS to be used for soil moisture estimation and scaling. Some soil moisture estimates were not reasonable due to uncertainties in cable depths and heat transfer mechanisms. To separate the technical issue of cable depth from the modeling challenges, the same methodology used to infer soil moisture from passive SoilDTS was applied to profile data of temperature and soil moisture obtained with point sensors. The depth of these point sensors could be determined with far greater accuracy than the cable depth. Analysis of the point observations challenged the common assumption that conduction is the dominant heat transfer mechanism in soil. Evaporation seemed to play a dominant role in heat transfer on dry days. Yet evaporation rates found were higher than would be expected if mass diffusion would be the dominant transfer mechanism of water vapor. Vapor diffusion appeared to be enhanced. Enhancement of vapor diffusion is a long-studied phenomenon, subject to debate on the explanations of underlying mechanism. In an extensive literature review on vapor enhancement in soils, the plausibility of various mechanisms was assessed. We reviewed mechanisms based on (combinations of) diffusive, viscous, buoyant, capillary and external pressure forces including: thermodiffusion, dispersion, Stefan’s flow, Knudsen diffusion, <b>liquid</b> <b>island</b> effect, hydraulic lift, free convection, double diffusive convection and forced convection. The analysis of the order of magnitude of the mechanisms based on first principles clearly distinguishes between plausible and implausible mechanisms. Thermodiffusion, Stefan’s flow, Knudsen effects, liquid islands do not significantly contribute to enhanced evaporation. Double diffusive convection seemed unlikely due to lack of experimental evidence, but could not be completely excluded from the list of potential mechanisms. Hydraulic lift, the mechanism that small capillaries lift liquid water to the surface where it evaporates, does significantly contribute to enhanced evaporation from soils, also from dryer soils. The experimental evidence for and the theoretical underpinnings of this mechanism are convincing. However, we sought mechanisms that both explain enhanced evaporation and steep temperature gradients in the soil during the daytime. These often observed gradients consist of a sharp decrease of temperature with a depth up to the depth of the evaporation front. Hydraulic lift cannot explain this because the evaporation front is located at the surface. One remaining mechanism is forced convection due to atmospheric pressure fluctuations, also referred to as wind pumping. Wind pumping causes displacement and flow velocities too small for significant convective and too small for significant dispersive transport, when steady state dispersion formulations are used. However, experiments do indicate significant dispersive transport that can be explained by dispersion under unsteady flow conditions. Forced convection due to pressure fluctuations seems to be the only mechanism that can explain both enhanced evaporation and the steep temperature gradients. We investigated under which conditions wind pumping can enhance water vapor transfer from the soil to the atmosphere and which mechanisms are responsible for this enhancement in a modeling study. Previous models of wind pumping relied on enhanced transfer due to enhanced mixing described with empirical macroscopic dispersion coefficients with weak physical foundations. We searched for better understanding of physical mechanisms driving enhanced mixing. With combination of order of magnitude analysis, phenomenological, empirical and analytical models, mechanisms were investigated. A model for surface pressure fluctuations was coupled with a pressure diffusion model, a pore flow velocity model and a dispersion model. Based on this coupled model, we propose that the enhancement is caused by mixing at the pore level due to flow instabilities. Fast pressure fluctuations at the soil-air interface make vortices in the soil unstable. Instabilities arise when the timescale of the pressure fluctuations is close to the timescale of viscous dissipation which is related to the pore size. In this case, vortices in the soil cannot increase, decrease and turn direction, in phase with the pressure fluctuations and instabilities occur in the form of ejections. The ejections of vortices enhance mixing and transport. Timescales of wind induced pressure fluctuations and pore sizes are such that this mechanism is considered likely in soils. Further research is needed to prove this mechanism and quantify it. The developed model is a hypothesis and should be tested with numerical and laboratory experiments. For estimating the effect of this vapor enhancement on the soil heat budget, a coupled heat and moisture transfer model should be developed. Such a model could also shed light on the relative importance of hydraulic lift and wind pumping for evaporation rates. Perhaps, because the topsoil forms the boundary between land and atmosphere, but also between two disciplines meteorology and hydrology, there are still many questions that remain about heat and moisture transfer in the upper few centimeters of the soil. Remote sensing soil moisture retrievals force the scientific community to revisit our understanding of the topsoil. As a result, remote sensing presents not only a challenge for ground validation, but also an opportunity for hydrological and meteorological model improvement.

40|$|Vapor {{diffusion}} in porous {{media in}} the presence of its liquid has often been analyzed like air diffusion. The diffusion rate is much lower than in free space due to the presence of the porous medium and any liquid present. However, enhanced vapor diffusion has also been postulated such that the diffusion rate may approach free-space values. The mechanisms postulated to lead to this enhancement include condensation/evaporation across isolated <b>liquid</b> <b>islands</b> in the porous media and an increased temperature gradient in the gas phase. In order to try to understand the mechanisms involved in such an enhancement, pore-scale models have been developed. Vapor diffusion {{in the presence of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>islands</b> has been evaluated for a one-dimensional pore network under a concentration gradient. The simulations show that significant enhancement of vapor diffusion is indeed possible in the presence of <b>liquid</b> <b>islands,</b> while air diffusion decreases slightly.

40|$|The drying of liquid-saturated porous {{media is}} {{typically}} approached using macroscopic continuum models involving phenomenological coefficients. Insight on these coefficients {{can be obtained}} by a more fundamental study at the pore- and pore-network levels. In this paper, we present a model based on a pore-network representation of porous media that accounts for various processes at the pore-scale. These include mass transfer by advection and diffusion in the gas phase, viscous flow in liquid and gas phases and capillary effects at the gas-liquid menisci in the pore throats. We consider isothermal drying in a rectilinear horizontal geometry, with no-how conditions in all but one boundary, at which a purge gas is injected at a constant rate. The problem is mainly characterized by two dimensionless parameters, a diffusion-based capillary number, Ca, and a Peclet number, Pe, in addition to the various geometrical parameters of the pore network. Results on the evolution of the liquid saturation, the trapped <b>liquid</b> <b>islands</b> and the drying rate are obtained as a function of time and the dimensionless parameters. The importance of trapped <b>liquid</b> <b>islands</b> on screening mass transfer to the continuous liquid cluster is emphasized. For fixed parameter values, the drying front does not in general obey invasion percolation rules. However, as drying progresses, and depending on the relative magnitude of the capillary and Peclet numbers, a transition to a percolation-controlled problem occurs. Effects of capillarity and mass transfer on Saturation profiles and drying rates are discussed. The results are then used to discuss upscaling to continuum models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Previously, {{diffraction}} {{transmission and}} {{scanning electron microscopy}} methods and probe microanalysis {{were used for the}} examination of melts of indium, gallium and tin. Examination by direct methods (in-situ) showed that the pre-melting stages characterised by spontaneous fragmentation of crystal grains into extremely fine elements. To some extent, this process is similar to the multiple nucleation of dislocation groups and maybe associated with the cascade-like increase of the number of bifurcations of the crystal potential in the pre-melting stage. Examination of the melts of indium and tin in <b>liquid</b> <b>islands</b> showed the presence of a crystalline phase with a size of #approx# 2. 5 nm. The second component of the liquid was found {{in the form of an}} amorphous film up to 3 nm thick. These results were used to formulate a new model of the liquid state. It is assumed that high superheating above the Debye temperature results in the formation of fluctuation waves of anomalous cooperative displacement of the atoms in crystals, as in the case of displacement detected in the stage of pre-transition processes. These anomalous displacements are possible as an alternative of thermal stresses of shear. In the Debye approximation for aluminium at room temperature they appear to be #approx# 175 kg/mm" 2. The self-organisation of the fluctuation displacement waves maybe regarded as the process of formation of a dissipative structure (DS), utilising the thermal energy of the crystal. It is assumed that the elements of the dissipative structure maybe represented by various defects of the crystal structure. Thus, the metallic melt is represented by a colloidal mixture inherited from the grains. As a result of the formation of a stable DS which consists of the several level of mosaic structure and 'divides' the crystal to mutually vibrating fragments, the crystals of the grains have the yielding property. The results of direct examination of the melting phases of indium, gallium and tin confirm the basic assumptions of this model. These metals have the well-known special features of the structure of the valency band, formed from electrons of s, p symmetry. In order to explain the special features of the application of these considerations to other elements, in this work, investigations were carried out into copper specimens whose valency band consists mostly of d-electrons (for the atom 3 d" 1 " 04 s" 1) Translated from Russian (Fiz.

40|$|International audienceThe {{early stage}} of 3 C-SiC {{nucleation}} and islands enlargement on on-axis 6 H-SiC(000 (1) over bar) (C face) were studied by changing the conditions of interaction of a Si(0. 25) Ge(0. 75) melt with the SiC substrate. After changing the temperature or the plateau duration at a fixed temperature, evolution in terms of shapes and sizes of the 3 C-SiC islands was found. The observed islands enlargement in the {{early stage of}} interaction was explained by taking into account a carbon transport from the graphite crucible to the seed. Once the crucible reached its thermal and thermodynamical equilibrium with the <b>liquid,</b> the <b>islands</b> started to be dissolved inside the melt due to a possible but small thermal gradient from the seed (hotter) to the sidewalls of the crucible (colder). By adding propane in the gas phase before reaching this equilibrium, SiC growth by vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism was achieved and the 3 C-SiC layers thus obtained were always found to contain a high density of twins. This is {{probably due to the}} fact that the density of 3 C nuclei, after interaction between the SiGe melt and the SiC seed, was always very high which should prevent orientation selection, unlike the case of Si face.

40|$|This paper adresses the hygric {{behaviour}} {{of ceramic}} and calcium silicate brick {{treated with a}} water repellent oligomeric alkyl-alkoxysilane. Although the hydrophobic treatment succesfully blocks capillary effects, diffusion-adsorption processes of water molecules into the hydrophobic treated material still can take place. This process determines the particular hygric behaviour of hydrophobic treated materials. First, the contact angle of a drop deposited on an hydrophobic surface changes continuously over time due to absorption {{of water from the}} droplet into the hydrophobic material. This absorption process is found to be drop-size dependent. As a result large droplets, that remain on the hydrophobic surface for a longer time, are preferentially used to accurately measure the contact angle. Second, the water vapour permeability can decrease substantially due to clogging of connective pores caused by the hydrophobic treatment. Porous building materials showing an important midsize pore system within the length of the polymer chains are very sensitive to clogging of connective pores and therefore susceptible to an important increase in water vapour transmission resistance. Due to micro-droplet and water island formation on the hydrophobic network, the water vapour permeability increases with relative humidity. Finally, liquid water break-through in hydrophobic treated cracks is explained in view of microdroplet and water forming process in the crack. When <b>liquid</b> water <b>islands</b> become connected in the crack, capillary forces arise leading to the break-through...|$|R
