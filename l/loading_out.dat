[...] This was the first time DJ locomotives had operated to Roxburgh. [...] By late June 1968 there was considerable removed material at Roxburgh yard ready for <b>loading</b> <b>out</b> by train. Hut accommodation for demolition workers, removal equipment such as bulldozers and a mobile crane on crawlers were transported to Roxburgh by a DJ hauled train on 2 July 1968. A temporary railway Hut compound was established on the Roxburgh station platform for the accommodation of some of the demolition men. [...] Mains power to the Huts, which were individually wired for electricity, was sourced from the electric power lines at Roxburgh station yard. The idea was that these temporary Huts were to be railed down to Millers Flat as the next demolition base just before the main line rail track had been fully removed from Roxburgh. At the time there was some significant concern reported in the media (and up to Ministerial level) as to why these men had been not able to use the Roxburgh Railway houses, which by now were mostly empty, rather than the expense of establishing the temporary railway workers Hut compound at Roxburgh. However, as explained by Railways at the time, this was impractical as the Huts would be needed anyway as demolition progressed further down the line and so portable accommodation was optimum and in the long run cheaper than furnishing railway houses at Roxburgh for temporary demolition gangs that would be there a few short weeks. By 19 July 1968, the yard track, main line track past the station platform [...] and turntable at Roxburgh had been removed and cleared out. [...] Men had been recruited from Winter Employment schemes and the mobile crane lifted complete track sets onto flat top wagons for transporting out. During demolition DSA class locomotives worked at the railhead shuttling empty and loaded wagons from and to the nearest exchange siding (the nearest intact station yard) on the branch whilst DJ locomotives periodically cleared out materials removed from that nearest railhead back down the branch to the Main South Line as removal progressed. Track sets were railed to either of Manuka station further down the branch for temporary storage or to Kakapuaka station south of Balclutha on the Main South Line where further Winter Employment Scheme men were employed dismantling these removed track sets. [...] By mid November 1968 removal was approaching the 40 mile peg, about five miles north of Beaumont (in the Beaumont gorge between Craig Flat and Beaumont). Work then ceased due to a labour shortage as seasonal workers went back to work in local freezing works. A weed spray train ran as far as Beaumont on Monday 11 November 1968, which by then has its all train stop board at 34 miles 37 chains, between Craigellachie and Beaumont (the line from here to the end of rails near the 40 mile peg being worked as an extended Way and Works siding).

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the design}} process of {{membrane}} structure to resist to high pressure loading, and the characterization of hyperelastic material, a structure made up of thin rubber undergoes large deformation and rotation under high pressure <b>loading</b> <b>out</b> of high pressurized gas. Until recently, to simulate the inflation of the hyperelastic membrane, a uniform pressure based on thermodynamic model or experimental tests {{is applied to the}} structure, as boundary conditions. From a computational time point of view, this approach is very fast, since no computational fluid dynamics is involved in the simulation. However, at the late stage of the membrane inflation, uniform pressure simulations lead to numerical instability {{due to the lack of}} fluid that generates damping effects and prevent numerical instability. Thus the uniform pressure assumption is unstable at the end phase of the inflation for long time duration. To simulate accurately the inflation process, computational fluid dynamics in a moving fluid domain as well as fluid structure interaction (FSI) algorithms need to be performed for accurate pressure prediction and fluid structure interface coupling. For the simulation of gas dynamic in a moving domain, Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation is used. Both simulations, uniform pressure and ALE simulation for computational gas dynamics, were compared to test data, indicating satisfactory results in terms of correlation for earlier stage of the inflation. However for late stage inflation, simulation using uniform pressure show numerical instability leading to the blow up of the structure. With the more recently developed procedure, ALE theory, shows the greatest accuracy, both in terms of graphical and schematic comparison, especially at the late stage of the inflation process. As a result, the new simulation procedure model can be utilised to research into the effects of changing the designs of the membrane structure to resist to highly pressure loading on soft rubber material...|$|E
40|$|Tilting ducted fans {{present a}} {{solution}} for the lifting and forward flight propulsion requirements of VTOL aircraft. However, the geometry of the duct enshrouding the propeller has great a effect on {{the efficiency of the}} fan in various flight modes. Shroud geometry controls the velocity and pressure at the face of the fan, while maintaining a finite <b>loading</b> <b>out</b> at the tips of the fan blades. A duct tailored for most efficient generation of static lifting thrust will generally suffer from performance deficiencies in forward flight. The converse is true as well, leaving the designer with a difficult trade affecting the overall performance and sizing of the aircraft. Ideally, the shroud of a vertical lifting fan features a generous bell mouth inlet promoting acceleration of flow into the face of the fan, and terminating in a converging nozzle at the exit. Flow entering the inlet is accelerated into the fan by the circulation about the shroud, resulting in an overall increase in thrust compared to an open propeller operating under the same conditions. The accelerating shroud design is often employed in lifting ducted fans to benefit from the thrust augmentation; however, such shroud designs produce significant drag penalties in axial flight, thus are unsuitable for efficient forward flight applications. Decelerating, or diffusing, duct designs are employed for higher speed forward flight configurations. The lower circulation on the shroud tends to decelerate the flow into the face of the fan, which is detrimental to static thrust development; however, net thrust is developed on the shroud while the benefits of finite blade loading are retained. With judicious shroud design for intended flight speeds, a net increase in efficiency can be obtained over an open propeller. In this experiment, conducted under contract to NASA LaRC (contract NAG- 1 - 02093) circulation control is being applied to a mildly diffusing shroud design, intended for improved forward flight performance, to generate circulation in the sense of an accelerating duct design. The intent is to improve static thrust performance of a ducted fan tailored for high speed axial flight, {{while at the same time}} significantly reduce the pressure signature on the ground plane. Circulation control on the fan shroud is achieved by the Coanda effect...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka {{being an}} island state, {{strategically}} {{located in the}} Indian Ocean, has a high potential for the developments of its economy in the coastal zone. During the reason past, there have been major development projects undertaken by the Government of Sri Lanka including the developments of ports, tourism industry and urban development. At the same time, {{it must be noted}} and recognised that the coastal zones are environmentally very sensitive and have to be conserved in order for well-being of unique coastal eco-system, This conflict between development and conservation has raised major issues among the environmental protectionist. Such groups have raised concerns of the impacts of development project on the coastal zone. Although many coastal region development projects have been undertaken, hardly any project has been monitored to study its impact on the environment. In this respect, planned monitoring of Colombo South Harbour (CSH) project, one of the largest engineering projects to be undertaken in Sri Lanka, provided an excellent opportunity to study the impacts arising from appreciable disturbances to the seabed and neighbouring regions. The analysis of this monitoring, which is the major part of this research study identifies the extent of impact arising from mega coastal projects. Both CSH and associated <b>Loading</b> <b>Out</b> Point (LOP) at Wadduwa have therefore been considered, In addition, it focused on the Kirinda Fishery Harbour project, which failed in the first instances as well as after rehabilitation. The impact on vessels manoeuvring during extreme hazardous condition was investigated via the case study of Shimoda port Japan, undertaken by the researcher during a training programme at Port and Airport Research Institute, Japan. From this research study, it is concluded that no significant coastal environment impacts are raised due to CSH project as far as sea water quality, air quality and suspended particles levels are concerned. However, threshold values for noise levels were frequently exceeded at quarry site. Further, LOP at Wadduwa indicated severe erosion at northern sections, and significant accumulation at southern sections. Observed data and calculations revealed that with the beach nourishment, for duration of a month, still amount of over 900 m 3 of volume for a stretch of 50 m along the coastline, eroded around 0 + 150 N to 0 + 500 N and the value decreases to 250 m 3 around 0 + 750 N to 0 + 900 N. From the results of numerical simulations for drifting bodies at Shimoda port, specific locations were identified as the safest and most suitable locations to be developed for berth and moor purposes at Shimoda port minimizing the intensity and probability of collision hazard. It is expected that detailed research studies will high-light the extent of impacts on the coastal zone of large civil engineering projects which interact with coastal water. Such interaction includes dredging, reclamation, construction of major coastal works, and its impact on livelihood of the coastal community during and after construction. In the absence of detailed monitoring during and after construction, one would only speculate the long term impacts without cross comparison with prevalent condition away from projects...|$|E
