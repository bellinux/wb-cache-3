40|$|Cation {{conductance}} and efflux {{induced by}} polyene antibiotics amphotericin B (AMB), amphotericin B methyl ester (AME), nystatin, mycoheptin, and <b>levorin</b> on frog isolated skeletal muscle fibers and whole sartorius muscles were investigated. Conductance was measured under current-clamp conditions using a double sucrose-gap technique. Cation efflux was studied using flame emission photometry. Some new {{data were obtained}} concerning the effects of <b>levorin</b> and mycoheptin on biological membranes. The power dependence of polyene-induced cation transport on antibiotic concentration in muscle membrane was lower than that in bilayers. The decline in the equilibrium conductance caused by polyene removal (except for <b>levorin)</b> was very fast. There was reverse temperature dependence of AMB- and nystatin-induced conductances. Both induced conductance and efflux values demonstrated a correlation with the order of antifungal activities: <b>levorin</b> > AMB, mycoheptin > AME > nystatin, except for AME, which was more potent on yeastlike cells. These effects were interpreted in terms of possible differences in the kinetics of channel formation in biological and model membranes and {{in light of the}} role of nonconducting antibiotic forms in biological membranes...|$|E
40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} the genetic activity of the polyene antibiotics, nistatine, <b>levorin,</b> <b>levorin</b> A_ 2, amphotericine B and newly synthesized derivatives of amphotericine B, combined action of antibiotic and mutagene, aplication of the antibiotic together with the antimutagenes. The mutagene activity 9 antibiotics (<b>levorin,</b> <b>levorin</b> A_ 2, amphotericine B and 6 its new derivatives) performed on a welsh onion and intestinal rod has been established for metamphocine and carbamphocine in the animals cells; the mytodepressive effect in the cells of plants for the levorine, amphotericine B, metamphocine, carbamphocine has been detected; the ability of peroxidasa to reduce the induced polyene antibiotics mutability of chromosomes has also been established. The genetic schedule for using the polyene antibiotics has been offered, the method of preventing from the peroxidase mutability of the induced polene antibiotic has been developed. The base for neutralization of the mutagene and cytotoxic effects of antibiotics in the fermentative regulation of the mutability and using the peroxidase as the antimutagene preparation. The subject of introduction: the method of prevention from the mutagene and cytotoxic effects.

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: culture Streptomyces levoris (78 pcs), the {{producer}} of the <b>levorin</b> antibiotics. The purpose of the work: studying {{the influence of the}} two-phase cultivation on the morphological and physiologo-biochemical characteristics of culture Str. levoris. The new method of the deep cultivation Str. levoris in the two-phase system water medium - paraffin has been developed. The ability of the mycelium to immobilize itself on the drops of the organic fluid has been detected. The influence of the two-phase cultivation on the variation of the medium substrates consumption has been revealed. The connection between the emulsion disperseness and the culture breathing activity structure has been established. The application of the two-phase cultivation method for Str. levoris has allowed to increase the output of the <b>levorin</b> antibiotics by 30 % as compared with the control. Established has been the property of the two-phase cultivation to restore the culture activity, being lost during storage. The new unit for measuring the intensity of the microorganisms breathing at the deep cultivation has been offered. The field of application: the biotechnology, the technology of receiving the biologically active substancesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{study of}} 7 drugs {{was carried out}} in {{patients}} with benign prostatic hypertrophy. The 7 drugs were chlormadinone acetate (CMA), TSAA- 291, medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA), allylestrenol (AE), polyene macrolide (<b>Levorin,</b> PM), Paraprost (PPC) and Eviprostat (EP). Its clinical evaluation was made by subjective symptoms, measurement of residual urine, rectal palpation of the prostate and urethrography. PM was effective to the improvement of subjective symptoms and all evaluated items. Judging from the degree of lowering of bladder base in urethrography, improvement in CMA group was significantly better than that in other 7 groups. Literatures regarding the medical treatment in benign prostatic hypertrophy were reviewed...|$|E
