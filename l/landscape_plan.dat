Saville, Inc., dated September 15, 1926. In 1928, Virginia Weddell requested that a two-story porch be added to expand the master bedroom suite and to build a second-floor sunroom. This was constructed in January 1932 by the contracting firm of Claiborne and Taylor, and was designed again by Henry Morse using Briar Hill sandstone.

Thicker, heavier and lighter in color than Virginia Buckingham Slate, the Cotswold slate was used to emphasize the height of the steep roof.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{similarities}} between green infrastructure and the German <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> {{can be found}} in comparing the approaches of the two planning instruments. Principles of green infrastructure such as multifunctionality, the multi-scale approach and connectivity show correspondences with <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> elements. However, some differences are apparent. The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine whether the main aims of these two frameworks overlap. It also seeks to deduce what benefits from ecosystem services could be provided by integrating the green infrastructure approach into the German <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> system. The results show that the green infrastructure concept is not well-known in German planning practice, although its principles are generally implemented through traditional <b>landscape</b> <b>planning.</b> Nevertheless, green infrastructure could act as a supplementary approach to current <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> practices by improving public acceptance and strengthening the social focus of the current <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> system...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>landscape</b> <b>plan</b> for Capitol Hill {{surrounding}} {{the capitol building}} was originally designed by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted in 1889. [...] The grounds of Capitol Hill were surrounded by a cast iron fence from the 19th century into {{the first decades of}} the 20th. [...] It was later removed and reused to enclose the Old Augusta Cemetery on Wares Ferry Road. [...] The grounds still contain many trees and scrubs from the Olmsted design, in addition to numerous monuments. [...] Other major features of the grounds include the marble steps leading to the front portico, the Confederate Memorial Monument and the Avenue of Flags. [...] Statuary on the capitol grounds includes Albert Patterson (1961), Duty Called (1986) by Branko Medenica, James Marion Sims (1939) by Biancio Melarango, Jefferson Davis (1940) by Frederick Cleveland Hibbard, John Allan Wyeth (1920s) by Gutzon Borglum, and Joseph Lister Hill (1969) by Gualberto Rocchi.|$|E

This remaining section of the original cemetery contains about 2,000 tombstones and other memorials and monuments of which many came from the resumed area outside the wall. Many of the monuments were erected to families or individuals who are famous for their part in the history of 19th-century Australia. The monuments are mostly in Sydney sandstone, predating the fashion for marble memorials. A small number of the later monuments are in marble or granite. One of the largest memorials, that to the Barker family, was brought from Scotland. About 90% of the monuments are the work of a local mason, John Roote Andrews, and his family. Within Camperdown Cemetery stand the Cemetery Lodge (1848), St Stephen's Anglican Church (1871–78), and the St Stephen's Rectory (1910).|$|E

40|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>planning</b> is an {{approach}} to planning land use based on analysis of physical, biological, cultural, and aesthetic resources. Its aim is creative resolution of land use conflicts {{through the development of}} physical plans. These plans result from synthesis of scientific analyses produced by specialists from multiple disciplines and from reconciliation of the interests of different user groups. <b>Landscape</b> <b>planning</b> developed primarily as a specialty area within landscape architecture in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Its most recognized practitioner was Ian McHarg, author of the influential book Design With Nature (1969). ^ Thirty years ago, landscape planners were {{on the cutting edge of}} environmental research. Their work led to methods for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the development of geographic information systems (GIS). Bridging the cultures of scientific research and professional planning practice was the aim of the first scholarly journal in the field, <b>Landscape</b> <b>Planning,</b> and it is a sentiment that characterized landscape planners quite well. ^ In recent years, the profile of <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> has diminished considerably. Those who might have called themselves landscape planners in the past now identify themselves as ecological modelers, landscape ecologists, or environmental planners. Is it possible that the mission of classic <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> has been subsumed by these newer specialty areas? Or does <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> still have a role to play in the resolution of today 2 ̆ 7 s environmental and land use problems? These are the questions that this research addresses. ^ To understand the evolution of <b>landscape</b> <b>planning,</b> its history is placed in context with the histories of city <b>planning,</b> ecology, and <b>landscape</b> architecture. To document the current status of the field, scholarly literature is analyzed through journal network analysis and content analysis of the last five years of <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> articles. ^ This research sheds light on the complex relationships between disciplines engaged in environmental problem solving. Results suggest that there is still a need for <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> today, but that weaknesses must be overcome to make the field more effective. A new model of <b>landscape</b> <b>planning</b> is proposed to address the problems and yet still retain the strengths of the classic model. ...|$|R

Most of the campus lies within the city limits; a small section of the south campus, including the Special Programs Building (home to the student health center and the campus police), intramural sports fields, and most of the campus apartments, lies within Henrico County. The university has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus—red brick buildings in a collegiate gothic style set around shared open lawns. [...] Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the original administration building and library for Richmond College, were designed by Ralph Adams Cram in 1910. Cram, a noted institutional architect, also designed buildings for Princeton, Cornell, Rice, and Williams, among other universities. [...] Warren H.
