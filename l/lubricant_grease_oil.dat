40|$|The {{beneficiary}} {{effects of}} WS 2 inorganic fullerene-like nanoparticles in the lubrication industry were shown in recent years. The {{incorporation of the}} nanoparticles into <b>lubricants</b> (<b>oils,</b> <b>greases)</b> is however not straightforward. When two surfaces are sliding against each other and a lubricant is used, a thin layer (tribofilm) is formed on the contact area, which effects the friction process. Lubricants usually contain several additives. These additives can impair the friction reducing behaviour of the WS 2 inorganic fullerene-like nanoparticles. This thesis investigates the effects of several additives in the lubrication process by analysing the tribofilms formed on the worn surfaces using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in a scanning electron microscope...|$|R
50|$|Galling occurs {{initially}} {{with material}} transfer from individual grains, on a microscopic scale, which become stuck or even diffusion welded to the adjacent surface. This transfer {{can be enhanced}} if one or both metals form {{a thin layer of}} hard oxides with high coefficients of friction, such as those found on aluminum or stainless-steel. As the lump grows it pushes against the adjacent material and begins forcing them apart, concentrating a majority of the friction heat-energy into a very small area. This in turn causes more adhesion and material build-up. The localized heat increases the plasticity of the galled surface, deforming the metal, until the lump breaks through the surface and begins plowing up large amounts of material from the galled surface. Methods of preventing galling include the use of <b>lubricants</b> like <b>grease</b> and <b>oil,</b> low-friction coatings and thin-film deposits like molybdenum disulfide or titanium nitride, and increasing the surface hardness of the metals using processes such as case hardening and induction hardening.|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} and subsequent synthesis of metal containing fullerenes- IFS (Inorganic Fullerene-like Structures) by R. Tenne et al. has generated considerable scientific interest with great potential impact in many industrial application {{areas such as}} lubrication. The lubrication mechanism (tribofilm formation) via exfoliation and deposition of the atomic layers from this cage-like IF-particles was revealed and demonstrated first by this research group. The incorporation of the nanoparticles into <b>lubricants</b> (<b>oils,</b> <b>greases)</b> is however not straightforward. When two surfaces are sliding against each other and a lubricant is used, a thin layer (tribofilm) is formed on the contact area. The friction reducing effects of the nanoparticles can be altered or hindered by certain additives {{that are used in}} lubricative oils. The effects of such additives on the tribological behavior of the nanoparticles are investigated by analyzing the tribofilms formed on the worn surfaces using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in a scanning electron microscope. Another challenge of nanoparticles in lubricants is the penetration of the nanoparticles into the contact zone. A possible solution of this problem is briefly discussed. A modified burnishing technique can be used to coat sliding metallic surfaces with a friction reducing tribofilm. The morphology and composition of these tribofilms was investigated with analytical electron microscopy techniques. In {{the second part of the}} thesis electron microscopy was used to investigate the material transfer. Titanium is an elements with high adhesive ability to the counter surface, it displays poor tribological properties in sliding metallic contacts. This can lead to material transfer and consequently severe surface damage. The cold formation and machining of titanium, thus can lead rapid tool wear and poor surface finish. Electron microscopy techniques were used to study the mechanism of titanium transfer to different counter surfaces...|$|R
