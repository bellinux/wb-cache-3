50|$|The main {{notation}}s are the Whyte notation (based on {{counting the}} wheels), the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting either the axles or the bogies), and the UIC classification of <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> arrangements (based on counting either the axles or the bogies).|$|R

50|$|The EMD GT26CU-2 first {{appeared}} in 1976. Unlike its turbocharged predecessor the GT16, the GT26CU-2 was identified with a U suffix which indicated that this model had traction motors that could fit the <b>locomotives</b> <b>axles</b> from Metre gauge to Irish gauge rails; thus Universal would be the understood term for the traction motors.|$|R

5000|$|The UIC {{classification}} of <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> arrangements, {{also known as}} German classification, describes the wheel arrangement of locomotives, multiple units and trams. It is {{set out in the}} International Union of Railways (UIC) [...] "Leaflet 650 - Standard designation of <b>axle</b> arrangement on <b>locomotives</b> and multiple-unit sets". It is used in much of the world. The United Kingdom uses a related scheme. The United States uses the simplified AAR wheel arrangement for modern locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Under the British and Imperial {{classification}} scheme of <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> arrangements, which {{is related to}} the UIC classification, 1Co+Co1 is a classification code for a locomotive wheel arrangement of two eight-wheeled bogies with an articulated inter-bogie connection, each with three axles powered by a separate traction motor per axle and with the fourth non-powered axle in an integral leading pony truck to reduce the axle load. The similar 1Co-Co1 classification is in the same axle configuration, but without the inter-bogie connection.|$|R
5000|$|The Class DD15 was {{developed}} from the Class DD13 locomotive design, {{with the addition of}} snowplough units at either end. The snowplough units could be detached, allowing the locomotives to be used for shunting and other duties outside the winter periods. However, with the snowplough units mounted, the <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> load was nearly 16 t, restricting use on rural lines, and so the class was superseded by the later Class DE15 locomotives, which had separate snowplough units. As with the Class DD13 locomotives, the Class DD15 had two [...] DMF31SB diesel engines.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{electro-mechanical}} {{model for a}} locomotive is presented. The mechanical part of the model includes the members of transmission from motor rotor to wheels, the weight transfer on <b>locomotive</b> <b>axles</b> and the model of stick-slip phenomenon between rail and wheels. The electrical part of the model consists of a flux oriented induction motor. A new anti slip system is then proposed: the control action is strictly multi-axles and uses only electrical measurements. Moreover it acts with different strategies for temporary or long time slipping phenomena. Simulations {{have shown that the}} controlled system is very effective, even if more axles slip...|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Samson Fox, {{who was born in}} 1838 in Bradford, Yorkshire. Fox had been apprenticed to Smith, Beacock and Tannett of Victoria Foundry, Leeds, successors to Fenton, Murray and Jackson, who were early railway {{locomotive}} builders. While at Smith, Beacock and Tannett, Fox became their travelling representative, and became acquainted with Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock, who were major shipbuilders on the Firth of Clyde. Scotts provided a substantial proportion of the capital to establish the Leeds Forge at Castleton Field, Armley, Leeds in 1874, initially producing straight and cranked <b>locomotive</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's big end bearing were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated <b>locomotive</b> <b>axles</b> also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher resistance to heat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{derailment}} {{had been}} the result of a broken <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle.</b> Rankine's investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing, however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow [...] "crystallized". The notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the fast fracture region of the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly crystalline.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike the Whyte {{notation}} and AAR system, both {{of which}} are used to classify wheel arrangements, and the UIC classification of <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> arrangements, the Swiss system, in both its original and updated forms, takes into account a number of other variables, including track gauge, motive power type, and maximum speed. [...] The Swiss system is also less precise than those other systems in the way it deals with axles, because it refers only to numbers, rather than to arrangements, of powered axles, and axles as a whole. [...] The Swiss system is therefore more a method of classifying locomotive and railcar types and series than a method of classifying wheel or axle arrangements.|$|R

50|$|At {{this early}} date this was remarkably far-sighted. It {{had to be}} altered for a plateway, to have plain wheel treads. Unfortunately the L-shaped cast iron plates were {{not strong enough to}} support the five-ton <b>locomotive's</b> <b>axle</b> loading. Smiles recorded:The first engine {{constructed}} by Mr Stephenson to order, after the Killingworth model, was made for the Duke of Portland in 1817, for use upon his tramroad, about ten miles long, extending from Kilmarnock to Troon, in Ayrshire. It was employed to haul the coals from the Duke's collieries along the line to Troon Harbour. Its use was however discontinued in view of the frequent breakages of the cast-iron rails, by which the working of the line was interrupted, and accordingly horses were again employed as before.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} full {{data acquisition}} method {{was that all}} the waveforms from every channel at each TR time were recorded in the real-time testing. Using the full data, many kinds of post processing methods {{could be used to}} identify the flaws, such as the image processing, the flaws identification, the image display and the detection process playback. This article represented the realization method of full data acquisition technology and introduced its applications in the automatic multi-channel detection for the work pieces such as the center bore of turbine rotor, the locomotive gear, the <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> and the petroleum drilling rod joint. Finally, the full data acquisition technology was compared with the traditional automatic multi-channel inspection method and its characteristic was summarized.

50|$|The system {{makes use}} of several {{distinct}} pulse train patterns of alternating current flowing through a track circuit to convey {{an aspect of the}} next signal. The circuit comprises the feedpoint at the next signal, one running rail, first <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle,</b> another running rail and back to the signal feedpoint. The resulting electromagnetic field is picked up by receiver coils located just front of the first <b>axle</b> of the <b>locomotive.</b> The signal is then amplified, filtered and evaluated.If the received signal changes from a more permissive to a less permissive aspect (like when passing a yellow light, indicating the next signal is red, which, in turn, requires stopping in front of it), an immediate vigilance control acknowledge is required; depending on configuration and aspects, periodic checks and a speed limit may be enforced as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of locomotives plays {{a central role}} for the smooth operation of railway systems. Hot-axle failures {{are one of the}} most commonly found problems leading to locomotive accidents. Since the operating status of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>axle</b> bearings can be distinctly reflected by the axle temperatures, online temperature monitoring has become an essential way to detect hot-axle failures. In this work, we explore the feasibility of predict the hot-axle failures by identifying the temperature from predicted nominal values. We propose a data-driven approach based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict the sensor temperature for axle bearings. The effectiveness of the prediction model was validated with operation data collected from commercial locomotives. With a prediction accuracy is within a few percent, the proposed techniques can be used as a dynamic reference for hot-axle monitoring...|$|R
50|$|In 1873, United Kingdom Patent No. 3286 {{was granted}} to C. Davidson and C.D. Williams {{for a system}} in which, if a signal was passed at danger, a {{trackside}} lever operated the locomotive's whistle, applied the brake, shut off steam and alerted the guard. Numerous similar patents followed but they all bore the same disadvantage - {{that they could not}} be used at higher speeds for risk of damage to the mechanism - and they came to nothing. In Germany, the Kofler system used arms projecting from signal posts to connect with a pair of levers, one representing caution and the other stop, mounted on the locomotive cab roof. To address the problem of operation at speed, the sprung mounting for the levers was connected directly to the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>axle</b> box to ensure correct alignment. When Berlin's S-Bahn was electrified in 1929, a development of this system, with the contact levers moved from the roofs to the sides of the trains, was installed at the same time.|$|R

Its single engine compartment was identical to either {{one of the two}} engine compartments of the Class DS. The cab was also identical to that of the Class DS, equipped with mechanically interlocked dual controls to enable operation in either direction.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the axle}} load was {{expected}} to be a light 18 t and the power at ~. In practice, the German <b>locomotives</b> had an <b>axle</b> load of 21 t (which is normal for this type of diesel locomotive).|$|R

50|$|The <b>locomotives</b> were 2 <b>axle</b> {{machines}} with both axles {{powered by a}} Poyaud (SSCM) diesel engine via a Voith hydraulic transmission. Locomotives were later re-engined (1997) with lower emission RVI engines; when re-engined locomotives received the green SNCF Fret livery.|$|R
50|$|Mallet found typical {{main line}} {{railways}} unwilling to adopt his particular ideas and, in 1884, {{he started to}} propose compounding combined with articulation; on lightly engineered secondary lines this could give greater power to <b>locomotives</b> whose <b>axle</b> load and size was limited. His patent 162876 in France specified four cylinders, two large and two small, with one pair of cylinders acting on two or three fixed axles, and the other pair acting on axles mounted in a swivelling truck.|$|R
50|$|The Heywood {{radiating}} <b>axle</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{could pass}} very tight curves {{by a special}} axle arrangement.
