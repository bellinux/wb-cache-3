Strategic entrepreneurship around notions of acquiring, bundling and <b>leveraging</b> <b>resources</b> to create value for customers and firm competitive advantage has been studied in relation to large established firms (Hitt et al 2010) but largely overlooked in studies of small and medium enterprises. Recent theorizing regarding the processes by which firms orchestrate resources to create new economic activity (Sirmon et al, 2011) has focused on the managerial capabilities of structuring, bundling and <b>leveraging</b> <b>resources</b> across the firms breadth, depth and lifecycle.

50|$|The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) is an {{independent}} agency of the United States government. The CPSC seeks to promote the safety of consumer products by addressing “unreasonable risks” of injury (though coordinating recalls, evaluating products that {{are the subject of}} consumer complaints or industry reports, etc.); developing uniform safety standards (some mandatory, some through a voluntary standards process); and conducting research into product-related illness and injury. In part due to its small size, the CPSC attempts to coordinate with outside parties—including companies and consumer advocates—to <b>leverage</b> <b>resources</b> and expertise to achieve outcomes that advance consumer safety. The agency was created in 1972 through the Consumer Product Safety Act. The agency reports to Congress and the President; it is not part of any other department or agency in the federal government.

Historically, the Commission was often run by three commissioners or fewer. Since 2009, however, the agency has generally been led by five commissioners, one of which servers as chairman. The commissioners set policy for the CPSC. The CPSC is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.|$|E
