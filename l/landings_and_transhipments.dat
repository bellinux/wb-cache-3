40|$|Many {{small island}} states have {{developed}} economies that are strongly dependent on tuna fisheries. Consequently, they {{are vulnerable to}} the socio-economic {{effects of climate change}} and variability, processes that are known to impact tuna fisheries distribution and productivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the impacts of climate oscillations on the tuna-dependent economy of Seychelles. Using a multiplier approach, the direct, indirect and induced economic effects of the tuna industry expenditure benefiting the Seychelles' economy declined in 1998 by 58, 26 and 35 %, respectively (mean decline: 42 %), a year of strong climate oscillation in the western Indian Ocean. Multivariate patterns in tuna purse-seine vessel expenditures in port were substantially modified by strong climate oscillations, particularly in 1998. A cointegration time-series model predicted that a 40 % decline in tuna <b>landings</b> <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> in Port Victoria, a value commensurate with that observed in 1998, would result in a 34 % loss for the local economy solely through reductions in cargo handling expenditures. Of several indices tested, the Indian Oscillation Index was best at predicting the probability of switching between low and high regimes of <b>landings</b> <b>and</b> <b>transhipment,</b> which translate into impacts for the economy. It is hypothesised that a late 2006 /early 2007 climate oscillation was compounded by prior overfishing to produce a stronger impact on the fishery and economy of Seychelles. The effects of fishing and climate variability on tuna fisheries are complex and pose significant challenges for fisheries management and the economic development of countries in the Indian Ocean...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve its {{shipping}} operations a major salt exporter needs to reduce costs, increase market share and improve customer service. This thesis examines the use of linear (LP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) {{as a means of}} solving a nonlinear transhipment problem associated with the export of salt. Tho feasibility of using a LP or NLP approach is explored, taking into consideration the computational time and useability of the models. To meet the demands of their customers the company currently uses heuristic methods to allocate varying size ships to different routes. To remain competitive the shipping options that are considered include the optimisation of vessel chartering for effective scheduling to customers, selection of vessel type, stockpiling <b>and</b> <b>transhipment.</b> This thesis examines the vessel Selection <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> options <b>and</b> provides for improvements. The NLP approach developed in this thesis is implemented under the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It is expected the results will provide improvements to shipping methods and reduction of costs in salt exportation and will have applications to shipping problems in other industries...|$|R
