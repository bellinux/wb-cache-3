Nasr's envoy remained in Cairo for several years and likely did not return to Aleppo until after the accession of Caliph al-Mustansir.

25|$|Since shared {{libraries}} on most {{systems do}} not change often, systems can compute a likely load address for each shared library on the system before it is needed, and store that information in the libraries and executables.

This optimization is known as prebinding in macOS and prelinking in Linux. Disadvantages of this technique include {{the time required to}} precompute these addresses every time the shared libraries change, the inability to use address space layout randomization, and the requirement of sufficient virtual address space for use (a problem that will be alleviated by the adoption of 64-bit architectures, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>being).</b>|$|E

Amis, Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed [...] "The Seven", meeting to discuss each other's poetry, listen to jazz, and drink enthusiastically. During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex, but made no romantic headway.

The spill-over from the Dungan rebellions of the 1870s into Mongolia also saw a number of Chinese businesses in Khovd and Uliastai destroyed.

[...] Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could last several months). [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte). [...] This resulted in the Journal removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages. [...] The Association Medical Journal was quickly followed by the Medical Times and with growing pressure on The Lancet to do the same this pretty much ended professional medical support for the device, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E
500|$|After World War II, Boganda was {{urged by}} the Bishop of Bangui, Mgr Grandin, to {{complement}} his humanitarian and social works through political action. Boganda {{decided to run}} for election to the National Assembly of France. On 10 November 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the assembly after winning almost half of the total votes cast and defeating three other candidates, including the outgoing incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa. Boganda arrived in Paris attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal. From 1947 on, Boganda conducted a lively campaign against racism and the colonial regime. Soon realizing the limits of his influence in France (he served in parliament until 1958 but gradually detached himself from its activities), he returned to Oubangui-Chari to organise a grassroots movement of teachers, truck drivers and small producers to oppose French colonialism, although his previous attempt to set up a marketing cooperative among African planters of his own ethnicity had failed. On 28 September 1949, at Bangui, he founded the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), a quasi-religious political movement and party that sought to affirm black humanity and quickly came to dominate local politics. His political creed was summed up in the Sango phrase [...] "zo kwe zo", which translated to [...] "every human being is a person". Effectively, he was looking for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks within the French Union rather than independence, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>being.</b> He demarginalised large masses of people—women, youth, workers, poor cultivators—with the intent of unleashing the creativity of the Oubanguian people by placing them centre stage in the making of their country's history.|$|E

However this was stopped after Westmoreland told Tri's American adviser at divisional level, a Colonel Gruenther, to tell the 7th Division commander to consult Kỳ before making any moves. Tri, whom the CIA had assessed as [...] "anti-Communist and pro-US", was shortly afterwards reported to have halted the advance of his regimental-sized task force into the capital, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>being.</b> At the same time, a brigade of Vietnamese marines was being prepared to support Khánh in his fight against the rebels, {{but it is not}} clear whether this was to be coordinated with Tri's 7th Division and whether Tri’s decision to stand his ground instead of attacking had an effect on the marines. There were also reports of elements of the 9th Division from Cần Thơ in the far south, and the 25th Division from the west moving towards the capital with around 30 armored personnel carriers. They were reportedly joined by the 5th Division who were coming in from Bien Hoa in the north. During all of these moves, Kỳ’s hand was strengthened by the mistaken belief of Khánh and his faction that the air force commander supported them.|$|E
