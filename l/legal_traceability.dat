40|$|As the {{dependency}} on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in surveying {{has been growing}} over the years, the need for <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of GNSS measurements has become a significant matter. In Malaysia, {{with the advent of}} the Malaysia Real-time Kinematic Network (MyRTKnet), GNSS surveying has revolutionised land survey and mapping. Correspondingly, the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) amended and published standard regulations and guidelines concerning cadastral survey, i. e., Cadastral Survey Regulations 2009, to include GNSS measurements. However, these regulations and guidelines has not comprehensively incorporated <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of GNSS measurements; which is a prerequisite for cadastral surveys as it requires reliable and conclusive evidence for issues such as boundary disputes. The first objective of this paper is to review and discuss the <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of GNSS measurements. Secondly, it will highlight the current practice and issues, i. e., with regard to <b>legal</b> <b>traceability,</b> within the present Malaysian cadastral regulation and guidelines, in relation to the prevalently adopted Network RTK (N-RTK) technique, GNSS instrument calibrations, and reference stations' accuracy. Lastly, a rudimentary best practice guideline for GNSS surveying in cadastral survey for Malaysia is proposed. It is expected that this paper will contribute to the implementation of a best practice guideline, which is inclusive of <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of GNSS measurements, for the Malaysian cadastral practice...|$|E
40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{observations}} are increasingly {{used for a}} wide range of applications, and networks of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) are being rapidly installed to provide centimetre-level relative positioning. It is becoming increasingly important to determine and report on the quality control of these installations. This is necessary for <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of data and measurements as well as for long-term stability studies of station coordinates. This paper presents the automation of high-precision daily coordinate solutions of stations in CORSnet-NSW, using the Bernese software. CORSnet-NSW is a rapidly expanding network of CORS stations separated by significant distances (up to 275 km in remote regions) in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Coordinates are obtained in ITRF 2005 and transformed into GDA 94. The ongoing analysis of these coordinates can reveal: 1) Site specific velocities of a network at higher densities than those provided by the IGS network, 2) A medium density sampling of the local distortions present in the GDA 94 datum and the distortions in ellipsoidal heights derived from the Australian Height Datum 1971 (AHD 71) and AUSGeoid 98, and 3) Trends in site coordinates revealing local ground deformation. GPS data collected over a short period (60 days) in 2009 is sufficient to calculate station coordinates at millimetre-level precision, and velocities with 2 - 4 mm/yr precision that agree with expected tectonic motions. Significant differences are shown to exist between the coordinates of CORSnet-NSW stations obtained from the Bernese solution and their published GDA 94 and ellipsoidal height coordinates at the 0. 2 m and 0. 3 m levels horizontally and vertically, respectively. The published coordinates are calculated from local tie-surveys and retain local distortions in GDA 94 and AHD 71 for the benefit of local users. Network-RTK error modelling methods, <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> via national ‘Regulation 13 ’ position certification, and overlapping CORS networks will soon require station coordinates in a more homogeneous datum, such as ITRF. Ever-increasing GNSS accuracy will highlight the local distortions present in GDA 94 and AHD 71 /AUSGeoid 98 and cause possible confusion for users. For these reasons, the time has come to review and renew the national horizontal and vertical datums...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: As {{technological}} advances in equipment {{as applied to}} field surveying measurement and data storage/recording continues to accelerate towards previously unforeseeable limits, there still remains the onus to verify Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) equipment to a national standard and the respective regulations that require a Surveyor {{to establish and maintain}} <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of measurement. Given the current trend of utilising Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for surveying applications, Electronic Distance Measurement, which was once the benchmark of measurement devices is being gradually replaced by GNSS systems. Notwithstanding, the lack of suitable calibration baselines standardised in accordance with the National Measurement Regulations for the purpose of EDM verification, appears to be disappearing at an alarming rate. Many previous certified EDM baselines {{are in a state of}} disrepair or they simply are no longer being certified on an ongoing basis. This paper intends to deal with this problem of diminishing EDM calibration baselines and look to an alternative method whereby utilising RTK GNSS technology to provide a solution to the traceability and verification of measurement of EDM devices back to a recognised standard...|$|E

Calibration {{laboratories}} and proficiency testing schemes Calibration laboratories provide <b>legal</b> metrological <b>traceability</b> in South Africa as stipulated in the Measurements Units and Measurement Standards Act (Act No. 18 of 2006). The laboratories therefore form {{an integral part}} of the metrological chain whenever physical measurements are performed, be these for trade, safety, scientific purposes, law enforcement or to ensure that South African manufacturers remain globally competitive. The calibration programme affects the lives of ordinary South Africans, from ensuring that the weight of the sugar, maize meal and flour that is purchased is correct, to ensuring the accuracy of the equipment used for law enforcement, such as evidential breath analysers and speed measuring devices, and ensuring the accuracy and traceability of measurements required within the IPAP priority sectors. Proficiency testing is essential for the demonstration of the competency of a laboratory.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{traceability}} and quality assurance in fish supply chains iii Due to declining sales of fresh fish to the European market {{over the last}} decade, {{there is a need}} for Danish fish supply chains to enhance the appeal of their products and services. The main objective of this thesis is to give suggestions as to how the operations in a fish supply chain can be improved in order to increase the chain’s competitiveness. The development in the <b>legal</b> requirements for <b>traceability</b> of fish in the European Union has been studied and reported. The traceability of fish products in actual supply chains was investigated by tracing the path of a fish product from a retailer and as far back to the origin as possible and tracking the batches containing the fish product forward in the distribution networks. The investigations revealed inadequate traceability and information loss along some of the chains. Case studies were conducted to gain insight into the current practices of two fish suppl...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Implementing global {{traceability}} standards (GTSs) facilitates interoperability in {{food supply}} chains (FSCs). The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present incentives, opportunities and requirements for implementing GTSs in a fresh FSC. Design/methodology/approach – The research was developed in two stages: a literature review was conducted to establish a theoretical framework; and then an in-depth case study of a Swedish fresh fish supply chain was conducted. The Kano methodology was used to evaluate opportunities based on implementation requirements in each enterprise. Findings – FSC enterprises implement a GTS to meet <b>legal</b> food <b>traceability</b> requirements. This incentive is stronger among enterprises upstream in the FSC than among downstream enterprises. Downstream enterprises emphasize communication with the end consumer as an incentive to implement a GTS. Implementing a GTS increases the opportunity to preserve end consumer confidence, efficiency in information sharing, reduces time in inventory management and the risk of theft. Research limitations/implications – The paper contributes to the field of food traceability by providing knowledge regarding incentives, opportunities and requirements for implementing standards to meet food traceability requirements at FSC enterprises. Practical implications – Regulatory requirements on traceability preservation of food safety, quality and sustainability stipulate the implementation of a GTS. The research presented can support managers in understanding incentives and opportunities for implementing a GTS. Originality/value – This paper combines in-depth academic research with the involvement of Swedish fresh food enterprises. The study is of benefit to fresh food enterprises, authorities and organizations in the further implementation and development of GTSs...|$|R
40|$|The Network Real-Time Kinematic (NRTK) GPS and GNSS {{technology}} is increasingly being utilised {{for a wide}} range of surveying and mapping applications, providing users with instant and highly accurate position information over distances of several tens of kilometres. This paper reviews the principles behind the two prevalent NRTK methodologies currently available, the Virtual Reference Station (VRS) approach and the Master-Auxiliary Concept (MAC). The inherent differences are outlined, and the two concepts are compared from both the user’s and the network operator’s perspective. While both methods are supported by the major GNSS equipment manufacturers and deliver positioning results at the same accuracy-level, there are significant differences in regards to the distribution of processing load, correction data transparency, <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> and required bandwidth. Several CORSnet-NSW sites are used to empirically determine the average bandwidth required for NRTK operation under typical conditions based on differently sized networks ranging from 3 to 9 reference stations. While the bandwidth required for MAC is significantly larger than for VRS, particularly for large cells, results show that it can be readily supported by common radios...|$|E
40|$|Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) {{networks}} are being introduced across Australia and internationally. They provide improved access to positioning infrastructure {{for a wide}} range of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications, in industries such as surveying, agriculture, mining and construction. Benefits include the rationalisation of infrastructure, establishment of multi-user systems, uniform positioning services, and consistent and reliable connectivity to the national datum. They can also provide a degree of <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> for satellite-based positioning. Antenna models are vital to CORS network operators, but often these are not fully understood by CORS users. To achieve maximum benefit from this technology, users need to apply the appropriate antenna models at their Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover and in post processing. The good news is that, once implemented, the models take care of all the complexity, enabling the user in the field to focus on the GNSS survey at hand. After all, CORS network services should be accurate, reliable and easy to use! But users should also be aware of the negative effects when antenna models are ignored, or inappropriate models are applied at the rover. This article explains why the so-called ‘absolute’ antenna models are vital when data from CORS networks is used for high-accuracy positioning...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to research, develop and assess a legally {{traceable}} set of Quality Assurance procedures for using RTK GPS when performing a cadastral survey. To create the QA procedures research was conducted on current legislation, governing bodies (literature) and best practice guidelines. ISO 9000 guidelines {{were used for the}} development of the Quality Assurance procedures. A comparison survey was carried out where by the same survey was performed using RTK GPS and a Total Robotic Station. This provided a point comparison between the two methods to determine the achievable accuracy, it also gave a good indication as to the cost efficiency of the two methods. By using ISO 9000 QA procedures the <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of GPS observations can be greatly improved. The research also showed that depending on the size of the reinstatement needed, RTK GPS could achieve the desired level of accuracy at a increased level of efficiency. On a cost per job basis this would provide an overall increase in expected profitability. This research is limited mostly by the legally untested use of ISO 9000 QA procedures for DPS observations. Until either the government or a professional body produce a standard or “guide for best practice” for tracing GPS observations this research is not absolute. ...|$|E
40|$|Ampersand is {{a method}} that uses {{relation}} algebra to capture business rules and to generate functional specifications of IT systems, which satisfy these rules. A business rule {{is defined as a}} formal representation of a business requirement. This thesis examines the feasibility of Ampersand to specify legal compliant requirements for business processes with use of the Hohfeldian legal concepts. These legal concepts derive the core legal norms from legal texts, which people, organization comply with. Another point of attention is to cope with exceptions in legal texts, pre-conditions in <b>legal</b> texts and <b>traceability</b> of <b>legal</b> texts. The results of the empirical study show {{that it is possible to}} specify requirements for business processes with the Ampersand language in a way that relations between actors in a business process, their tasks (actions) and the legal consequences of performing or not performing tasks are clear. The implementation consists of a part that serves as a database of legal norms. For establishing a link between legal statement and formal representation, the identification of the legal article is stored as population of the concepts. This makes it possible to include the source of the legal statement in reasoning with cross-references...|$|R

40|$|The Surveyors Board of Queensland has {{recently}} {{become aware of}} some issues {{with the use of}} GNSS/GPS, particularly Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), on cadastral surveys. This document is designed to provide a summary of overarching principles that should govern how surveyors go about this task. It is not exhaustive: rather it is essentially an interim document designed to bring attention to some common errors in practice and will be later supplemented by more detailed guidelines. It is also designed to be read in conjunction with best practice guidelines such as SP# 1 (refer to References). In this document RTK refers to the use of good quality geodetic receivers and antennas and not hand held mapping grade receivers, nor DGPS systems. Although this guideline primarily covers cadastral surveys where some aspects of the work will be carried out using RTK GNSS, these principles may be also applicable to engineering, topographic, and other surveys, particularly where local ground-based coordinates and dimensions are required. For completeness and clarity, parts of the document also may refer to GNSS observational techniques other than RTK. Logically, this guideline is not applicable when using conventional measurement techniques only. The document does not cover • <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of measurement and survey integration – you should refer to requirements of the appropriate verifying authority for details on that aspect. • the general operational aspects of RTK GNSS – you should refer to manufacturers' specifications and other guidelines. ...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanners}} {{are becoming}} more familiar in the surveying industry due to the significant technological advances in equipment over the past 10 – 20 years introducing many new types of equipment and methods for the capture of point data {{in a variety of}} environments. The introduction of the terrestrial laser scanner in the surveying industry has been slowed by a lack of understanding in comparison with traditional surveying methods. This poses the question to the surveying industry of whether the relative accuracies and potential uses of terrestrial laser scanning systems can be of significant value to the surveying industry much like GPS has become over the last decade. For this project I have conducted testing on various facets of terrestrial laser scanning operation, specifically confirmation of specifications and the ability to establish a method providing <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of measurements obtained from these systems. This project utilised the RIEGL LMS-Z 620 terrestrial laser scanner and a Trimble S 8 total station. The results from the various scan sessions were then analysed to compare the obtained data to the specified accuracies published by the manufacturer as well as extracting information that members of the surveying industry can use to evaluate the capabilities of this instrument for traditional and non-traditional scanning applications. Terrestrial laser scanning is a relatively new concept for surveyors, with scanners capable of capturing large amounts of three-dimensional coordinated data quickly and very accurately without having to physically access objects and / or environments that may be hazardous or impractical to access. In Australia surveyors have not embraced the technology as quickly as other countries due to the unknown capabilities and questions about the accuracies that can be achieved, when compared to existing equipmen...|$|E
40|$|CORSnet-NSW is {{a network}} of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{continuously}} operating reference stations (CORS) that will cover New South Wales and is an expansion of SydNET, which has been successfully operating in the Sydney metropolitan region since 2004. CORSnet-NSW is fully funded and managed by Land and Property Information (LPI), {{a division of the}} NSW Land and Property Management Authority (LPMA). In excess of seven million Australian dollars have been committed for capital investment in the Survey Infrastructure Improvement Project – the majority of which will be invested in the CORS network – plus additional recurrent funds to operate the network. CORSnet-NSW currently (January 2010) consists of 29 CORS and is being expanded to include 70 stations by 2013 in order to provide state-wide coverage. As part of this expansion, LPI has purchased Trimble Navigation’s VRS 3 Net CORS network management software which will significantly enhance the range and quality of services that LPI can provide to its customers. Work is being undertaken to integrate VRS 3 Net with LPI’s existing accounting and delivery systems, which is a first for this system. Currently, dual network control centres are being built at LPI’s data centres in Sydney and Bathurst. Once completed, these control centres will provide a fully redundant network with ample capabilities for many years to come. This new infrastructure will also facilitate a wide range of research projects in the areas of geodesy, surveying, positioning, navigation and telecommunications. CORSnet-NSW will provide users with network real time kinematic (NRTK) services in the extended Sydney metropolitan area as well as other populated regions of the state and single-base RTK elsewhere, as well as supplying GNSS data for post-processing. RTK and NTRK correction data are available in RTCM 3. 1 format via the internet using NTRIP (Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol), providing centimetre-level horizontal positioning in real time. This paper introduces CORSnet-NSW and discusses several issues {{that need to be addressed}} in order to provide a reliable GNSS positioning service of homogeneous and high accuracy across the state. These issues include the direct connection to the national datum, <b>legal</b> <b>traceability</b> of CORS coordinates, compatibility with online GNSS processing services and CORS networks in neighbouring states, and the correct use of Antenna Phase Centre Variation (APCV) models...|$|E
