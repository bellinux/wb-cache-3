5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, there {{remained}} only 40 Mérens horses {{registered in the}} breed studbook. The breed was saved from extinction by utopian communities believing in an ecological apocalypse. As part of the hippie movement, people wanting {{to live on the}} fringe of society settled in the small villages of Ariege. They boosted the local economy, including encouraging the resumption of the breeding of Mérens. At the same time, the story of the semi-feral horse Bonbon became a <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> This Mérens, orphaned following an accident, was raised on bottle-fed goat milk. He was then sold to a horse-dealer before later returning to his homeland and winning prizes as a stallion. He died at twenty, having returned to his herd high in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|However, many meteorologists {{argue that}} the monsoon is not a <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> as {{explained}} by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire tropical zone of Earth. This criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds, but casts {{it as one of}} several factors rather than the only one.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} drop {{is a type}} of <b>local</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{found in}} open channel flow. It is a rapid change in the depth of flow from a high stage to a low stage that results in a steep depression in the water surface. It is often caused by an abrupt change in the channel slope.Another type of <b>local</b> <b>phenomena</b> found in an open channel flow is the hydraulic jump.|$|R

50|$|In certain {{applications}} {{we have to}} {{deal with}} signals which contain components which can be described as <b>local</b> <b>phenomena,</b> for example pulses or steps, which have certain time duration. A consequence of applying a filter to a signal is, in intuitive terms, that the duration of the <b>local</b> <b>phenomena</b> is extended by the width of the filter. This implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter's impulse response function as short as possible.|$|R
25|$|How {{important}} {{the concept was}} can be understood from how the idea that some <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> may be somehow linked to an absolute and sacred object found extensive application in the medieval and early modern periods. It was often said that temple lands in Japan were local emanations of Buddhist paradises or that an artisan's work was one with the sacred actions of an Indian Buddha, such as Nevin Koshy.|$|E
25|$|Colaprete et al. {{conducted}} simulations {{with the}} Mars General Circulation Model which {{show that the}} local climate around the Martian south pole may currently be in an unstable period. The simulated instability {{is rooted in the}} geography of the region, leading the authors to speculate that the sublimation of the polar ice is a <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> rather than a global one. The researchers showed that even with a constant solar luminosity the poles were capable of jumping between states of depositing or losing ice. The trigger for a change of states could be either increased dust loading in the atmosphere or an albedo change due to deposition of water ice on the polar cap. This theory is somewhat problematic {{due to the lack of}} ice depositation after the 2001 global dust storm. Another issue is that the accuracy of the Mars General Circulation Model decreases as the scale of the phenomenon becomes more local.|$|E

500|$|In {{parallel}} to that official cult were the more private cults of pious individuals venerating Nyuserre {{as a kind}} of [...] "saint", an intercessor between the believers and the gods. This popular cult, which developed spontaneously, perhaps because of the proximity of Nyuserre's pyramid to Memphis, referred to Nyuserre using his birth name Iny, and likely consisted of invocations and offerings to statues of the king or in his mortuary temple. Therefore, archaeological traces of this cult are difficult to discern, yet Nyuserre's special status is manifest in some religious formulae, where his name is invoked, {{as well as in the}} onomastics of individuals, notably during the Middle Kingdom, whose names included [...] "Iny", such as Inhotep, Inemsaf, Inankhu and many more. Although the veneration of Nyuserre was originally a <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> from Abusir, Saqqara and their surroundings, it may have ultimately reached even outside of Egypt proper, in Sinai, Byblos and Nubia, where fragments of statues, vessels and stelae bearing Nyuserre's name have been discovered in cultic contexts.|$|E

2500|$|Street gangs were {{prevalent}} in the poverty of the South Bronx, {{and much of the}} graffiti, rapping, and b-boying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and one-upmanship of street gangs. Sensing that gang members' often violent urges could be turned into creative ones, Afrika Bambaataa founded the Zulu Nation, a loose confederation of street-dance crews, graffiti artists, and rap musicians. By the late 1970s, the culture had gained media attention, with Billboard magazine printing an article titled [...] "B Beats Bombarding Bronx", commenting on the <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and mentioning influential figures such as Kool Herc. The New York City blackout of 1977 saw widespread looting, arson, and other citywide disorders especially in the Bronx where a number of looters stole DJ equipment from electronics stores. As a result, the hip hop genre, barely known outside of the Bronx at the time, grew at an astounding rate from 1977 onward.|$|E

[...] The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, though spanning a much shorter dataset, shows no warming of planetary average temperature, and a possible cooling. [...] "MCS MY 28 temperatures are an average of 0.9 (daytime) and 1.7 K (night- time) cooler than TES MY 24 measurements." [...] Locally and regionally, however, changes in pits in the layer of frozen carbon dioxide at the Martian south pole observed between 1999 and 2001 suggest the south polar ice cap is shrinking. More recent observations indicate that Mars' south pole is continuing to melt. [...] "It's evaporating right now at a prodigious rate," [...] says Michael Malin, principal investigator for the Mars Orbiter Camera. The pits in the ice are growing by about 3 meters (9.8ft) per year. Malin states that conditions on Mars are not currently conductive {{to the formation of}} new ice.

6000|$|So far, {{the picture}} of Doncaster on the {{occasion}} of its great sporting anniversary, offers probably a general representation of the social condition of the town, in the past {{as well as in the}} present time. The sole <b>local</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of the current year, which may be considered as entirely unprecedented in its way, and which certainly claims, on that account, some slight share of notice, consists in the actual existence of one remarkable individual, who is sojourning in Doncaster, and who, neither directly nor indirectly, has anything at all to do, in any capacity whatever, with the racing amusements of the week. Ranging throughout the entire crowd that fills the town, and including the inhabitants as well as the visitors, nobody is to be found altogether disconnected with the business of the day, excepting this one unparalleled man. He does not bet on the races, like the sporting men. He does not assist the races, like the jockeys, starters, judges, and grooms. He does not look on at the races, like Mr. Goodchild and his fellow-spectators. He does not profit by the races, like the hotel-keepers and the tradespeople. He does not minister to the necessities of the races, like the booth-keepers, the postilions, the waiters, and the hawkers of Lists. He does not assist the attractions of the races, like the actors at the theatre, the riders at the circus, or the posturers at the Poses Plastiques. Absolutely and literally, he is the only individual in Doncaster who stands by the brink of the full-flowing race-stream, and is not swept away by it in common with all the rest of his species. Who is this modern hermit, this recluse of the St. Leger-week, this inscrutably ungregarious being, who lives apart from the amusements and activities of his fellow-creatures?

40|$|This thesis study covers both global {{performance}} and <b>local</b> <b>phenomena</b> analyses focusing on natural circulation reactor design safety. Four important topics are included: the global SBWR design safety assessment, important <b>local</b> <b>phenomena</b> investigation, steady and transient natural circulation process study, and two-phase instability analysis. ^ The conceptual {{design of the}} SBWR- 200 is introduced in this thesis and the global performance of a natural circulation reactor is then assessed using PUMA integral test data and RELAP 5 simulations. A safety assessment methodology is developed to evaluate the PUMA integral test data extrapolation and code scalability. The RELAP 5 code simulation capability in low-pressure low-flow conditions is also validated. The study shows that the code is capable of predicting the global accident scenario in natural circulation reactors with reasonable accuracy, while failing to reproduce some safety related <b>local</b> <b>phenomena.</b> ^ The natural circulation process is investigated in detail using PUMA separate effect natural circulation tests. The natural circulation flow rate and heat transfer rate have been modeled analytically and numerically. The work indicates that two-phase natural circulation has enough capability to remove decay power. However, the flow instability observed in two-phase natural circulation cases seriously challenges the feasibility of natural circulation reactor design. The instability is classified {{as a type of}} density wave instability induced by flashing. A detailed stability study is performed focusing on flashing induced instability under natural circulation condition. Various flashing phenomena have been studied and a mechanistic flashing model has been proposed and improved using a relaxation method. The developed relaxation flashing model can be applied to general two-phase non-equilibrium phenomena. ...|$|R
