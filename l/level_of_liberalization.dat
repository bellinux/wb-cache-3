40|$|WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) was {{designed}} to liberalize and expand trade in government procurement. Revised GPA was implemented in 1996 and the latest revision was completed (but not yet implemented) in 2012, but as a plurilateral agreement. Since {{the end of the}} UR, there has been attempts by various WTO members to liberalize trade in the government procurement market? through an expansion of Parties who are signatories to GPA, and through a negotiated agreement on transparency in government procurement. The attempt to expand the Parties who are signatories to the GPA - attempt to increase the width of the coverage of the agreement - has been somewhat successful, but I argue that the goal should be to further liberate the government procurement markets of the current Party members - to reduce thresholds and other barriers which limit market access even to other GPA members, in other words, to increase the depth of coverage. Taking cue from Korea's FTA, I propose a two-level <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> the government procurement market under the GPA: A "light" level which would be the same as the current <b>level</b> <b>of</b> liberalization; and a "deep" level with lower thresholds and less exemptions. I argue that, as seen in Korea, with FTAs, many GPA Parties already have multiple <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> (i. e, spaghetti-bowl effect of FTAs), but by limiting the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> to two, we can seek the best <b>of</b> deep <b>liberalization</b> but reduce the spaghetti-bowl effect...|$|R

Panel data regressions for a sample of developed and developing economies confirm that an increase in income inequality is mostly linked to a decrease in the current account balance.

It follows that the more actors who take part in politics, and the more that institutions allow political opposition, the more open a society (of states) is likely to be.

Results show that, once the endogenous nature of policy changes is controlled for, the policy appears more effective than expected, in terms of its impact on concentration, consumers’ access, store size and level of service to consumers. While the decree overall seems to have help the consumer to have more access and more in-store services, our analysis suggests food retailing became more concentrated in response to the implementation of the LD 114 / 1998.

Hoekman, European University Institut; Judge Allan Rosas, Court of Justice of the European Union; Professor Robert Wolfe, Queen's University, CanadaThe thesis {{focuses on}} the {{liberalization}} of services {{in the context of}} preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The first part develops an interpretation of Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) that regulates the conclusion of the so-called economic integration agreements (EIAs). It is argued that in the context of preferentialism, the GATS does not impose any market access discipline but aims at creating a non-discriminatory trading environment. Special attention is paid to Mode 4 and to the type of liberalization that it covers. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the main elements of Article V GATS (sectoral/modal coverage and non-discrimination) are employed to conduct an empirical analysis of EIAs. The chosen sample includes four of the European Unionﾒs international trade agreements that feature significant services liberalization. The services schedules of these four agreements are reviewed and rated to find out their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization.</b> In the context of the EU, its services commitments continue, to a large extent, to be determined individually by its Member States. As the thesis shows, significant variations still exist among different Member States both in horizontal and sector-specific commitments. The thesis connects the EUﾒs internal situation to the wider issue of how deep EIAs should be in order to escape claims of non-compliance. It asks the question of how the exact coverage and level of non-discrimination should be assessed in a situation where commitments vary across different states or regions of the same contracting party. No clear answer can be provided but the thesis proposes that in order to be in line with its international obligations, the EU, as well as any WTO Member with internally divided regulatory powers in services, should ensure that when signing EIAs, the commitments of all Member States (or, in the case of other WTO Members, all states/regions/other entities with regulatory powers in services) reach the GATS threshold of substantiality in their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization...</b>|$|E

The research question is Does having a monarchical regime type increase the degree <b>of</b> political <b>liberalization</b> and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> political stability?" In recent years, observers have noted that Middle Eastern monarchies seem to have higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> political stability and more political freedom than the region's republics.

The theory is tested by constructing a series of statistical models, and examining the effect of monarchy on different dependent variables. The analyses are performed on datasets covering the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific, a region with many former ruling monarchies. The results indicate that monarchies in both the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific generally have higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization,</b> but that some types of political freedom, such as religious freedom, might be lower in monarchies. The results also indicate that Middle Eastern monarchies are more stable than the monarchies that have existed in the Asia-Pacific. Thus, although the latter group of monarchies have either collapsed or transitioned to constitutional monarchy in the past decades, the models reveal no indications of imminent regime change among Middle Eastern monarchies...|$|R

To study data of 54 countries from 1985 to 2010 and because the nexus between financial liberalization and economic growth is nonlinear and depends on specific national factors especially institutions quality and governance, the Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model is used. The main result of this study shows that a better contribution of financial liberalization to economic growth requires the interrelationship and the complementarity between financial liberalization and governance.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} extensive {{new data}} on the legal independence of new central banks in 26 former socialist economies (FSE). This data is constructed using the codification system for measuring legal independence developed in Cukierman, Webb and Neyapti (1992) and in chapter 19 of Cukierman (1992). This makes it comparable with earlier data on central bank independence (CBI) in the industrial democracies and in, non FSE, developing countries and permits experimentation with alternative indices of CBI like those reviewed in Eijffinger and van Keulen (1995). The new indices of independence indicate that central bank (CB) reform in the FSE during the nineties has been quite ambitious. In spite of the large price shocks induced by the transformation from plan to market, reformers in those countries chose to create central banks with <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> legal independence that are substantially higher, on average, than those of developed economies during the eighties. Based on data from 1989 through 1998 {{the evidence in the}} paper suggests that CBI is unrelated to inflation during the early stages <b>of</b> <b>liberalization.</b> But for sufficiently high and sustained <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization,</b> and controlling for variables like price decontrols and wars, legal CBI and inflation are significantly and negatively related. These findings are consistent with the view that legal CBI, no matter how high, cannot contain the powerful inflationary impact <b>of</b> wide scale <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> formerly controlled prices. But once the process <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> has gathered sufficient momentum legal independence becomes effective in slowing inflation down and the cumulative liberalization index developed by de Melo et. al. (1996) becomes relatively less important. The paper also presents evidence on factors that affect the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> CBI and examines the relation between inflation and CBI within a broader sample composed of the transition and of the developed economies. ...|$|R
