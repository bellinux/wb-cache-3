25|$|It {{unfortunately}} {{appears to}} us, and many residents of Bay County, that Dr. Siebert {{has become a}} scapegoat for those seeking a political solution to recent events, rather than a logical resolution based upon science and fact.

500|$|In 2011, Romm {{stated that}} [...] "Feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century {{in the face}} of a rapidly {{worsening}} climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced." [...] Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up notes: [...] "the bottom <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". [...] Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year. He also asks in the book, [...] "will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies, or will we be importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China." [...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The bottom <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time for somebody else to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the middle}} of June the {{political}} situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the POUM – painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a Trotskyist organisation – was outlawed and under attack. <b>The</b> Communist <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> POUM <b>were</b> [...] "objectively" [...] Fascist, hindering the Republican cause. [...] "A particularly nasty poster appeared, showing a head with a POUM mask being ripped off to reveal a Swastika-covered face beneath."

500|$|Another common {{criticism}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book <b>was</b> {{aimed at}} fans of The Simpsons {{and not a}} general audience.

[...] Bacchus concurred, saying [...] "Cartwright writes {{as if she were}} speaking to devotees of The Simpsons Fan Club, too often providing bland tidbits of background that only obsessives would ever really care about." [...] Rob Sheridan of the National Post also believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book <b>is</b> [...] "aimed squarely at rabid Simpsons fans", and criticized <b>the</b> writing, commenting <b>that</b> [...] "the chronology of her story is sometimes muddled, and a lot of sentences have that first-draft feeling [...] But none of this is anything to have a cow about." ...|$|R

2500|$|Maayana Miskin of Arutz Sheva {{characterized}} the movement as [...] "a mass protest". Writing for The American Thinker, Ethel C. Fenig described the protest {{movement as a}} cause for freedom of speech. Westword commented positively on the protest idea, [...] "Sounds like an idea we'd like to frame." [...] The editor of Family Security Matters, Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement {{from the perspective of}} freedom of speech, and commented, [...] "I realize that in a free society, someone {{is always going to be}} doing or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer." [...] Andrew Mellon of Big Journalism wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, [...] "The bottom <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. We are an equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American." [...] Mario Roy of La Presse discussed the incident, and noted, [...] "it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship.

2500|$|The first {{proposal}} for a people mover was launched by NSB in 1986 and was centered around being a link for the airport. [...] The line would have its start at Stabekk Station on the Drammen Line, {{where it would be}} located next to the railway platforms. NSB would schedule all services along the Drammen Line stop at Stabekk. The stations at the terminals would be built in the immediate vicinity of the check-ins.

500|$|<b>The</b> initial {{government}} <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> regular {{army had}} taken the actions. ARVN radio broadcasts bore the influence of Nhu's abrasive tone in directing the Republican Youth {{to cooperate with the}} government. Nhu accused the Buddhists of turning their pagodas into headquarters for plotting anti-government insurrections. He claimed the Buddhist Intersect Committee operated under the control of [...] "political speculators who exploited religion and terrorism". Lodge believed Diệm remained in control but that Nhu's influence had risen to unprecedented levels. He thought that Nhu's divide and conquer tactics had split the military into three factions, respectively led by Generals Đôn and Đính, and Colonel Tung. Đôn was believed not to have the allegiance of Đính and Tung, who took their orders directly from Gia Long Palace. The two loyalists had support from various pro-Diệm elements. Lodge predicted <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> army deposed Diệm, fighting could break out within the ARVN.|$|R

40|$|It <b>is</b> {{well known}} <b>that</b> a {{necessary}} condition for the Lax-stability of <b>the</b> method of <b>lines</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eigenvalues of the spatial discretization operator, scaled by the time step k, lie within a distance O(k) of the stability region of the time integration formula as k ~ O.

Our results generalize those of an earlier paper by considering: (a) Runge-Kutta and other one-step formulas, (b) implicit as well as explicit linear multistep formulas, (c) weighted norms, (d) algebraic stability, (e) finite and infinite time intervals, and (f) stability regions with cusps. In summary, the theory presented in this paper amounts to a transplantation of the Kreiss matrix theorem from the unit disk (for simple power iterations) to an arbitrary stability region (for method of lines calculations) ...|$|R
2500|$|Zobel {{networks}} are rarely used for traditional frequency filtering. [...] Other filter types are significantly more efficient for this purpose. [...] Where Zobels {{come into their}} own is in frequency equalisation applications, particularly on transmission lines. [...] The difficulty with transmission <b>lines</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impedance of the line varies in a complex way across the band and is tedious to measure. [...] For most filter types, this variation in impedance will cause {{a significant difference in}} response to the theoretical, and is mathematically difficult to compensate for, even assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impedance <b>is</b> known precisely. [...] If Zobel {{networks are}} used however, it is only necessary to measure the line response into a fixed resistive load and then design an equaliser to compensate it. [...] It is entirely unnecessary to know anything at all about the line impedance as the Zobel network will present exactly the same impedance to line as the measuring instruments. [...] Its response will therefore be precisely as theoretically predicted. [...] This is a tremendous advantage where high quality lines with flat frequency responses are desired.|$|R

5|$|The unified {{armed forces}} of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the Wehrmacht. This {{included}} the Heer (army), Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force). From 2 August 1934, members {{of the armed forces}} were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally. In contrast to the previous oath, which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments, this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal. Hitler decreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen—the mobile death squads responsible for millions of deaths in Eastern Europe—when it was tactically possible to do so.

30|$|Because {{the primary}} {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare interpolation methods, first the effect of interpolation methods on accuracy was considered. The most striking result along this <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two kriging methods outperformed the IDW method to predict groundwater table depth for both the seasons, and RBF performed better than OK. This agreed with the findings of several authors who have made comparisons among interpolation methods (Zimmerman et al. 1999; Sarangi et al. 2006; Kumar 2007; Sun et al. 2009; Arslan 2014), but contradicted the findings of several other such authors (Weber and Englund 1992; Gallichand and Marcotte 1993; Declercq 1996). Our study strengthened <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performance of kriging was superior to IDW. Of course, kriging has several other advantages, but those were not performance related. The underperformance of IDW may be due to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> it could not distribute the weights properly to arrest the drifting effect of water table depth. The data distribution may be another reason, but in normal condition observation wells used to be distributed randomly. So, IDW may underperform in normal practical situation.|$|R
