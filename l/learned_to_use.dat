5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners {{did not understand the}} process.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2010, Banister {{was named}} the Pirates' interim bench coach after Gary Varsho was fired by the organization. At {{the end of the}} 2010 season, the Pirates fired manager John Russell. Banister and Clint Hurdle were the two finalists for the position. The Pirates named Hurdle as their manager, and Banister {{was named the}}ir {{full-time}} bench coach. As the Pirates bench coach, Banister learned about sabermetrics from a quantitative analyst who traveled with the team. Banister <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> quantitative data to inform his decisions on when the Pirates should employ defensive shifts in the field. He was initially chosen to manage Scottsdale in the AFL after the 2014 season, but he was replaced by Pirates' special assistant Frank Kremblas due to the possibility of the Pirates reaching the MLB postseason.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} known today as the Bedouin, some time after they <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} empirical exploration of <b>using</b> reinforcement <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> simple forms of working memory. <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> memory involves <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> behave in the environment while simultaneously <b>learning</b> when <b>to</b> select internal actions that control how knowledge persists in memory and <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> that information stored in memory to make decisions. We focus on two different models of memory: bit memory and gated memory. Bit memory is inspired by prior reinforcement learning literature and stores abstract values, which an agent can <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> associate with task history. Gated memory is inspired by human working memory and stores perceptually grounded symbols. Our goal is to determine computational bounds on the tractability of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> these memories. We conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration {{of the dynamics of}} <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> memory models by modifying a simple partially observable task, TMaze, along specific dimensions: length of temporal delay, number of dependent decisions, number of distinct symbols, quantity of concurrent knowledge, and availability of second-order knowledge. We find that <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> gated memory is significantly more tractable than <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> bit memory because it stores perceptually grounded symbols in memory. We further find that learning performance scales more favorably along temporal delay, distinct symbols, and concurrent knowledge when <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> gated memory than along other dimensions. We also identify situations in which agents fail <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> gated memory optimally which involve repeated identical observations which result in no unambiguous trajectories through the underlying task and memory state space...|$|R
40|$|This paper brings {{together}} work in modeling episodic memory and reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate {{that is possible}} <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> episodic memory retrievals while simultaneously <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> act in an external environment. In {{a series of three}} experiments we investigate <b>using</b> RL <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> what <b>to</b> retrieve from episodic memory and when to retrieve it, how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> temporal episodic memory retrievals, and how to build cues that are the conjunctions of multiple features. Our empirical results demonstrate that it is computationally feasible <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> episodic memory in the three experiments, and furthermore, that <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> internal episodic memory accomplishes tasks that reinforcement learning alone cannot. These experiments also expose some important interactions that arise between reinforcement learning and episodic memory. In a fourth experiment, we demonstrate that an agent endowed with a simple bit memory cannot <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it effectively. This indicates that mechanistic characteristics of episodic memory may be essential <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it, and that these characteristics are not shared by simpler memory mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E

Tribal members learned methods to increase the speed of manufacture. They incorporated firing pottery in a kiln and using glazes into their techniques. They <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> squeeze molds to produce copies of pots quickly. Kiln firing produced finished pottery of more uniform brown tones than the shades of gray from traditional pottery techniques.|$|E
25|$|At {{around the}} same time Curtiss began her work, doctors reevaluated Genie on the Leiter scale and {{measured}} her on the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale, which placed her estimated mental age between a 5- and 8-year-old with a very high degree of scatter. Doctors believed Genie had <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> her gestalt perception to determine the number of objects in a group, and by the start of the case study she could accurately discern the correct number of up to 7 objects via gestalt perception. Child psychologist David Elkind, who was involved in the grant meetings, evaluated Genie in May 1971 and reported that she was in the concrete operational stage of development, noting that she understood object permanence and could engage in deferred imitation. Genie's physical health also continued to improve, and by this time her endurance had dramatically increased. Her social behavior was still highly abnormal, and doctors were especially concerned that she almost never interacted with people her age, but evaluations from the time expressed some optimism about her prognosis.|$|E

25|$|Greenland {{was always}} colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion {{of the soil}} was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland {{settlements}} may not have recognized {{until it was too}} late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation. A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food. But they never <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.|$|E
25|$|The mirror test allows {{scientists}} {{to determine whether}} birds are conscious of themselves and able to distinguish themselves from other animals by determining whether they possess or lack the ability to recognize themselves in their own reflections. European magpies are the only animals beside mammals that {{have been shown to}} be able to pass this test by trying to remove colored stickers from underneath their beaks when shown in a mirror. However, in 1981, Epstein, Lanza and Skinner published a paper in the journal Science in which they argued that pigeons also pass the mirror test. A pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it which it then turned to peck—food was the consequence of a correct choice (i.e., the pigeon <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mirror to find critical elements of its environment). Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a leading}} base stealer {{in the first half}} of his career. He was also able to hit triples, {{reaching}} double figures four times. As he became slower in later years while his body grew and his injuries mounted, Gwynn would anticipate pitchers' moves and would sometimes steal bases by breaking for second base before the pitcher started delivering the ball to the hitter. Defensively, he improved considerably and was among the best right fielders at quickly going to the line, cutting the ball off, and throwing to second base. He worked on his defense, constantly checking right field walls in ballparks to study how balls bounced off them. His running ability also helped him on defense. When he entered the majors, Gwynn was not a very good right fielder nor an accurate thrower. For a long time, he worked on his defense harder than he did his hitting. While he was a natural hitter, he was most proud of his five Gold Gloves, calling his first one from 1986 his most treasured piece of memorabilia. He became a perennial leader in outfield assists. Although his arm was not particularly strong, he <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his body to build momentum into his throws. In college, he could not even throw the ball from center field to second base without it hopping first.|$|E

25|$|For generations, Xianghua's {{ancestors}} of the Chai family have groomed men and women into seasoned warriors of China. A woman named Xiangfei {{was sent to the}} prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay and became supremely skilled with the jian. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk at the temple and the most prominent candidate for inheritor of the holy bo staff, the Kali-Yuga. Not until the illegitimate birth of their first daughter, Xianglian, was their love made known to the other monks who remained very strict regarding the temple's edicts and so Xianglian was taken from her parents on her second birthday. Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, a sworn brother of Xiuqiang and Xiangfei, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Unknown to Xiuqiang was that when Xiangfei, pregnant with a second child, had left the temple, secretly returned to her homeland, was taken in by the Chai home there, and {{became a member of the}} Ming Dynasty secret Imperial Guard, the Jinyiwei. Months later, she gave birth to her second daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled from the temple, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone, as she would be happier in her ignorance. When monks from the Temple came to Xiangfei, searching for the missing sword, all they found was young Xianghua playing with a battered jian, and they gave up the search years later. Only Xiuqiang knew that Xianghua's sword was actually the Krita-Yuga in disguise. As time passed, Xianghua had <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it just as well as her mother when Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua became a member of the Imperial Guard.|$|E
