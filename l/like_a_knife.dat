25|$|The Cuts <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Knife</b> tour {{started in}} eastern Canada. In March, Adams started the American {{leg of the}} tour; after five months Adams had {{performed}} over 100 dates. He later joined the British progressive rock band Supertramp on their tour in North America. Though not featured on the album, drummer for the tour was the late Frankie LaRocka and the keyboard player was Johnny 'Blitz' Hannah. Adams then traveled to Vancouver where he played live in front of 30,000 fans. Later on he went to Europe for a six-week solo tour; one show (and subsequent band interview) was broadcast live on German TV and radio {{as part of the}} famous Rockpalast series. He played in six different countries. In November 1983, Adams went to Japan to start his own headline tour. By this time Adams had been on the road 283 days. Adams supported The Police when they toured in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E

60|$|I {{had seen}} the green of the valley turn to gold and then to flaming brown. I {{had seen the}} fire perish out of those autumnal tints, and with the falling of the leaves, a slow, grey, bald decrepitude {{covering}} the world. And to this had now succeeded chill wintry gales that howled and whistled through the logs of my wretched hut, whilst the western wind coming down over the frozen zone above cut into me <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife's</b> edge.|$|R

500|$|In March 1984, {{recording}} for Reckless {{began after}} extensive touring {{for the support}} of Cuts <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Knife.</b> However, unhappy with the recording process, Adams decided to take a month off. In August, Adams headed back to the studio with Tina Turner for the track [...] "It's Only Love"; he also returned with more new songs and started re-recording songs which would lead to the development of such tracks as [...] "Run to You", Summer of '69", and [...] "Heaven".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} with two B-side tracks; [...] "Kids Wanna Rock" [...] and [...] "The Best Was Yet to Come", which had previously {{appeared on the}} albums Reckless and Cuts <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Knife</b> respectively. [...] "Summer of '69" [...] received favourable reviews from music critics. The single had a strong effect on music charts internationally, with its highest peak being number four in the Netherlands, and its least successful charting country being Germany. The track was promoted with a music video, which was filmed by Steve Barron. The video features Adams and his backing band {{in a variety of}} settings, including running from the police.|$|E
500|$|Josephson {{was known}} at Cambridge as a brilliant, but shy, student. Physicist John Waldram {{recalled}} overhearing Nicholas Kurti, an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson's exam results with David Shoenberg, the reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: [...] "Who is this chap Josephson? He {{seems to be}} going through the theory <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> through butter." [...] While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the Mössbauer effect, pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to Physics World, Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him a place in the history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect.|$|E

500|$|After a tour {{supporting}} his album Cuts <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Knife,</b> he immediately started the recording sessions {{for the new}} album, Reckless. [...] "Summer of '69" [...] was finished on January 25, 1984, co-written with Jim Vallance in his basement studio. The song went {{through a number of}} changes because neither Adams nor Vallance was convinced it was a strong enough song to be featured on the album. In their first draft, the lyric [...] "summer of '69" [...] appeared only once. At that time the two were planning to title it [...] "Best Days of My Life" [...] instead. While the lyric [...] "Best days of my life" [...] appeared seven times in the first draft, on the final draft it had been replaced by [...] "summer of '69" [...] and appeared only two times throughout the song.|$|E

3000|$|Cultural {{difference}} or incompatibility {{also occurred}} in ancient China when the Buddhist idea of rebirth {{was first introduced}} to China. 1 Confucian scholar Fen-Chan (范縝AD. 450 [*]~[*] 515)keenly debated with Buddhist disciples, including a faithful Buddhist emperor Liang Wu Di (梁武帝AD. 464 [*]~[*] 549), about whether there is life after death.
