Thus the One produces determinate relations between magnitudes by making the indeterminacy of the Indefinite Dyad determinate, and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of determinate Twoness, which can from various perspectives {{be seen as the}} Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space is implicit in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E

This and the Hasty Pudding Club, an organization for performing amateur theatricals, are the two lions of Harvard. The Porcellian Club is hardly a place of resort for those who cultivate the intellect {{at the expense of the}} body. The list of active members is small, owing in part to the <b>largeness</b> of the annual subscription. The great desire of every student is to become a member of it... the doings of the club are shrouded in secrecy... All that can be said by a stranger who has been privileged to step behind the scenes is that the mysteries are rites which can be practised without much labor and yield a pleasure which is fraught with no unpleasant consequences.|$|E

However, Darwin wrote, [...] "I can by no means agree ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements.... Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that <b>largeness</b> of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely." ...|$|E

His {{building for the}} Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Broad Street was erected in 1872-76 {{in preparation for the}} Centennial Exposition. The exterior has a <b>largeness</b> of scale and a vigor in the detailing that would be notable anywhere, and the galleries are top-lit with exceptional efficiency. Still more original and impressive were his banks, even though they lay quite off the main line of development of commercial architecture in this period. The most extraordinary of these, and Furness's masterpiece, was the Provident Institution in Walnut [...] Street, built as late as 1879. This was most unfortunately demolished in the Philadelphia urban renewal campaign several years ago, but the gigantic and forceful scale of the granite membering alone should have justified its respectful preservation.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{piriformis}} muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it can compress or strangle the {{sciatic nerve}} beneath the muscle. Generally, conditions {{of this type}} {{are referred to as}} nerve entrapment or as entrapment neuropathies; the particular condition known as piriformis syndrome refers to sciatica symptoms not originating from spinal roots and/or spinal disc compression, but involving the overlying piriformis muscle. In 17% of an assumed normal population the sciatic nerve passes through the piriformis muscle, rather than underneath it; however, in patients undergoing surgery for suspected piriformis syndrome such an anomaly was found only 16.2% of the time leading to doubt {{about the importance of the}} anomaly as a factor in piriformis syndrome. Some researchers discount the importance of this relationship in the etiology of the syndrome. [...] Oddly, MRI findings have shown that both hypertrophy (unusual <b>largeness)</b> and atrophy (unusually smallness) of the piriformis muscle correlate with the supposed condition.|$|E
2500|$|Slate.com {{described}} Shatner's {{depiction of}} Kirk as an [...] "expansive, randy, faintly ridiculous, and yet supremely capable leader of men, Falstaffian in {{his love of}} life and <b>largeness</b> of spirit". The Myth of the American Superhero refers to Kirk as a [...] "superhuman redeemer" [...] who [...] "like a true superhero ... regularly escapes after risking battle with monsters or enemy spaceships". Although some episodes question Kirk's position as a hero, Star Trek [...] "never left the viewer in doubt for long". Others have commented that Kirk's exaggerated [...] "strength, intelligence, charm, and adventurousness" [...] make him unrealistic. Kirk is described as able to find ways [...] "through unanticipated problems to reach [...] goals" [...] and his leadership style is most [...] "appropriate in a tight, geographically identical team with a culture of strong leadership." [...] Although Roddenberry conceived the character as being [...] "in {{a very real sense}} ... 'married'" [...] to the Enterprise, Kirk has been noted for [...] "his sexual exploits with gorgeous females of every size, shape and type"; he has been called [...] "promiscuous" [...] and labeled a [...] "womanizer". The Last Lecture author Randy Pausch believed he became a better teacher, colleague, and husband because he watched Kirk run the Enterprise; Pausch wrote that [...] "for ambitious boys with a scientific bent, there could be no greater role model than James T. Kirk". David A. Goodman commented that Kirk [...] "has as much reality as possible for a fictional character." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{exploration}} of post-natal concerns begins in chapter 9 with {{a review of}} astrological factors that occur when children are not reared. This considers the indications of still births and babies that seem [...] "half-dead", or {{those that have been}} left exposed (including whether [...] there is possibility they may be taken up and live). Chapter 10 then details the techniques for establishing the length of life under normal circumstances. This is an important and lengthy passage of text, the techniques of which require precise astronomical detail and advanced knowledge of complex progressive techniques. Jim Tester has commented on how Ptolemy goes into [...] an unusual level of detail in a responsibility that Bouché-Leclercq described as [...] "the chief task of astrology, the operation judged most difficult by practitioners, most dangerous and damnable by its enemies". Such a prediction [...] involves judicial skill as well as mathematical expertise since several 'destructive' periods may be identified but countered by other, protective astrological influences, resulting in periods of danger or illness that does not lead to death. This is followed, in chapter 11, by the astrological principles from which judgement is made of bodily appearance and temperament. The planetary significations follow the logic of their humoral associations, so that Jupiter (associated with warmth and moisture, an humoral combination which promotes growth) gives <b>largeness</b> in bodily form. [...] Since these define, to some extent, predisposition towards bodily afflictions, there is a natural flow towards the content of chapter 12, which focuses on the astrological significators relating to injuries and diseases. The details of planetary associations with bodily organs and functions are given, such as Saturn ruling the spleen and Jupiter the lungs. Jim Tester has pointed out that several lists of this type exist [...] "more or less agreeing in detail".|$|E

The city stretches from Phulnakhara in south to Choudwar in north and Kandarpur in east to naraj in west while main city {{is located at}} the apex of the Mahanadi River delta. [...] Apart from Mahanadi, four of its distributaries also run through the city. The distributaries include Mahanadi, Kathajodi, Kuakhai and Birupa where Kathajodi further has two distributaries; the right being Devi while the left is Biluakhai. Mahanadi runs through the city on the northern side separating the main city from the Jagatpur Industrial Area. The Kathajodi river forms a riverine island of Bayalis Mouza after separating the main city from Gopalpur. The Kuakhai river separates {{the southern part of the}} city into two-halves, namely Pratap Nagri and the new township of Naranpur. The Kuakhai runs throughout the south of the city along Phulnakhara before entering Bhubaneswar. The Birupa river runs through the north of Jagatpur Industrial Area separating it from Choudwar. There are numerous ponds known as (pokharis) in the city that store rain water. The Mahanadi provides much of the drinking water to the city. Recent growth of the city has resulted in expansion across the Kathajodi River and a newer township towards the head of the delta formed between the tributary Kathajodi river and the main river Mahanadi has come up by the name of Markat Nagar (popularly known as CDA by the local residents) which is spread across 2000 acres. CDA has 15 sectors out of which 11 are residential & has population around [...] Jagatpur & Mahanadi vihar are the other two townships in the City. Mahanadi Vihar is the first satellite city project in Odisha. Cuttack is referred to as a city with Baaban Bazaar, Teppan Galee i.e. this is the city of 52 markets and 53 streets which is told by people of Odisha for the <b>largeness</b> of this city. Naranpur is another satellite township coming up in Trishulia, on the other side of Kathajodi River.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--'tis not our {{greatest}} doings {{that the world}} gets wind of," [...] said the furmity-woman, who, lately settled in this purlieu, sat among the rest.

60|$|Fourth. The enlightened {{understanding}} sees <b>largeness</b> {{enough in}} the promises to encourage it to pray; which still adds to it strength to strength.

60|$|The {{word had}} told him another thing; namely, {{that he should be}} king in his stead.

6000|$|This <b>largeness</b> of {{the heart}} and mercy of God towards his people, is also {{signified}} by the spreading out of his hand to us in the invitations of the gospel.

6000|$|I {{suppose the}} {{intention}} of the phrase [...] "finding salvation," [...] as religious people use it, is very much this experience.
