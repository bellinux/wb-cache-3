Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in.

5000|$|We had a {{political}} problem with Russia on that film.

Communism was not something we desired. So we stayed a way from politics and made it a people's battle.

In July 2009, he was placed joint fifth with Coronation Street's Kevin Webster on the best soap characters list in 2009. Deller said [...] "Both characters have been underrated 'good guys' for much of their tenure on the shows and deserve some credit for that. That's not the main reason they've made this month's chart though - it's because <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> the forums seem to have owned up to fancying these guys this month - and in a poor month for storylines and characterisation, being a DILF is qualification enough to get you into our top five.|$|R

The clubs have been crowded, but mostly not too crowded, with a great energy at shows around town and out on the street.

It {{seemed like a good}} idea at the time to have 40 people singing at once. I've no idea why. ... Every time you think to yourself 'Do we really want to go this far?' and you say to Jim, 'Jim, are you sure about this?' and anybody else will go 'Don't do it!', Jim goes 'More! More!

She meets a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> her way and most of them try to help her while others are surprisingly apathetic to her situation. Eventually, the movie takes a turn when the girl looks into the camera for the first time, breaking the fourth wall, and someone shouts from off-screen, [...] "Mina, don't look into the camera!" [...] The movie is a real life capture of events thereon (or that is how it seems). Mina announces that she doesn't want to act in the movie any more and wants to go home.

5000|$|... "Comets of Kandahar", {{one of four}} {{instrumental}}s on the album, {{also had}} its origins in Afghanistan: [...] "An instrumental piece isn’t really about anything, {{but you have to}} come up with names for these things. So the title came from something one of the Canadian soldiers said to me while we were standing there watching—what I learned was kind of a nightly pleasure for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> the base—the jet fighters taking off constantly, twenty-four hours a day, for missions or patrols. They go off in pairs, thirty seconds apart, and after dark you can’t see them; you just hear a roar. But a moment later you’ll see the flame, from the tail cone, coming out of the fighter. And that’s all you can see. There’s this glowing purplish cone flying across the sky. Everyone stops to look at this because it’s a beautiful sight. So there we are standing, a bunch of us, and we’re all looking at it, and the soldier standing next to me said, 'The comets of Kandahar.' So that became the title of the piece." ...|$|E

It's hard to imagine a kid being able to come back down to reality." [...] A Grazia fashion editor complained on Twitter that a large bow worn by Gevinson had blocked her view of a runway during fashion week.

[...] Gevinson later remarked: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> the Internet have a problem with a young person doing well.
