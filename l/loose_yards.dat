25|$|In November 1938, in an {{incident}} of mass hysteria, many residents believed a serial killer, the Halifax Slasher, {{was on the}} <b>loose.</b> Scotland <b>Yard</b> concluded there were no attacks after several locals admitted they had inflicted wounds on themselves.|$|R
60|$|The mate at {{the helm}} saw also, for he blew his whistle, a sign at which the anchor was slipped--there {{was no time to}} lift it--and men who were waiting on the <b>yards</b> <b>loosed</b> the {{lashings}} of certain sails, so that almost immediately the ship began to move.|$|R
60|$|Gradually {{the fire}} of the Indians ceased, and the {{defenders}} were able to leave the loop-holes. Two of the men went down and fastened up the cattle, which were still standing <b>loose</b> in the <b>yard</b> inside the stockade; the other set to to prepare a meal, for Mrs. Welch could not take her eyes off the canoe.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Titans managed to score 17 points {{and keep the}} Jaguars {{scoreless}} for that quarter. Kicker Rob Bironas made a field goal from 27 yards out. Later, Cortland Finnegan returned a <b>loose</b> ball 92 <b>yards</b> for a touchdown. Later, Chris Hope intercepted the ball and returned it 61 yards for another touchdown. At {{the end of the}} third quarter, the Titans were up by 14 points.|$|R
50|$|The Bills' {{next game}} {{was at home}} against the Steelers, where they {{continued}} to struggle. Near {{the end of the}} first quarter, Travis Henry fumbled in Steeler territory, and Dewayne Washington returned the <b>loose</b> ball 63 <b>yards</b> for a touchdown to open the scoring, 7-0. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers broke open the game with running back Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala running in for a 22 yard touchdown to make it 20-3.|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} between the shore and the schooner being very short, the boat was quickly alongside, and the party, under stout Ole Thorwald, took possession of their prize. Meanwhile Gascoyne had set the jib and fore-topsail, which latter had been left hanging <b>loose</b> from the <b>yard,</b> so that by hauling out the sheets slowly and with great care, the thing was done without noise. The cable was then cut, the boat manned, and the Foam glided out of the bay like a phantom ship.|$|R

6000|$|The {{beach was}} quite near, {{and in this}} quarter {{altogether}} uninhabited; so down we ran, and, at cable's length, saw little Jule gliding past--top-gallant-sails hoisting, and a boy aloft with one leg thrown over the <b>yard,</b> <b>loosing</b> the fore-royal. The decks were all life and commotion; the sailors on the forecastle singing [...] "Ho, cheerly men!" [...] as they catted the anchor; and the gallant Jennin, bare-headed as his wont, standing up on the bowsprit, and issuing his orders. By {{the man at the}} helm stood Captain Guy, very quiet and gentlemanly, and smoking a cigar.|$|R

I made a clove-hitch round his tail, d'ye see, and got the end of it slung over the spar and fastened, so as I couldn't lose him. Then I set to work and I ate him in a week right up to his back fin, and I drank the rain that fell on my coat, and when I was picked up by the Gracie of Gloucester, I was that fat that I could scarce climb aboard. That's what Ephraim Savage means, my lad, when he says that he is a baddish man to beat." ...|$|R
60|$|By nightfall of {{that day}} the two hotels of Glenford were crowded, the {{visitors}} being generally connected with newspapers. On the next day {{there was a great}} deal of travel on the turnpike, and old Jane was kept very busy, the captain having resigned the entire business of toll-taking to her. Everybody stopped, asked questions, and requested to see the captain; and many drove through and came back again, hoping to have better luck next time. But their luck was always bad; old Jane would say nothing; and the captain and Olive were not to be seen. The gate to the little front garden was locked, and there was no passing through the tollhouse. To keep people from getting over the fence a bulldog, which the captain kept at the barn, was turned <b>loose</b> in the <b>yard.</b>|$|R
40|$|Animal welfare versus costs? – Assessment {{of dairy}} housing systems Animal welfare plays an {{important}} role in organic agriculture. The EEC-regulations lead to high standards: e. g. <b>loose</b> housing, outside <b>yards</b> and pasture for cattle. Loose housing systems for dairy cows mainly differ in the design of the lying area (cubicles, bedded-sloped floor, deep litter/straw yard). In this paper, animal welfare and economic aspects of these systems are confronted. Results from own behavioural observations on 40 farms and calculations of profitability are presented. With regard to most behaviour variables obser-ved, straw yards and sloped floors proved most adequate, followed by comfortable cubic-les. Traditional cubicle houses had the most adverse effects on behaviour. The same order was found for lesions. However, the economic calculations showed, that the straw yard system led to the highest costs, followed by the cubicle house with slatted floors, the sloped floor and cubicle houses with concrete passageways. Therefore, a higher welfare level will lead to higher costs, at least partially...|$|R
50|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their {{embarrassing}} road {{loss to the}} Steelers, the Seahawks went home for Sunday Night football, as they hosted the winless New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as a blocked punt would result in New Orleans RB Pierre Thomas returning the <b>loose</b> ball 5 <b>yards</b> for a touchdown, along with the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the 'Hawks continued to trail as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Eric Johnson, while WR Lance Moore got a 7-yard TD run. The Seahawks would respond with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Ben Obomanu. However, New Orleans {{went back to work}} with Brees completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston. Seattle would end the half with kicker Josh Brown getting a 52-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, the 'Hawks tried to rally in the fourth quarter, but all they could get was Hasselbeck's 22-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson.|$|R
50|$|The replay a {{week later}} on 16 August 2003 showed early signs that it may {{live up to the}} frenetic pace of the drawn encounter. After John Gardner and Niall McCarthy had given Cork an early two point lead, Wexford's Mitch Jordan pounced on some {{uncertainty}} in the Cork defence and cheekily flicked the sliotar past Donal Óg Cusack in the Cork net for the opening goal of the game. A long puck out from Damien Fitzhenry was met by more shaky Cork defending, and as the ball broke <b>loose</b> about 20 <b>yards</b> out, it was hit first time by Larry Murphy whose shot was too hard for Cusack to stop. Unfazed, Cork stuck to their game plan and were back in the game when Alan Browne struck low, through a forest of legs, and across the goal past Fitzhenry. The goal count was brought level soon afterwards when Timmy McCarthy latched onto an Alan Browne hand pass. Wexford trailed by 2-8 to 2-3 at the interval, however, as Diarmuid O'Sullivan and Seán Óg Ó hAilpín shored up the defence, Cork {{went on to win the}} second half by 1-9 to 0-4.|$|R

50|$|Recap:The Panthers {{took the}} lead in the first quarter with a rushing {{touchdown}} by Graham. Buffalo's offense struggled to gain any yardage on the ground or in the air. Early in the second quarter, Pittsburgh missed a 32-yard field goal. One Panther drive later, and Pittsburgh would miss a 47-yard field goal. Once the Bulls got the ball back, Peter Farning kicked a 40-yard field goal, putting Buffalo on the scoreboard. Both defenses remained strong throughout the first half of play. The Bulls got the ball first in the third quarter. Chazz Anderson, Buffalo's starting QB, drove for 49 yards before being intercepted by Pittsburgh's defense. Ray Graham of the Panther's would later punch in a rushing touchdown to go ahead 14-3. The next drive, Anderson lead a Buffalo drive that would take them to the end-zone. The score was then 14-10. Pittsburgh would soon answer back however, with a 5-yard rushing touchdown by Ray Graham. Going into the fourth quarter, Buffalo's running back, Branden Oliver, would punch in a 1-yard touchdown. The Bulls tried a 2-point conversion, but failed to make the score 21-16. Pittsburgh answered back yet again however with a quick 6 play, 60-yard drive that would end in a touchdown. On the next drive, the Bulls gained 42 yards, but failed to convert on fourth down, forcing them to turn over. On the next drive, Ray Graham broke <b>loose</b> for 75 <b>yards,</b> and later punched in a touchdown with a 1-yard gain. The end score was 35-16, Pittsburgh.|$|R
50|$|The match {{began at}} a quick pace. After just two-and-a-half minutes the ball broke <b>loose</b> about 25 <b>yards</b> {{out from the}} Limerick goal. Bernie Forde {{collected}} and went on a solo-run before kicking the ball past Tommy Quaid and into the Limerick net for the first goal of the day. Five minutes later Joe Connolly was fouled just outside the 21-yard line. He pointed from the resultant free to give Galway a four-point lead. It was all Galway {{at this early stage}} as Michael Connolly sent in a good cross to the far post from the Hogan Stand side where it was collected by an unchallenged P. J. Molloy. He made no mistake in sending the ball into the net to put Galway 2-1 to no score up. Limerick's response was immediate. A high lob towards the left of the square saw Éamonn Cregan get in a neat overhead strike to send the ball into the net for his sides' first goal of the game. Two minutes later Cregan added a point from a free to put Limerick back on track. Cregan was a one-man show at this stage. A minute later a great ball out of defence by Mossie Carroll found Cregan down on the left wing. A cheeky dummy fooled full-back Conor Hayes before Cregan popped over a point from 45 yards. Galway responded with a succession of neat points. John Connolly and Noel Lane all got their names on the score sheet. Cregan stepped up again to respond for Limerick with a point from 55 yards. Joe Connolly negated this point almost immediately. His brother John then got one of the scores of the day when he pointed from 50 yards out on the touch line. Brian Carroll, who had just entered the play, then popped up to become Limerick's second scorer with a point. Both sides exchanged points in the final minute, courtesy of Cregan and Lane. At half-time the score read Galway 2-7, Limerick 1-5.|$|R
