5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing <b>loose</b> <b>sediment</b> and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E

25|$|As {{the glacier}} first retreated and melted, {{large amounts of}} highly erodible, {{fine-grained}} sediment dropped out in relatively high mountain valleys. The availability of this fine-grained, <b>loose</b> <b>sediment</b> combined with a high gradient to turn a newly forming Kobuk River into a fast-working sediment transport system. The river picked up glacial till from its upper reaches and transported it downstream until the gradient diminished. When the river encountered flatter ground, it deposited its sediment load resulting {{in the creation of}} broad, flat floodplains, alluvial fans, and meander bends through aggradation.|$|E

500|$|The Shinano River has a {{long history}} in Honshu, and along with other rivers in the region, has has a {{significant}} affect on the geography and ecology of the area. Originally the Shinano River would have drained straight into an estuary-like Fukushima lagoon before making its way into the Sea of Japan after flowing down from the Japanese Alps. Over centuries of sediments being brought downstream, a marshy plain formed in the lagoon into what is currently the Echigo Plain. Estimates presented in 1993 place the amount of <b>loose</b> <b>sediment</b> in the river system at [...] The construction of diversion channels have limited the upkeep required to keep a navigable passage between the Niigata port and the open ocean; however, a consequence of diverting sediment has been that the northern coast of Niigata Prefecture (which includes Niigata and its port) is receding by an average [...] per year (measured from 1947 to 1975) due to sediment being released well-south of the river's original mouth in Niigata.|$|E
2500|$|Detailed {{studies by}} E. Davaud and A. Strasser of Holocene limestones {{currently}} exposed on North Bimini and Joulter Cays (Bahamas) reveal {{the sequence of}} events likely responsible for creating beachrock pavements like the Bimini Road. First, a complete beach sequence of shallow subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal carbonate sediments accumulated as the shoreline of North Bimini built seaward during part of the Holocene. Once the deposition of these sediments built the North Bimini's shoreline seaward, freshwater cementation of the carbonate occurred at some depth, possibly even a metre or so below sea level, beneath the island's surface. This cementation created a band consisting of a thick primary layer of semilithified sediments and thinner discontinuous lenses and layers of similar semilithified sediments beneath it. Later, when erosion of the island's shoreline occurred, the band of semilithifed sediment was exposed within the intertidal zone and the semilithified sediments were cemented into beachrock. As the sediments underlying the eroding shoreline was eroded down to Pleistocene limestone, the beachrock broke into flat-lying, tabular, and rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks as observed for modern beaches within the Bahamas by E. Davaud and A. Strasser. Thinner layers of beachrock underlying the primary bed of beachrock were also broken up as the loose sediments enclosing them and the thicker primary bed were eroded. As the <b>loose</b> <b>sediment</b> was scoured out from under the blocks and other pieces of beachrock by so-called [...] "scour and settling processes", they dropped downward for several meters until they rested directly on the erosion-resistant Pleistocene limestone as an erosional lag. Eugene Shinn discusses a similar, but not identical, process by which the Bimini Road could have been created.|$|E

50|$|Ocean {{processes}} grade <b>loose</b> <b>sediments</b> to particle sizes {{other than}} sand, such as gravel or cobbles. Waves breaking {{on a beach}} can leave a berm, which is a raised ridge of coarser pebbles or sand, at the high tide mark. Shingle beaches are made of particles larger than sand, such as cobbles, or small stones. These beaches make poor habitats. Little life survives because the stones are churned and pounded together by waves and currents.|$|R

50|$|Terrain {{inversion}} {{can also}} happen without cementation by groundwater, however. If a surface is being eroded by wind, the necessary contrast in erodibility can arise simply from variations in grain size of <b>loose</b> <b>sediments.</b> Since wind can carry away sand but not cobbles, for example, a channel bed rich in cobbles could form an inverted ridge {{if it was}} originally surrounded by much finer sediments, even if the sediments were not cemented. This effect has been invoked for channels in Saheki Crater.|$|R

The Aileu formation consists of phyllite, schist, amphibolite, slate, and some volcanic rocks with a thickness of 300  m spread over almost the entire area, and conglomerates, sand, and clay act as an Ainaro formation with 100  m thickness in a small area in the southwest part.|$|R

For a period of time, a very similar soil was recognized as the Rocklin series which differed from the San Joaquin series only in having thick, consolidated sediments beneath its hardpan, opposed to <b>looser</b> <b>sediments</b> beneath the San Joaquin hardpan.

50|$|Erosion {{by moving}} water {{can happen in}} two ways. Firstly, the {{movement}} of water across the bed exerts a shear stress directly onto the bed. If the cohesive strength of the substrate {{is lower than the}} shear exerted, or the bed is composed of <b>loose</b> <b>sediment</b> which can be mobilized by such stresses, then the bed will be lowered purely by clearwater flow. However, if the river carries significant quantities of sediment, this material can act as tools to enhance wear of the bed (abrasion). At the same time the fragments themselves are ground down, becoming smaller and more rounded (attrition).|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} the members of the Gadilida are usually glassy-smooth in {{addition}} to being quite narrow and with a reduced aperture. This along with other structures of their anatomy allows them to move with surprising speed through <b>loose</b> <b>sediment</b> to escape potential bottom-dwelling predators. The Dentalids, on the other hand, tend to have strongly ribbed and often rather rough shells. When they sense vibrations anywhere around them, their defensive response is to freeze. This makes them harder to detect by animals such as ratfish which can sense the electrical signals given off by the most minute muscle movement.|$|E
