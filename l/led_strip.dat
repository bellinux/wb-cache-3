40|$|Previous {{study and}} our {{laboratory}} {{have reported that}} short-wavelength (blue and green) light and combination stimulate broiler growth. However, short-wavelength stimuli could have negative effects on poultry husbandry workers. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of human-friendly yellow LED light, which is acceptable to humans and close to green light, on broiler growth. We also aimed to investigate the potential quantitative relationship between the wavelengths of light used for artificial illumination and growth parameters in broilers. After hatching, 360 female chicks ("Meihuang" were evenly divided into six lighting treatment groups: white <b>LED</b> <b>strips</b> (400 - 700 nm, WL); red <b>LED</b> <b>strips</b> (620 nm, RL); yellow <b>LED</b> <b>strips</b> (580 nm, YL); green <b>LED</b> <b>strips</b> (514 nm, GL); blue <b>LED</b> <b>strips</b> (455 nm, BL); and fluorescent strips (400 - 700 nm, FL). From 30 to 72 days of age, broilers reared under YL and GL were heavier than broilers treated with FL (P 0. 05). Moreover, YL significantly improved feeding efficiency when compared with GL and BL at 45 and 60 days of age (P < 0. 05). In addition, we found an age-dependent effect of light spectra on broiler growth and a quantitative relationship between LED light spectra (455 to 620 nm) and the live body weights of broilers. The wavelength of light (455 to 620 nm) was found to be negatively related (R 2 = 0. 876) to live body weight at an early stage of development, whereas the wavelength of light (455 to 620 nm) was found to be positively correlated with live body weight (R 2 = 0. 925) in older chickens. Our results demonstrated that human-friendly yellow LED light (YL), which is friendly to the human, {{can be applied to the}} broilers production...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Overview of our {{practical}} and low-cost tracking solution using ceiling mounted <b>LED</b> <b>strips.</b> In this paper {{we present a}} novel approach for tracking the move-ment of a user in a large indoor environment. Many studies show that natural walking in virtual environments increases the feeling of immersion by the users. However, most tracking systems suf-fer from a limited working area or are expensive to scale up to a reasonable size for navigation. Our system {{is designed to be}} easily scalable both in working area and number of simultaneous users using inexpensive off-the-shelf components. To accomplish this, the system determines the 6 DOF pose using passive <b>LED</b> <b>strips,</b> mounted to the ceiling, which are spatially encoded using De Bruijn codes. A camera mounted {{to the head of the}} user records these patterns. The camera can deter-mine its own pose independently, so no restriction on the number of tracked objects is required. The system is accurate to a fewmillime-ters in location and less than a degree in orientation. The accuracy of the tracker is furthermore independent of the size of the working area which makes it scalable to enormous installations. To provide a realistic feeling of immersion, the system is developed to be real-time and is only limited by the framerate of the camera, currently at 60 Hz...|$|R

50|$|<b>LED</b> <b>strips</b> are not {{dimmable}} in {{the conventional}} sense. Attempting to vary {{the brightness of the}} LEDs by changing the external voltage is impractical. However, they can be dimmed using pulse-width modulation (PWM) dimmers. These rapidly switch the LEDs on and off, typically 20 times per second, by changing the voltage from zero to the expected value as a square wave. The relative width of the on and off portions of the square wave can be varied so that the LEDs are on or off for relatively more or less time, leading to a perceived (and to some extent real, with phosphor-coated LEDs) change in the brightness.|$|R

5000|$|<b>LED</b> <b>strip</b> lights most {{commonly}} operate on 12 or 24 volts of direct current from a power supply, {{sometimes referred to}} as a driver. USB strip lights operate on the standard 5-volt direct current used by USB devices. Mains voltage LED strips are also available. These have the advantages of being usable in much longer single runs without a brightness drop along the length, but are less flexible and heavier due to higher voltage and current ratings and thick coatings for shock safety and high IP ratings in their intended outdoor positions, with limited cut points. No separate power supply is needed, although there must be a rectifier between the mains supply {{and the end of the}} LED strip.The most common PCB designs use multiple parallel circuits consisting of passive dropper resistors in series with a certain number of LED SMDs, to operate at a certain current and power level with the expected input voltage. This design is referred to as constant-voltage and is rather sensitive to small variations in input voltage and to the voltage drop that occurs along long lengths of strip when driven from a single power input. Alternative design is the [...] "constant current" [...] design where each parallel circuit of several SMDs includes a small integrated circuit to provide a fix current to that group of LEDs, within a wide range of applied voltages. This allows the strip to operate at the same power level and brightness along its entire length, or with some variation in the driver voltage.|$|E
