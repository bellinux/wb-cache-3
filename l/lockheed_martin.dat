5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> experienced delays during the production changes {{to make new}} external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, {{making it impossible for}} them to produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for Atlantis, and one for Endeavour for an emergency rescue mission, if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8B {{is to be}} {{replaced}} by the F-35B version of the <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> F-35 Lightning II, which was planned to enter service in 2012. The USMC had sought a replacement since the 1980s, and has argued strongly in favor of the development of the F-35B. The Harrier's performance in Iraq, including its ability to use forward operating bases, reinforced the need for a V/STOL aircraft in the USMC arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{government}} {{plans to}} replace the Hornet force with seventy-two <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> F-35 LightningII fighters. Under the Defence Materiel Organisation's Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B, the first Lightnings will be delivered to the RAAF in late 2018.

5|$|Both {{carriers}} will {{be completed}} as originally planned, in a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) configuration, deploying the <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> F-35B. Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the British government had intended to purchase the F-35C carrier version of this aircraft, and adopted plans for Prince of Wales to be built to a Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. After the projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate, the government {{announced that it would}} revert to the original design on 10 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) {{produced}} 232 Block 30/40/50 F-16s on a production line in Ankara under license for the Turkish Air Force. TAI also produced 46 Block 40s for Egypt {{in the mid-1990s}} and 30 Block 50 from 2010. Korean Aerospace Industries opened a production line for the KF-16 program, producing 140 Block 52s from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (decade). If India had selected the F-16IN for its Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft procurement, a sixth F-16 production line would be built in India. In May 2013, <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> stated there were currently enough orders to keep producing the F-16 until 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} AgustaWestland and <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> was {{selected}} as the winners of the US VXX competition to replace the President's Marine One helicopters of the United States Marine Corps. A variant of the AW101, designated VH-71 Kestrel, was to be manufactured domestically and had proceeded into the flight testing stages. However the programme encountered significant cost overruns and political opposition, which led to the procurement being scrapped in June 2009. Separately, the Marine Corps had also conducted studies into the adoption of the EH101 as a fallback option to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, a {{group of}} current and veteran members of No.75 Squadron {{travelled}} to Papua New Guinea to commemorate the 60th anniversary {{of the end of}} the Pacific War, and the 63rd anniversary of the Battle of Milne Bay. As at 2011, No.75 Squadron remained at Tindal and was the RAAF's largest F/A-18-equipped unit. The squadron regularly exercises with units from the RMAF, RNZAF, RSAF and US Military and conducts training using the facilities of the Delamere Air Weapons Range. As of 2014, No. 75 Squadron is scheduled to transition to <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> F-35A Lightning II fighters from late 2021.|$|E
5|$|Italy has {{opted to}} extend the Tornado's service life {{at the expense of}} {{alternative}} ground-attack aircraft such as the AMX International AMX; in 2010 a major upgrade and life extension program was initiated, which will provide new digital displays, Link 16 communications capability, night-vision goggles compatibility, and several other upgrades. In the long term, it is planned to replace the Tornado IDS/ECR fleet in Italian service with the <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> F-35 Lightning II, with the final Italian Tornado scheduled to be phased out in 2025.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 2003, AgustaWestland {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Bell Helicopter to undertake final assembly of the US101 in the U.S. Under the pact, AgustaWestland would produce the main rotor blades and main fuselage sections at its Yeovil, UK, facility. The company would also manufacture other components, including the gearbox, at its Cascina Costa, Italy facility; this represents a work share of 36 per cent. The remaining 64 per cent work share was split between <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> (31 per cent) and Bell Helicopter (27 per cent) and other firms (6 per cent).|$|E
5|$|Prime {{contractor}} <b>Lockheed</b> <b>Martin</b> Aeronautics manufactured {{the majority}} of the airframe and performed final assembly at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia; program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provided additional airframe components as well as avionics integration and training systems. F-22 production was split up over many subcontractors across 46 states to increase Congressional support, though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays. Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost. Production supported over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers and up to 95,000 jobs.|$|E
