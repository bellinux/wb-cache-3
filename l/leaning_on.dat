5|$|Ono {{released}} her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured {{a photo of}} her <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise in lieu of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 {{there are}} two public statues of Formby. The first, by the Manx artist Amanda Barton, is in Douglas, Isle of Man, and shows him <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a lamp-post and dressed in the {{motorcycle}} leathers of a TT racer. Barton was also commissioned to provide a second statue for the Lancashire town of Wigan, which was unveiled in September 2007 in the town's Grand Arcade shopping centre.|$|E

5|$|In 1556, amid great pomp, and <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> the {{shoulder}} {{of one of his}} favorites (the 24-year-old William, Count of Nassau and Orange), Charles gave away his lands and his offices. The Spanish empire, which included Spain, the Netherlands, Naples, Milan and Spain's possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip. His brother, Ferdinand, who had negotiated the treaty in the previous year, was already in possession of the Austrian lands and was also the obvious candidate to succeed Charles as Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|Saxobeats was commercialized {{with three}} {{different}} covers shot by Andrei Nemirschi. For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one of her hands being attached to her head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on her shoulders against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Church {{dates from}} the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled {{sandstone}} tower, a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross-legged and <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> one elbow, in 15th century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} the album with producers Michael Angelo, Focus..., and Jake and the Phatman, among others. He {{also worked with}} singer-songwriter Joi, former Tony! Toni! Toné! member D'wayne Wiggins, singer-songwriter Teedra Moses, singer Dawn Robinson, formerly of Saadiq's other group Lucy Pearl, singer-songwriter Babyface, and rapper Allie Baba, Saadiq's nephew. The album's title is a reference to his mother's nickname for him, also a childhood name. Its cover artwork {{was inspired by the}} blaxploitation films of the 1970s. It shows Saadiq dressed in a vintage cornflower blue suit, knicker pants, and lime green argyle socks, while <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a white 1967 Mercury Cougar.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{opens with}} a shot of a sea, and Stan laying on a rock {{with a pair of}} white boots {{designed}} with her name on them. Subsequently, she is seen dancing in a place sprayed with graffiti and sporting an orange swimsuit paired with a bright blue jacket. Next, while a few males are playing basketball in front of her, she is portrayed watching and interacting with them while wearing a khaki jacket with denim short shorts, a white vest top and white shoes. After the singer and the others further walk through their surrounding and perform to the track, the visual ends with Stan <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a wall from the beginning.|$|E

Paul is a critic of the [...] "War on Drugs" [...] and does not believe marijuana users should be put in jail. He supports the legalization of hemp for industrial purposes.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> {{a table in}} an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus {{seems to be on}} his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and {{the figure of the}} boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{produced}} by Mike Shipley on a considerable budget and marked {{a significant change in}} Winger's sound, eschewing their glam metal anthems prevalent in their first two albums for a harder and more aggressive style of music with a good dose of socio-political <b>leanings</b> <b>on</b> tracks like [...] "Blind Revolution Mad", [...] "In for the Kill", and [...] "Who's the One". The material was also less commercial and radio friendly, evident especially in the track [...] "Junkyard Dog (Tears on Stone)" [...] incorporating contemporary heavy metal and progressive elements and clocking in at 6:54.|$|R
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Trainor <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> a bed reciting the song's lyrics, {{interspersed}} with scenes of dolls {{and a young}} girl and boy having a tea party. As the video progresses, Trainor proceeds to fail at her attempt to bake pies, setting a pie on fire. Trainor is then shown scrubbing the kitchen floor. The entire video is interspersed with scenes of a singing and dancing barbershop quartet. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} video, Trainor tests potential suitors. The first date cooks her a meal consisting of a small portion of scallops, which fails to impress Trainor. The second potential suitor takes her to a carnival and tries to impress her with his strength, which also fails to impress Trainor. The third date takes her boating, with the boat nearly capsizing and Trainor getting seasick. This also fails to impress Trainor. Finally, Trainor meets Charlie Puth on the online dating service, PlentyofFish. Puth comes to Trainor's home with a carryout pizza, which succeeds in impressing Trainor. The video ends with Trainor smiling and inviting Puth into her home.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> the outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E
