He furthermore stated that in these two stories, Tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with the new political climate. He stated that in this story, Hergé [...] "abandons the complex plotting of The Secret of the Unicorn in favour of an episodic style of adventure not seen since the early books". Thompson further draws attention to the arrival of Calculus in the story, describing him as the [...] "third and final member" [...] of Tintin's [...] "family". Thompson was critical of the use of colour in the story, stating that much of it <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> in black-and-white, as it was originally printed in Le Soir.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} and sounds were {{also met with}} muted enthusiasm. Kasavin complained of Deus Exs relatively sub-par graphics, blaming them on the game's [...] "incessantly dark industrial environments." [...] GamePro reviewer Chris Patterson {{took the time to}} note that despite being [...] "solid acoustically," [...] Deus Ex had moments of weakness. He poked fun at JC's [...] "Joe Friday, 'just the facts, deadpan," [...] and the [...] "truly cheesy accents" [...] of minor characters in Hong Kong and New York City. IGN called the graphics [...] "blocky", adding that [...] "the animation is stiff, and the dithering is just plain awful in some spots," [...] referring to the limited capabilities of the Unreal Engine used to design the game. the website, later on, stated that [...] "overall Deus Ex certainly <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> than your average game." ...|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 {{received}} critical acclaim. The improved graphics {{in particular}} were noted. Trent Ward of IGN complimented the [...] "amazing" [...] graphics and commented that it <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> {{than the first}} game, but criticized the lack of major changes. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot too praised the graphical improvements over the original, and also highly commended the sound, but criticized the lack of gameplay changes compared to the first game. [...] The gameplay was praised as [...] "outstanding" [...] by William Harms of the American PC Gamer magazine, but he also commented that multiplayer has glitches and oversights such as {{not being able to}} get back to the main menu after a game. Jason Cross of Computer Games Strategy Plus commended the gameplay and echoed others' views on the graphical improvements, but criticized the high system requirements. A reviewer from Game Revolution liked the graphics, scenarios, and humor. Another reviewer who liked the graphics was Chad Foster of Gamezilla, who also commended the [...] "incredible" [...] detail, and the [...] "realistic" [...] sounds. Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World praised the dark humor, but criticized the short campaign. The game was awarded its Editor's Choice award, and in 2000, a Best Voice Acting award.|$|E

[...] Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly praised the video {{saying that it}} [...] "shows Madonna looking the best she has since at least 2005's video for 'Hung Up'. Of course there is the {{requisite}} writhing, hip grinding, a rousing dance sequence, and a smoldering mantourage. It is, in a word, awesome". HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, looking as if she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video.

500|$|The battle {{system in}} Medieval: Total War was {{considered}} by many reviewers to be {{the highlight of the}} game. In their review, Eurogamer felt [...] "The sensation of scale and drama in these conflicts is incredible", praising the visual effects and combat. The different battlefields and their environments were praised by IGN, with ActionTrip agreeing that [...] "Medieval: Total War <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> than Shogun", adding that the terrain and units are more detailed than those in Shogun: Total War. GameSpot praised the realistic battles, mentioning that the real-world battlefield considerations like fatigue, ammunition, facing, and morale included in the game was a [...] "welcome change". GameSpy also stated the [...] "chaotic" [...] battles were appropriate to the era, but criticised the siege aspect, claiming it to be [...] "too plain and underwhelming", with a lack of detail compared to the other 3D elements. The soundtrack to the game was well received by IGN, [...] "The soundtrack is full of rousing context-sensitive orchestra moments which get you in the mood for bloody slaughter" [...] commenting it is fitting for a game that [...] "delivers body counts like no other" [...] ActionTrip also admired how the game's music changed pace as the battle commenced, praising The Creative Assembly for its [...] "masterfully placed audio and visual effects". The artificial intelligence for Medieval: Total War was thought to be much improved over its predecessor, CGW mentioning the AI was intelligent enough to prevent brute force alone from winning fights. Criticism was received on the larger battles giving low frame rates and performance, while ActionTrip also noted several unit management issues with path-finding and unit facing, stating [...] "it's demoralising to see archers facing the wrong way".|$|E
500|$|The Tenjho Tenge anime is {{described}} as a significantly toned down version of the Japanese manga, but still retains most of the spirit of its predecessor. Much of the nudity was removed by the animators, but was made up in the way of sexual innuendos, gratuitous cleavage, and panty shots. Since the anime is a close adaptation to the manga, critique of the plot is comparable to the manga's. Some reviewers felt that the anime was handled in a frantic and ill-planned manner that made the conclusion not satisfactory even with the original video animation. The animation done by Madhouse is considered to be well done. They used bright vibrant colors, solid backgrounds and plenty of visible detail with very little pixelation or jagged movement, but at times used repeated character shots and animations. The animation done during the fight scenes is done in real time and is done as close to reality as possible while still bending, and often violating, the laws of physics. [...] The early fight scenes are thought to be the [...] "...most intense seen in recent anime" [...] by Kevin Gilvear of DVD Times. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network affirmed the quality of animation in these scenes does drop somewhat over time, but the action still <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> than the average fighting anime. Both the Japanese and English voice acting are considered to be good, but the English dub at times can be a little uneven. The English dub on occasion has poor dialogue, according to Anime News Network's Patrick King, which causes it to lose much of the anime's sincerity. Overall, the anime is considered to be above average, but suffers from a lack of a good ending, mainly because the anime only covered the first arc of the story.|$|E

Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Deol took a hiatus {{from acting}} and {{returned}} to the screen in 2004 in Kismat opposite Priyanka Chopra. In Bardaasht, a drama based on the screenplay written by Vikram Bhatt, Deol starred alongside Lara Dutta and Rahul Dev as Aditya Shrivastav, a deserted army officer. The film deals with themes of police brutality and corruption and justice. Deol then played another army officer, a Lieutenant Commander in Anil Sharma's [...] Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo as Kunaljit Singh/Vikramjeet Singh. The film, which featured some prominent Bollywood actors such as Amitabh Bachchan (who played a general and Deol's father), and Akshay Kumar, it was arguably Deol's highest profile film to date but despite high box office expectations it was a commercial failure. His most famous role of all time was in Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo, when he wore a pugh/turban. That gave him more of an audience from the Punjabi crowd, and inspired comments saying he <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> in a turban.|$|E
2500|$|Apple iMac was {{introduced}} in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted [...] "the back of our computer <b>looks</b> <b>better</b> than the front of anyone else's." [...] Described as [...] "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers – {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).|$|E
