500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped {{to a low of}} just 19percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> numbers and accusations of being [...] "the worst president," [...] Bush would say, [...] "I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2009, Newsom {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run for governor of California in the 2010 election. In September 2009, he received the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton. During the campaign, Newsom remarked that, if elected, he'd like to be referred to as [...] "The Gavinator" [...] (a reference to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's nickname, [...] "The Governator"). Throughout the campaign, however, Newsom suffered <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> numbers, trailing Democratic frontrunner Jerry Brown by more than 20 points in most polls. In October 2009, Newsom dropped out of the gubernatorial race.|$|E
2500|$|Borisov {{founded a}} new {{political}} party, GERB in December 2006 (in English Coat of Arms, derived from [...] "Grazhdani za evropeisko razvitie na Bulgariya" [...] or [...] "Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria"). GERB won the first Bulgarian European Parliament elections on 20 May 2007, despite a very <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> attendance and turnout of 28.6%, which prompted Borisov to voice his wish for early parliamentary elections. Following a party congress in January 2010, Borisov became the official leader of GERB (of {{which he had been}} only an [...] "informal leader"), thus replacing Tsvetan Tsvetanov, who had served under Borisov at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and later as a vice-mayor of Sofia.|$|E
50|$|Paul {{received}} 1.23% of {{the vote}} in the Puerto Rico primary, coming in sixth, his <b>lowest</b> <b>polling</b> of any territory during the campaign.|$|R
50|$|Labour leader Andrew Little had led Labour since 2014 {{and after}} several <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> results {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire from the leadership following intense media speculation.|$|R
5|$|Following Blair's {{announcement}} of his resignation and Brown's bid for leadership, the Labour Party rose in {{popularity in the}} polls, gaining three points after months of <b>low</b> <b>polls</b> and trailing behind the opposition Conservative Party. However, Labour subsequently lost this lead.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{entering}} the campaign with relatively <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> numbers, the NDP recovered and increased their support significantly after Layton's {{performance in the}} leaders debates. In the English-language debate, Layton criticized Michael Ignatieff's poor attendance record in the House of Commons, saying [...] "You know, most Canadians, if they don’t show up for work, they don’t get a promotion!", to which Ignatieff was unable to respond effectively. The Globe and Mail described Layton's attack as a [...] "knock-out punch" [...] while the Toronto Star stated it was the [...] "pivot in the debate [...] {{was a turning point}} in the federal campaign". Layton's New Democrats successfully capitalized on Ignatieff's attendance record in the Toronto area.|$|E
50|$|Stanton won {{the vacant}} seat with a {{majority}} of over 4,000 votes in a <b>low</b> <b>poll.</b> (Stanton: 10,286 votes; Winstone: 6,080 votes).|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom's all-time <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> {{rating in}} the United States came in 1994, during the split over Bosnia, when 56% of Americans interviewed {{considered}} Britons {{to be close}} allies.|$|E
50|$|Despite a {{small and}} steady {{increase}} after record <b>low</b> <b>polling,</b> Nelson lost {{the leadership of the}} Liberal Party to Shadow Treasurer, Malcolm Turnbull, on 16 September 2008 by 45 to 41 votes in a spill. Nelson went to the backbench.|$|R
50|$|On September 21, 2015, Walker {{suspended}} {{his campaign}} after <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> numbers. Once considered a front runner for the Republican nomination, Walker's campaign suffered from two lackluster debate performances, low fundraising and {{an inability to}} raise his profile among the 16 other GOP contenders.|$|R
5000|$|On July 27, 2015, United States Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun and Boston 2024 Chairman Steve Pagliuca {{issued a}} joint {{statement}} that officially ended the city's Olympic bid. Rumors that the USOC might pull Boston's bid had been swirling since late March due to <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> numbers and continued interest by Los Angeles in hosting.|$|R
50|$|Christie {{dropped out}} of the race on February 10, 2016 after the New Hampshire primary {{following}} a poor showing and <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> numbers. He received 7.4% of the overall vote in the New Hampshire primary.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{parliamentary}} term, however, internal tensions began to grow within the Alliance. This was partly driven by the party's <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> ratings, which were often blamed on perceived [...] "subservience" [...] to Labour. In particular, many members of the party organisation were less willing to support Labour than the party's MPs were, leading to a rift between parliamentary leader Anderton and party president Matt McCarten.|$|E

50|$|Several notable {{candidates}} {{lined up}} to face Edwards in the 1987 gubernatorial election. Perhaps his strongest early challenger was Republican Congressman Bob Livingston. Also in the race were Billy Tauzin, a then-Democratic Cajun congressman from Thibodaux who was a strong Edwards supporter while serving {{in the state legislature}} from 1972-80; Democratic Secretary of State Jim Brown of Ferriday, and a Democratic congressman from Bossier City, Buddy Roemer, the son of former Commissioner of Administration Charles Roemer, who climbed up from a series of <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> rankings early in the campaign.|$|E
5000|$|Because of this failure, {{the party}} was {{dissolved}} the following month by a meeting of all UVF commanders. A statement announced; [...] "The <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> for the VPP candidate indicates that the general public {{does not support the}} political involvement of the UVF. It would therefore be fruitless to promote the Volunteer Party as a party political machine". Most of its members returned to the UVF (some of whom were later to form the Progressive Unionist Party). The UVF turned back to violence and was banned again by the British government on 4 October 1975.|$|E

50|$|In {{the wake}} of {{convictions}} for the ethics violations (see criminal conviction), Taft's approval rating bottomed out at 6.5 percent, according to a late November 2005 poll by Zogby, giving him quite possibly the <b>lowest</b> <b>polled</b> approval rating ever by a United States politician. A SurveyUSA poll that same month gave Taft a rating of 18 percent. A late-2005 article in Time named {{him as one of}} the three worst governors in the country.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, {{two female}} Premiers were {{appointed}} in Australia: Joan Kirner inherited significant deficit in Victoria, while Carmen Lawrence headed {{a party that}} had previously been accused of corruption. In 2009, Kristina Keneally was appointed Premier of New South Wales amid <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> for her party and their eventual defeat in 2011. Julia Gillard was appointed as Australia's first female prime minister and subsequently ousted amid procedural complaints about the leadership spill.|$|R
5000|$|Gillard portrayed Rudd as a [...] "chaotic" [...] {{manager and}} would-be celebrity {{who led a}} [...] "paralysed" [...] government. Rudd portrayed Gillard as untrustworthy and unable to win an election. Rudd {{nominated}} Gillard's actions in relation to her promise not to implement a carbon tax; her East Timor and Malaysia Solution plans for asylum seekers; her written agreement with Andrew Wilkie on poker reforms and twelve months of <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> as key failings of Gillard's time in office.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, Efford {{criticized the}} {{leadership}} of provincial Liberal Leader, Yvonne Jones and called for her to consider resigning. Efford stated that her <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> numbers were {{the main reason for}} his request. He referenced a Telelink poll released that week by NTV, in which 11 percent of respondents said they would prefer Jones to lead the province. Jones responded by saying Efford was an absolute nuisance to the Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal party, and another poll done in March showed that Jones' popularity was now up to 18% from the 11% that the February poll showed.|$|E

5000|$|Despite <b>low</b> <b>polling,</b> Jindal {{publicly}} retained {{confidence in}} {{how he would}} fare in Iowa. In October 2015, Jindal said he believed his campaign was [...] "doing very well" [...] {{in the state and}} that he believed the race would change after the Iowa caucus. In addition, he predicted that he would win the state, which would [...] "propel us forward to the nomination". Former Iowa Republican political director Craig Robinson thought the campaign marched around the state instead of with its denizens.|$|R
2500|$|Despite Moore's {{predictions}} that his initial <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> numbers were inaccurate, Riley won the primary, 306,665 (66.6 percent) to 153,354 (33.34 percent). In his concession speech, Moore told supporters that [...] "God's will has been done." [...] Moore {{did not call}} Riley to concede and refused to support Riley {{in the general election}} because of Riley's acceptance of campaign contributions from political action committees. Despite losing the Republican primary Moore was endorsed as a write-in candidate in the general election by the Alabama Constitution Party.|$|R
40|$|Traditional centre-left {{parties have}} {{experienced}} difficult electoral results and <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> ratings {{in a number}} of European countries in recent years, including the Labour Party in the UK, the SPD in Germany, the PS in France and the PSOE in Spain. Yet one significant exception has been the success of Matteo Renzi and his Democratic Party in Italy, who have enjoyed strong polling figures since Renzi became Italian Prime Minister in February 2014. Francesco Amodio and Angelo Martelli write on Renzi’s success and assess whether there are lessons for other centre-left parties in Europe, notably in the UK given the current Labour leadership contest...|$|R
5000|$|A further crisis {{came with}} a {{by-election}} in the Abbey division of Westminster in August 1921. All three candidates claimed to be representing Anti-Waste and to be unconnected with the Coalition. Brigadier-General Nicholson, theoretically the official Unionist nominee, described himself as 'Constitutional and Independent Conservative Anti-Waste', as opposed to Lieutenant R.V.K. Applin, the Anti-Waste's official candidate, and Sir Arnold Lupton, a former Liberal MP for Sleaford who stood as 'Independent Liberal and Anti-Waste'. Nicholson's victory by just over 1,000 on a <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> was indeed a glorious triumph for the government. It was followed by another desperate contest in London, in West Lewishamwhere Sir Philip Dawson, Conservative and Anti-Waste, defeated Lieutenant-Commander Windham, the Anti-Waste candidate, by just 747 votes.

5000|$|In {{trying to}} explain how a solid Republican could lose a {{traditionally}} Republican state by such a large margin, political commentators cited numerous key factors. Kaine's campaign had many political advantages, including his association with the state's popular Democratic Governor Mark Warner and defense of Warner's 2004 budget priorities, his [...] "response ads" [...] to Kilgore's death penalty advertisements, which featured him speaking to voters about his religious convictions, his relentless in-person campaigning across the state, and his opposition to tax increases. In contrast, Kilgore's campaign had many political disadvantages, including a backlash over the death penalty ads that Kilgore's campaign ran in the fall, the relatively <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> numbers of then-President George W. Bush {{at the time the}} election, and a bitter division between the moderate and conservative wings of the Republican party over tax and spending priorities.|$|E
50|$|Domingo Bordaberry {{may be said}} to {{have contributed}} to a {{distinct}} tendency within Uruguayan political culture in that he and his son Juan María Bordaberry, standing apart somewhat from the Montevideo-based political life, also succeeded by one means or another in garnering at least limited support from both of the formerly mutually antagonistic National (Blanco) and Colorado parties. (This antagonism may be understood {{in the context of the}} intermittent Civil War which occurred throughout much of the 19th century.) The wide personal political support commanded in recent years by his grandson Pedro Bordaberry, himself a former government minister, which reaches beyond the lately <b>low</b> <b>poll</b> percentages received by the formerly dominant Colorado Party (Uruguay), is thus arguably not beyond the context of an apparent capacity to unify support from diverse parts of the Uruguayan party spectrum inherited in some measure from Domingo Bordaberry. The relevance of this capacity for cooperation, particularly for the second round of the more recent Presidential elections, between the National and Colorado Parties, has been made more acute by the greatly increased electoral support in recent years for the Frente Amplio grouping.|$|E

500|$|On June 17, Gilmore was {{featured}} as the spotlight guest on CNN. He discussed economic {{policies of the}} Bush Administration that he disagreed with including [...] "the prescription drug program", but he applauded the president's record on cutting taxes and stated that {{the handling of the}} economy was [...] "not the source of the president's unpopularity." [...] He assessed that [...] "there are other areas" [...] that have caused the <b>low</b> <b>polling</b> numbers including [...] "the Iraq war". He confirmed that he was [...] "very uncomfortable with" [...] the handling of the war, but strongly disagreed with some Democratic leaders who called for a timetable for withdrawal. He argued that these politicians were [...] "not taking the best interest of this country (The United States) into effect." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1990 election, {{he stood}} for Parliament as a {{candidate}} for the National Party, defeating Labour's Bill Dillon in the Hamilton East electorate. In the 1993 election, however, he was defeated by Labour's Dianne Yates. He regained the seat in the 1996 election, and retained it in the 1999 election, but in the 2002 election, he was defeated again by Dianne Yates. Having opted not to seek a position on National's party list, Steel left Parliament. Testament to Steel's popularity in the city of Hamilton {{is the fact that he}} lost what has traditionally been regarded as a bellwether seat by a mere 600 votes, in an election where the National Party was almost destroyed by its <b>lowest</b> <b>polling</b> result in recent history.|$|R
