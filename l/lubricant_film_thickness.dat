50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness.</b>|$|E

Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> along the line of action of gear tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|E

40|$|The elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) {{regime is}} characterized by the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact, hydrodynamics of viscous friction caused by shearing the lubricant, and dramatic viscosity increase due to high pressure. As technology for mechanical components advances towards higher energy efficiency and less energy loss from viscous friction, this advancement implies that <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> are decreasing towards thicknesses on the nanometer scale. However, these <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> may behave differently from what is predicted by classical EHL theory.

The aim of this work is to derive {{an understanding of the}} molecular configurations in this thin film interface) of how these configurations evolve during shearing, and of the impact of mechanical stress and elevated temperature on the durability of the thin film molecules. A molecular mechanics model is developed and parameterised to account for the important features of this system. In particular, parameters are derived to describe accurately the perfluoropolyether molecules which make up the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film,</b> and the hydrogen bonding interactions between the perfluoropolyether functional end groups and substrate ad-groups, using density functional calculations. A periodic sliding boundary simulation cell is employed to model shearing. Four groups of simulations are conducted. These comprise physisorbed simulations (which only allow for physisorbed interactions between the perfluoropolyether molecules and the two confining, atomically smooth substrates), chemisorbed simulations (which examine the impact of chemically bonding some of the perfluoropolyether molecules to one of the substrates), high temperature simulations (which examine the impact of shearing under elevated interfacial temperatures) and rough substrate simulations (which examine the impact of replacing one of the substrates with an atomically rough substrate). Within each group of simulations, three <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are studied to examine the effect of varying lubricant thickness. Statistical data are collected from each simulation and presented in this work. Via these data, together with the evolution, of atomic and molecular configurations, a very detailed picture of the properties of this thin film interface is presented. In particular, we conclude that perfluoropolyether lubricant forms distinct molecular layers when confined between two substrates, the rate of heat generation under shearing conditions typical of those in a head-disk interface is insufficient for thermal mechanisms to result directly in lubricant degradation, and mechanical stresses attained in the head-disk interface are unlikely to result in any significant degree of lubricant degradation.
