For motorcycle {{sports such as}} motocross, goggles typically feature a foam rim which seals against the face and <b>layered,</b> <b>tinted</b> lenses to accommodate for varying light conditions.|$|R
50|$|Pleasing surface.Bare plaster {{can be a}} {{beautiful}} interior surface. The natural color of veneer plaster is a mottled white. When applied for maximum smoothness, it {{can result in a}} hard, mirror-like surface, which masks the mechanical uniformity of the drywall with the subtly organic form of a hand-applied <b>layer.</b> <b>Tinting</b> can be added to the wet plaster for color effects.|$|R

50|$|The Wyandotte is a dual-purpose breed, raised {{both for}} eggs and for meat. It matures {{moderately}} rapidly, and hens are good <b>layers</b> of <b>tinted</b> eggs. It {{is a popular}} show bird, particularly in Germany.|$|R
50|$|M. & N. Hanhart was a London lithographic {{publishing}} house founded by Michael Hanhart (1788-1865) and Nicholas Hanhart. The firm's heyday {{is considered to}} have been between 1839 and 1882. They published {{a wide range of}} material including book illustrations and lithographic sheet music covers. Their best work was in the field of large chromolithographs. Hanhart used a complex <b>layering</b> of <b>tint</b> stones, to produce work unique in colouration and tonal values.|$|R
50|$|Jan van Goyen {{would begin}} a {{painting}} using a support primarily of thin oak wood. To this panel, he would scrub on {{several layers of}} a thin animal hide glue. With a blade, he would then scrape over the entire surface a thin <b>layer</b> of <b>tinted</b> white lead {{to act as a}} ground and to fill the low areas of the panel. The ground was tinted light brown, sometimes reddish, or ochre in colour.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Hillshading {{provides}} a rendering of topographic surfaces by assigning brightness to surface elements {{based on the}} orientation of these elements and a selected direction of illumination. Users easily visualize many topographic features, but some areas lack detail, as one shade of gray does not define a unique surface orientation. We clarify some of this ambiguity by varying the color of <b>layer</b> <b>tints</b> with aspect direction. We use the CIELAB color model to quantify color specifications and map variations in luminosity onto slices of the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color model. Traditionally, cartographers assign an aspect-invariant color (or colors) based on H and S and vary V with the hillshading values. In our research, we assign aspect-variant H and V values in close proximity in HSV color space. We use values of luminosity and saturation from the CIELAB and HSV color models to select colors that are least saturated, most saturated, least luminous, and most luminous to represent the northwest, southeast, southwest, and northeast directions, respectively. We then vary V in the traditional manner with hillshading from the northwest. Topographic details not apparent in the original hillshaded maps are highlighted with this technique.

5000|$|Sgraffito ( [...] ; plural: sgraffiti; {{sometimes}} spelled scraffito) is {{a technique}} either of wall decor, produced by applying <b>layers</b> of plaster <b>tinted</b> in contrasting colours to a moistened surface, or in pottery, by applying to an unfired ceramic body two successive layers of contrasting slip or glaze, and then in either case scratching so as to reveal parts of the underlying layer. [...] The Italian past participle [...] "sgraffiato" [...] is also used, especially of pottery.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} church are decorated with sgraffito which is produced by applying <b>layers</b> of plaster <b>tinted</b> in contrasting colors to a moistened surface, or in ceramics, by applying to an unfired ceramic body two successive layers of contrasting slip, and then in either case scratching so as to produce an outline drawing. The decoration includes representations of Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah and the Annunciation. The technique is attributed to the Arts and Crafts Movement and, at Hornblotton, have been created by cutting away the upper coat of white cement and leaving exposed the strawberry coloured undercoat of plaster including terracotta patterns of sunflowers and leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Chevrolet Avalanche, {{customers}} began to notice cosmetic problems with the cladding on their vehicles. Over time exposure to heat and sunlight would cause a chalky faded appearance. It was especially noticeable on the cargo bed panels, and sail-panel windows where [...] "Zebra Striping" [...] would appear. Customer reaction to this problem resulted in General Motors agreeing to a one time treatment of a product called ArmorDillo. This product would temporarily restore the cladding for a period of about 6 months. After that it would wear off then need to be re-applied. Realizing this was not a permanent solution, GM, together with Gatorback Coatings, developed a coating that could be applied to the cladding to restore it to a like-new shine. This product was designed to etch into the plastic and bond a new <b>layer</b> of <b>tinted</b> acrylic over the faded plastic. Customers within the 3yr/36,000 original factory warranty could go to their dealership to have it restored under their original warranty under GM TSB:04-08-111-001C. GM did not use side body cladding on the second generation model. General Motors has also identified the original source of the faded cladding.|$|R
