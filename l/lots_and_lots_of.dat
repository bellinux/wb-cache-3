500|$|In the episode, Field Marshal Haig {{is shown}} casually {{sweeping}} away toy soldiers with a dustpan and brush; BBC News Magazines Finlo Rohrer called this a [...] "visual allusion to his callousness", but quoted the historian Gary Sheffield as saying [...] "The real Field Marshal Haig {{was certainly not}} a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did you ended up with <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> casualties." [...] Sheffield also noted that [...] "Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and John French and the other generals", so Haig effectively [...] "appears twice".

[...] "Beautiful Son", written and recorded in 1992, features a more mellow guitar riff, and its lyrics make references to crossdressing. Love said the songwriting process {{on the track}} {{was an attempt to}} [...] "be a little dumber. I was always trying to write a very complex song without ever having learned to write an easy Beatles song," [...] noted in a 1994 interview. [...] "It just had a riff. It wasn't super smart but it sounded good and that's when I started learning things don't have to have <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> notes.

[...] Soap opera commentator Kaydee Barnett stated that Todd's dark edges had been softened {{over a period of}} many years by Blair, Viki, and Starr. Todd's deep love for his sister, Viki, was partly demonstrated by him supporting her during her battle with cancer, her difficulties with her daughter and his niece, Jessica, and by defending Viki to her enemies. Berry enjoyed the vulnerability Viki brought out of Todd, and felt that his self-hatred demonstrated itself in many ways, including when he refused to name his son, Jack, after himself because his name carried too much baggage.|$|E

500|$|The Atlus {{version was}} {{directed}} by Kouji Okada, while the scenario's original elements were written by Kazunari Suzuki. Sprite and promotional artwork was designed by Esaki Minoru, and the music was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. During the early phases, the gameplay concept was a near-copy of the gameplay style of the Wizardry series, attributed by Suzuki to their superiors being fans of the series. Suzuki insisted on the inclusion of some new feature which would distinguish it from Wizardry. This resulted {{in the creation of}} the demon negotiation system. Okada later stated that demon negotiation was decided upon from an early stage. Speaking later about the first-person exploration, Okada was highly critical, feeling that after all their efforts [...] "All we had left after everything was said and done were <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> long, winding dungeons!". Storage space on the cartridge was a recurring concern for the team, with Suzuki using unspecified programming tricks to include high-quality sprite graphics.

[...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing you could never say about Peter." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album, {{also called}} Magician Among the Spirits, {{received}} mixed reviews, despite the guitar rock hook of its single, [...] "Comedown". It {{was released on}} the band's own Deep Karma label, but due to financial constraints they had to arrange for outside distribution for the North American and European markets. This almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come.

Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky ground, this was nearly the death knell.

[...] At least three genera of Ediacarans—Albumares, Anfesta, and Rugoconites—share similarities with Dendrogramma; all three appear to have possessed a disc with an internal network of forking channels. This possibility generated considerable excitement: Simon Conway Morris of the University of Cambridge stated that the discovery is [...] "a very interesting surprise, and it poses <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> questions."
