5|$|The Percy estates were {{primarily}} {{located in the}} northern counties of Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland. Even though the title was restored in 1416, and the Percy estates were officially regranted, this did not mean the immediate return of all the family possessions.

Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album This Is War in December 2009 to critical acclaim.|$|E

Warlock were starting to have {{an opening in the}} US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture, B of the Bang, was {{situated}} {{to the southeast}} of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way. Built after the Commonwealth Games to commemorate them, it was the tallest sculpture in the United Kingdom. However, numerous structural problems led to the 184ft. sculpture being dismantled in 2009 for safety reasons.

5|$|Plans for the {{boulevard}} {{and the construction}} of a Michigan Avenue Bridge were further elaborated upon in Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. In 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue {{and the construction of}} a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street. An ordinance to fund construction was passed in 1913, but was declared void by the Supreme Court of Illinois. A second ordinance was passed in 1914, but <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> continued until the end of 1916. Construction finally started on April 15, 1918, and the bridge was officially opened in a ceremony on May 14, 1920.|$|E

5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal {{opened in}} 1827, which {{provided}} an easier route than the river, and protracted <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> followed over {{ownership of the}} river and water rights for the canal. These were not finally resolved until 1832, when the Canal Company formally took over the river navigation. The ability to navigate the river gradually deteriorated, not helped by the abandonment of the River Parrett as a navigation in 1878. Following flooding in Taunton in 1960, much of the river between there and its mouth was straightened, and the navigation locks were removed. That at Ham was blown up by the Territorial Army. Navigation rights were repealed in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> for the next decade.|$|E

Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required letter of credit until the last possible day.|$|E

5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials {{were not the only}} ones perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously she had been a strong advocate for her son, helping him with <b>legal</b> <b>battles,</b> she now argued against his application for parole, and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> to realize their danger to human health.

5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition to the cost of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place.|$|E
5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and {{included}} {{the sale of}} Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, {{and the threat of}} administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of meetings and events, including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch {{around the perimeter of the}} pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club's estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced the £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of <b>legal</b> <b>battles</b> which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.|$|E
