5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit has a <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> content, additional sugar may {{be added to}} raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E
25|$|The {{legality}} of chaptalization varies by country, region, and even wine type. In general, {{it is legal}} in regions that produce grapes with <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> content. Chaptalization is prohibited in Argentina, Australia, California, Italy, and South Africa. Germany prohibits the practice for making Prädikatswein. It is generally permitted in regions where grapes tend to have <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> content, including Northern regions of France, Germany, and the United States.|$|E

Bronchospasm is due to blockage in lungs of β2 receptor and <b>low</b> blood <b>sugar</b> because of decreased stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver via β2 receptor.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} permits chaptalization when {{producing}} natural grape wine from juice with <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> content. This allows chaptalization in cooler {{states such as}} Oregon, or in states such as Florida where the native grape (Muscadine) is naturally low in sugar. However, individual states may still create their own regulations; California, for example, prohibits chaptalization, although California winemakers may add grape concentrate.|$|E
25|$|The Champenois were {{envious of}} the {{reputation}} of the wines made from their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However the northerly climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustainable viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> levels. The wines were lighter bodied and thinner than the Burgundies.|$|E
25|$|For {{other types}} of wines, such as {{sparkling}} wines like Champagne, maintaining {{a certain amount of}} acidity in the grapes is important to the winemaking process. As the concentration of acids in the grapes decrease the further along the ripening process you go, grapes destined for sparkling wines are often some of the earliest grapes to be harvested in a vintage. With their high acidity and <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> levels, these grapes would be under ripe and would produce table wines that many wine drinkers would consider unpalatable yet the balance of sugars and acids is well suited for sparkling wine production.|$|E

25|$|If {{ripening}} is {{broadly defined}} as the development of wine grapes, then {{it could be said}} that ripening is happening throughout the continuous annual cycle of the grapevine. More narrowly defined, ripening begins at the inception of veraison. At this point (which is normally 40–60 days after fruit set though it may be longer in cooler climates), the grapes are hard and green with <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> levels and very high levels of mostly malic acids. During veraison, which may last from 30–70 days depending on the climate and other factors, the grapes go through several changes which impact their sugar, acid, tannin and mineral composition. The concentration of phenolic compounds in the skin, most notably anthocyanins for red wine grapes, replace the green color of chlorophyll as the grape berries themselves change color.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{from the}} Champagne region were known before medieval times. The Romans {{were the first}} to plant {{vineyards}} in this area of north-east France, with the region being cultivated by the 5th century, or possibly even earlier. Later, churches owned vineyards and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of Eucharist. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims, and Champagne was served as part of coronation festivities. The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northerly climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustainable viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and <b>low</b> <b>sugar</b> levels. The wines would be lighter bodied and thinner than the Burgundy wines they were seeking to outdo.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the precipitating {{effects of the}} westernized diet on diabetes mellitus, glucose tolerance and insulin response to oral glucose load (1. 5 g/kg body weight) and insulin sensitivity to exogenous insulin (0. 2 U/kg) were studied in rats fed an experimental diet for 8 weeks. Four experimental diets were used : <b>low</b> fat-no <b>sugar</b> diet (energy ratio of 10 % fat, 70 % starch, {{a model of the}} traditional Japanese diet), high fat-high sugar diet (40 % fat, 20 % starch, 20 % sugar, a model of the westernized diet), <b>low</b> fat-high <b>sugar</b> diet (10 % fat, 50 % starch, 20 % sugar) and high fat-no sugar diet (40 % fat, 40 % starch). In high fat-high sugar diet rats, the body weight increased more, plasma glucose and insulin levels were higher while fasting and after oral glucose load, and insulin sensitivity was lower than in <b>low</b> fat-no <b>sugar</b> diet rats. Similar impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia were present both in <b>low</b> fat-high <b>sugar</b> diet rats and in high fat-no sugar diet rats.
