5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother does not <b>like</b> <b>Jack</b> because he {{reminds her of}} the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E

Perhaps more important, however, was the talent coming {{up through the}} Tigers farm system at the time.

Unlike many other hardcore bands of the era, they also acknowledged proto-punk bands like the New York Dolls, MC5 and Iggy Pop. Even more {{unusual for a}} band of the scene that spawned them, they were also informed by such new wavers as Elvis Costello, The Jam, and Nick Lowe, as well as authors <b>like</b> <b>Jack</b> Kerouac.|$|E

25|$|Professional bouts {{are usually}} {{much longer than}} amateur bouts, {{typically}} ranging from ten to twelve rounds, though four-round fights are common for less experienced fighters or club fighters. There are also some two- and three-round professional bouts, especially in Australia. Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters <b>like</b> <b>Jack</b> Dempsey. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights {{for most of the}} 20th century until the early 1980s, when the death of boxer Duk Koo Kim eventually prompted the World Boxing Council and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.|$|E

500|$|In his own words, Lee {{was not a}} [...] "brilliant youngster <b>like</b> <b>Jack</b> Hearne or Denis Compton, but an ordinary, average county cricketer". Despite this assertion, Lee's 18,594 {{first-class}} {{runs for}} Middlesex rank him eleventh in their all-time list, and {{he is one of}} only seventeen cricketers to have scored over 5,000 runs and taken over 300 wickets for the county. H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton suggested that figures alone do show his true worth, as at the time the Lord's pitch did not favour batsmen, and had he played his career on [...] "some other ground where the pitch was a batsman's paradise, his figures would have borne a truer relation to his value." [...] Lee batted with a noticeable crouch, and scored predominantly on the leg side. His style was unattractive to watch, but effective, and although Hearne and Hendren drew most of the plaudits for their more colourful methods, Lee received praise for his toughness and courage.|$|E
500|$|The record {{opens with}} [...] "Feeling This", which {{features}} flanged drums and an unconventional [...] "syncopated Latin-flavored backbeat and a harmony-rich chorus" [...] following {{a series of}} [...] "half-barked" [...] vocals. [...] "Feeling This" [...] was the first song written for the album and illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence, and regret, with the protagonist of the song reflecting over his romance's dimming flame in the chorus [...] "Fate fell short this time/Your smile fades in the summer." [...] Hoppus and DeLonge wrote the song in two different rooms and upon meeting to discuss the song, the two realized they had both written about sex—the passionate, lustful side (reflected in the verses) and the romantic side (the choruses). It segues into [...] "Obvious", which explores the Wall of Sound technique and features a brooding, heavy intro combined with cascading guitar riffs. [...] "I Miss You" [...] is an all-acoustic affair, featuring a melancholy piano, cello, upright acoustic bass, and a [...] "brushstroked hip-hop groove." [...] The song features references to Tim Burton's 1993 animated film The Nightmare Before Christmas with [...] "We can live <b>like</b> <b>Jack</b> and Sally" [...] and [...] "We'll have Halloween on Christmas". In interviews and the liner notes for Blink-182, Barker reveals that the line was directed towards his then girlfriend, Shanna Moakler. [...] "Violence" [...] flicks between [...] "bizarre, spoken jazzy verses and anthemic punk rock choruses" [...] with lyrics that equate broken hearts with global violence.|$|E
500|$|After {{four years}} of privately denouncing the popular nature writers in letters and conversation, Roosevelt decided to weigh in publicly; while {{alerting}} Burroughs that he had finally broken his silence, he wrote: [...] "I know that as President I ought not to do this". He had given an interview to journalist Edward B. Clark, who quoted Roosevelt in the article [...] "Roosevelt on the Nature Fakirs" [...] in the June 1907 issue of Everybody's Magazine. Roosevelt not only spoke out against Long, but other authors <b>like</b> <b>Jack</b> London and Roberts, who wrote what he called [...] "'unnatural' history". Roosevelt popularized the term [...] "nature faker" [...] over Clark's original spelling, and defined it in his essay as [...] "an object of derision to every scientist worthy of the name, to every real lover of the wilderness, to every faunal naturalist, to every true hunter or nature lover. But {{it is evident that}} [...] completely deceives many good people who are wholly ignorant of wild life. Sometimes he draws on his own imagination for his fictions; sometimes he gets them second-hand from irresponsible guides or trappers or Indians." [...] He voiced displeasure with and disbelief of London's descriptions of dog fighting in White Fang, as well as Long's stories about Wayeeses the wolf taking down prey; Roosevelt was so specific as to debate the depicted outcome of the fights based {{on the size of the}} animals involved. Long's books in particular were deemed a [...] "genuine crime", especially against the country's children. Fearing that a curriculum including sentimental nature stories would corrupt young children, Roosevelt wrote: [...] "As for the matter of giving these books to children for the purpose of teaching them the facts of natural history—why, it's an outrage." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fox's performance, {{saying that}} it was almost worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall of gave the episode a mixed review, saying that [...] "I find [...] and his love life {{simultaneously}} boring and obnoxious … [...] insufferable"; however, he enjoyed the subplots and commended the acting by Matthew Fox and Jorge Garcia. [...] James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were [...] "the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of the bad old flashbacks, in that it just reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past … I didn't get much from it". [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5/10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. [...] Carabott wrote that [...] "this season [...] seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle … oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do" [...] and stated that [...] "the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "the pace … was a bit too slow" [...] and [...] "I usually like the Jack-centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for high drama or stimulating action"; however, he noted that [...] "all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special." [...] Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that [...] "this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson [...] and Henry Ian Cusick [...]" [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "a break after last week's action- and information-packed episode", argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles. [...] UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not <b>like</b> <b>Jack.</b> [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode three out of five stars, saying that [...] "the Jack-Kate romantic intrigue is rather dull, while the appendix plot feels like an unnecessary narrative obstacle for viewers to surmount." ...|$|E

2500|$|River's {{characterisation}} {{has invited}} parallels {{with that of}} Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a companion of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors introduced by Steven Moffat in 2005. According to Moffat in the Doctor Who Confidential episode accompanying [...] "Forest of the Dead", River's blaster gun is the one previously owned by Jack in the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Upon River's return in series five, Lyle Masaki of AfterElton felt that viewers {{had the chance to}} see the character [...] "do her best to channel Captain Jack" [...] by capturing the same [...] "'charming rogue' vibe". In May 2012 Moffat stated that River, <b>like</b> <b>Jack,</b> is bisexual. Heather Hogan, a senior editor of AfterEllen felt that Moffat's ability to create [...] "fascinating, complicated characters like... River Song" [...] is a direct consequence of him abiding by [...] "Captain Jack's label-eschewing motto": [...] "You people and your quaint little categories". James Cornish of WhatCulture subsequently cited River's characterisation in a rebuke against claims of misogyny and homophobia in Moffat's writing. He described her as [...] "a more sexual, trigger happy version of the Doctor" [...] and [...] "the strongest female character seen on Doctor Who for a quite a while".|$|E
