40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{establish}} the best hyperspectral narrowbands for discriminating agricultural crops and to determine the accuracy with which such discrimination was possible. Six crops (wheat, barley, chickpea, <b>lentil,</b> <b>vetch,</b> and cumin) were studied. The best 12 narrowbands provided the most rapid increase in spectral discrimination. Further addition of narrowbands, only marginally increased discrimination capability reaching a plateau around 30 narrowbands. The overall accuracy (and Khat) in separating the six crops increased rapidly from 73 percent (Khat= 71) when 6 best bands were used to 84 percent (Khat= 79) when 12 best bands were used. Peak overall accuracies of 94 percent (Khat = 92) were achieved with about 30 narrowbands. Possibility of significant improvements by using mid infrared bands were indicated. Principal component derived hyperspectral narrowbands explained 61 - 92 percent variability in biomass and 70 - 87 percent variability in LAI.

40|$|The {{contents}} of protein and non-protein (free and protein-bound) tryptophan and of proteins in the flours of nine legume seeds were determined. Lupins and soybeans showed the highest protein concentrations, followed by groundnuts, beans, broad beans, <b>lentils,</b> <b>vetches,</b> chick-peas, and peas. Protein tryptophan content {{is higher in}} soybeans and lower in peas (502 and 192 mg/ 100 g of dry flour, respectively) than in the other legumes, which also contain non-protein tryptophan. Chick-peas show the highest value of free tryptophan and groundnuts the lowest (58. 2 and 2. 24 mg/ 100 g of dry flour, respectively). Tryptophan appears to be bound to water-soluble proteins and to proteins soluble at pH 8. 9. In particular, chick-peas contain a high amount of tryptophan bound to water-soluble proteins, followed by beans. The results are evaluated, considering the importance, not only of protein, but also non-protein tryptophan, for assessing the nutritive value of a protein in food...|$|R

From around 9,500 BC, the eight Neolithic founder crops—emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, [...] hulled barley, peas, <b>lentils,</b> bitter <b>vetch,</b> chick peas, and flax—were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans.

40|$|The widely {{accepted}} models describing {{the emergence of}} domesticated grain crops from their wild type ancestors are mostly based upon selection (conscious or unconscious) of major features related either to seed dispersal (nonbrittle ear, indehiscent pod) or free germination (nondormant seeds, soft seed coat). Based on the breeding systems (self-pollination) and dominance relations between the allelomorphs of seed dispersal mode and seed dormancy, it was postulated that establishment of the domesticated forms and replacement of the wild ancestral populations occurred in the Near East within a relatively short time. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), however, appears as an exception among all other “founder crops” of Old World agriculture because of its ancient conversion into a summer crop. The chickpea is also exceptional because its major domestication trait appears to be vernalization insensitivity rather than pod indehiscence or free germination. Moreover, the genetic basis of vernalization response in wild chickpea (Cicer reticulatum Ladiz.) is polygenic, suggesting that a long domestication process was imperative due to the elusive phenotype of vernalization nonresponsiveness. There is also a gap in chickpea remains in the archaeological record between the Late Prepottery Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age. Contrary to the common view that Levantine summer cropping was introduced relatively late (Early Bronze Age), we argue for an earlier (Neolithic) Levantine origin of summer cropping because chickpea, when grown as a common winter crop, was vulnerable to the devastating pathogen Didymella rabiei, the causal agent of Ascochyta blight. The ancient (Neolithic) conversion of chickpea into a summer crop required seasonal differentiation of agronomic operation from the early phases of the Neolithic revolution. This topic is difficult to deal with, as direct data on seasonality in prehistoric Old World field crop husbandry are practically nonexistent. Consequently, this issue was hardly {{dealt with in the}} literature. Information on the seasonality of ancient (Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age, calibrated 11, 500 to 4, 500 years before present) Near Eastern agriculture may improve our understanding of the proficiency of early farmers. This in turn may provide a better insight into Neolithic agrotechniques and scheduling. It is difficult to fully understand chickpea domestication without a Neolithic seasonal differentiation of agronomic practice because the rapid establishment of the successful Near Eastern crop package which included wheats, barley, pea, <b>lentil,</b> <b>vetches,</b> and flax, would have preempted the later domestication of this rare wild legume...|$|R
40|$|Bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia (L.) Willd.) {{was a part}} of the {{everyday}} diet of the Eurasian Neanderthal population and the modern human Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers at the end of the last Ice Age. The major criteria to determine the domestication in bitter vetch and other ancient grain legumes are non-dehiscent pods, larger seed size and smooth seed testa. Bitter vetch seeds were found among the earliest findings of cultivated crops at the site of Tell El-Kerkh, Syria, from 10 th millennium BP. Along with cereals, pea and <b>lentil,</b> bitter <b>vetch</b> has become definitely associated with the start of the 'agricultural revolution' in the Old World.

Its distribution was rapid, since the available evidence reveals its presence in remote places at similar periods. Recently the first success has been obtained in the extraction of ancient DNA from charred bitter vetch seeds.

40|$|Abstract: Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) is {{essential}} to all soil processes that {{have an impact on}} crop production and the environment. Soils of the semi-arid Mediterranean region are low in SOM due to environmental conditions (temperature, moisture) and centuries of cultivation. Hence, as SOM has a major influence on soil aggregation, nutrient supply, and soil moisture, as well as the relationships between them, {{there is a need to}} assess the impact of cropping systems on this critical soil parameter. During a 14 -year rotation trial of durum wheat with alternate crops in northern Syria (mean annual rainfall: 340 mm), we examined the effects of common rotations, fertilizer nitrogen (N), and variable grazing of cereal stubble on SOM by measuring organic C in soil samples (depth: 0 - 20 cm) during October-November, before planting. The rotations significantly influenced mean SOM level, the order being fallow (lowest), continuous wheat, <b>lentil,</b> chickpea, <b>vetch,</b> and medic (highest). The mean effect of N was to increase SOM, but grazing intensity tended to decrease SOM. While results from different aspects of the trial published elsewhere demonstrated the value of legume-based rotations as biologically and economically viable alternatives to fallow or continuous cropping, this soil sampling SOM study showed that crop production can be compatible with the goal of improving soil quality, with potential environmental benefits. Thus, soil and crop management practices involving appropriate rotations (legumes/cereals), adequate N fertilization of the cereal crop, and retention of crop residues can combine sustainable and economic cropping while reversing soil degradation...|$|R

Dry matter yield varied between 10, 068. 2 and 16, 480. 4 kg ha– 1. It was determined that Hungarian vetch was a suitable rotation crop, and that 200 kg of N ha– 1 was the best N fertilization rate for silage maize production across years and N rates. Moreover, according to the previous crop × N fertilization rate interaction, the highest dry matter yield was obtained from 240 kg of N ha– 1 after barley. Silage maize following Hungarian vetch in rotation {{did not respond to}} the application of more than 120 kg of N ha– 1, in terms of dry matter and N yields, while in barley-maize and wheat-maize these 2 parameters increased in response to every level of N fertilization applied.

In January 2006, we observed severe broomrape attacks in four commercial fields of fall-sown lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Iceberg) crops at Almodóvar del Río (Córdoba Province) in southern Spain. Infected lettuce plants showed severe stunting, foliar yellowing, and had loose-formed heads. Infection of lettuce plants by Orobanche sp. was confirmed by removing plants to verify the attachment of broomrapes to lettuce roots. There were one to four broomrapes per lettuce plant. Incidence of infected lettuce ranged from 10 to 20 % in different areas of the fields. Morphological observations of broomrape plants identified the parasite as O. crenata. The main botanical features were as follows: plants 20 to 40 cm tall; corolla 20 to 28 mm, white, lips with lilac, divergent veins, lower lip large with suborbicular lobes, not ciliate; filaments hairy, obliquely inserted 2 to 4 mm above the base of corolla, with short glandular hairs in the upper third; anthers glabrous, 2 to 2. 5 mm in length, and stigma yellow or pinkish at anthesis (2). O. crenata also was observed infecting faba bean (Vicia faba) plants in a field in close proximity to the affected lettuce fields. The complete 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA gene and internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 of O. crenata were sequenced using adventitious roots and stem tissues sampled from infected faba bean and lettuce plants (Genbank Accession Nos.

40|$|Limited {{knowledge}} about the 3000 -year period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age in central Anatolia, Turkey, prevents any understanding of change or continuity in crop production, consumption and crop husbandry techniques. This research aims to address this bias through the examination of archaeobotanical remains from the four central Anatolian Chalcolithic sites of Çatalhöyük West, Çaml&# 305;bel Tarlas&# 305;, Canhasan I and Kuruçay and the consequent investigation of their crop economies. This work draws on multiple methods and techniques to understand the plant-related activities that occurred at the sites. The four chosen sites bookend the Chalcolithic period (c. 6000 - 3000 cal BC) and provide the opportunity for exploring the interrelationship between crop choice, crop husbandry, settlement size, surrounding environment and social organisation. Differences in crop species such as hulled barley, glume wheats and pulses, particularly <b>lentil</b> and bitter <b>vetch</b> occur at all four sites with species choice community specific. Multiple methods are used to disentangle the depositional processes, such as dung burning, that formed the assemblages, providing {{an indication of the}} origin of the archaeobotanical material and allowing inferences about the nature of weed seeds found. Crop processing activities are evident at all sites, with the dehusking of glume wheat contributing significantly to the archaeobotanical assemblage. The analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of crops coupled with the functional ecology of arable weeds, indicate that crop husbandry techniques/regimes were site specific and were influenced by site size/population as well as environmental conditions. The identification of the crops grown and the methods used to cultivate and process them have implications for understanding the social context of such activities, and the broader socio-economic background of a period preceding the great changes in social structure seen in the Bronze Age. </p...|$|R
40|$|Broomrape is {{a common}} name for more than 200 species from the family Orobanchaceae,. They all are chlorophyll-lacking obligate root holoparasites that subsist on broad-leaf plants, thereby {{depleting}} them of nutrients, minerals and water. Several broomrape species parasitize important crops (tomato, potato, tobacco, eggplant, faba bean, <b>vetch,</b> <b>lentil,</b> peanut, Brassica spp., sunflower, carrot, celery and parsley). At present, over 73 million hectares of farmland under cultivation in the Middle East, Southern and Eastern Europe, and regions of North Africa are infested with broomrapes. The losses in crop productivity estimated at {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually than affect the livelihoods of 100 million farmers. In Balkans the family Orobanchaceae is represented 2 genera: Orobanche includes 25 species, two of which are endemic for the region: O. serbica (the region of Nish and Dragoman), O. esulae (Bulgaria and Serbia). Other species, like Orobanche pancicii, do also occur elsewhere (e. g., in Central Europe), but have their centre of distribution on the Balkan Peninsula. Phelipanche includes 7 species and putatively also hybrids between Ph. ramosa and Ph. lavandulacea, which are reported in Bulgaria. Taxa in both genera additionally include many intraspecific taxa. Our current knowledge on their diversity on the Balkans is based on floristic records only. As has been shown for the floristically comparatively much better investigated Iberian Peninsula (Carlon et al. 2005), a combination of classical taxonomic approaches with modern molecular techniques can greatly enhance our understanding of broomrape diversity in a region including the description and resurrection of new and neglected taxa of often local or regional distribution. Thus, although previous phylogenetic studies (Park et al., 2007 a, 2007 b; Schneeweiss et al., 2004 a; 2004 b; Weiss-Schneeweiss, 2006) have included material from the Balkans, mainly from Greece and Croatia, the local biodiversity is still grossly under-studied using modern approaches. This not only leads to unclear status of taxonomically problematic species of Orobanchaceae and their local intraspecific taxa on the Balkans, but also hampers the assessment of their relevance as actual or potential agricultural pest species. During the recent studies in Bulgaria a database of Orobanchaceae was created. The groups of Phelipanche (Stoyanov, 2005 a) and Orobanche sect. Glandulosae (Stoyanov, in press) are revised. A determination key of Phelipanche, based on the seed morphology is completed (Stoyanov, 2005 b). A study in the peroxydase spectra of Phelipanche is done (Stoyanov & Stoyanova, 2007). Particular chorological data from the Balkan countries are collected. During the last 15 - 20 years of economical and political turmoils in the Balkans, the economical activities (agriculture, industry etc.) in many Balkan countries were seriously diminished, many populated areas were abandoned. The large state farms, which once existed were destroyed and a vast number of scattered tiny private farms were created. In most of them, agriculture was returned back to “horse-power” (fig. 2) and lacks sufficient pathogen control. During this period the wildlife forms reclaimed significant territories. The processes of association and integration of Balkan countries to the European Union during the last years brought relative economical stability. The economical revival is associated with reclaiming of abandoned lands for agriculture and livestock farming. On the other hand many abandoned villages are in process of rapid conversion to tourist centers. However, these processes outran the efforts of researchers supported by programs like Nature- 2000 etc. to appraise and categorize the biodiversity in affected areas and to propose a balance that will make economic expansion safe for unique species and protect their habitats. Therefore, one of the main activity of the proposal will be to study biodiversity in broomrapes in Balkans and to map habitats of unique and relict species which have to be preserved. On the other hand, several broomrape species parasitize important crops (tomato, potato, tobacco, eggplant, faba bean, <b>vetch,</b> <b>lentil,</b> peanut, Brassica spp., sunflower, carrot, celery and parsley (Goldwasser and Kleifeld, 2002), thus causing tremendous agricultural losses in many regions of the world (Joel, 2000, Musselman, 1994). For example, Phelipanche ramosa and Phelipanche mutelii are serious problems in tobacco-producing European countries, where those two species cause serious reduction (up to 40...|$|R
50|$|The oval egg (0.75-0.8 mm) is {{flattened}} on one side. At first, {{it has a}} white {{color and}} then it becomes yellow. In the end the color turns dark. The larva reaches 14 mm long. At first it is white, then yellow with dark head and anal scutellum. It has eight lines of dark warts with hairs. Larva also has eight pairs of legs (three pairs on thorax). The body length of yellow-brown pupae varies from 5 to 7 mm. The over-wintering takes place during the phase of fifth-instar larvae, within a dense oval cocoon in the ground on fields of pea, <b>lentil,</b> peavine and <b>vetch.</b> An insignificant number of caterpillars over-winter in places where grain is dried and threshed. The insects pupate, in their cocoons, underground {{during the month of}} May. The pupae period lasts 10-18 days. The first moths appear during the period of wild vetch and pea-vine blooming. When first buds appear, the moths are found on pea. After coupling, which takes place four to seven days after emergence from the cocoon, the insects begin to lay eggs. Additional feeding on pea flowers is preferred. Moths fly in the evening; they live 10-14 days. Mass oviposition occurs at the beginning of July. The oviposition lasts 25-30 days. Pests lay eggs in groups of one, two or three (rarely four) on upper leaves (lower side), peduncle, bell, stems. Embryonic development lasts 6-10 days. Fecundity reaches 200 eggs. Hatching caterpillars penetrate into the pods and gnaw grains from above, making wide channels, ending in a hollow at one end. They soil the grain with fecal masses and cobwebs. Usually, one, rarely two or more (up to four) caterpillars are located in pods. The entire larval period (lasting 16-25 days) occurs inside one pod. The larvae have five instars, four molts. Then the insect makes a hole in the pod wall and comes out, making a cocoon in the ground. This take place when the pods become mature and the plants become dry (from the end of July and up to the first ten-day period of September). Young caterpillars (not fifth instar) that did not finish their feeding can diapause, but eventually they perish.|$|R
40|$|The disease cercospora {{leaf spot}} (CLS), {{caused by the}} fungus Cercospora zonata, has {{affected}} faba bean (Vicia faba) production regions in southern Australian in recent years. This study provides new information on the prevalence and significance {{of the disease and}} the factors that affect severity. Temperature, wetness period, plant maturity, pathogen variability and inoculum concentration all influenced infection of faba bean by C. zonata in a controlled environment. Disease severity was positively correlated (R²= 0. 83 P< 0. 001) with wet-degree hours (DH{subscript]w) and premature defoliation (40 - 50 %) of the lower canopy, which was most severe when the pathogen was inoculated at the mid- to late-vegetative crop growth stages. Pathogenicity tests showed that 29 isolates of C. zonata collected from 1999 to 2008 varied in aggressiveness; this was not related to geographical origin of isolates or growth rate in vitro, but isolates collected from 2005 to 2008 were more aggressive than those collected in the period 1999 - 2004. The temporal and spatial dynamics of the disease on susceptible and resistant genotypes of faba bean were examined. A strong association between the incidence and severity of CLS and soil-borne inoculum was established using comparative analyses of disease on plants in soil sown with faba bean every 3 years since 1997 and in adjacent soil with no history of cultivation of faba bean. Spatial patterns of disease development showed that inoculum spread primarily over short distances during the early stages of CLS epidemics, though dispersal of 4 to 16 m from the infested soil was observed. Non-linear regression using a logistic model described disease development over time on susceptible plants in soil with in situ inoculum, whereas an exponential model best described disease gradient with distance from the inoculum source and disease development on resistant plants. There was a positive relationship (R²= 0. 93, P< 0. 05) between disease severity on susceptible plants grown in soil with infested residue on the surface and the amount of DNA of C. zonata detected in the soil. When residues were removed from the soil surface, or depleted rapidly through grazing, the infectivity of soil and the amount of DNA of C. zonata detected were significantly less than for soil with residue remaining on the surface. C. zonata survived in soil, on infested residue or as fungal propagules in the soil profile, and remained infective for at least 30 months. The distribution and occurrence, host range and management of CLS of faba bean in southern Australia were studied. C. zonata infected narbon bean, <b>lentil</b> and <b>vetch</b> but did not infect pea, chickpea, lathyrus, lupin or canola. A disease survey of 100 commercial faba bean crops in southern Australia showed that CLS was endemic to all districts examined, observed in 87 % of crops. Disease severity varied in all districts but was most severe in crops in the south-east of South Australia. Disease incidence and severity were highest in fields planted with faba bean in short rotations (1 - 4 years) and decreased (R²= 0. 13, P= 0. 006) as the interval between faba bean crops increased. Severity also appeared to be influenced by faba bean residue remaining from the previous year in adjacent fields. CLS manifested as severe lesions on foliage and extensive defoliation, resulting in a 7 % reduction in yield in field experiments. Applications of carbendazim, tebuconazole, chlorothalonil and triadimefon significantly reduced CLS severity compared with untreated controls and a single application of either carbendazim or tebuconazole prior to disease onset was identified as an economical application strategy for control of the disease. A rapid screening technique was developed to identify resistance to C. zonata in faba bean genotypes in a controlled environment. All faba bean cultivars commercially available to the Australian industry were susceptible to the disease. The mode of inheritance of resistance to C. zonata was determined to be monogenic dominant and this has allowed a relatively simple pathway by which sources of resistance identified in this study can be transferred to adapted faba bean genotypes available to the southern Australian industry.

U iskopavanjima 2002. godine otkriven je paljevinski grob s drvenom arhitekturom u kojem su se nalazili prilozi dvojakoga podrijetla. Autohtono podrijetlo u latenskoj kulturi mlađega željeznoga doba pokazuju lonci zaobljenoga tijela izrađeni rukom i zdjela S-profilacije. Sjevernoitalskoga podrijetla su zdjelica tankih stijenki, keramička svjetiljka, staklena posuda te ostali prilozi koji zajedno s Klaudijevim novcem datiraju grob u sredinu 1. st. Na osnovi nalaza posuda izrađenih u latenskim tradicijama pretpostavlja se kako je u grobu bila pokopana osoba starosjedilačkoga podrijetla, dok importirani prilozi svjedoče o ranoj romanizaciji južne Panonije i dunavskoga limesa. O postojanju složenoga pogrebnoga rituala svjedoče izdvojeni ostaci kultiviranih biljaka domaćega i uvoznoga podrijetla koje su bile položene u lonce. The high Danube bank near Ilok, {{which is}} {{situated}} on the western slopes of Fruška gora, was continuously settled in all prehistoric periods, and after that - as the finds analyzed herein indicate - in the Roman time, but Ilok experienced its peak in the Late Middle Ages, {{in the period of}} Nikola and his son Lovro. The beginning of excavations in Ilok’s upper town is particularly significant for reveal of the topography of Roman Ilok, which remained almost completely unknown due to a small number of finds. Data about the Roman settlement of Ilok (Cuccium) are preserved in several Itineraries, with different forms for the settlement’s name. Thus Notitia Dignitatum mentions two cavalry units, Cuneus equitum Promotorum and Equites Sagittarii, in Cuccium of the 4 th century. The excavations of the Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb began in 2001 in the extension of the eastern wing of Odescalchi Castle, to be continued in 2002 towards the west to encompass the lawn in front of the castle (Fig. 1). In preloess layer SJ 224 (10 YR 4 / 3) {{in the southern part of}} the excavated area, filling SJ 229 was isolated. This filling is the first in a number of preserved fillings of the larger prehistoric pit SJ 306 which by finds was dated to the beginning of the Early Iron Age. In prehistoric filling SJ 229 another younger rectangular filling SJ 230 (5 Y 4 / 3) was identified, whose western edge was damaged by recent burial in lime pit SJ 216, whereas the southern part lies outside the margin of the excavated area. Filling SJ 230 is part of the Early Roman grave SJ 273. Along the southern profile of the dig in filling SJ 230 a smaller burial SJ 270 and filling SJ 269, which caused no major damage to the grave (Fig. 5), were identified. The bottom of the grave with finds remained preserved, and the lack of incinerated human remains is possibly due to the fact that they are situated in the southern part of the grave, which has not yet been excavated, even though it is highly possible that they were destroyed in an earlier intervention in the grave filling. All grave goods were found in the eastern part of the grave (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). In the middle of the grave, close to the top of SJ 230, a hollow shafted iron axe (Pl. 2, 7) was found, which on account of its position compared to other finds is supposed to have entered the grave by digging through the older prehistoric strata, thus not belonging to the grave goods. On the bottom of the grave, filling SJ 268 (2. 5 Y 5 / 6) was isolated which belongs to the thin layer of preserved wooden architecture (Fig. 2 - 3), on whose remains in the northeastern corner of the grave two hand-made pots with a rounded body and a flat rim and bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2) were found, as well as fragments of a wheel-made bowl with an S profile (Pl. 2, 1). In the corner of the grave, fragments of a dark-gray bowl with thin walls (Pl. 2, 6) and a play-token of dark blue glass paste (Pl. 2, 1) were found. A part of the bowl was also in a pot laid slightly more to the south (Pl. 1, 2). Around both pots numerous seeds were identified, which is why the complete content of the filling around the vessels and their filling is flotated. In the eastern part of the grave there were fragments of a glass vessel, probably a funnel or a glass (Pl. 2, 4). Fragments of a ceramic lamp (Pl. 2, 5), a bronze earring (Pl. 1, 3), a fragment of a bronze needle (Pl. 1, 5) and an iron rivet (Pl. 2, 8) were found in the southeastern excavated part of the grave. Also in that part of the grave a bronze artifact, which probably represents a vessel’s handle fastening system (Pl. 1, 4), and Claudius coin (Pl. 1, 6) were found. Beneath the remains of planks, filling SJ 272 (5 Y 5 / 4) was isolated, which contained no grave goods. The excavated part of grave SJ 273 is rectangular-shaped with rounded corners with dimensions of 2. 12 m (W-E) and 1. 88 m (N-S up to the dig profile). The results of research indicate that all the grave goods were lain on the bottom of a wooden case, the existence of which is proved not only by SJ 268, but also by four uncovered post holes, one in each corner (SJ 277 and SJ 295), and two more in the middle of the western and eastern side of the grave respectively (SJ 275 and SJ 293). Although the southern part of the grave was not excavated, it can be assumed that post holes were in the southeastern and southwestern corner of the grave. All the holes are quadrangular, and in the bottom part they become octagonal to make post driving easier. The results of floatation of part of the filling around the ceramic vessels laying in the northeastern part of the grave and the filling of pots indicated the existence of a complex funeral custom which is reflected in the presence of a relatively large number of isolated cultivated plants. Archaeobotanical analysis showed that among grave goods there were cereals (barley, millet, and different types of wheat), leguminous plants (<b>lentil</b> and <b>vetch)</b> as well as a large number of “fruit” objects (melon/cucumber, fig, apple/ pear cherry/sour cherry/sloe, plum, elder and vinegrape). The fig and probably the melon were imported to the Ilok since they are cultivated in warmer (sub) Mediterranean areas, whereas the other sorts were probably cultivated in the surroundings of Ilok. All of the cereals and vetch are carbonized, i. e. they were intentionally or unintentionally burned. Apparently they were laid onto a funeral pile. The remaining “fruit” finds were calcified, i. e. they were laid into the grave fresh or dried, probably when laying the human remains and other grave goods. With the exception of the fig, which had to be dried due to long transport from the Mediterranean region, the remaining fruits could have been laid fresh. Apples, pears, plums, sourberries and elder berries as well as vinegrapes and melons ripen at the same time of the year, i. e. in the early autumn, which suggests that the burial took place in that season. Still one has to keep in mind that “fruit” objects could have been kept in dried state for a relatively long time. The remains of a Roman grave were found in the excavations of 2002, indicating the existence of a cemetery, which had been unknown until now. The grave contained a cremation burial, with grave goods that were laid on the bottom in the northeastern corner and along the eastern side of the wooden case, rectangular in shape, which was probably made of oakwood (Fig. 4). The answers to questions on the chronological position, ethnic determination and the origin of the finds shall be given after an analysis of the grave goods, which can be divided in two groups, the first represented by three ceramic vessels made following the tradition of the La Tène culture, and the other group of finds which are northern Italic imports and which, along with the coin, make dating of the grave possible. These finds consist of a ceramic bowl with thin walls, a glass vessel, a ceramic lamp, a bronze earring and a glass paste play-token. The same origin can be assumed concerning the finds that were preserved only in fragments such as a bronze handle fastening system of a vessel and a needle. On the basis of their shape and technological characteristics, the two hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the wheel-made, S-profiled bowl are connected with the tradition of the La Tène culture. The dark gray to dark brown pots with an admixture of quartz and chuff in abundance, have a rounded body, a flat rim beneath which there is a horizontal groove and a flat bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2). These are situla form pots, for which there are numerous parallels in the Late La Tène Scordiscs settlements in eastern Slavonia and Syrmia, found also in Early Roman strata and graves. Of similar origin is also the S-profiled, wheel-made bowl with a rich admixture of quartz (Pl. 2, 1) that was also found in the northeastern corner of the grave. The hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the S-profiled bowl represent the Late La Tène heritage of the Scordiscs and testify to the presence of an autochthonous population in the Early Roman sites of the 1 st century, whose traditions are the strongest in the shapes, techniques and methods of decorating coarse pottery. As indicated by the finds from the settlement layers in Vinkovci, Osijek and Srijemska Mitrovica, the local craftsmen continued the production of recognizable shapes, thus satisfying the needs of the indigenous population. Those forms were decorated by familiar motifs by applying combed or broom-shaped ornaments and by polishing. Ceramic ware with autochthonous features was preserved until the period of the Flavians, suggesting the existence of indigenous peregrine communities which preserved the achievements of their own material culture up until the end of the 1 st century, but due to intensified romanization in the 2 nd century this autochthonous trait The second and larger group of finds from the grave testifying|$|R
