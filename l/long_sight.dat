2500|$|The SG 553 is an {{improved}} {{version of the}} SG 552 and was released in 2008. Even though it mostly resembles the SG 552, the SG 553 has one key advantage, the recoil spring is now wrapped around the piston rod like in the SG 550/551 models, which address several reliability issues encountered in the SG 552 and also allows the usage of the standard SG 550/551 charging handle. The SG 553 series rifles have a [...] <b>long</b> <b>sight</b> radius. A long barrel version of the SG 553 known as the SG 553 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. Further factory options for the SG 553 rifle series are an integrated receiver Picatinny rail and an adjustable butt stock. The SG 553 R is a variant chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge fed from AK family box magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The SG 551 carbine has a short pattern [...] barrel, {{gas tube}} and piston {{compared}} to the SG 550. The SG 551 series rifles have a [...] <b>long</b> <b>sight</b> radius. The handguards were also changed and the bipod removed. The SG 551 cannot be used with a bayonet or fire rifle grenades. The SG 551 comes in several specialized variants designed for use with security and special forces. Among those variants are the SG 551-1P police carbine (designed to engage point targets out to 300 m; equipped with a Hensoldt 6x42 BL telescopic sight and detachable cheek riser), the SG 551 SWAT carbine (coated with a corrosion-resistant finish and equipped with an optical sight mount used with {{a wide array of}} sights, and can also accept mission-critical accessories such as a bipod, laser pointer or tactical light) and the SG 551 LB carbine with an extended [...] barrel that enables the use of rifle grenades and a bayonet.|$|E
50|$|The small diopter viewing opening {{ensures the}} shooter's eye is very {{precisely}} and consistently centered behind the diopter sight. The diopter sight {{is easy to}} use and usually allows for very accurate aiming, because a relative <b>long</b> <b>sighting</b> line can be used. A <b>long</b> <b>sighting</b> line helps to reduce eventual angle errors and will, in case the sight has an incremental adjustment mechanism, adjust in smaller increments when compared to a further identical shorter sighting line.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To explore why emmetropisation fails in {{children}} who have strabismus. METHODS: 289 hypermetropic infants were randomly allocated spectacles and followed. Changes in spherical hypermetropia were compared in those who had strabismus {{and those who did}} not. The effect of wearing glasses on these changes was assessed using t tests and regression analysis. RESULTS: Mean spherical hypermetropia decreased in both eyes of "normal" children (p 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with normal infants, neither eye of those who had strabismus emmetropised, irrespective of whether the incoming vision was clear or blurred. It is suggested that these eyes did not "recognise" the signal of blurred vision, and that they remained <b>long</b> <b>sighted</b> because they were destined to squint. Hence, the children did not squint because they were <b>long</b> <b>sighted,</b> and glasses did not prevent them squinting...|$|R
50|$|A normal {{levelling}} rod {{can be used}} for stadia measures at shorter distances (up to about 125 m). For longer distances, special stadia rods are better suited. In order to provide good visibility at long distances, stadia rods are typically wider than {{levelling rod}}s with larger markings. Since very fine gradations are not necessary for <b>long</b> <b>sights,</b> they may be left off the dedicated stadia rod.|$|R
2500|$|This {{book is a}} more {{complete}} version of a story summarized in Quenta Silmarillion. Húrin {{and his younger brother}} Huor were leaders of the House of Hador, one of the three kindred of elf-friends. At Nírnaeth Arnoediad they covered the escape of Turgon to Gondolin by sacrificing their army and themselves. Huor was slain, but Húrin was brought before Morgoth alive. As revenge for his aid to Turgon and his defiance, Morgoth cursed Húrin and his children, binding Húrin to a seat upon Thangorodrim and forcing him to witness all that happened (using the <b>long</b> <b>sight</b> of Morgoth himself) to his children in the succeeding years. There is little additional information about Morgoth in this book, except in the encounter with Húrin, which is set out in more detail than in The Silmarillion and in a more connected narrative than in Unfinished Tales. It gives the first allusion to the corruption of Men by Morgoth soon after their awakening, and the assertion by Morgoth of his power over the entire Earth through [...] "the shadow of my purpose".|$|E
2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] <b>long</b> <b>sight</b> radius. The return mechanism has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E
2500|$|The SG 550 series rifles have a [...] <b>long</b> <b>sight</b> radius and are {{equipped}} with iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation. The sights {{are similar to those}} on some Heckler & Koch weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating diopter drum soldered to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the gas block. The rear sight has an open notch setting marked [...] "1" [...] designed for immediate firing up to 100 m but also contains apertures with settings [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] and [...] "4" [...] corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges. The 400 m setting has a removable iris for sportive shooting. The sights are adjustable via micrometer screws with windage and elevation increments of 1.5 mrad or [...] at 300 m. For night use, the dedicated [...] "1" [...] notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally {{on each side of the}} notch and additionally in a flip-up post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank grenades.|$|E

40|$|In {{this project}} we examine {{to what degree}} the policy “Vækstplan DK” will deliver the {{improvements}} to the Danish company’s ability to compete on the international marked, that it promises. This is done by taking specific reforms from the policy and categorize them using Neoclassical economical theory. On that way, we get the deep explanations, on the transcendental level, that can explain why the reforms in “Vækstplan DK” would work, from a neoclassical standpoint. Those arguments will we criticize using postkeynesian economical theory, by comparing the arguments in each theory on the areas that entail the policy. The result will be areas where the 2 theory’s disagree, and the larger the disagreement, the larger the uncertainty there is, regarding if the policy will deliver the improvements to the Danish company’s ability to compete on the international marked that it promises.
