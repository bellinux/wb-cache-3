5|$|Delahaye had {{departed}} Mauritius in May 1797, arriving in France and on 9 July {{to be appointed}} as an official on a commission sent to Italy to plunder the libraries and museums of northern Italy {{in the wake of}} Napoleon’s victories there. On his return he was appointed head gardener, first at Trianon in 1798 and then, in 1805, on the Empress Joséphine’s estate at Malmaison. A Scotsman, Alexander Howatson, had been appointed Head Gardener at Malmaison. Napoleon did not <b>like</b> <b>having</b> an Englishman as an employee and being presented with an excessive bill by Howatson for transportation of shrubs to Malmaison, Napoleon had an opportunity to dispense with his services. The post of Superintendent of the Château de Malmaison gardens was given to the botanist Charles de Mirbel. It was through de Mirbel that Delahaye had obtained the position of Head Gardener at Malmaison, based on his successful restoration of the gardens at Le Trianon and also Marie Antoinette's old garden at Versailles. This garden was probably the most important collection of living Australian plants in Europe in this period. For several decades Delahaye was the only gardener in Europe who had actually seen the plants from New Holland growing in their natural habitat, and many of the plants he grew he had collected himself. Although tensions developed between Delahaye and Empress Josephine's chief botanist, Aimé Bonpland, Delahaye continued to work for Empress Joséphine until her death in 1814 after which he entered business (possibly in 1826 when Malmaison was sold) as manager of a successful private nursery at Montreuil, near Versailles, which also occupied his wife and sons. Here he kept a collection of natural history specimens and an extensive herbarium together with seeds and ethnographic specimens brought back from his voyage.|$|E

If the bottom cannot stand one any longer, the top will start the other.

A regular figure with Schläfli symbol {p,q} can be quasiregular, with vertex configuration (p.p)q/2, if q is even.|$|E

After the death of Ismail, the Turkomans managed to seize power from the Iranians, they were however, defeated by Tahmasp I, the son of Ismail.|$|E

They want to be with their owners and to participate; their {{activity level}} most often matches the activity level of the family. As a working dog, they <b>like</b> <b>having</b> a job to do and enjoy participating in hiking, carting, obedience trials, herding, weight pulling and backpacking with their owners.|$|E

The team struggled {{in the first}} class matches, where they drew two and lost three matches, and only looked <b>like</b> <b>having</b> a chance of winning in the last match against Kent. The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.|$|E
25|$|Womack and {{her husband}} are best friends with Scott Maslen and his wife Estelle Rubio. They have known each other since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack's two {{children}} and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was <b>like</b> <b>having</b> to kiss his sister.|$|E

25|$|Bennett {{was made}} an Honorary Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1987. He was also awarded a D.Litt by the University of Leeds in 1990 and an honorary {{doctorate}} from Kingston University in 1996. In 1998 he refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, in protest at its acceptance {{of funding for}} a chair from press baron Rupert Murdoch. He also declined a CBE in 1988 and a knighthood in 1996. He has stated that, although {{he is not a}} republican, he would never wish to be knighted, saying it would be a bit <b>like</b> <b>having</b> to wear a suit {{for the rest of his}} life.

It's like too much dessert or {{too much of a good}} thing." [...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.|$|E

He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I <b>like</b> <b>having</b> my privacy." ...|$|E

[...] Texas Monthly asserted that characterization was Koen's greatest asset, though the story's [...] "sense of pacing falters" [...] after two hundred pages. Another criticism was directed at the numerous monologues, which felt <b>like</b> <b>having</b> [...] "commercials stacked toward the end of a late-night TV movie." [...] Texas Monthly ended their review on a positive note, giving praise to the historical detail as well as the story's ending, which the reviewer believed would encourage readers to buy the forthcoming sequel.|$|E
500|$|Howarth {{also stated}} that Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding, even if reluctantly, did not make sense {{and that he could}} not, in good conscience, support Todd's redemption by continuing to play him as Todd Lord, who had become a likable character. [...] Since the rape was, as he called it, [...] "so in-depth and so brutal", he viewed Todd and Marty doing something <b>like</b> <b>having</b> drinks with each other bizarre. Entertainment Weekly reported that One Life to Live agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months. Indy Week said, [...] "Todd was partially redeemed into a self-destructive antihero who remained popular until the show's end, but his portrayer and many critics were wary of having him becoming a romantic lead." ...|$|E

While Margaret had been considered truly feminine, flexible, adaptable, humorous and charming, Mary was unyielding and authoritarian. Margaret accomplished her goals using a smile, a joke, or a word of praise, but Mary used cynical and biting comments. Unlike her aunt, Mary was unable to forgive or forget. She recognized this lack of [...] "power as a woman" [...] as her main problem.|$|E
