500|$|... "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Dan Gennoe of UK Yahoo! Music {{called it an}} [...] "ass-shaking" [...] and [...] "sweety back-in-the-day soul" [...] song. John Murphy for musicOMH compared Aguilera's vocals on the track to Mariah Carey's. He further wrote that the song makes [...] "you sit up and take notice" [...] and deemed [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] "the best pop/R crossover" [...] since Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love". Jody Rosen from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the track [...] "whizzes past at such a furious pace", while Kelefa Sanneh for The New York Times praised the song as [...] "the album's glorious, mile-a-minute hit single, which proves once again {{that no one can}} roar <b>like</b> <b>Ms.</b> Aguilera". Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{as one of the best}} tracks on Back to Basics. Jenny Eliscu for Rolling Stone was positive toward the song, selected the track as one of the best materials throughout the first disc. Writing for The Morning Call, Len Righi commented that [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "Understand" [...] and [...] "Slow Down Baby" [...] "put her at Aretha Franklin's doorstep".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{criticized the}} {{contract}} amount, considering it a gamble for Virgin. He stated that Jackson [...] "is a producer-dependent artist—i.e., someone who relies on others {{to make her}} sound interesting and trendy. She also lacks a sharply defined personality, both {{as an artist and}} celebrity. Where singers <b>like</b> <b>Ms.</b> Houston and Mariah Carey have commanding vocal power, Ms. Jackson's is a relatively indistinguishable studio voice." [...] Richard Branson rebutted this argument stating [...] "Ms. Jackson has met with great success working with the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, just as her brother Michael Jackson has experienced his greatest successes with the producer Quincy Jones. It is interesting that Mr. Holden doesn't mention this similar 'liability' when discussing Michael Jackson. To say that Ms. Jackson is 'dependent' on her producer is a shortsighted observation. She is a formidable talent who stands on her own." [...] Michael Jackson would break his sister's record only days later, when he signed a $60 million contract with Sony Music Entertainment. Both sibling's contracts garnered considerable criticism. Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "A Records President Al Cafaro, whose company lost the fierce bidding battle over Janet Jackson to Virgin Records, said record companies may be vesting too much importance in individual performers" [...] as the funds used as advances to the Jacksons could have launched recording careers for numerous unknown talents. Cliff Burnstein of Q-Prime [...] management commented that recording artists demands for advances upon signing would begin to escalate from that point forward.|$|E
500|$|In the Zone {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. It holds {{a score of}} sixty-six out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on thirteen critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Jason Shawhan of About.com gave a positive review, saying that while the album's vibe is sexy, {{the result is a}} personal statement from Spears. He also added, [...] "T's another thing about Spears' new record, as none of her previous albums ever managed to produce any kind of sustained emotional response than the pleasure that comes from a good pop record. I miss Max Martin, for sure, but it feels <b>like</b> <b>Ms.</b> S. has been paying attention to La Ciccone. To put it another way, this is Britney's True Blue." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album [...] " [...] all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern—it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums." [...] Ruth Mitchell of BBC Online called [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] the best track of the album, but added, [...] "Sadly, her attempts to prove her new-found maturity are what overwhelm and cloud all that is good about In The Zone." [...] Mim Udovitch of Blender commented, [...] "This I’m-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin [...] No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] the best and most straightforward moments of the album, but added that [...] "On a CD intended to celebrate her lurch into adulthood, Spears remains distant and submerged. For all her freedom, she's still finding her way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lavin {{appeared}} in the new Nicky Silver play Too Much Sun, which opened Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre on May 18, 2014. Ben Brantley, in his review for The New York Times wrote: [...] "And it's an unconditional treat to witness an actress <b>like</b> <b>Ms.</b> Lavin tuned so precisely into the writer's wavelength that script and performance become a marriage of true minds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Promiscuities received, in general, {{negative}} reviews. A New York Times review characterized Wolf as a [...] "frustratingly inept messenger: {{a sloppy}} thinker and incompetent writer. She tries {{in vain to}} pass off tired observations as radical aperçus, subjective musings as generational truths, sappy suggestions as useful ideas". Two days earlier, however, a different Times reviewer praised the book, writing, [...] "Anyone—particularly anyone who, <b>like</b> <b>Ms.</b> Wolf, {{was born in the}} 1960s—will have a very hard time putting down Promiscuities. Told through a series of confessions, her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire." [...] In contrast, The Library Journal excoriated the work, writing, [...] "Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white, middle-class, liberal milieu to a whole generation....There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005 she {{produced}} a {{show at the}} Boesky Gallery featuring elderly women posed in ornate costumes and wigs. She painted them in oils on ovals of glass and had them photographed. Her inspiration for the set of pieces was Miss Havisham from Great Expectations. She told an interview that being pregnant at the time, [...] "I guess I was thinking about mortality, feminine beauty, my fears about being a mother and an artist." [...] An ArtForum reviewer noted that the costume and pose of one drawing was a [...] "nearly identical copy" [...] of a Feinstein photograph in a Marc Jacobs advertisement {{from the year before}} and that the elderly model in fact looked much <b>like</b> <b>Ms.</b> Feinstein might look when she aged. The reviewer wrote the [...] "(self-)portraits" [...] felt [...] "in line with the current vogue for noble iconography" [...] and also described them as [...] "celebratory caricatures, self-indulgent and vain." [...] She also criticized the one foam and three wood sculptures from the exhibition as [...] "merely clunky hybrids of kitschy Cubism and craft." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{observational}} {{results on}} the globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies are summarized. Although the number of spirals with well–studied GCSs is still small, new studies promise to increase it rapidly {{in the next few}} years. New telescopes and technology have contributed to increasingly detailed studies of GCs in Local Group galaxies <b>like</b> <b>M</b> 31 and M 33, and more distant spirals <b>like</b> <b>M</b> 81 and M 104 are finally getting the attention they deserve. The Milky Way GCS looks to be reasonably typical of spirals, and still has a lot to tell us {{about the history of the}} galaxy. ...|$|R

5|$|The typical average equipartition {{strength}} for spiral galaxies is about 10 μG (microGauss) or 1 nT (nanoTesla). For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss or 30 μT (microTesla). Radio-faint galaxies <b>like</b> <b>M</b> 31 and M 33, our Milky Way's neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5 μG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, <b>like</b> <b>M</b> 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 μG on average. In prominent spiral arms the field strength can {{be up to}} 25 μG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated. The strongest total equipartition fields (50-100 μG) were found in starburst galaxies, for example in M 82 and the Antennae, and in nuclear starburst regions, for example in the centers of NGC 1097 and of other barred galaxies.|$|R
