5|$|In September 1950, Keith Richards and Jagger were classmates at Wentworth Primary School, Dartford. In 1954, Jagger {{passed the}} eleven-plus {{and went to}} Dartford Grammar School, which now has the Mick Jagger Centre, named after its most famous alumnus, {{installed}} within the school's site. Jagger and Richards lost {{contact with each other}} when they went to different schools, but after a chance encounter on platform two at Dartford railway station in July 1960, resumed their friendship and discovered their shared love of rhythm and blues, which for Jagger had begun with <b>Little</b> <b>Richard.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Little</b> <b>Richard's</b> show, {{according}} to Barnum, {{was the first}} rock and roll show to use spotlights and flicker lights, which had been a show business tradition, accentuating <b>Little</b> <b>Richard's</b> innovative use of colorful capes, blouse shirts, makeup and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins. <b>Little</b> <b>Richard's</b> onstage antics often included running {{on and off the}} stage, lifting his leg while playing his piano, and jumping up and down onstage and atop the piano, bringing audiences into a frenzy.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the release}} of The Rill Thing and <b>Little</b> <b>Richard's</b> last album <b>Little</b> <b>Richard's</b> Greatest Hits: Recorded Live!

5|$|In {{addition}} to performing on air for KVOW, Jennings {{started to work}} as a DJ in 1956, and moved to Lubbock. His program ran for six hours, from 4:00 in the afternoon to 10:00 in the evening. Jennings played two hours of Country classics, two of current Country, and two of mixed recordings. During those final two hours, Jennings played artists such as Chuck Berry and <b>Little</b> <b>Richard.</b> The owner reprimanded him each time he aired the recordings, and when he then played two Richard records in a row, the owner fired him.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{earliest}} recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like <b>Little</b> <b>Richard</b> and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became {{childhood}} {{friends and}} classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent, before the Jagger {{family moved to}} Wilmington, five miles (8.05km) away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, <b>Little</b> <b>Richard,</b> Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again in 1960 on Dartford railway station, and the Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records that Jagger was carrying revealed a common interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.|$|E

5|$|Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre {{has hosted}} the annual Idrettsgallaen, a {{television}} show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home and the summer athletes are off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include <b>Little</b> <b>Richard</b> in 1993, Vamp in 2005, Willie Nelson in 2008 and José Carreras in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of <b>Little</b> <b>Richard</b> and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E
5|$|Gillan's {{first attempt}} at a band was called Garth Rockett and the Moonshiners, and {{consisted}} of himself on vocals and drums, alongside guitarist Chris Aylmer, who later went on to work with Bruce Dickinson. The band covered songs such as Tommy Roe's Sheila and The Shadows' Apache. He discovered he couldn't sing and play drums at the same time, so settled {{on the role of}} lead vocalist, performing regularly at St Dunstan's Hall, the local youth club. He soon switched to another local band who also played at Dunstan's Hall, Ronnie and the Hightones, who renamed themselves as the Javelins after he joined. The band played covers of Sonny Boy Williamson, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and <b>Little</b> <b>Richard,</b> and were early customers of then-local music shop owner Jim Marshall. The Javelins disbanded in March 1964, with guitarist Gordon Fairminer leaving to join what eventually became the group Sweet.|$|E

5|$|In {{support of}} Kaleidoscope Dream, Miguel {{embarked}} on a short promotional tour in the United States on September 26, 2012. He also promoted the record with television performances on 106 & Park, The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He subsequently toured {{in support of the}} album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front of a mirror. In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after <b>Little</b> <b>Richard</b> and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E
5|$|The {{counterculture}} was a youth {{movement that}} included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and country rock of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of bands like Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by bands like the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic black rock songs by <b>Little</b> <b>Richard,</b> Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as the counterculture developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E

Prince has been compared with jazz great Miles Davis in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career; Davis himself regarded Prince as an uncanny blend of Brown, Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, Stone, <b>Little</b> <b>Richard,</b> Ellington, and Charlie Chaplin.|$|E
