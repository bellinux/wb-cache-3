40|$|This thesis studies a multi-factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton {{model and}} a LIBOR mar- ket model on the Norwegian, European and US {{interest}} rate market. The main concerns are the low-rate environment {{and exposure to}} negative interest rates in these models. We begin by introducing financial markets and the mathematical models explaining them. Further we discuss {{the problem with the}} current low-rate environment and the historical market practice. The focuses are implementations of two multi-factor interest rate models and the presence of negative interest rates. The historical data is provided by DNB and consists of zero coupon swap rates for several maturities in the period 2000 - 2012. The volatility factors are derived from historical data using principal component analysis and covariance matrices. With today?s yield curve the probability of negative rates is highly significant in the HJM model, whereas it is zero in LMM because of lognormality. Monte Carlo is used on the models to compare prices of caps and floors. We show that the models do not produce the same price especially around strikes near the current 3 -month rates. Further we price <b>long</b> <b>butterfly</b> spreads to show the absence of arbitrage in both models...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFew {{species of}} true {{butterflies}} (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) have evolved a proboscis that greatly exceeds {{the length of}} the body. This study is the first to examine the morphology of an extremely <b>long</b> <b>butterfly</b> proboscis and to describe how it is used to obtain nectar from flowers with very deep corolla tubes. The proboscis of Eurybia lycisca (Riodinidae) is approximately twice as long as the body. It has a maximal length of 45. 6  mm (mean length 36. 5  mm ±  4. 1  S. D., N =  20) and is extremely thin, measuring only about 0. 26  mm at its maximum diameter. The proboscis has a unique arrangement of short sensilla at the tip, and its musculature arrangement is derived. The flower handling times on the preferred nectar plant, Calathea crotalifera (Marantaceae), were exceptionally long (mean 54. 5  sec ±  28. 5  S. D., N =  26). When feeding on the deep flowers remarkably few proboscis movements occur. The relationship between Eurybia lycisca and its preferred nectar plant and larval host plant, Calathea crotalifera, is not mutualistic since the butterfly exploits the flowers without contributing to their pollination. We hypothesize that the extraordinarily long proboscis of Eurybia lycisca is an adaptation for capitalizing on the pre-existing mutualistic interaction of the host plant with its pollinating long-tongued nectar feeding insects...|$|E
