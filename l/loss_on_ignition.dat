25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (<b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition).</b> Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E
25|$|Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, {{although}} {{depending on}} the application, {{this may not be}} necessary. Ash used as a cement replacement must meet strict construction standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. 75% of the ash must have a fineness of 45µm or less, and have a carbon content, measured by the <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition</b> (LOI), of less than 4%. In the U.S., LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance. This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using beneficiation methods like mechanical air classification. But if fly ash is used also as a filler to replace sand in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the Bureau of Indian Standards mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the assessment of}} terrestrially derived organic carbon in sediments from two Scottish sea lochs. The results illustrate a smooth decrease in area-specific sediment oxygen uptake rates along a transect of six stations {{from the head of}} Loch Creran to the sea, from 18. 7 mmol O 2 m - 2 d - 1 to 6. 6 mmol O 2 m - 2 d - 1. Measurement of the <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition</b> at two temperatures (250 °C and 500 °C) of the sediment fraction from 1 ? 2 cm depth at the same stations enabled the proportion of weight loss that occurred over the high temperature range to be calculated. These show a smooth increase from 0. 33 to 0. 62. These observations indicate that (a) the amount of easily biodegradable organic material in the sediment decreases by two-thirds along the transect and (b) the proportion of refractory organic material in the sediment increases along the same transect. This suggests strongly that terrigenous organic material, brought down by the River Creran is a very important fuel for sediment diagenetic processes in this system. Preliminary analyses of the lignin composition of the same sediments indicate the predominance of non-woody gymnosperm tissue. Lignin is used as a proxy for terrigenous allochthonous material.

Biologically active, and stabilized samples prepared in the laboratory, were consolidated using the oedometer apparatus and the large hydraulic consolidation cell. Index tests, including specific gravity of solids and <b>loss</b> in mass <b>on</b> <b>ignition,</b> were used to quantify the level of biological digestion of the test material. Sludge in the liquid state had a low permeability of the order of 10 - 9 m/s, while consolidated sludge material was practically impermeable. Flocs of mainly organic clay-sized particles, which comprised roughly 90 % of the solids, trapped the pore water, resulting in the very low permeability measured. Consolidation largely occurred as a result of creep, and in the long-term, due to decomposition of the solids. Greater levels of biological digestion reduced the organic content and produced a more free-draining material.

BBSS from the Bothnian Bay were different {{than those of the}} Bothnian Sea and Baltic Proper, though BBSS from the latter two basins did not differ from each other. This difference of Bothnian Bay BBSS was indirectly attributed to salinity as it is a region impoverished in both marine and freshwater species; hence individual species size-distributions contribute considerably to the whole resulting in a different BBSS. BBSS grouped according to sediment LOI did not differ from each other. As there were no differences between LOI-grouped size-spectra yet geographical and hence species diversity groupings did differ, it is apparent that the sediment environment is less important than species diversity in determining BBSS patterns in the Baltic Sea.

5000|$|<b>Loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition</b> {{is a test}} used in {{inorganic}} analytical chemistry, {{particularly in}} the analysis of minerals. It consists of strongly heating ("igniting") a sample of the material at a specified temperature, allowing volatile substances to escape, until its mass ceases to change. This may be done in air, or in some other reactive or inert atmosphere. The simple test typically consists of placing a few grams of the material in a tared, pre-ignited crucible and determining its mass, placing it in a temperature-controlled furnace for a set time, cooling it in a controlled (e.g. water-free, CO2-free) atmosphere, and redetermining the mass. The process may be repeated to show that mass-change is complete. A variant of the test in which mass-change is continually monitored as temperature is changed, is thermogravimetry.|$|E
50|$|The key {{economic}} criteria for channel iron deposits are, firstly tonnage and location relative to infrastructure {{similar to other}} bulk commodities. Thereafter, {{the nature of the}} cement is important, particularly in the cases of carbonate cements containing magnesite, as magnesium is a problem. Rare channel iron deposits are rendered uneconomic because of a silica cement proving too durable for easy mining and crushing. The water content of channel iron deposits (quoted as <b>Loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>Ignition)</b> is from 7% to 12%, which is the highest of all iron ore types, generally due to the presence of goethite-limonite. Phosphorus, aluminium and sulfur levels are another concern, typically being above normal levels in-situ although if the phosphorus and aluminium are hosted in a weak cement, they can often be washed out during beneficiation. Most channel irons are upgraded via washing of the pisolite gravels to remove the cements and matrix.|$|E

The degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. Because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall, a mixture of underburned (i.e. high <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition),</b> well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced.

V. ] The final publication is available at link. springer. comSub-fossil insect remains have the potential to characterise changing environmental conditions in both lentic and lotic water systems, however, relatively few studies have been undertaken in riverine environments. This paper uses sub-fossil caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera) and aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) to reconstruct river flow conditions for a large paleochannel (from multiple monoliths) using the Lotic invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE). Examination of the larval Trichoptera and Coleoptera remains indicated a marked change in the community and flow environment, as suggested by paleoLIFE scores within the profile of three of the monoliths examined. At the base of the channel the community was characterised by taxa indicative of high energy lotic habitats with predominantly mineral substrates (e. g. Trichoptera: Hydropsyche contubernalis and Brachycentrus subnubilis, Coleoptera: Elmis aenea and Esolus parallelepipedus). Within three of the monoliths there was a change in community composition to one indicative of a low energy backwater/lentic environment with abundant submerged and emergent vegetation (e. g. Trichoptera: Phryganea bipunctata and Limnephilus flavicornis, Coleoptera: Colymbetes fuscus and Hydrobius fuscipes).
