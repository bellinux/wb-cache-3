The characters will be <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> in depth and analyzed as role models, both positive and negative, for the specific children they were written for. The research is centered around the main questions of what were children taught throughout different time periods and how the focus of the lessons shifted throughout each different time period.

30|$|This {{also raises}} the {{interesting}} and important {{question about what}} a book about pastoralism and development in West Africa would be like. Surely, there are similarities between pastoral systems in West Africa and the Horn of Africa, {{but there are also}} considerable differences. The arid and semi-arid areas of West Africa have been described as a mosaic of types of land use, population densities, and market integration (Raynaut 2001), where pastoralists have been integrated into regional economies and agricultural systems for long (Ellis and Galvin 1994, Kerven 1992). Moreover, pastoralists in West Africa are not limited to the arid and semi-arid areas; they have successfully expanded into the sub-humid and humid zones too (Boutrais 1996). Finally, there is considerable diversity of pastoral systems ranging from highly-mobile, extensive systems to more sedentary, capital-intensive systems (Moritz et al. 2009). In short, West African pastoralists have long been well integrated into the local, regional, national, and international economies. One could argue that for a glimpse of the different alternative pathways for pastoralists in the Horn, it may pay off to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> has been <b>going</b> on in West Africa in the last decades (Moritz et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Reception {{analysis}} {{provides a}} means of understanding media texts by understanding how these texts are read by audiences. Theorists who analyze media through reception studies {{are concerned with the}} experience of media (print, broadcasting, online media) and it takes a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> is actually <b>going</b> on. Reception analysis concentrates on the audience themselves and how they come to a particular understanding view of a text, and how meaning is created through that experience. An important concept of reception theory is that the media text-the individual movie or television program-has no inherent meaning in and of itself. Instead, meaning is created in the interaction between spectator and text; in other words, meaning is created as the viewer watches and processes the movie. Reception theory argues that contextual factors, more than textual ones, influence the way the spectator views the movie or television program. Contextual factors include elements of the viewer's identity as well as circumstances of exhibition, the spectator's preconceived notions concerning the movie or television program's genre and production, and even broad social, historical, and political issues. In short, reception theory places the audience in context, taking into account all of the various factors that might influence how she or he will read and contruct meanings from the text, such as in form of still images, moving images, or written. To understand the meanings that people take from a text it is necessary to get closer to individual audience members and engage with them at a personal level-qualitative research becomes a necessity There are obvious implications for research methodology. Quantitative research is not suited to investigating the construction of meaning. Keywords : Reception analysis, active audience...|$|R

Prior to the episode's release, certain scenes {{were reported to have}} been cut from the official broadcast, having been deemed too disturbing.

Lauren Cohan, who portrays Maggie Greene, made similar comments regarding the episode, saying some of the scenes were [...] "so disturbing", she did not think they would make it on TV. The series' composer, Bear McCreary, tweeted to parents of young children: [...] "Do not let children watch The Walking Dead tonight. Or ever again.

Despite his warning, McCreary said that [...] "No Sanctuary" [...] was his [...] "favorite episode in years, and, , the scariest score I've ever done."

40|$|The US dollar {{has been}} {{volatile}} and falling {{again and again}} in recent decades as well as recent years, and for many observers, {{it is going to be}} broken sooner or later. The central importance of the dollar is due to the fact that it is not just a currency for the US. Over half of all dollar bills in circulation are held outside of the US borders, and almost half of the US Treasury bonds are held as reserves by foreign central banks. The US dollar is supposed to be the anchor that stabilizes the global currency market. Instead, today it is a major source of instability. In the back ground, the US fiscal deficits have been running high again under Bush administration, once up to almost 3 % of US GDP. And current account deficit is set to about 7 % in 2005 and more volatility is widely expected. The situation is very challenging for the central banks of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore which collectively hold about US$ 2. 8 trillion worth of US Treasury bonds as part of their reserves. The moment that they reduce their purchases, the value of the dollar slips. Yet, the more they buy, the more they are exposed to a potential free fall of the US dollar. China has been blamed, not only by US congressmen who are understandably not very familiar with either the complicated currency issues or the domestic politics in any other country, but also many economists or business strategists. It was said that it was all because RMB did not reevaluate, as the source of this "global imbalance" and currency instability. How much revaluation of RMB would remove the US deficits of $ 700 billions, or at least the US-China trade deficits $ 200 billions (including Hong Kong) ? 500 % or 1000 %? Of cause no body asked for that kind of magnitude now. Normally smart people say 30 - 50 %, with the unsaid intention to blame-then-suggest again another 30 - 50 % after some initial moves, then the third, the fourth. This seems not really new phenomena at all. It has been all so familiar before and since the Nixon shock in early 70 s', and in 80 s' when there was the Plaza Accord. The convenient targets to blame were the gold standard, the Dutch Mark, the Japanese Yen. Now it is turn for Chinese reminbi. So the question is what are the real causes of the global imbalance and currency instability? In this short paper, we first take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> is really <b>going</b> on with the Chinese economy and trade balance, and then try to identify sources of the current imbalance, and then, as a concluding remark, think again the possibilities to reform the global currency system...|$|R
