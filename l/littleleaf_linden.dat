25|$|The present garden {{follows a}} layout {{established}} by Mellon. Each flower bed is planted {{with a series}} of <b>Littleleaf</b> <b>lindens</b> and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower bed facing the central lawn are edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers are interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, {{during the}} John F. Kennedy administration, {{the garden was}} largely {{redesigned}} by Rachel Lambert Mellon concurrently with extensive repair work to the East Garden. Mellon created a space with a more defined central lawn, bordered by flower beds that were planted in a French style whilst largely using American botanical specimens. The present-day garden follows the same layout first established by Mellon, where each flower bed is planted {{with a series of}} 'Katherine' crabapples and <b>Littleleaf</b> <b>lindens</b> bordered by low diamond-shaped hedges of thyme. Additionally, the outer edges to the flower bed which face the central lawn are edged with boxwood, and each of the four corners to the garden are punctuated by Magnolia × soulangeana; specifically, obtaining specimens that were found growing {{along the banks of the}} Tidal Basin by Mellon.|$|R
50|$|The bank {{building}} only occupied {{one-third of}} the site, the rear portion housed a drive-through window and large parking lot surrounded and intersected with trees. Landscape architect Dan Kiley chose specific types of trees and foliage in order to integrate the bank with its neighboring buildings and help shade {{the inside of the}} bank. He used <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> trees as the basis of the space, with euonymus as ground cover and seasonal spring bulbs, begonias, geraniums, and chrysanthemums as accents.|$|E
50|$|Lodgepole pine is {{the most}} common tree at Blue River, {{although}} its population has been severely reduced by the mountain pine beetle. Other common native conifers are Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, western hemlock and western red cedar. Among deciduous trees, the black cottonwood is largest; trembling aspen and paper birch are also prominent. Non-native trees which may be seen in Blue River include green ash, <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden,</b> silver maple, and Norway maple. Sugar maple, burr oak, northern red oak and butternut formerly thrived at the CNR Gardens.|$|E
30|$|The {{probability}} of failure increased with increasing DBH for eight species: green ash (Figure  2), red maple, white pine, pin oak, and, marginally, honeylocust, red pine, London planetree, and Liberty elm (Ulmus americana L. ‘American Liberty’). For red maple and Liberty elm, the correlation with DBH was only significant when a defect was not present. For green ash, evidence supporting the observation that the {{probability of}} failure increased with DBH more quickly when a defect was not present was less clear (Table  2, Figure  2). The {{probability of failure}} of <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata Mill.) increased when trees were in-leaf (Figure  2), unlike in red maple and Liberty elm, the only other species for which the effect of leaf {{was included in the}} logistic regression model (Table  2). The probability of failure decreased when defects were present for red maple and red oak, and, marginally, pin oak and <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Table  2).|$|E
40|$|Over three growing seasons (1994 - 1996), {{water loss}} of five {{recently}} transplanted, balled and burlaped (B 2 ̆ 6 B) tree species was investigated using below-ground, electronic weighing lysimeters. For each species, actual tree water loss {{was correlated with}} reference evapotranspiration (ETo) to create a water loss multiplier. At {{the beginning of each}} growing season a single tree was planted into each lysimeter. Selected species were London planetree (Platanus x acerifolia 2 ̆ 7 Bloodgood 2 ̆ 7), corkscrew willow (Salix matsudana 2 ̆ 7 Tortuosa 2 ̆ 7), <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordataI 2 ̆ 7 Greenspire 2 ̆ 7), Norway maple (Acer platanoides 2 ̆ 7 Emerald Queen 2 ̆ 7), and green ash (Fraximus pennsylvanica 2 ̆ 7 Patmore 2 ̆ 7). Throughout each growing season, tress were well-watered and lysimeter mass and meteorological variables were collected on site. Water loss multipliers for each tree species were calculated as the ratio of water loss (based upon total leaf area) to total daily ETo. Results indicate corkscrew willow and <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> had the greatest daily mean water loss (5. 6 and 4. 8 mm, respectively) (0. 22 and 0. 18 in, respectively), while Norway maple had the least (1. 1 mm) (0. 04 in). Water loss multipliers were greatest for corkscrew willow and <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (1. 1 and 0. 9, respectively) and least for Norway maple (0. 2). Resgression analysis indicated total daily ETo had limited influence on total daily tree water loss. This suggests factors other than ETo influence water loss of recently transplanted, B 2 ̆ 6 B trees in a semi-aird climate...|$|E
30|$|For most {{deciduous}} species, {{there were}} too few individuals to test the effect of leaf with logistic regression. However, the presence (London planetree, pin oak and red oak) or absence (green ash and honeylocust) of leaves presumably contributed to the probability of failure, which was in general greater for species in which most individuals were in-leaf. However, when we included the effect of leaf in logistic regression models (red maple, <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden,</b> Liberty elm), probability of failure was correlated {{with the presence of}} leaves only for <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden.</b> This disparity may have been due to characterizing trees rather than individual branches that failed as in-leaf or leafless. Although the percentages of red maples and Liberty elms that failed and failed at a defect were similar, as was mean DBH for both species, the probability of failure was noticeably greater for Liberty elms. Although a greater percentage of red maples had leaves, the cumulative diameter of secondary branches for Liberty elms was {{two and a half times}} greater than that for red maples. According to Nowak (1996), leaf area for a certain DBH for American elm is greater than red maple.|$|E
30|$|The {{aberrant}} {{timing of}} the snowstorm may explain inconsistencies with previous work in urbanized settings. For example, red oak and <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> have previously been considered resistant to ice damage (Hauer et al. 1993; Sisinni et al. 1995), but had a high probability of snow-induced failure. The presence of leaves presumably facilitated the accumulation of snow on branches. Conversely, green ash has been considered susceptible to ice damage (Hauer et al. 1993; Sisinni et al. 1995), but the absence of leaves on trees {{in the current study}} reduced the probability of snow-induced failure.|$|E
30|$|The {{study area}} {{is located in}} the nemoral forest region (Smirnova et al. 2017). This means that the {{potential}} vegetation on watersheds is broad-leaved forests dominated by the trees <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata), English oak (Quercus robur), Fraxinus excelsior, Acer platanoides, and Wych elm (Ulmus glabra); shade-tolerant shrubs and an undergrowth of shade tolerant trees occur in the understory; nemoral herbs such as Aegopodium podagraria, Pulmonaria obscura, Asarum europaeum, etc. occupy the ground layer. Light-demanding species, including an undergrowth of shade intolerant trees, occur in open habitats that are kept open by large herbivores or by destructive events, such as windthrow, or man’s actions, or fires.|$|E
30|$|Aside from {{differences}} between angiosperms and gymnosperms or {{the timing of}} leaf senescence for different species, tree size and its influence of branch morphology mostly superseded the effect of species. The only species differences were of attachment angle and the proportionally greater increase in branch length with DBH for green ash, London planetree, red oak, and Liberty elm, compared to red maple, honeylocust, and <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden.</b> In combination {{with the presence of}} leaves on most London planetrees and red oaks, greater branch length would increase snow-induced bending moments on branches of those species. We observed many weakly attached branches on Liberty elms, which is consistent with the smaller mean attachment angles measured on that species, as well as the number of defective branches that did not fail. Attachment angle may affect snow accumulation, and can also be associated with the presence of included bark, which we recorded as a defect and reduces the strength of branch attachments (Smiley 2003). MOR also differs among species (Kretschmann 2010), but the lack of correlation between MOR and the probability of failure was not surprising considering that failure depends on both applied stress and MOR: stronger wood only reduces the likelihood of failure if the snow-induced bending stress is similar between two branches.|$|E
40|$|Gas {{exchange}} {{and growth of}} transplanted and nontransplanted, field-grown Norway maple (Acer platanoides L. `Schwedleri 2 ̆ 7) and <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata Mill. `Greenspire 2 ̆ 7) trees were investigated in an arid climate. In the spring of 1995, three trees of each species were moved with a tree spade to a new location within a field nursery and three nontransplanted trees were selected as controls. Predawn leaf water potential, morning-to-evening stomatal conductance and leaf temperature, leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference, midday stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, and growth data were collected over a 2 -year period. After transplanting, weekly predawn leaf water potential indicated that transplanted trees were under greater water stress than were nontransplanted (control) trees. However, predawn leaf water potential of maple trees recovered to control levels 18 weeks after transplanting, while that of transplanted linden trees remained more negative than that of controls. In 1995, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates were lower throughout the day for transplanted trees. In 1996, gas exchange rates of transplanted maple trees recovered to near control levels while rates for transplanted linden trees did not. Sensitivity of stomata to leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference varied with species and with transplant treatment. Each year transplanted trees of both species had less apical growth than did control trees. Although gas {{exchange and}} apical growth of transplanted trees was reduced following transplanting, recovery of gas exchange to control rates differed with species...|$|E
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to investigate how energy balance of bark mulch and turf surfaces influence gas exchange and growth of recently transplanted trees. On several occasions over a 3 -year period, stomatal conductance and leaf temperature were measured throughout the day on `Emerald Queen 2 ̆ 7 Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and `Greenspire 2 ̆ 7 <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata Mill.) trees growing over each surface. Tree water loss was estimated using a general transport flux equation applied to the tree crown apportioned between sunlit and shade layers. Microclimate variables were measured over each surface with a permanent weather station. Tree growth data were collected {{at the end of}} each growing season. Soil heat flux data revealed that a greater portion of incoming radiation was prevented from entering the soil below mulch than below turf. Due to this insulating effect, and consequent lack of evaporative cooling, mulch surface temperature was greater, and emitted more longwave radiation, than turf. Leaves over mulch intercepted more longwave radiation, had greater leaf temperature, and greater leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference than leaves over turf. As a result, leaves over mulch had greater stomatal closure than leaves over turf. Estimated tree water loss varied between surface treatments and with climatic conditions. Trees over turf had greater shoot elongation and leaf area than trees over mulch. These data suggest that gas exchange and growth of recently transplanted trees in an arid climate may be reduced if planted over nonvegetative, urban surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} high sodium {{chloride}} (NaCl) levels on Na and nutrient retention of three soil substrates and on <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> growth in different soil substrates were {{studied in the}} laboratory and the greenhouse, {{within the framework of}} a substrate selection program for trees planted in downtown Montreal. In addition, the effects of the structural soil (SS) compaction were studied in the first greenhouse experiment. The first greenhouse experiment was established in a factorial arrangement of four soils x four salt levels in a completely randomized design with five replicates. The four soil types were (1) L with a bulk density (BD) of 1. 53 g/cm 3, (2) LP with a BD of 1. 26 g/cm 3, (3) SS with a BD of 1. 8 g/cm 3 (SS 1. 8), and (4) SS with a BD of 2. 0 g/cm 3 (SS 2. 0). The second greenhouse experiment had a split plot design. Two fertilization levels (with fertilizer and without fertilizer) were randomly arranged as the main plots on ten benches. Within each main plot, the combinations of three NaCl levels (0, 0. 5 and 1. 0 g NaCl/kg soil) and three soil substrates (L with a BD of 1. 40 g/cm 3, LP with a BD of 1. 13 g/cm 3 and SS 2. 0) were randomized in the sub-plots.

40|$|Although transplanted trees {{typically}} {{establish and}} grow without incident in frequently irrigated turfgrass, their performance in precisely irrigated turfgrass in an arid climate is not known. We investigated {{the effect of}} precision irrigation scheduling on growth and water relations of balled-and-burlapped <b>littleleaf</b> <b>linden</b> (Tilia cordata Mill. `Greenspire 2 ̆ 7) planted in buffalograss (Buchloë dactyloides [Nutt. ] Engelm. `Tatanka 2 ̆ 7) and kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.). Over 2 years, trees in turfgrass were irrigated either by frequent replacement based on local reference evapotranspiration, or precision irrigated by estimating depletion of soil water {{to the point of}} incipient water stress for each turfgrass species. Predawn leaf water potential and stomatal conductance of trees were measured during first-year establishment, and predawn leaf water potential was measured during a mid-season water-deficit period during the second year. Trunk diameter growth and total tree leaf area were measured {{at the end of each}} year. Values of predawn leaf water potential and stomatal conductance of trees in precision-irrigated buffalograss were lower (– 0. 65 MPa, 25. 3 mmol·m– 2 ·s– 1) than those of trees in the other treatments near the end of the first growing season. The longer interval between precision irrigations resulted in mild water stress, but was not manifested in growth differences among trees across treatments during the first season. During the water-deficit period of the second year, there was no evidence of stress among the trees regardless of treatment. At the end of the second season, total leaf area of trees grown in precision-irrigated kentucky bluegrass (1. 10 ± 0. 34 m 2) was 46...|$|E
