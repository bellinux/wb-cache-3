40|$|This paper {{describes}} a newly convened effort {{to design and}} execute synthesis studies in hydrology. We focus on an emerging view that human activities are affecting strongly {{the basic character of}} the water cycle, through a myriad of processes including water abstraction and flow diversion, <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change, pollution, <b>destruction</b> of aquatic biodiversity, and climate change. A major scientific challenge is to understand how these changes manifest themselves and if they generate synergistic impacts across the different scales. Our primary synthesis goal is to quantify widespread alteration of hydrologic systems over local-to-regional domains focusing on the Northeast corridor of the United States over a 500 -yr period (1600 to 2100). This is a region bearing sharp gradients in climate, land and water management and emblematic of pressures on water resources across the nation. This science agenda will be advanced through the activities of a consolidated Working Group (WG), which will study Regional Watersheds, Hydromorphology, and Continental Processes. The effort expands activities first consolidated under CUAHSI, and welcomes several new members who have led major CUAHSI, NSF, National Academy, regional, national, and international community activities. Our WG maintains cross-linked sub-groups on: Regional Earth System Models, Virtual Watershed Simulation, and Hydro-Indicators, organized through an IT framework to provide focus and unity of purpose. A project implementation design will be presented, including research, education, and outreach efforts...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} national, {{regional}} and global <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification {{systems have been}} developed to meet specific user requirements for <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> mapping exercises, independent of scale, nomenclature and quality. However, this variety of land-cover classification systems limits the compatibility and comparability of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> data. Furthermore, the current lack of interoperability between different <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> datasets, often stemming from incompatible <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification systems, makes analysis of multi-source, heterogeneous <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> data for various applications a very difficult task. This paper provides a critical review of the harmonization of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification systems, which facilitates the generation, use and analysis of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps consistently. Harmonization of existing <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification systems is essential to improve their cross-comparison and validation for understanding landscape patterns and changes.

The Ministry of Environment in South Korea provides historic <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> datasets, and in this case 30 M[*]×[*] 30 M <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> is used to calculate the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> areas.

Once the necessary information is set, GIS can easily calculate the total monetizable values of each <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> by multiplying per acre median values of each <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> with the total acre of each <b>land</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to detect <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> changes from remotely sensed data for monitoring environment. Although {{there are a few}} applications of visual textures to <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification, they are limited to a few major <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories with the application of one textural measure. For a semi-natural environment, such as Scottish <b>land</b> <b>cover,</b> there are many <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories, which differ from each other by subtle differences. For this situation {{it is not enough to}} apply one textural measure to characterise <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories. Moreover because <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change cannot happen between any two <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories, it is possible to detect <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change by discriminating between pairs of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories which could change from one to the other. This thesis, therefore, attempts to present descriptions of various texture measures for <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories and apply them to detect <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> changes by pairwise discrimination. Three different bandpass filter banks: Haar masks, Laws masks and Gabor filters are applied to extract <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> textures. In order to learn the difference between the three filter banks, we analyse the properties and the spatial frequency for each filter bank. Their abilities to discriminate different <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories are evaluated by discriminant analysis. Because the three filter banks divide the spatial frequency domain differently, their abilities are different. In order to learn which filter bank is the best for the discrimination of a specified pair of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories, we compare the performance of the three filter banks and obtain a ranking table which could be used as a textural knowledge for a system for monitoring <b>land</b> <b>cover.</b> Experiments on the Elgin area of Scotland show that texture measures are promising for discriminating <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories. And for each permissible <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change, the best filter bank is shown. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
30|$|For <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> {{determination}} of fire points, I used a 30 m resolution 1998 Landsat raster data set with 18 classified <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> types (Natural Resource Spatial Analysis Laboratory 1998).

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>cover</b> is of {{fundamental}} importance to many environmental applications {{and serves as}} critical baseline information for many large scale models e. g. in developing future scenarios of land use and climate change. Although there is an ongoing movement towards the development of higher resolution global <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps, medium resolution <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> products (e. g.

However, the current <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> products are not accurate enough for many applications {{so we need to}} develop approaches that can take existing <b>land</b> <b>covers</b> maps and produce a better overall product in a hybrid approach. This paper uses geographically weighted regression (GWR) and crowdsourced validation data from Geo-Wiki to create two hybrid global <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps that use medium resolution <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> products as an input. Two different methods were used: (a) the GWR was used to determine the best <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> product at each location; (b) the GWR was only used to determine the best <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> at those locations where all three <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps disagree, using the agreement of the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps to determine <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> at the other cells. The results show that the hybrid <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> map developed using the first method resulted in a lower overall disagreement than the individual global <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps. The hybrid map produced by the second method was also better when compared to the GLC 2000 and GlobCover but worse or similar in performance to the MODIS <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> product depending upon the metrics considered. The reason for {{this may be due to}} the use of the GLC 2000 in the development of GlobCover, which may have resulted in areas where both maps agree with one another but not with MODIS, and where MODIS may in fact better represent <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> in those situations.

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>cover</b> {{classification}} is {{the most}} important element of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> mapping and is a key input to many societal benefits. Traditional classification methods require a large amount of remotely sensed images, which are time consuming and labour intensive. Recently, crowdsourcing geographic information (CGI), including geo-tagged photos and other sources, has been widely used with lower costs, but still requires extensive labour for data classification. Alternatively, CGI textual information is available from online sources containing <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> information, and it provides a useful source for <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification. However, the major challenge of utilising CGI is its uneven spatial distributions in <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> regions, leading to less reliability of regions for <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification with sparsely distributed CGI. Moreover, classifying various unorganised CGI texts automatically in each <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> region is another challenge. This paper investigates a faster and more automated method that does not require remotely sensed images for <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification. Spatial clustering is employed for CGI to reduce the effect of uneven spatial distributions by extracting <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> regions with high density of CGI. To classify unorganised various CGI texts in each extracted region, <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> topics are calculated using topic model. As a case study, we applied this method using points of interest (POIs) as CGI to classify <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> in Shandong province.

Fine spatial resolution images are usually acquired relatively infrequently, whereas coarse spatial resolution images may be acquired with a high repetition rate but may not capture the spatial detail of the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> mosaic of the region of interest.

These experiments included comparative assessment of methods based on single-date image such as the super-resolution approaches (e. g., pixel swapping-based super-resolution mapping) and the state-of-the-art spatial–temporal fusion approach that used the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion model (FSDAF) to predict the fine-resolution images, in which the maximum likelihood classifier and the automated <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> updating approach based on integrated change detection and classification method were then applied to generate the fine-resolution <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps. Results show that the methods based on single-date image failed to predict the pixels of changed and unchanged <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> with high accuracy. The <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps that were obtained by classification of the reflectance images outputted from ESTARFM and FSDAF contained substantial misclassification, and the classification accuracy was lower for pixels of changed <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> than for pixels of unchanged <b>land</b> <b>cover.</b> In addition, STIMFM predicted fine spatial–temporal resolution <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps from a series of Landsat images and a few Google Earth images, to which ESTARFM and FSDAF that require correlation in reflectance bands in coarse and fine images cannot be applied. Notably, STIMFM generated higher accuracy for pixels of both changed and unchanged <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> in comparison with other methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for {{the comparison of}} different <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> datasets and illustrates how this can be extended to create a hybrid <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> product. The datasets used in this paper are the GLC- 2000 and MODIS <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> products. The methodology addresses: 1) the harmonization of legend classes from different global <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> datasets and 2) the uncertainty associated with the classification of the images. The {{first part of the}} methodology involves mapping the spatial disagreement between the two <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> products using a combination of fuzzy logic and expert knowledge.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the application of}} high-resolution satellite data for extracting spatial information have encouraged <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> mapping activities throughout Australia. Together with the increase of these mapping activities, the need for standardizing <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification schemes for maps has been emphasized. In 2000, FAO published a widely accepted <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classification system based on priori (pre-decided) approach, which can be applied to any area of the world. This study examined <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> features of the geographically diverse state of Queensland, Australia, with a special emphasis on dynamic <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> differences, and applied fundamentals of FAO LCCS to classify <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> of two different regions. These two regions; 1) the arid Mt. Isa region in northern Queensland; and 2) the urbanized southeast region including Brisbane and the Gold Coast, cover a diversity of landscape types. The combination of these regions is representative of a large portion of other regions of the Australian continent. Improving the resolution of national <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps is of a national priority as it required to address a wide range of environmental and natural resource issues. Classifications were conducted on SPOT 10 m satellite data, supported by 2. 5 m high resolution SPOT true colour images, ASTER, and some Landsat scenes. Other GIS data layers including SLATS 2001 - 2003 (Statewide <b>Land</b> <b>cover</b> and Trees Study) data and extensive field survey information collected from both areas were also utilized. Both regions were classified initially into three levels (dichotomous phase) of the FAO LCCS and then spectral features, field investigations, and other image attributes were used to generate 4 th level (Modular-Hierarchical phase) <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> categories. Results show a very satisfactory <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> map at 10 m resolution compared to existing <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> products. The standard FAO classification scheme provides a standardised system of classification {{that can be used to}} analyse spatial and temporal <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> variability throughout the country. This approach also has the advantage of facilitating the integration of Australian <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> mapping products with global <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> datasets...|$|R
40|$|Detailed and {{accurate}} <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> and <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change information {{is needed for}} South America because the continent is in constant flux, experiencing {{some of the highest}} rates of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change and forest loss in the world. The <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> data available for the entire continent are too coarse (250 m to 1 km) for resource managers, government and non-government organizations, and Earth scientists to develop conservation strategies, formulate resource management options, and monitor <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> dynamics. We used Landsat 30 m satellite data of 2010 and prepared the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> database of South America using state-of-the-science remote sensing techniques. We produced regionally consistent and locally relevant <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> information by processing a large volume of data covering the entire continent. Our analysis revealed that in 2010, 50 % of South America was covered by forests, 2. 5 % was covered by water, and 0. 02 % was covered by snow and ice. The percent forest area of South America varies from 9. 5 % in Uruguay to 96. 5 % in French Guiana. We used very high resolution (< 5 m) satellite data to validate the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> product. The overall accuracy of the 2010 South American 30 -m <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> map is 89 % with a Kappa coefficient of 79 %. Accuracy of barren areas needs to improve possibly using multi-temporal Landsat data. An update of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> and change database of South America with additional <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classes is needed.

It proposes a combined Remote Sensing, GIS and Cartography approaches {{in order to produce}} an accurate <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> layer at regional and local scales for an area where the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> features are various and complicated in configuration. The area between Prahova and Teleajen rivers is characterized by complex landforms as hills and depressions with active and dynamic geomorphic processes. This paper presents a model integrating a supervised classification derived from Landsat OLI images with currently available <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> models, as well as GIS processing results of data fusion and cartographic techniques for feature representation on the map, at different scales. Another research direction was to use some normalized differenced indices to separate the spectral classes, and to assess and validate the results from the classification. <b>Land</b> <b>cover</b> map was obtained using: 1) <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classes derived from supervised classification of Landsat 8 OLI image data, and; b) <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> features extracted from two <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> models (CORINE <b>Land</b> <b>Cover</b> and GlobeLand 30), integrated with the classification dataset. The results were confronted and validated with ground truth points generated from orthophotos and other satellite images.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Automatic <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> change {{detection}} via remotely sensed imagery {{has a wide}} {{application in}} the area of LUCC research, nature resource and environment monitoring and protection. Under the condition that one time (T 1) data is existed <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> maps, and another time (T 2) data is remotely sensed imagery, how to detect change automatically is still an unresolved problem. This paper developed a <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> parcel-knowledge guided method for automatic change detection under this situation. Firstly, the <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> map in T 1 and remote sensing images in T 2 were registered and superimposed precisely. Secondly, the remotely sensing knowledge database of all <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classes was constructed based on the unchanged parcels in T 1 map. Thirdly, guided by parcels in T 1 <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> map, obtained RS image statistical information corresponding to the parcel in <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> map. Finally, <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> changes were detected and the change parcel was recognized through the automatic matching between the database of <b>land</b> <b>cover</b> classes and the extracted statistics of parcel. Experimental results and some actual applications show the efficiency of this method. 1.
