5|$|A {{central part}} of Klamath mythology, the {{mountain}} offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding. Historically, the area around it has been inhabited by Native American tribes and settlers. Until the 1970s, a fire <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> sat on {{the summit of the}} mountain, and its foundation remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|Users of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift {{virtual reality}} {{headsets}} can tour Henry's <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> using the Steam application Destinations. For this purpose, {{the scene was}} rebuilt on the Source game engine. Firewatch was made compatible with PlayStation 4 Pro on its November 10 launch, with enhanced performance through 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range imaging. The free roam mode was enabled for PlayStation 4 Pro and Steam shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Calshot {{returned}} to duty {{as an active}} air base, housing two squadrons of Sunderland flying boats which {{took part in the}} Berlin airlift of 1948, before being passed across to Maintenance Command in 1953. The Southampton Harbour Board built a coastguard <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> at the castle in 1952, and the following year they began to construct a signal station tower on top of the keep, complete with radar and radio facilities, which opened in 1958. By then, military seaplanes had become obsolete, and the RAF station was finally closed in 1961.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} fire <b>lookout</b> <b>towers</b> predates the United States Forest Service, founded in 1905. Many townships, private lumber companies, and State Forestry {{organizations}} operated fire <b>lookout</b> <b>towers</b> {{on their own}} accord.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, {{during the}} Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt formed the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), {{consisting}} {{of young men}} and veterans of World War I. It was during this time that the CCC set about building fire <b>lookout</b> <b>towers,</b> and access roads to those towers. The U.S. Forest Service took great advantage of the CCC workforce and initiated a massive program of construction projects, including fire <b>lookout</b> <b>towers.</b> In California alone, some 250 <b>lookout</b> <b>towers</b> and cabs were built by CCC workers between 1933 and 1942.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
5|$|Development for Firewatch {{began with}} a single {{painting}} by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working {{on the periphery of}} game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The Real Monasterio de Santa Ana is a Christian monastery in Badajoz, {{declared}} a Bien de Interés Cultural site in 1988. It is {{the headquarters of}} the Order of St. Clare in the city and lies {{in the heart of the}} old city. It was founded in 1518 by Ms. Leonor de Vega i Figueroa, under the blessing of Pope Leo X, and belonged to the jurisdiction of the Franciscan province of San Miguel. According to the tombstone in the grounds, Figueroa was abbess of the monastery for forty years until her death on April 17, 1558. She was buried in the grounds, until moved to the Cripta Real del Monasterio de El Escorial. The monastery underwent a major transformation in the 18th century although the original structure partly remains. Outwardly, part of the building has buttresses and a tower with two bells. On the vault of the chancel stands a <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> with a lattice brick convent, topped with pinnacles. The church of the monastery has a single nave which was rebuilt in the late 17th century, and the presbytery is covered by a late Gothic rib vault dated to the first half of the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|The town's {{inhabitants}} {{paid the}} price for this neglect in September 1540 when Barbary pirates from North Africa carried out a major raid, {{taking advantage of the}} weak defenses. Hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The Spanish crown responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the Charles V Wall to control the southern flank of the Rock. The wall's builder, the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Calvi, also strengthened the Landport Gate. Another Italian engineer, Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino, extended the wall onto the Upper Rock at some point probably between 1558–65. A <b>lookout</b> <b>tower,</b> one of several constructed along Spain's southern coast during this period, was built at the eastern end of the isthmus linking Gibraltar with the Spanish mainland. This structure, known as Devil's Tower, was demolished during World War II. The German engineer Daniel Specklin is also thought to have been employed in improving Gibraltar's fortifications between 1550–52. Although there is no direct evidence, the Spanish fortifications {{at the southern end of}} the town are virtually identical in design to drawings in Specklin's posthumously published Architectura von Vestungen ("The Architecture of Fortresses") and on this basis it has been suggested that he was the designer of Gibraltar's southern works.|$|E
25|$|The Balsam Lake Mountain Fire Observation Station {{is located}} at the summit of the {{mountain}} of that name in the Town of Hardenburgh, New York, United States. It comprises a steel frame fire <b>lookout</b> <b>tower,</b> the observer's cabin and privy and the jeep road to the complex.|$|E

25|$|Balsam Lake Mountain, the westernmost of the Catskill High Peaks, was {{the site}} of the first fire <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> in New York in 1887, when a nearby sportsmen's club built it to protect their lands below the mountain. It was later taken over by the state, which built several towers {{culminating}} in the current one. The tower was manned until 1988.|$|E
25|$|While the {{mountain}} is {{closely associated with}} the highly popular eponymous ski area built around the Colonel's Chair ridge at {{the mountain}}'s northwest corner, that takes up {{only a small portion of}} the mountain. The actual summit, some distance from the ski area, is graced with a fire <b>lookout</b> <b>tower,</b> the highest in the state and second-highest in the Northeast. The former road to it is open to hikers, horses (and possibly mountain bikers in the future). It is the most popular route to the mountain's summit.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century it was {{acquired}} {{by the state and}} became part of the Catskill Park Forest Preserve. Its location in the Esopus Valley between the northern and southern Catskills made it an ideal place for a fire <b>lookout</b> <b>tower,</b> which still stands on the mountain's summit. The Mount Tremper Fire Observation Station has been restored and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hikers often follow the old road to it from Phoenicia, also a section of the Long Path long-distance trail, to enjoy the views from the tower.|$|E

The floors are connected by a well-conserved narrow spiral staircase only 1m in width located in {{the northwest corner of}} the building. The stairs are protected at the top by a rectangular turret. On the first two levels of the staircase there are slots in the external wall to admit light. The roof terrace is 27m above the ground. The turret projects another 7m and the <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> extends a further 5m giving a total height of 39m for the structure. The walls are 2.4m in thickness on the ground floor, 2.2m on the first floor and 2.0m on the second.|$|E
25|$|Just {{southwest}} of the parish church is a hill called Sacromonte, which overlooks the town and provides clear views of the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos. (There is a <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> here used when Popocatépetl is more active. This hill has been considered sacred since the pre-Hispanic period, when a god named Tezcatlipoca was worshiped here with dances and ceremonies from 23 April to 12 May. These days were known as “Toxcatl” or “dry things” as these days usually were {{the end of the}} dry season just before the rainy season. An image of the deity was located in a cave {{at the top of the}} hill. Today, the hill contains the Sanctuary of the Señor del Sacromonte and a chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Cameron Sim {{moved to}} Kobe in 1870, {{where he worked}} for the {{settlement}} druggist Llewellyn & Co. before establishing Sim & Co. on Lot 18. In addition to distributing Ramune and proposing the foundation of the KRAC, Sim was also known for leading the settlement's internal firefighting force, for which he held lookout from a fire <b>lookout</b> <b>tower</b> in Nishimachi Park near his home. He kept his firefighting clothes, helmet, and axe beside his pillow even when he slept and participated personally in almost every fire-fighting effort during his tenure. After the settlement was returned and the firefighting force incorporated into Kobe's, Sim was left a position as honorary advisor in the new structure and allowed to direct a team. Sim was also the vice chairman of the settlement's Municipal Council, and as the chairman was sick during the ceremony for the return of the settlement, Sim attended in his place and signed the associated documents.|$|E
