Limited experimental conditions, varied influence factors and diverging experimental data make it difficult to accurately predict the SCC behavior of DMW joints with complex geometry, material configuration, operating loads and crack shape.

40|$|Velocity {{profiles}} {{are measured}} using molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) {{in the high}} temperature test facility (HTTF) at Oregon State University during a depressurized conduction cooldown (DCC) event. The HTTF is a quarter scale electrically heated nuclear reactor simulator designed to replicate various accident scenarios. During a DCC, a double ended guillotine break results in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) depressurizing into the reactor cavity and ultimately leading to air ingress in the reactor core (lock-exchange and gas diffusion). It is critical to understand the resulting buoyancy-driven flow to characterize the reactor self-cooling capacity through natural circulation. During tests conducted at ambient pressure and temperature, the RPV containing helium is opened (via the hot and cold legs) to a large vessel filled with nitrogen to simulate the atmosphere. The velocity profile on the hot <b>leg</b> <b>pipe</b> centerline is recorded at 10 Hz with MTV based on NO tracers.

During the first 20 seconds of the event, helium flows out of the RPV with a maximum velocity below 2 m/s. The velocity profile transitions from parabolic to linear in character and decays slowly over the rest of the recording; peak velocities of 0. 2 m/s are observed after 30 min.

A primary objective of this work is to evaluate various NDE methods to assess their ability to detect, localize, and size cracks in steel components that challenge standard and/or conventional inspection methodologies. This interim technical letter report provides a summary of a technical evaluation aimed at assessing the capabilities of phased-array (PA) ultrasonic testing (UT) methods as applied to the inspection of small-bore DMW components {{that exist in the}} reactor coolant systems (RCS) of pressurized water reactors (PWRs).

40|$|Reactivity {{accident}} scenarios could {{originate from}} internal boron dilution {{in the primary}} system of a nuclear pressurized water reactor type (PWR or VVER). In essence the phenomena is caused by boron dilution following vaporization and condensation within the primary coolant system as a result a reduction in primary system mass inventory, e. g. during a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA). When the liquid level in the reactor vessel falls below the hot leg elevation, steam begins to flow to the steam generators and condenses there. This steam carries no boron, thus boron concentration in the cold leg loop seals begins to decrease. If for some reason this water plug with low boron concentration enters the core without any major mixing with the borated coolant, the result is a positive reactivity insertion. The paper presents an analysis using the RELAP 5 Mod 3. 3 for a small break LOCA in one cold <b>leg</b> <b>pipe</b> of a Russian-type VVER- 1000 nuclear reactor. The boundary conditions consider, as far as possible, a realistic situation in which the four accumulator tanks (SIT) and the three low pressure injection systems (LPIS) are available for core cooling but one of the three high pressure injection systems (HPIS), not serving the damaged loop, is not available. A range of break sizes (from 30 cm 2 to 120 cm 2) have been investigated in order to identify a range of potentially adverse conditions. From the results obtained, in some calculations boron dilution is observed in some loop seals. The worst situation was found to occur at the 40 cm 2 break size. However, due to ECCS injection and mixing an increase of boron concentration is observed in the upper parts of the downcomer. Additionally RELAP codes have been used to perform analyses of the balance of boron mass within the reactor circuit...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{removal of}} {{heat from the}} {{containment}} building is an important consideration {{in the design of}} a nuclear power plant. In this investigation a simple rectangular natural circulation loop was simulated to determine whether it could possibly be used to remove usable quantities of heat from a containment building. The loop had a vertical pipe on the inside and outside of the containment building. These pipes acted as heat exchangers. Single phase and two phase cases were simulated by imposing a temperature on the respective vertical <b>leg</b> <b>pipe</b> walls and determining the heat absorption from the containment building. The heat was conveyed from the inside of the building to the outside via the natural circulation phenomenon. A literature study was done to cover topics relevant to this investigation. A theoretical model using conservation equations and control volumes was derived. This model was based largely on knowledge gleaned from the literature study. The theoretical model was a simple homogenous model, which was sufficiently detailed for a conceptual investigation. The theoretical model was then manipulated into a form suitable for use in a computer simulation program. Simplifications were made to the simulation model and underlying theory {{due to the nature of}} the investigation. The simulation model was validated against published experimental results. During the simulation phase a number of cases were investigated. These cases were divided into base cases and parametric studies. During the base case simulations the change of key fluid variables along the loop was examined. During the parametric studies the hot and cold leg inside wall temperatures, loop geometry and pipe diameter were varied. The effect of these parameters on the heat absorption from the containment was determined. The simulations showed that with the current assumptions about 75 to 120 of the natural circulation loops are needed depending on their geometry and containment conditions. The heat removal rates that were calculated varied from 50 kW to 600 kW for a single loop. As explained in the final chapter, there are many factors that influence the results obtained. The natural circulation concept was deemed to be able to remove usable quantities of heat from the containment building. Master...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The High Temperature Test Facility (HTTF) is an {{electrically}} heated, scaled {{model of}} a Modular High Temperature Gas Reactor (MHTGR). Five experiments were conducted to study Depressurized Conduction Cool-Down phenomena stemming from a Double-Ended Guillotine Break (DEGB). After a DEGB, the reactor pressure vessel would depressurize until the pressures are equalized between the cavity that surrounds the reactor vessel and the vessel itself. Immediately following the depressurization {{there would be a}} large density gradient between the reactor vessel, which is full of hot helium and the cavity mixture of cold air and discharged helium. This density gradient would drive lock exchange flow, where the less dense helium would travel {{along the top of the}} pipe and the denser cavity gas would intrude into the bottom of the pipe and propagate towards the lower plenum. The cavity gas would then fill the lower plenum up to the top elevation of the hot <b>leg</b> <b>pipe,</b> which would then diffuse air into the core, potentially compromising core support and fuel integrity by graphite oxidation. Lock exchange flow is a density driven mechanism that depends on the density gradient between the cavity and the pressure vessel. Gas concentrations and temperatures greatly affect density and thus affect key time characteristics of lock exchange flow. The key time characteristics to be studied in the five experiments are: the time for the gas front to arrive at the thermocouple instrumentation in the cross-duct outside the lower plenum, the time to fill the lower plenum, and the times to reach instrumented posts in the lower plenum at various heights. The time to reach the plenum will indicate the speed at which the cold dense gas front is travelling. The time to fill the lower plenum is also the time of onset of molecular diffusion. The time the gas front reaches each instrumented post will display how the cold dense gas front propagates through the plenum. The first three of five tests were conducted at ambient temperatures with initially equalized pressures between the Reactor Cavity Simulation Tank (RCST) and the Primary Pressure Vessel (PPV). The next test was a heated depressurization, and the last test was a heated test with pressures initially equalized. These three categories of tests vary initial conditions that will change lock exchange flow time characteristics...|$|E

The initial pipe design suggested ceramic fiber blanket as the insulation material based on requirements associated with service temperature capability within the expected range, very low thermal conductivity, and low density. Nevertheless, it was {{not considered to be}} well suited for internal insulation use because its very high surface area and proclivity for holding adsorbed gases, especially water, would make outgassing a source of contaminant gases in the He-Xe working fluid. Additionally, ceramic fiber blanket insulating materials become very friable after relatively short service periods at working temperatures and small pieces of fiber could be dislodged and contaminate the system. Consequently, alternative insulation materials were sought that would have comparable thermal properties and density but superior structural integrity and greatly reduced outgassing.

40|$|The Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory are {{developing}} a Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) {{to serve as a}} demonstration of state-of-the-art nuclear technology. The purpose of the demonstration is two fold 1) efficient low cost energy generation and 2) hydrogen production. Although a next generation plant could be developed as a single-purpose facility, early designs are expected to be dual-purpose. While hydrogen production and advanced energy cycles are still in its early stages of development, research towards coupling a high temperature reactor, electrical generation and hydrogen production is under way. Many aspects of the NGNP must be researched and developed in order to make recommendations on the final design of the plant. Parameters such as working conditions, cycle components, working fluids, and power conversion unit configurations must be understood. Three configurations of the power conversion unit were demonstrated in this study. A three-shaft design with 3 turbines and 4 compressors, a combined cycle with a Brayton top cycle and a Rankine bottoming cycle, and a reheated cycle with 3 stages of reheat were investigated. An intermediate heat transport loop for transporting process heat to a High Temperature Steam Electrolysis (HTSE) hydrogen production plant was used. Helium, CO 2, and an 80 % nitrogen, 20 % helium mixture (by weight) were studied to determine the best working fluid in terms cycle efficiency and development cost. In each of these configurations the relative component size were estimated for the different working fluids. The relative size of the turbomachinery was measured by comparing the power input/output of the component. For heat exchangers the volume was computed and compared. Parametric studies away from the baseline values of the three-shaft and combined cycles were performed to determine the effect of varying conditions in the cycle. This gives some insight into the sensitivity of these cycles to various operating conditions as well as trade offs between efficiency and capital cost. Prametric studies were carried out on reactor outlet temperature, mass flow, pressure, and turbine cooling. Recommendations on the optimal working fluid for each configuration were made. A steady state model comparison was made with a Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC) power conversion system developed at Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). A preliminary model of the CBC was developed in HYSYS for comparison. Temperature and pressure ratio curves for the Capstone turbine and compressor developed at SNL were implemented into the HYSYS model. A comparison between the HYSYS model and SNL loop demonstrated power output predicted by HYSYS was much larger than that in the experiment. This was {{due to a lack of}} a model for the electrical alternator which was used to measure the power from the SNL loop. Further comparisons of the HYSYS model and the CBC data are recommended. Engineering analyses were performed for several configurations of the intermediate heat transport loop that transfers heat from the nuclear reactor to the hydrogen production plant. The analyses evaluated parallel and concentric piping arrangements and two different working fluids, including helium and a liquid salt.

The effects of muscle depth (Experiment 1) and radial distance from a heat pipe (Experiment 2) were investigated initially. Then the use of multiple heat pipes was compared with no heat pipes for the loin and hind leg regions of a carcass (Experiment 3). All three {{experiments were}} conducted at a commercial beef abattoir in Western Australia. Without heat pipes, the time taken for the temperature to fall to 35 °C in the hind leg was 10, 90 and 300 min for depths of 25, 50 and 100 mm from the surface, respectively. Temperature increased with radial distance from a heat pipe and the relative differences in temperature between different positions increased with time. Temperatures 110 min after the commencement of cooling were 35. 7, 36. 8 and 38. 3 °C for 20, 40 and 80 mm from the heat pipe, compared with 39. 8 °C without the pipe.

30|$|The {{benefit and}} {{practicality}} of implementing multiple loop borehole designs {{to improve performance}} and/or reduce installation cost is arguable. The use of a thermally enhanced grout with a single loop appears to lower borehole resistance by 30  % over neat bentonite grout at standard U-bend separations, despite higher thermal shunting between {{the legs of the}} loops. But, unless the <b>pipe</b> <b>legs</b> can be guaranteed to be separated and not twisted and contacting over a substantial length of the bore, this 30  % benefit may never be realized in practice. Physical separation, {{such as the use of}} Geo-Clips, is at least as beneficial as thermally enhanced grout. With this in mind, the obvious benefit of multiple loops in reducing borehole resistance is increased surface area for heat transfer and thinner HDPE walls that result from employing smaller diameter pipe loops. Another advantage to multiple loops is in lowering the pressure drop of the ground heat exchanger, which can be as much as 35  %. This benefit develops from dividing the flow into multiple pipe loops of a given cross section as well as shortening the length. In operation, this can save considerable pump energy over the year.|$|R

40|$|The Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) {{is a small}} shore {{bird that}} upon casual {{observation}} resembles the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus). The most obvious differences are in the dark beak and legs of the Snowy Plover {{in contrast to the}} orange bill with the black tip and orange <b>legs</b> of the <b>Piping</b> Plover. The two also have strikingly different calls (pers. obs.). In Nebraska the Piping Plover can be found along the Missouri, Platte, Niobrara, Loup, and Elkhorn Rivers and the sandpits associated with those rivers (Haig and Plissner 1993). Piping Plovers are also common along the shore of Lake McConaughy (Peyton 2004). The Snowy Plover, in contrast, has been recorded from only a few locations in Nebraska, and the only reported areas for successful breeding within the state are Harlan County Reservoir (Silcock 2004) and Lake McConaughy, where breeding has been documented since 2000 (Silcock 2000, 2001 b, and 2003). In Nebraska the Snowy Plover was listed as Casual until the designation was changed to Regular in 2003 (NOU Records Committee 2004). This change is reflective of the increase in sightings reported in The Nebraska Bird Review and the documentation of nesting within the state. The first report of nesting Snowy Plovers in Nebraska was in 1998 from the Missouri River near Santee, Nebraska (Silcock 200 la). This nest was apparently lost. The second and third reports for the state, and the first reports of successful nesting, were of adults with young at Lake McConaughy in 2000 and 2001 (Silcock 2001 b). Adult birds were sighted at Lake McConaughy in 2002, but it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t until June 2003 that a Snowy Plover nest with eggs was located at Lake McConaughy (Silcock 2003 a). Later that summer three additional broods were located, two of which eventually fledged chicks (Silcock 2003 b). Thus, between 2000 and 2003, there was one nest with eggs and four broods of Snowy Plovers documented at Lake McConaughy. Starting in 2004, the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District added the monitoring of nesting Snowy Plovers at Lake McConaughy to its annual Piping Plover monitoring plan. Presented here are the nesting data for Snowy Plovers at Lake McConaughy in 2004 and 2005...|$|R
