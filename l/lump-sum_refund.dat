40|$|Confusion {{surrounding}} {{the appropriateness of}} long-run considerations in effluent regulation has arisen in the literature and recently carried over into textbooks. We use a factor input model under oligopsony to show that, when firms can influence the level of marginal damages, a linear pollution tax does not satisfy the long-run entry-exit condition. Previous results to the contrary are shown to depend on restrictive assumptions. Efficient policy design requires a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>refund</b> or any one of various non-linear pricing schemes. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a 1992 {{decrease in}} U. S. {{federal income tax}} withholding that shifted the timing of income tax payments while leaving ultimate tax burdens unchanged. Consequently income typically received as a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>refund</b> on filing a tax return was shifted into the previous year's monthly income. This paper considers {{the impact of the}} withholding change in the context of mental accounting and finds a decrease in the probability that households contributed to a tax-preferred retirement account. Additional robustness tests show that short-term saving did not simultaneously increase and that the main findings are not driven by liquidity constraints. © 2010 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
40|$|By {{simulations}} {{with the}} dynamic equilibrium model TD-BU-E 3 DGEM {{the long term}} impacts of two alternative policy instruments for responses to climate change were assessed: green quota and double dividend. Electricity demand growth was de-coupled from the economic growth. 3 economic sectors, 5 existing and three new vintage electricity production technologies were considered. By 2050 the share of renewables in the electricity production could be reaching 0, 289 and there are sufficient potential renewable resources. The economic burden is bearable and the welfare is growing. Checking the double dividend hypothesis (trade-off b/n environmental benefits and gross economic costs) : {{the reduction in the}} labor tax is increasing consumption; the reduction of consumption tax to a lesser extent so but the reduction in the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>refund</b> to the representative household is detrimental to consumption. Hence, only for the case of labor tax recycling, we could assume the existence of a strong double dividend...|$|E
40|$|The 'polluter pays principle' (PPP) {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{principles}} that govern the European Union's environmental policy. Although PPP justifies Pigovian taxation as a legitimate policy means to internalise externalities, there is a potential contradiction between PPP and Pigovian taxation depending upon the definition of pollution control costs. We summarise this debate and focus on the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>refunding</b> of tax revenues in order to reconcile the PPP and Pigovian taxation. We propose equity as the guiding principle to select among various refunding schemes, and empirically examine a specific application. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{federal income}} tax system has become an {{important}} vehicle for social policy. Although tax expenditures are skewed toward middle- and high-income households, tax transfers to lowincome households increased substantially during the last decade. It is now common for low- and moderate-income working families to receive federal refunds of $ 2, 000 or more. Research shows that many families view <b>lump-sum</b> tax <b>refunds</b> as “assets. ” Thus, there are compelling reasons to leverage tax refunds for asset building. This paper offers specific recommendations for linking tax refunds with programs and policies that promote saving and asset accumulation in lowincome households...|$|R
