2500|$|In New Mexico, U.S., {{scientists}} {{tested a}} new terawatt laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as [...] "filaments". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments <b>lead</b> <b>electricity</b> through the clouds, {{playing the role}} of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand. Statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed—in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels.|$|E

However, with Global Climate Change becoming a greater focus in engineering, it is critical for energy to be converted in as environmentally benign a way as possible. There are different sustainable methods to meet the energy demand. However, the focus of this research is in the area of Waste Heat Recovery. The waste heat stored in the exiting condenser cooling water is delivered to the air flow through a water-air cross flow heat exchanger. A converging thermal chimney structure is then applied to increase the velocity of the airflow. The accelerated air can be used to turn on the turbine-generator installed on the top the thermal chimney so that electricity can be generated. This system is effective in generating electricity from otherwise wasted heat. power plant; waste heat recovery; heat exchanger; air velocity; thermal chimney...|$|R
40|$|The {{foundation}} STUNS {{is investigating}} a possible move of the Origo office with tenants {{to a new}} office space. The Origo office today has a low utilization rate which makes it interesting to investigate the possibility of having an office space based on the ratio of occupancy. The {{purpose of this study}} is to calculate a ratio of occupancy with the corresponding risk of overcrowding and estimate the energy reduction. When adapting the new office space to the optimal ratio of occupancy, three office design proposals will be created. With the chosen optimal ratio of occupancy at 68 percent, the risk of overcrowding spanned between 0. 3 to 0. 6 percent. All proposals based on the optimal ratio of occupancy <b>lead</b> to <b>electricity</b> and cost reductions. An open office design <b>leads</b> to an <b>electricity</b> reduction of 686 kWh and a cost reduction of 168 kSEK per month. An activity based workplace <b>leads</b> to an <b>electricity</b> reduction of 540 kWh and a cost reduction of 132 kSEK per month. An individual office design <b>leads</b> to an <b>electricity</b> reduction of 452 kWh and a cost reduction of 111 kSEK per month. A sensitivity analysis is made by altering input parameters. The analyzed parameters are the unique attending employees, the transition probabilities and the choice of risk of overcrowding. For optimal utilization an open office space is the best alternative because it requires least square meters based on the same ratio of occupancy and workspaces. But when considering more aspects about work habits, employees’ opinions and behaviour the optimal office design may need a different structure...|$|R

Using sub-sector and state-level manufacturing output data, along with past variation in energy prices, we find electricity prices––relative to oil and gas––to be {{more important in the}} manufacturing process, with a one standard deviation reduction in electricity prices leading to a 2. 8 percent increase in manufacturing output. Our estimated elasticities together with plausible reductions in electricity tariffs derived from the energy reform, could increase manufacturing output by up to 3. 6 percent, and overall real GDP by 0. 6 percent.

The US residential sector poses a significant opportunity for improvement in efficiency which will <b>lead</b> to <b>electricity</b> and carbon savings, further leading to long-term cost savings for each household. A {{way to think}} about energy savings is by considering two radically different approaches: voluntary simplicity or investment in technology. Investments in technology include retrofits for existing homes and building new homes more efficiently, both focusing on aspects such as heating and cooling, insulation, water use and water heating, lighting, and appliances. Voluntary simplicity is rooted in choosing a simplistic lifestyle, and simplifiers make alternative consumption choices based on ethical and environmental considerations. This paper will explore {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both approaches, including potential barriers to implementation and solutions, and will analyze the potential economic impacts of a major shift towards either practice. While investing in technology or choosing to simplify are not mutually exclusive practices, by analyzing each method separately it becomes clear that embracing either approach or a combination of the two has great potential to positively impact both the US environment and the economy...|$|R

Discrete and continuous-time formulations are presented that can {{address these issues}} together with multiple intermediate due dates.

So far, these emissions {{have not been}} taken into account when generation firms bid their availability into the National Electricity Market.

Thus, the electricity generation sector will need to move from what has been an essentially private (i. e. production) cost structure to a social cost approach.
