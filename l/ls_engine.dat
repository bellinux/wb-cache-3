50|$|Except for the Chevrolet Small-block V8 and Lamborghini V12, the Rolls-Royce/Bentley V8 is the longest-lived engine {{currently}} in production. From a standpoint of usage in currently sold vehicles, the 6.75-litre engine {{is the second}} longest-lived engine produced (after the Lamborghini V12, 1963-2010). Production of the Chevrolet small-block engine has been relegated to sale as a crate engine, and the replacement GM <b>LS</b> <b>engine</b> is dynamically unrelated to the classic Chevrolet V8 engine.|$|E
50|$|The first V-Series {{model of}} the Cadillac family was the CTS, which was built on GM Sigma Platform like the core model. Since a V8 engine was used, it {{required}} a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added. The spring rate was significantly increased.Right at front above the ground, GM <b>LS</b> <b>engine</b> V8 from the C5-generation Corvette Z06 was fitted and coupled—also from the C5 Z06—with a six-speed Tremec manual transmission.|$|E

5000|$|All US {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with an electronically controlled Aisin AW-series automatic transmission. Beginning in the 1995 model year, European cars with the 2.5 <b>L</b> <b>engines</b> were also available with a manual transmission, the so-called M90, a strong new design that {{was derived from the}} Volvo 850's transmission. With the demise of the 2.5 <b>L</b> <b>engine,</b> the M90 was paired with a detuned version (...) of the 3.0 <b>L</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to its {{economical}} cost {{to build}} and maintain, access to new parts and good balance between weight and power, the sandrail continues {{to be used by}} many enthusiasts today. However, the heavier and typically more powerful sandcar now represents another style for duners. [...] This style often employs mammoth cars weighing several thousand pounds and using highly advanced suspension systems and transmissions coupled with large performance V8 engines such as the latest GM <b>LS</b> <b>engine</b> series, Ford Modular engine series or Range Rover engine series.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007 {{the brand}} {{announced}} the first Portuguese sports car. Its design {{was inspired by}} the cars of the 60's and 70's.

The rest of car was claimed to be a product of Portuguese engineering (serious doubts on this matter are expressed on the Portuguese Wikipedia page for the car), produced with the experience of working for other brands like UMM and Bravia (builder of the Chaimite series of armoured vehicles). The brand, Vinci, is also developing other models like Vinci Sport, Vinci TT (from the Portuguese [...] "Todo-o-terreno" [...] All Terrain) and Vinci Eco (a 'nature-friendly' car). The company wants to forget less successful Portuguese experiences in the automotive industry, such as UMM and Bravia, and instead follow the example of AJP, a Portuguese builder of motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{touted as}} one of the most {{important}} new engine concepts by delivering a diesel that is both capable and compact, this engine is not yet commercially launched. The engine project is currently on an indefinite hold. GM planned a 4.5L 72-degree V8 for light-duty applications which would be built at GM's powertrain facility in Tonawanda, New York after 2009. Designed to fit in the same space as an <b>LS</b> <b>engine,</b> it is expected to produce over [...] and 520 lbft Nm of torque while delivering 25% better fuel efficiency than a gasoline equivalent. An electronically controlled, 29,000-psi (2,000 bar) common-rail fuel system is also used on the engine with an ability to inject fuel five times per combustion event. It was initially targeted for the Chevy Silverado/GMC Sierra and Hummer H2.Unlike previous Duramax engines, the 4.5-liter is planned to be designed and built entirely by GM without assistance from Isuzu.|$|E

5000|$|MAFless tuning is {{a popular}} {{modification}} in Australia for Holden vehicles powered by the General Motors LS1 Gen III 5.7 V8 engine. The genesis for MAFless tuning of the LS1 in Australia was the HSV GTS version of the Holden Commodore, which was factory fitted with a Callaway-developed C4B version of that engine running in MAFless mode. Rated at 300 kW, the C4B was the most powerful factory LS1 sold in Australia and created substantial credibility for MAFless tuning of LS1 V8s. Within days of the HSV GTS's release the CSV Veloce was on the Australian market with a 330 kW LS1 incorporating a MAFless configuration. The MAFless configuration was later dropped by HSV and subsequent cars have all had MAF's. MAFless tuned <b>LS</b> <b>engine</b> equipped vehicles never eventuated in the United States as the C5 Corvette with the same engine was always fitted with a MAF sensor. It featured a larger MAF sensor body than the ones installed in the Australian cars, to avoid any intake restriction issues and still deliver accurate injection at all times.|$|E
5000|$|The CTS sedan is {{enhanced}} with GM performance parts like a GM <b>LS</b> <b>engine</b> V8 from the C5-generation Chevrolet Corvette Z06, {{as well as}} the Corvette Z06's six-speed Tremec manual transmission. The LS family of V8 engines share no common parts with the antique [...] "small block" [...] V8 Designed by Ed Cole and his team in the early 50's. The block design and head are all clean sheet designs and carry no parts or dimensions other than bore spacing with the old designs. This becomes apparent when comparing the differences between intake and exhaust manifold designs. The intake and exhaust ports are evenly spaced apart unlike the old [...] "small block". From 2004 and 2005, the CTS-V came with the 5.7 L pushrod OHV LS6 engine producing [...] at 6,000 rpm and 395 lbft Nm of torque at 4,800 rpm. The 5 lbft Nm torque reduction of the CTS-V vs the LS6 used in the C5 Z06, was due to the exhaust manifold that needed to be used on the CTS-V. From 2006 to 2007, the previous LS6 engine was superseded by the new 6.0 L OHV LS2 engine as used in the base 2005 Chevrolet Corvette. The new LS2 engine was rated at the same [...] at 6,000 rpm with the peak torque of 395 lbft Nm at 4,400 rpm. While both engines offer the same HP and torque specifications, the LS2's benefit was a wider torque band, due to the higher displacement it offered.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research is to design and develop a web-based personalized learning system called Personalized Learning Material Generator System (PLMGS). Initially, the researcher investigated the individual differences {{with respect to their}} learning strength (LS) based on the individual multiple intelligence, computer screen design preferences and learning object (LO) format to a group of 475 full time students attending bachelor degree programs at the Faculty of Education, UTM. Information pertaining to LS was collected using questionnaire which measured eight different constructs while information of screen design preferences and LO format was collected using self-designed checklists. This information served as a basis of the development of individual learning preferences (LP) profile. The LP was then used in the design and development of a prototype of PLMGS learning system which comprised of five main components namely, <b>LS</b> <b>engine</b> profile, LO, menu template, learning object repository system (LORS) and the integration of PLMGS into the Moodle e-learning platform. The design and development of PLMGS was based on ADDIE model using PHP and Javascript as programming languages. A series of quantitative pattern analysis study has identified three dominant LS components among the learners namely Verbal (V), Mathematical (M) and Spatial (S). Each of these LS dominants was found to be correlated to specific type of screen design preferences. A study of suitability of PLMGS (in terms of preferred screen design and LO) conducted on 102 students has found that most of the learning materials produced by PLMGS suit most of the individual student’s learning preferences. By at large, the study has contributed a useful framework in the design and development of personalized learning system that integrates individual LS, screen design preferences and LO format which is believed to give crucial benefits especially in elearning and personalized learning environment field...|$|E
