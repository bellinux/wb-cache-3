2500|$|With the Islamic Mughal empire {{falling apart}} in the 18th century, {{regional}} post-Mughal ruling elites and new dynasties from diverse religious, geographical and <b>linguistic</b> <b>background</b> attempted to assert their power {{in different parts of}} India. Bayly states that these obscure post-Mughal elites associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, deploying the symbols of caste and kinship to divide their populace and consolidate their power. In addition, in this fluid stateless environment, some of the previously casteless segments of society grouped themselves into caste groups. However, in 18th century writes Bayly, India-wide networks of merchants, armed ascetics and armed tribal people often ignored these ideologies of caste. Most people did not treat caste norms as given absolutes writes Bayly, but challenged, negotiated and adapted these norms to their circumstances. Communities teamed in different regions of India, into [...] "collective classing" [...] to mold the social stratification in order to maximise assets and protect themselves from loss. The [...] "caste, class, community" [...] structure that formed became valuable in a time when state apparatus was fragmenting, was unreliable and fluid, when rights and life were unpredictable.|$|E

The current design neither includes periphery students 2 ̆ 7 cultural and linguistic norms and values, nor does it allow them to affect the existing design through their design activities. These LMSs are currently constraining users from higher-level interactions. As a result, writing students have to act as the LMS ask them to do, and they remain passive in these platforms. Based on the web usability test responses, this study proposes to invite Citizen Designers, writing students from periphery cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> to design LMS interfaces to enhance user activities and transform them into cross-cultural platforms. This study analyzes interface designs by Citizen Designers to see how designers acquire their agency in a cross-cultural digital contact zone. This study concludes that Citizen Designers 2 ̆ 7 participation in interface design helps them create favorable electronic environments that help them acquire their agency and enhance their (digital) writings and researches. ...|$|R
