5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built {{using a combination}} of cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after the construction of the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street <b>Line</b> <b>side,</b> the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a false ceiling was placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street <b>Line</b> <b>side,</b> the southern side. Finishing touches were only applied to the IND side of the station. The tracks on the closed-off BMT side were used only to store trains outside of rush hour.|$|E

The bridges {{on either side of}} the station bear a notice issued by British Rail in 1987 stating that the trackbed still belongs to British Rail. <b>Line</b> <b>side</b> markers remain dotted about the old trackbed. Following closure, the station site was used as a car park.|$|E

2500|$|Where the {{building}} wiring system defines a [...] "neutral" [...] conductor that {{is close to}} earth potential, it is an advantage for appliance designers to preserve that distinction. For example, appliances may ensure single-pole switches interrupt the <b>line</b> <b>side</b> of the circuit, or ensure that screw-base lampholder shells {{are connected to the}} neutral side of the supply, minimizing the chance of contact with live parts. This requires a plug that can only be connected in one way to the socket, so that the energised and neutral conductors are not interchanged. In most designs, such [...] "polarized" [...] plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarized plugs.|$|E
2500|$|... the LIRR has 8 {{active control}} towers. All {{movements}} on the LIRR {{are under the}} control of the Movement Bureau in Jamaica, which gives orders to the towers that control a specific portion of the railroad. Movements in Amtrak territory are controlled by Penn Station Control Center or PSCC, run jointly by the LIRR and Amtrak. The PSCC controls as far east as Harold Interlocking, in Sunnyside, Queens. The PSCC replaced several towers. The Jamaica Control Center, operational since the third quarter of 2010, controls the area around Jamaica terminal by direct control of interlockings. This replaced several towers in Jamaica including Jay and Hall towers at the west and east ends of Jamaica station respectively. At additional locations, <b>line</b> <b>side</b> towers control the various switches and signals in accordance with the timetable and under the direction of the Movement Bureau in Jamaica.|$|E

50|$|The {{side of the}} {{transformer}} {{facing the}} line, in a good quality design, will have the winding laid in two parts (often with a centre tap provided) which are carefully balanced to maintain the line balance. <b>Line</b> <b>side</b> and equipment side windings are more useful concepts than the more usual primary and secondary windings when discussing these kinds of transformers. At the sending end the <b>line</b> <b>side</b> winding is the secondary, but at the receiving end the <b>line</b> <b>side</b> winding is the primary. When discussing a two-wire circuit primary and secondary cease to have any meaning at all, since signals are flowing in both directions at once.|$|E
