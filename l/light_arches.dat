[...] Now, taking these three distinctive attributes, the mysterious, the graceful, and the voluptuous, what is the whole character? Very nearly--the Greek: for these attributes, common to all picturesque blue country, are modified in the degree of their presence by every climate. In England they are all low in their tone; but as we go southward, the voluptuousness becomes deeper in feeling as the colors of the earth and the heaven become purer and more passionate, and [...] "the purple of ocean deepest of dye;" [...] the mystery becomes mightier, for the greater and more universal energy of the beautiful permits its features to come nearer, and to rise into the sublime, without causing fear. It is thus that we get the essence of the Greek feeling, as it was embodied in their finest imaginations, as it showed itself in the works of their sculptors and their poets, in which sensation was made almost equal with thought, and deified by its nobility of association; at once voluptuous, refined, dreamily mysterious, infinitely beautiful. Hence, it appears that the spirit of this blue country is essentially Greek; though, in England and in other northern localities, that spirit is possessed by it in a diminished and degraded degree. It is also the natural dominion of the villa, possessing all the attributes which attracted the Romans, when, in their hours of idleness, they lifted the <b>light</b> <b>arches</b> along the echoing promontories of Tiber. It is especially suited to the expression of the edifice of pleasure; and, therefore, is most capable of being adorned by it.|$|E
60|$|The Villa Pandolfini stood {{directly}} upon a small grass-grown piazza, {{on the top}} of a hill which sloped {{straight from}} one of the gates of Florence. It offered to the outer world a long, rather low facade, colored a dull, dark yellow, and pierced with windows of various sizes, no one of which, save those on the ground floor, was on the same level with any other. Within, it had a great, cool, gray cortile, with high, <b>light</b> <b>arches</b> around it, heavily-corniced doors, of majestic altitude, opening out of it, and a beautiful mediaeval well on one side of it. Mrs. Hudson's rooms opened into a small garden supported on immense substructions, which were planted on the farther side of the hill, as it sloped steeply away. This garden was a charming place. Its south wall was curtained with a dense orange vine, a dozen fig-trees offered you their large-leaved shade, and over the low parapet the soft, grave Tuscan landscape kept you company. The rooms themselves were as high as chapels and as cool as royal sepulchres. Silence, peace, and security seemed to abide in the ancient house and make it an ideal refuge for aching hearts. Mrs. Hudson had a stunted, brown-faced Maddalena, who wore a crimson handkerchief passed over her coarse, black locks and tied under her sharp, pertinacious chin, and a smile which was as brilliant as a prolonged flash of lightning. She smiled at everything in life, especially the things she did n't like and which kept her talent for mendacity in healthy exercise. A glance, a word, a motion was sufficient to make her show her teeth at you like a cheerful she-wolf. This inexpugnable smile constituted her whole vocabulary in her dealings with her melancholy mistress, to whom she had been bequeathed by the late occupant of the apartment, and who, to Rowland's satisfaction, promised to be diverted from her maternal sorrows by the still deeper perplexities of Maddalena's theory of roasting, sweeping, and bed-making.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{the tight}} {{schedule}} (originally the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition was planned to open {{as early as}} 1937) {{and the lack of}} a fully developed architectural plan, the reconstruction of 1st Meshchanskaya street was put almost to chance. The street was divided into sections and assigned architects from APU 4 including D. D. Bulgakov, K. I. Dzhusom-Danilenko, E.P. Egorov, V.N. Kolpakova, M.S. Zhirovim, Maximov; the project also attracted architects from other workshops of the Moscow City Council - S. G. Andrievsky (APU 6), architects V. Minkov and P. Nesterov, from the studio of D. F. Friedman (APU 5), A.G. Turkenidze (APU 11), and others. In the spring of 1936 the design department the Moscow City Council delivered plans for the first buildings. Most of them were immediately accepted with minor adjustments, but a number of proposed plans were rejected. For instance, a residential project at the Botanical Garden designed by Konstantin Melnikov was rejected, the form of which would have combined <b>light</b> <b>arches,</b> similar to dried plants for a herbarium, and balconies in the form of bunches of flowers. [...] In 1937 the Great and Small Krestovsky overpasses were built on the street.|$|E

5000|$|The Parkade {{incorporated}} {{many new}} and innovative design features for a parking structure. The skywalks that circle the structure {{were the first}} of its kind found on a parking center and was one of the few 'modern' parking facilities with a roof, a realistic and sensible solution given the climate of the region. The design separated pedestrian and automobile entrances and exits, a consideration not found on similar parking garages of the time period. Floors in the garage are sloped to allow for maximum parking spaces, the architect commented, “All the floors are sloping in this thing - parking structures aren't easy to design.” Light, long columns in the exterior design were used to create a vertical effect. <b>Light</b> <b>arches,</b> a 'working arch', creates a wide overhang at the top, protecting the white outer walls and shielding the structure from bad weather. A striking feature of the center is its sculptured tower extending 175 feet above the ground and far above the main structure. Its major function is housing the mechanisms for the passenger elevators. The tower also serves as a beacon to motorists, signaling a safe place to park their vehicles. And people were the center of the design claimed the architect Heylman, “There will be a news stand and outdoor restaurant with brightly colored umbrellas, a city ticket booth, and other pleasant facilities. The environment is designed for people - not things.” ...|$|E

50|$|The 1922 Memorial Bridge {{includes}} the longest single concrete arch span in Massachusetts. Its self-supporting steel rib arches represent an uncommon refinement of Melan's original idea - {{by making the}} steel arches self-supporting, and using them to support their own load plus {{the weight of the}} formwork and the wet concrete during construction, an initial compressive stress was developed in the steel prior to the setting of the concrete. This prestressing of the steel allowed a much higher proportion of its ultimate strength to be utilized, allowing, in turn, the use of smaller and <b>lighter</b> <b>arch</b> ribs and a less massive substructure.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} silence the {{activity}} of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would open up the ability to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviors, and pathologies. Here we show {{that members of the}} class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate very powerful, safe, multiple-color silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin- 31 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near- 100 % silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow <b>light.</b> <b>Arch</b> mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. In addition, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally-relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins 2, 3 or natural spike firing.
