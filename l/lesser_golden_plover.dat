40|$|We {{measured}} resting and peak metabolic rates (RMR and PMR, respectively) during {{development of}} chicks of seven species of shorebirds: least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla; adult mass 20 22 g), dunlin (Calidris alpina; 56 - 62 g), lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes; 88 - 92 g), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus; 85 - 112 g), <b>lesser</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis dominicana; 150 - 156 g), Hudsonian godwit (Limosa haemastica; 205 - 274 g), and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus; 380 g). We tested two opposing hypotheses: the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, which posits that growth rate in chicks is {{inversely related to}} functional maturity of tissues, and the fast growth rate-high metabolism hypothesis, which suggests that rapid growth is possible only with a concomitant increase in either RMR or PMR. We have {{found no evidence that}} chicks of shorebirds with fast growth rates have lower RMRs or lower PMRs, as would be predicted by the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, but our data suggested that faster-growing chest muscles resulted in increased thermogenic capacity, consistent with the fast growth-high metabolism hypothesis. The development of homeothermy in smaller species is a consequence primarily of greater metabolic intensities of heat-generating tissues. The maximum temperature gradient between a chick's body and environment that can be maintained {{in the absence of a}} net radiative load increased rapidly with body mass during development and was highest in least sandpipers and lowest among godwits. Chicks of smaller species could maintain a greater temperature gradient at a particular body mass because of their higher mass-specific maximum metabolic rates...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> across Scotland was modelled using land cover and management variables, {{and used to}} highlight the spatial association between <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> abundance and current and proposed wind farm developments. Overlap was greatest in three biogeographical zones (the Western Isles, the Western Central Belt and the Borders Hills) and was estimated at ca. 5 % of the biogeographical population in each case. New field data were used to predict the effects of wind farm development on <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> populations, employing a conservative analytical approach to detect statistically significant wind farm related effects. The results provide evidence of significant avoidance of wind turbines by breeding <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> to a distance of at least 200 metres. Furthermore, wind farm sites appear to support lower densities of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> than predicted by the distribution model for sites without wind farms. Therefore, there is evidence for negative effects of wind farm developments on <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> and we suggest strategies to reduce any potential conflict between the need to promote wind energy {{and the need to}} maintain <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> populations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plovers Pluvialis spp. {{all have}} very {{distinct}} breeding plumage rich in contrast, with a conspicuous black belly and breast bordered by a bright white fringe. Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> are known partly to replace their breeding plumage with striped yellow feathers during incubation, different from both breeding and non-breeding plumages. In this study a similar partial breeding moult {{was observed in}} Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> caught on the nest or collected during incubation, although the feathers did not differ clearly from those of non-breeders. This moult starts during incubation and precedes the post-breeding moult into non-breeding plumage. Because the lighter feathers reduce {{the contrast between the}} black belly and the white flanks, we suggest that during incubation the plumage characteristic that {{plays an important role in}} mate choice is no longer important; at this stage it is better for the bird to be inconspicuous. Additional information on museum skins of <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and of Grey Plovers indicated that only the three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> undergo this partial moult, but that Grey Plovers in general retain full breeding plumage throughout incubation. The three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> also resemble each other in their generally very passive nest defence strategies. In contrast, the larger Grey Plovers actively chase and attack aerial and ground predators. Thus, a reduced conspicuousness of the body plumage during incubation is likely to benefit the <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> more than the Grey Plover. We suggest that nest defence behaviour, plumage characteristics and perhaps size have co-evolved as a response to different selection pressures in <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plover, but alternative hypotheses are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The repair {{jobs that}} birds {{have to do}} to {{maintain}} high quality plumage take energy and time, so should be under intense selection. Recently, we have shown that secondary moult in the Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plover</b> Pluvialis apricaria is incomplete, irregular and asymmetric between wings, and argued that this reflected their ‘relaxed’ migratory habits. On the basis of this hypothesis, we predict that relatives of this species that have to make long flights between breeding areas and winter quarters would invest more in the moult of secondaries. To test this we collected data on moult patterns in two populations of Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis fulva (Siberia and Alaska), on American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis dominica (Alaska) and Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola. Data were from the breeding, staging (Mongolia and Indiana) and wintering (Uruguay) areas. We found patterns consistent with our prediction: Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from Siberia, and Grey Plovers have a similar moulting pattern to Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers.</b> Although both go to remote winter quarters, they migrate mainly over land, probably making short or moderate flights, as they are able to stage frequently. In contrast, the Alaskan populations of Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> tend to renew all their secondaries from their second wing moult onwards. In line with their moult patterns, these two populations are known to make very long non-stop flights between breeding and winter areas. We argue that irregular moult and the partial renewal of secondaries is a primitive character in all four species. The full replacement of secondaries in the Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from Alaska may be considered as an adaptation for very long demanding flights. Regular moult patterns of secondaries, as found in many other shorebirds, could be a further refinement of this adaptation. ...|$|R

40|$|In spring, {{large numbers}} of <b>Golden</b> <b>Plover</b> Pluvialis apricaria feed in lowland areas of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, {{and many of these}} are presumed to be birds which breed in Iceland. This study {{estimated}} how many Icelandic birds pass through north Lewis, the most northerly part of the island group. Birds were counted during spring 2005, and samples of these birds were scored on a scale of 0 – 9 by the boldness of their plumage. Northern <b>Golden</b> <b>Plover</b> have bolder breeding plumage than southern forms. Birds with scores of 5 – 9 were recorded early in the season and these were believed to be of the altifrons form which breed in Iceland. Locally breeding birds of the apricaria form were found to have plumage scores of 2 – 5 for females and 6 – 8 for males. From counts and the proportion of birds with high plumage scores, an estimated minimum of 14, 000 Icelandic <b>Golden</b> <b>Plover</b> passed through north Lewis that spring.
