40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of No Child Left Behind in 2001 and high stakes testing, the focus in education has been on low-achieving students resulting in gifted learners being largely ignored. Gifted underachievers are often identified as bored or apathetic. Researchers are beginning to examine gifted students’ motivation and engagement, {{but there is a}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> research examining why gifted middle school students are uninspired to achieve. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand how gifted middle school students in a Georgia school district and their parents and teachers describe the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to achieve. Within the study, four research questions were asked: (1) How do middle school gifted students describe the terms 2 ̆ 2 inspired 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 motivation 2 ̆ 2 ? (2) How do middle school gifted students, their parents and teachers describe the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to achieve? (3) What factors do participants identify as influencing the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to achieve? (4) What impact does the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to achieve have on gifted middle school students’ academic experiences and achievements? Data collection methods included student interviews, parent interviews, faculty interviews, and a student questionnaire. Seven students, seven parents, and five teachers participated for a total of 17 participants. Data analysis methods included bracketing, In Vivo coding, establishing patterns, textural description, structural description, and finally describing the essence of the participants’ experiences. Findings yielded two emerging themes: (a) Gifted Learners Experience Disengagement and (b) Gifted Learners Experience Reengagement...|$|R

5000|$|The sonata {{is not in}} {{the typical}} {{classical}} form of three or four contrasting movements, but consists of a single movement centered in the key of B minor.

However, for a long period he lacked any ideas for these other movements. Berg turned to Schoenberg, who commented that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> meant that 'Berg ... had said all there was to say'.

30|$|Here a conceit {{is used to}} {{highlight}} the seeker’s <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> to move towards the light. The lowly blade of grass and the buds are personified and endowed with a natural yearning, {{in contrast to the}} speaker’s own predicament. Light, is operating on two levels, imbuing the grass and buds with patient humility or devotion, whereas the seeker is bereft of the aspiration for enlightenment, a reversal of the natural order. The compound noun ‘aspiration-flame’ challenges the notion of passive receptivity, illustrating it should be a conscious, dynamic experience. It recalls Walt Whitman, who uses this conceit, the innate humility of grass in his Leaves of Grassu, and extends it into a symbol to explore both the multiplicity and the oneness or unity of the world around him.|$|R
