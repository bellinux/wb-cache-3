30|$|In the UK, at a {{time when}} the {{specialty}} of obstetrics and gynaecology fails to attract young doctors but when there is an overwhelming need to produce obstetricians, core training is being reduced and simplified with a series of competency-based assessments requiring the barest minimum of either practical or theoretical training. This level of training may be adequate for office-based gynaecologists or those undertaking standard obstetric care, but it is neither sufficient for the specialists of the future nor sufficiently challenging for the generalist. We should not, therefore, be surprised that the speciality has a recruitment crisis. Complex subjects such as minimal access surgery will—in the UK certainly and elsewhere probably—be crammed into a series of 6 -month modules in the <b>last</b> <b>2</b> years of <b>training,</b> with students emerging with a certificate of completed training.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Multiple sclersis (MS) {{can involve}} {{approximately}} {{all aspects of}} life, which leads to different problems for a person such as psychological problems. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy on {{the mental health of}} female patients suffering from MS. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, the study sample consisted of 24 patients suffering from MS, who were selected via convenience sampling method. Once the participants were homogenized in regard withg their age, occupation, and education, they were devided into an experimental group (n= 12) and a control group (n= 12). The study instrument consisted of the general health questionnaire (GHQ- 28). The experimental group attended 8 sessions—each <b>lasting</b> <b>2</b> hours—of <b>training</b> on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, whereas the control group did not receive any interventions. In order to analyze the study data, SPSS software(ver, 22) was used via Multivariate analysis of co-variance (MANCOVA). Results: As the study results demonstrated, the difference between experimental and control groups was proved to be significant in terms of mean scores of mental health and its dimensions (p= 0. 0001). Conclusion: The study results supported the effectiveness of mindfulness – based cognitive therapy on mental health of female patients. It can be concluded that this method has ameliorated mental health of MS patients...|$|R
40|$|Major {{part of a}} {{pancreatic}} islet is composed of beta cells that secrete insulin, a key hormone regulating influx of nutrients into all cells in a vertebrate organism to support nutrition, housekeeping or energy storage. Beta cells constantly {{communicate with each other}} using both direct, short-range interactions through gap junctions, and paracrine long-range signaling. However, how these cell interactions shape collective sensing and cell behavior in islets that leads to insulin release is unknown. When stimulated by specific ligands, primarily glucose, beta cells collectively respond with expression of a series of transient Ca$^{ 2 +}$ changes on several temporal scales. Here we analyze a set of Ca$^{ <b>2</b> +}$ spike <b>trains</b> <b>recorded</b> in acute rodent pancreatic tissue slice under physiological conditions. We found strongly correlated states of co-spiking cells coexisting with mostly weak pairwise correlations widespread across the islet. Furthermore, the collective Ca$^{ 2 +}$ spiking activity in islet shows on-off intermittency with scaling of spiking amplitudes, and stimulus dependent autoassociative memory features. We use a simple spin glass-like model for the functional network of a beta cell collective to describe these findings and argue that Ca$^{ <b>2</b> +}$ spike <b>trains</b> produced by collective sensing of beta cells constitute part of the islet metabolic code that regulates insulin release and limits the islet size...|$|R
30|$|Procedure We first {{execute the}} {{probabilistic}} classifier, with the testing set (R) comprising of the <b>last</b> <b>2</b>  weeks of water consumption for every user (approximately 336, 000 records), {{in order to}} obtain the possibility of whether consumption will occur or not, during each hour. The rest of the dataset (approximately 8.36  M records) is used as the training set (S). We perform binary classification, obtaining an intermediate dataset indicating whether or not consumption will occur for each <b>training</b> <b>record.</b> Using the hours during which we predicted that water will be consumed, we ran the regressor, obtaining a full predicted time-series result of water consumption for each user. Before each algorithm’s execution, we determined the optimal scale vector using the genetic approach.|$|R
