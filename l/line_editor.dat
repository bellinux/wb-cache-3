2500|$|... ed is a <b>line</b> <b>editor</b> for the Unix {{operating}} system. It {{was one of}} {{the first}} parts of the Unix operating system that was developed, in August 1969. It remains part of the POSIX and Open Group standards for Unix-based operating systems, alongside more sophisticated full-screen editors such as vi.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of Unix, {{the use of the}} ed <b>line</b> <b>editor</b> {{provided}} diff with the natural ability to create machine-usable [...] "edit scripts". [...] These edit scripts, when saved to a file, can, along with the original file, be reconstituted by ed into the modified file in its entirety. [...] This greatly reduced the secondary storage necessary to maintain multiple versions of a file. [...] McIlroy considered writing a post-processor for diff where a variety of output formats could be designed and implemented, but he found it more frugal and simpler to have diff be responsible for generating the syntax and reverse-order input accepted by the ed command.|$|E
5000|$|The first text editors were [...] "line editors" [...] {{oriented}} to teleprinter- or typewriter-style terminals without displays. Commands (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an imaginary insertion point called the [...] "cursor". Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small {{section of the}} file, and periodically by printing the entire file. In some <b>line</b> <b>editors,</b> the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the line number in the file, text strings (context) for which to search, and eventually regular expressions. <b>Line</b> <b>editors</b> were major improvements over keypunching. Some <b>line</b> <b>editors</b> {{could be used by}} keypunch; editing commands could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file. Some common <b>line</b> <b>editors</b> supported a [...] "verify" [...] mode in which change commands displayed the altered lines.|$|R

50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>editors</b> keep a {{reference}} to the 'current line' to which the entered commands usually are applied. In contrast, modern screen based editors allow the user to interactively and directly navigate, select, and modify portions of the document. Generally line numbers or a search based context (especially when making changes within lines) are used to specify which part of the document is to be edited or displayed.|$|R

50|$|TEX {{programs}} are {{a collection of}} TSS line editing commands, TSS session commands and TEX statements. TEX variables could be inserted into TSS commands and TSS <b>line</b> <b>editor</b> commands via the TEX variable substitution feature. TEX programs were primarily designed to extend the <b>line</b> <b>editor</b> system. Consequently, TEX had no concept of file input/output relying instead on applying line edit commands to the working file and saving as needed.|$|E
25|$|These {{and similar}} {{electronic}} typewriters were in essence dedicated word processors with either single-line LCD displays or multi-line CRT displays, built-in <b>line</b> <b>editors</b> in ROM, a spelling and grammar checker, a few kilobytes of internal RAM and optional cartridge, magnetic card or diskette external memory-storage devices for storing text and even document formats. Text could be entered a line or paragraph {{at a time}} and edited using the display and built-in software tools before being committed to paper.|$|R

50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>editors</b> {{are limited}} to {{typewriter}} keyboard text-oriented input and output methods. Most edits are a line-at-a-time. Typing, editing, and document display do not occur simultaneously. Typically, typing does not enter text directly into the document. Instead, users modify the document text by entering terse commands on a text-only terminal. Commands and text, and corresponding output from the editor, will scroll {{up from the bottom}} of the screen in the order that they are entered or printed to the screen. Although the commands typically indicate the line(s) they modify, displaying the edited text within the context of larger portions of the document requires a separate command.|$|R

5000|$|A {{convenient}} {{feature of}} Commodore's ROM-resident BASIC interpreter and KERNAL was the full-screen editor. Although Commodore keyboards only featured two cursor keys which alternated direction when the shift key was held, the screen editor allowed users to enter direct commands or to input and edit program lines from {{anywhere on the}} screen. If a line was prefixed with a line number, it was tokenized and stored in program memory. Lines not beginning with a number were executed by pressing the [...] key whenever the cursor happened {{to be on the}} line. This marked a significant upgrade in program entry interfaces compared to other common home computer BASICs at the time, which typically used <b>line</b> <b>editors,</b> invoked by a separate [...] command, or a [...] "copy cursor" [...] that truncated the line at the cursor's position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{last two}} {{commands}} issued ( [...] and [...] ) are shorthand for [...] "jump to final position" [...] and [...] "kill line". They, or their direct equivalents, are useful to disambiguate between a <b>line</b> <b>editor</b> and a character-oriented editor. On a <b>line</b> <b>editor,</b> these {{would have the}} expected effect, i.e. that of deleting the final line of the file. On TECO, the command fails, because it sees a line as [...] "a string of text terminated by consecutive CR LF"; in its eyes, the [...] "last" [...] line would in fact be the penultimate.|$|E

40|$|Text editors come in {{the forms}} viz. <b>Line</b> <b>editors,</b> Stream editors, Screen editors, Word processors, Structure editors, etc. There are many text editors {{provided}} with Windows viz. Notepad, WordPad, Microsoft Office Word, etc. The MS-DOS editors viz. EDLIN, EDIT also work in Windows. But {{none of the above}} editors is interactive. The process of entering the programs/text shall be greatly enhanced, for the newcomers, if the editor is an interactive one. This paper gives the design & development of a new and efficient approach for line text editing, the most basic and fundamental editing, in Turbo C for Windows OS. It is proposed to give a new, interactive, and more user friendly approach to line text editing for document / non document(program) files using singly linked lists. A menu driven program is designed and developed. The program displays all the options and once a user chooses a particular option, he is prompted further interactively. The program is fully tested on Windows XP, with total RAM = 256 MB. This research work has, in all, twenty three options and is academically(not available in any book) very useful for the Computer Science & Engineering and Information Technology disciplines...|$|R
