The experiment consists of two 'treatments': a group <b>lending</b> <b>product</b> with group responsibility (so-called 'joint liability') and an individual loan product. In a previous report (Attanasio et al, 2008) we detailed the background information to the project, the partner institutions involved, the randomisation methodology, loan products, and outcome variables of interest. In this report, we analyse the data collected from the first wave (the baseline). We provide descriptive statistics relating to our sample along a wide range of dimensions such as education choices, assets, savings, debt, income, enterprises, consumption and transfers. The analysis of this population is of interest in its own right and gives a first snapshot of the target population which is not available from existing data sources. We show formal comparisons of these characteristics between treatment and control groups, an important test of how well the randomisation actually worked, and thus a crucial pre-requisite against which the program will be evaluated in around a year's time...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, energy {{efficiency}} {{projects have been}} financed by energy service companies (ESCOs) under a shared savings arrangement known as performance contracting. Essentially, performance contracting packages engineering, procurement and construction management services with project finance to provide companies with an ability to implement {{energy efficiency}} projects on an off-balance sheet basis. For large industrials, who have ready access to engineering services, the real attractiveness of performance contracting is the off-balance sheet nature of the financing. However, as every energy manager has experienced, selling the next shared savings deal internally can be a difficult task at best. Financial types react coolly to transactions in which the effective interest rates can range from 15 % 30 %. The ideal product for industrials would be a pure financing arrangement, that is off-balance sheet, low cost and capable of being funded by banks and leasing companies. Specifically, a traditional asset-based <b>lending</b> <b>product,</b> called an off-balance sheet loan (OBL), {{can be adapted to}} the financing of energy efficiency projects. Structured properly, an OBL can provide industrials with the same off-balance sheet benefit as performance contracting, but at a greatly reduced cost. Typically, the interest rate on an OBL will approximate an industrial's incremental borrowing rate and is currently around 8. 0 % - 10. 0 %...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the first {{randomized}} evaluation {{of the impact of}} introducing the standard microcredit group-based <b>lending</b> <b>product</b> in a new market. In 2005, half of 104 slums in Hyderabad, India were randomly selected for opening of a branch of a particular microfinance institution (Spandana) while the remainder were not, although other MFIs were free to enter those slums. Fifteen to 18 months after Spandana began lending in treated areas, households were 8. 8 percentage points {{more likely to have a}} microcredit loan. They were no more likely to start any new business, although they were more likely to start several at once, and they invested more in their existing businesses. There was no effect on average monthly expenditure per capita. Expenditure on durable goods increased in treated areas, while expenditures on “temptation goods ” declined. Three to four years after the initial expansion (after many of the control slums had started getting credit from Spandana and other MFIs), the probability of borrowing from an MFI in treatment and comparison slums was the same, but on average households in treatment slums had been borrowing for longer and in larger amounts. Consumption was still no different in treatment areas, and the average business was still no more profitable, although we find an increase in profits at the top end. We found no change...|$|R
40|$|Housing {{is widely}} {{connected}} to economy factors, and its complexity cause difficulties in prediction. Therefore {{it is essential}} to understand the mechanism underlying the housing market. This study suggests that fundamental macroeconomic factors, i. e. Gross Domestic <b>Product,</b> <b>Lending</b> Rate, Unemployment Rate, Construction Cost and Consumer Price Indices play important roles in determining the house prices. In this paper, econometric methodology has been adopted to study the relationship between housing price and fundamental macroeconomic factors in Malaysia for the period 1988 – 2007. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model and Vector Error Correction (VEC) Model has been employed to examine the long term relationships and short run relationships between housing price and macroeconomic factors. The long run equilibrium shows that housing price is positively related to Consumer Price Indices but negatively related to other macroeconomic factors. The short run equilibrium shows the existence of long run influence from economic factors to house prices. Low coefficients of variables in the short run equilibrium indicates housing price is less elastic in responding to the changes of macroeconomic factors in short run. The relationships between house price and each macroeconomic factor are inspected through Granger causality test and generalised impulse response function. The results show that house price Granger causes Gross Domestic <b>Product,</b> <b>Lending</b> Rate, Construction Cost and Consumer Price Indices. According to the generalised impulse response analysis, Housing Price itself, Gross Domestic <b>Product,</b> <b>Lending</b> Rate and Construction Cost are highly sensitive to the changes of housing pric...|$|R
