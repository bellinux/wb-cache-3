On an existing device, a new <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> was mounted instead of a shock sensor, from economy reasons, and then tests were performed. Using a ballistic pendulum, composed from a prismatic body with two steel balls attached to the ends, a planar motion was obtained by the suspending method. The prismatic body has attached the <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor,</b> the sensor signal generated by the sensor and the characteristic signal for time period during which the active part of the pendulum collides different bodies are compared using a memory oscilloscope.

50|$|The pressure, {{temperature}} and <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> generate analog signals which are converted to their digital equivalents using analog to digital converters. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the centrifugal force generated when the wheel rotates. This force {{is proportional to}} the rotational speed. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> may be a simple switch rather than an analog transducer (accelerometer). This is usually referred to as a roll switch. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> allows the TPM to be placed in a low-power communication device mode, when the vehicle is stationary which can extend the battery life. The advantage of a roll switch over an accelerometer is that the switch is purely mechanical and doesn't use any power to take a measurement.|$|R

First, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>acceleration</b> obtained from gyro-sensor is compared with the actual <b>longitudinal</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the vehicle. If the vehicle is in yawing motion, actual <b>longitudinal</b> <b>acceleration</b> can’t be approximated from time derivative of wheel speed, because lateral velocity and yaw rate affect actual <b>longitudinal</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Wheel speed and yaw rate {{can be obtained from}} the sensors mounted on the vehicle, but lateral velocity can’t be measured from the sensor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} a perimeter protection system with <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> with the acoustic surface wave. The system consists of subsystems. Subsystems are connected with a monitoring centre. Every subsystem consists of an identical set of <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> with the acoustic surface wave, a measurement generator and a quadrature phase demodulator and a reference generator, the frequency of which is different in every subsystem. The acoustic surface wave <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> are of a different frequency of free vibrations. The spectrum of the output signal from a subsystem is situated around the frequency which equals the difference between the measuring generator frequency and the reference generator frequency. Therefore the spectrum of every vibrating sensor is located in a different known frequency range. The analysis of the spectrum of signals from subsystems performed in the monitoring center allows monitoring the vibration status of every sensor included in a system. A system can consist of many identical acoustic surface wave <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> sets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{self-powered}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> {{based on}} triboelectric nanogenerator is proposed, {{which consists of}} an outer transparent shell and an inner mass-spring-damper mechanical system. The PTFE films on the mass surfaces can slide between two aluminum electrodes on an inner wall owing to the acceleration in the axis direction. On {{the basis of the}} coupling of triboelectric and electrostatic effects, the potential difference between the two aluminum electrodes is generated in proportion to the mass displacement, which can be used to characterize the acceleration in the axis direction with a detection range from about 13. 0 to 40. 0 m/ s 2 at a sensitivity of 0. 289 V·s 2 /m. With the integration of <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> in three axes, a self-powered 3 D <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> is developed for vector acceleration measurement in any direction.

The problem of phase hysteresis and time delay caused by the non-collocated sensor/actuator pairs is considered. The system&# 39;s dynamic model considering the non-collocated placement of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> and the piezoelectric patch actuator is derived. The phenomenon of phase hysteresis and time delay degrades {{the performance of the}} control system, or even induces instability.

40|$|<b>Acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are the key}} {{components}} in a health monitoring system for civil and building structures especially for detecting damages due to earthquakes and wind loads. Optical <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> have many advantages over conventional electrical <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> such as their immunity to electromagnetic interference and their capability to transmit signals over long distance without any additional amplifiers. We have recently developed a new optical <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> that uses fiber Bragg grating elements. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> was designed to have high sensitivity of 1 pm/Gal in low frequency range. The cross-axis sensitivity was minimized {{by the use of}} a leaf spring. The mechanism employed for this sensor ensures uniform strain distribution in the Bragg grating element so that the Bragg reflection peak will not be deteriorated. On the other hand, the Bragg grating element needed to apply post-tension to induce appropriate bias strain. This bias strain is much higher than the operational limit of the optical fibers in communication industry. The high strain level is harmful and results in failure within a short service period. To overcome this shortcoming, the direct writing procedure without removal process and the use of high screening strain in a proof-test are considered. Employing these measures, the lifetime of a Bragg element is found to be extended to more than 50 years even at 8, 000 microstrain applied to the Bragg grating element. The advantage of multiplexing capability is demonstrated by proposing a liquefaction sensor consisting of an FBG <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> and FBG pressure sensors...|$|R

In the paper, a motion simulation system was set up and a two-stage experiment was designed to investigate the role of the grip force on the longitudinal comfort of rapid transit trains. The results of the experiment show that the incremental grip force was linearly correlated with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>acceleration</b> value, while the incremental grip force had no correlation with the direction of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>acceleration</b> vector.

The feasibility and practicably of the model was verified by a field test. Furthermore, a comparative analysis shows that the motion simulation system and the grip force based model were valid to support the laboratory studies on the longitudinal comfort of rapid transit trains...|$|R
