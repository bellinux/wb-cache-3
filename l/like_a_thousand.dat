25|$|That {{the history}} of {{religion}} is cyclic and is renewed every seven millennia. The present cycle {{from the time of}} the Biblical Adam is split into seven epochs or ages, parallel to the seven days of the week, with periods for light and darkness. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad appeared as the promised Messiah at the sixth epoch heralding the seventh and final age of mankind, as a day in the estimation of God is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> years of man's reckoning. According to Ghulam Ahmad, just as the sixth day of the week is reserved for Jumu'ah (congregational prayers), likewise his age is destined for a global assembling of mankind in which the world is to unite under one universal religion: Islam.|$|E
500|$|The Warrior-class design used many well-proven {{technologies}} {{that had been}} used in ocean-going ships for years, including her iron hull, steam engine, and screw propeller; only her wrought-iron armour was a major technological advance. Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote, [...] "What made [...] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world." [...] Being faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty immediately stopped the construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another eleven ironclads over the next few years. Jacky Fisher, who was the ship's gunnery lieutenant in 1863–64, later wrote that in spite of this, most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: [...] "It certainly was not appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> years." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke {{described}} as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E

2500|$|A Thousand Years (2006) one of Hirst's {{most provocative}} and {{engaging}} works, contains an actual life cycle. Maggots hatch inside a white minimal box, turn into flies, then feed on a bloody, severed cow's {{head on the}} floor of a claustrophobic glass vitrine. Above, hatched flies buzz around in the closed space. Many meet a violent end in an insect-o-cutor; others survive to continue the cycle. A Thousand Years was admired by Bacon, who in a letter to a friend a month before he died, wrote about the experience of seeing the work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. Margarita Coppack notes that [...] "It is as if Bacon, a painter with no direct heir in that medium, was handing the baton on to a new generation." [...] Hirst has openly acknowledged his debt to Bacon, absorbing the painter's visceral images and obsessions early on and giving them concrete existence in sculptural form with works <b>like</b> <b>A</b> <b>Thousand</b> Years.|$|E
