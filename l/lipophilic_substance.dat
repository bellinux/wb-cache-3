500|$|A {{biological}} membrane {{is a form}} of lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The formation of lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment. This is known as the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous system, the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar, aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together, forming a vesicle; depending on the concentration of the lipid, this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles, liposomes, or lipid bilayers. Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile (lipid) behavior. Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics and is the subject of current academic research. Micelles and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect. When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment, the polar molecules (i.e., water in an aqueous solution) become more ordered around the dissolved <b>lipophilic</b> <b>substance,</b> since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile.

Analysis of pooled contaminant data from multiple sites and sampling years within rivers allows characterization of river-specific chemical pressures.

Comparative impedance measurements of amphibian skin revealed that impedance of freshly excised skin was significantly higher than that of frozen stored skin, which included negative values in single cases.

On the basis of these screening results, one nocardioform actinomycetes/Acinetobacter spp. -dominated WWTP 1 and one M. parvicella-dominated WWTP 2 were selected for detailed investigations. In actinomycetes/Acinetobacter-dominated WWTP 1 both <b>lipophilic</b> <b>substances</b> in the EPS and hydrophobic cell surfaces stabilized the scum layer.

In the presence of io ~ 6 M propanolol, a /S-blocker, epinephrine had no effect on the permeation of any of the test substances except that the permeability to urea decreased somewhat.

40|$|Objective: Polyphenols {{are natural}} antioxidants, which can inhibit {{oxidative}} chain reactions in human skin and prevent therefore some skin diseases and premature ageing. A prerequisite of this behaviour is their permeation {{through the skin}} barrier, in particular the stratum corneum (SC). In this study, we investigated the skin permeation kinetic of polyphenols, incorporated to semisolid emulsions, {{and the release of}} polyphenols from the emulsions. Methods: Mixtures of model substances, consisting of catechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, quercetin, rutin and protocatechuic acid (PCA), were formulated into o/w emulsions with different oil phase content. The in vitro experiments were carried out in Franz-type diffusion cells by means of ex vivo pig skin and a cellulose membrane. Results: The increased oil content in the emulsion led to a significant decrease in initial release coefficients (Kr), diffusion coefficients within the formulation (Dv) and skin permeation coefficients (Kp), respectively. The study considered the dependence of Kr on molecular weight and lipophilicity of polyphenolics. For both more hydrophilic and more <b>lipophilic</b> <b>substance</b> groups, the values for Kr were inverse proportional to molecular weight. For catechin, quercetin, rutin, resveratrol and PCA, a good correlation between Kp and Kr parameters was obtained. The most permeable substance was PCA (Kp = 1. 2 · 10 - 3 cm h- 1), and the least permeable was quercetin (Kp = 1. 5 · 10 - 5 cm h- 1). Conclusion: All substances could pass the SC barrier and were found mostly in the epidermis and dermis, confirming the potential of polyphenols as anti-ageing active cosmetic ingredients...|$|E
40|$|DDT is {{a highly}} {{lipophilic}} molecule known to deplete membrane rafts of their phosphoglycolipid and cholesterol contents. However, we have recently shown that DDT can also alter the thyroid homeostasis by inhibiting TSH receptor (TSHr) internalization. The present study was undertaken to verify whether DDT goitrogenic effects are due to the insecticide acting directly on TSHr or via alteration of the membrane rafts hosting the receptor itself. Our results demonstrate that, in CHO-TSHr transfected cells, TSHr is activated {{in the presence of}} TSH, while it is inhibited following DDT exposure. DDT can also reduce the endocytic vesicular traffic, alter the extension of multi-branched microvilli along their plasma membranes and induce TSHr shedding in vesicular forms. To verify whether TSHr displacement might depend on DDT altering the raft constitution of CHO-TSHr cell membranes the extent of TSHr and lipid raft co-localization was examined by confocal microscopy. Evidence shows that receptor/raft co-localization increased significantly upon exposure to TSH, while receptors and lipid rafts become dislodged on opposite cell poles in DDT-exposed CHO-TSHr cells. As a control, under similar culturing conditions, diphenylethylene, which is known to be a <b>lipophilic</b> <b>substance</b> that is structurally related to DDT, did not affect the extent of TSHr and lipid raft co-localization in CHO-TSHr cells treated with TSH. These findings corroborate and extend our view that, in CHO cells, the DDT disrupting action on TSHr is primarily due to the insecticide acting on membranes to deplete their raft cholesterol content, and that the resulting inhibition on TSHr internalization is due to receptor dislodgement from altered raft microdomains of the plasma membrane...|$|E

The test substance dissolved in medium-chain triglyceride is coated on a polycarbonate slide {{which serves as a}} cover sheet of a Bürker chamber.

After ten min at 37 C, the cells are photographed under microscope and the fractions of normal and defect cells are evaluated. No staining is needed and the cells are kept viable during the test period. With increasing chain length, fatty acids, aliphatic amines and alcohols all increased the fraction of defect erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. The results indicate that several fatty acids are very potent in their acute actions on erythrocytes, and that this effect is due to chain length rather than conformation. Conclusion: The technique offers a screening method for testing the harmful effects of small amounts of <b>lipophilic</b> <b>substances</b> on erythrocytes...|$|R
