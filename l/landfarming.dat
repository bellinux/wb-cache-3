We tested the “molarity of ethanol droplet” (MED) water repellency test as a rapid indicator of TPH concentration in soil at one <b>landfarm</b> near Bradford, PA. MED was estimated by determining the minimum ethanol concentration (0 – 6 M) required to penetrate air-dried and sieved soil samples within 10 sec.

Uncontaminated <b>landfarm</b> site soil amended with increasing concentrations of waste oil sludge showed a high correlation between MED and TPH. MED values exceeded the upper limit of 6 M as TPH estimates exceed ca. 25, 000 mg/kg.

40|$|Improper use {{of natural}} resources, {{especially}} soil, causes its degradation and severe soil erosion. Water erosion {{is an important factor}} causing soil degradation. Land use change of pasture would result in severe soil erosion mainly due to the reduction of vegetation cover and also surface soil disturbance. The objectives of this study were to estimate the amount of sediment, runoff and nutrient loss in four different land uses including a pasture with good vegetation cover (> 20 %), a pasture with poor vegetation cover (< 10 %), a currently being used dryland farm and a degraded dryland farm which is not used. Soil samples were taken from the depth of 0 – 10 cm in a completely randomized design with four replications. A rainfall simulator was run for two hours to estimate the amount of sediment, runoff and nutrient loss. Organic matter, total N, available P and distribution of particles size in soil and sediment were measured. The results showed that a very high degradation has occurred in the area mostly due to water erosion created as a result of overgrazing in pasture, susceptibility of geological formations and more importantly, the change of land use pasture to inefficient dryland farming. Maximum and minimum runoff was observed in the abandoned dry <b>landfarm</b> and pasture with good vegetation cover, respectively. Maximum sediment content was observed in dryland farm. Sediment content in dryland farm, abandoned dry <b>landfarm</b> and pasture with poor vegetation cover were 54. 5, 21 and 10. 4 times more than that in the pasture with good vegetation cover, respectively. Enrichment ratio (ER) of soil particles in sediment was highest for fine silt (2 - 5 µm), followed by clay. A minimum of ER was obtained for sand fraction. Percentages of organic matter, total N and available P in sediment were higher in the first hour as compared to the second one.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{removal of}} petroleum products using <b>landfarming</b> {{has been applied}} commercially in large scale with relative success. The technology has been widely used due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, together with these advantages, there are physical, chemical and biological aspects of the technology that can hamper the remediation process. The dominant pollutant removal mechanisms involved in <b>landfarming</b> are volatilisation of low molecular weight volatile compounds during {{the early days of}} contamination or treatment, biodegradation and adsorption. However, volatilisation, leaching of the petroleum products and the remaining ‘recalcitrant’ hydrocarbon residues present both health and environmental challenges to the rehabilitation practitioners when designing the <b>landfarming</b> technology.

Although simplicity and cost-effectiveness are the major advantages for using <b>landfarming,</b> other factors generally regarded as disadvantageous to implementing the technology can be addressed. These includes requirements for large land area for treatment, availability of the pollutant degrading bacteria, effectiveness of the technology at high constituent concentration (more than 50, 000 ppm), improved concentration reductions in cases requiring more than 95 % of pollution reduction and the flexibility of the technology in integrating the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons with other contaminants that may occur with the petroleum products...|$|E

In addition to the measurement of CO 2 evolution, periodic analyses of PNAs and hydrocarbons monitored biodegradation activity. The estimation of carbon balance and of soil organic matter assessed the fate of residual hydrocarbons. Seven sludge applications during a 920 -day active disposal period were followed by a 360 -day inactive “closure” period with no further sludge applications. A burst of CO 2 evolution followed each sludge addition, but substantial amounts of undegraded hydrocarbons remained {{at the end of}} the study. Hydrocarbon accumulation did not inhibit biodegradation performance. Conversion of hydrocarbons to CO 2 predominated during active disposal; incorporation into soil organic matter predominated during the closure period. In this sludge, the predominant PNAs were degraded more completely (85 %) than total hydrocarbons. Both biodegradation and abiotic losses of three- and four-ring PNAs contributed to this result. Some PNAs with five and six rings were more persistent, but these constituted only a small portion of the PNAs in the sludge.

It is important to reveal the controlling factors on the field for optimal selection of remediation strategy. In this study, an integrated field <b>landfarming</b> technique was carried out to assess the relative effectiveness of five biological approaches on diesel degradation. The limiting factors during the degradation process were discussed. Method A total of five treatments were tested, including conventional <b>landfarming,</b> nutrient enhancement (NE), biosurfactant addition (BS), bioaugmentation (BA), and combination of bioaugmentation and biosurfactant addition (BAS). The consortium consisted of four diesel-degrading bacteria strains. Rhamnolipid {{was used as the}} biosurfactant.

Department of Energy (DOE) is {{currently}} developing a Proposed Plan (PP) for remediation of designated sources of chlorinated solvents that contribute contamination to the Southwest (SW) Groundwater Plume at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), in Paducah, KY. The principal contaminants in the SW Plume are trichloroethene (TCE) and other {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs); these industrial solvents were used and disposed in various facilities and locations at PGDP. In the SW plume area, residual TCE sources are primarily in the fine-grained sediments of the Upper Continental Recharge System (UCRS), a partially saturated zone that delivers contaminants downward into the coarse-grained Regional Gravel Aquifer (RGA). The RGA serves as the significant lateral groundwater transport pathway for the plume. In the SW Plume area, the four main contributing TCE source units are: (1) Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 1 / Oil Landfarm; (2) C- 720 Building TCE Northeast Spill Site (SWMU 211 A); (3) C- 720 Building TCE Southeast Spill Site (SWMU 211 B); and (4) C- 747 Contaminated Burial Yard (SWMU 4).

40|$|Important in {{this study}} was the {{landfarm}} on Kreekraksluizen where <b>landfarming</b> was investigated in cooperation with RIZA, during a period of more than 10 years, which made it possible to predict the effect of <b>landfarming</b> in the long term. The database for this site is unique and will be extended in the future. The large experimental research on Kreekraksluizen was supported by several studies at other sites and in the laboratories of Alterra. As a traditional management practice, slightly polluted sediments from ditches in the rural area of The Netherlands are spread over adjacent land.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon (PAH) -contaminated soils and sediments {{have been the}} subject of investigations and characterization for more than 25 years. Are the results of these investigations sufficient to solve the problem? Based on several investigations of <b>landfarming</b> at Wageningen-UR and Utah State University, it is concluded that under proper conditions, PAH-degrading microorganisms are present and active in contaminated soils. However, long periods of time (e. g., up to 14 years) may be necessary to degrade the PAHs to sufficiently low concentrations. If locations for passive <b>landfarming</b> without active tilling or irrigation are available for use for long periods of time, it is possible to remediate PAH-contaminated soils and sediments in such a way that the remediated soil can be reused again, thereby solving the contamination problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{analysis}} of the effects induced by urban pressures on the socio-economic and territorial characteristics of the rural peri-urban areas in order to identify planning and intervention strategies aimed at enhancing the quality of agriculture and landscape. A survey was conducted in the surroundings of Parma on farms located in the vicinity of urban areas. The structural, productive and social characteristics of the family-farm units were analyzed. The survey updated an identical survey, carried out in 1986, in which it was examined a sample of 208 farms. The units surveyed were evaluated in two aspects: the “vitality”, which takes into account the structural characteristics (size, production, labour force, etc.), and the “stability”, in which a crucial role is played by the age of the conductor and the presence of a successor. It was found that only 28 % of the original farm sample is still alive, one third has disappeared, 30 % was absorbed by existing farms, 8 % has been abandoned. The factors most favourable to the survival resulted those referred to the vitality, especially the physical and economic size of the farm, the presence of cattle, the percentage of land in property, the presence of young labour. Among the factors that predispose to the abandonment, the urbanization processes were found to be determinants, in terms of expansion of both the built-up area and of that planned as urbanisable. The research has highlighted the importance of the vitality of the farms together with a context that has maintained its original rural features. These combined aspects can better define what we call the resiliency of the <b>landfarms</b> system i. e. the capability of positively reacting to the variable modifications of the internal and external conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{to make the}} first set of measurements documenting the potential for emissions of pollutants from exploration and production (E&P) waste disposal facilities at Bourg, Louisiana and Bateman Island, Louisiana. The objective of the project was to quantify the emissions and to determine whether the measured emissions were potentially harmful to human health of workers and the adjacent community. The study, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) is designed to complement additional studies funded by Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LADNR) and the American Petroleum Institute. The distinguishing feature {{of this study is that}} actual, independent field measurements of emissions were used to assess the potential problems of this disposal technology. Initial measurements were made at the Bourg, LA facility, adjacent to the community of Grand Bois in late 1998 -early 1999. Emission measurements were performed using aluminum chambers placed over the surface of the <b>landfarm</b> cells. Air was pulled through the chambers and the concentration of the contaminants in the air exiting the chambers was measured. The contaminants of interest were the ''BTEX'' compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), commonly found in E&P wastes and hydrogen sulfide, a noxious gas present naturally in many E&P wastes and crude oils. Measurements indicated that emissions were measurable using the techniques developed for the study. However, when the air concentrations of these contaminants that developed above the <b>landfarm</b> cells were compared with standards for workers from the Occupational and Safety and Health Association (''OSHA'') and for communities (Louisiana's ambient air standards), levels were not of concern. Since amounts of wastes being processed by the Bourg facility were considerably lower than normal, a decision was made to continue the study at the Bateman Island facility near Morgan City, LA. This facility was receiving more normal loadings of E&P wastes. Additional emission measurements were made at the Bateman Island facility within cells over a range of ''ages'', from those most recently loaded with E&P wastes to cells that have not received wastes for 9 months or more. As expected the greatest chance for emissions when the cell is most recently loaded. Again, measured fluxes did not produce air concentrations that were of concern. As expected, the highest fluxes were observed in the cells that had recently received wastes and older cells had very low emissions. Measurements of emissions of hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) were also conducted at these two facilities. Levels of emissions were similar to the xange observed in the literature for natural salt marshes that surround these facilities. Production of sulfide within the cells was also measured by the most sensitive techniques available and measured sulfide production rates were low in the samples tested. The only potential concern at the facility with regards to sulfide was the levels of sulfide emitted from the sumps. The facility logbook at Bourg was analyzed to determine a time sequence of activities over 1998 - 1999. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality conducted a time-series of air concentrations for hazardous air pollutants during this period at the fenceline of the Bourg facility. These data were characterized by periods of static concentrations interspersed with peaks. A series of peaks were analyzed and compared with logbook records for the activities occurring at the time. In reverse fashion, a set of activities documented by the logbook was examined and the concentrations of benzene that developed from these activities were documented. No direct correlation could be made with the observed peaks and any activities suggesting that concentrations of benzene at the fenceline may be the result of a complex suite of activities including onsite activities not documented in the logbook (loading of the cells by truck haulers) and offsite activities (automobile traffic). Based on these results several recommendations were made. These include maintaining loading of wastes at rates observed during the study period and further evaluating sulfide emissions from the sump system. A scientifically based cell management approach that would maintain benzene levels below levels of concern is possible based on the simple emission models calibrated during this study. However, measured emission rates and long-term records of air concentrations near the facilities suggest that this is not necessary at present...|$|R

Hit monitoring data were obtained {{in accordance with the}} applicable Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) hazardous waste post-closure permit (PCP). The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) - Division of Solid Waste Management issued the PCPs to define the requirements for RCRA post-closure inspection, maintenance, and groundwater monitoring at the specified TSD units located within the Bear Creek Hydrogeologic Regime (PCP no. TNHW- 116), Upper East Fork Poplar Creek Hydrogeologic Regime (PCP no. TNHW- 113), and Chestnut Ridge Hydrogeologic Regime (PCP no. TNHW- 128). Each PCP requires the Submittal of an annual RCRA groundwater monitoring report containing the groundwater sampling information and analytical results obtained at each applicable TSD unit during the preceding CY, along with an evaluation of groundwater low rates and directions and the analytical results for specified RCRA groundwater target compounds; this report is the RCRA annual groundwater monitoring report for CY 2007. The RCRA post-closure groundwater monitoring requirements specified in the above-referenced PCP for the Chestnut Ridge Regime replace those defined in the previous PCP (permit no. TNHW- 088), which expired on September 18, 2005, but remained effective until the TDEC issued the new PCP in September 2006. The new PCP defines site-specific groundwater sampling and analysis requirements for the CRSDB, CRSP, and KHQ that differ from those established under the expired PCP, including modified suites of laboratory analytes (RCRA groundwater target compounds) for each site and annual rather than semiannual sampling frequencies for the CRSDB and KHQ. The new PCP also specifies the RCRA post-closure groundwater monitoring requirements for the ECRWP, a closed TSD unit that was not addressed in the expired PCP...|$|R
