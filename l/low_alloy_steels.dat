50|$|Corrosion {{occurs in}} various forms in the {{refining}} process, such as pitting corrosion from water droplets, embrittlement from hydrogen, and stress corrosion cracking from sulfide attack. From a materials standpoint, carbon steel is used for upwards of 80 per cent of refinery components, which is beneficial due to its low cost. Carbon steel is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205 °C, but other corrosive chemicals and environments prevent its use everywhere. Common replacement materials are <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> containing chromium and molybdenum, with stainless steels containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments.

However, in some <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels,</b> containing other elements like chromium and molybdenum, tempering at low temperatures may produce an increase in hardness, while at higher temperatures the hardness will decrease.

This de-embrittlement process, known as [...] "baking", is used to overcome the weaknesses of methods such as electroplating which introduce hydrogen to the metal, but is not always entirely effective. In the case of welding, often pre- and post-heating the metal is applied to allow the hydrogen to diffuse out before it can cause any damage. This is specifically done with high-strength steels and <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> such as the chrome/molybdenum/vanadium alloys.
