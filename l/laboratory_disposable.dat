40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} elementary school teachers’ and school principals’ views on physical learning environments of schools where teachers are expected to implement the constructivist philosophy/approach. In this qualitative study, the researcher interviewed 48 elementary school teachers and 6 school administrators working in Uşak, Turkey. The qualitative data were transcribed and analyzed through coding-based content analysis. The data collected from 7 participants (5 teachers and 2 administrators) were analyzed by three researchers and the rest were analyzed by the author. At the end of the study, problematic coding was discussed by the same three researchers again and codes were discussed with some (n= 4) participants as well. That is, participants’ approvals related to the results were obtained from 3 teachers and 1 administrator. The findings showed that teachers’ common demands were special classrooms in order to design their classes because they want to implement constructivism.

30|$|DNA {{contamination}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} challenges needed to overcome before MDA, as the MDA procedure may magnify the contamination and finally lead to the failure of the experiment. Generally, contaminations come from three sources (Yilmaz and Singh, 2012; Blainey, 2013), the tainted specimen during the cell-sorting step, the polluted reagents or equipment used for the experiment, and the inappropriate environment during the experimental process (Blainey, 2013). There are three kinds of solutions and the combination of them can greatly eliminate such contaminations. The first solution is to use strict cleaning measures to guarantee the process of experiment, including ethylene oxide treatment of <b>laboratory</b> <b>disposables</b> (Shaw et al., 2008), heat-sensitive DNA nucleases (Champlot et al., 2010) or UV irradiation (Woyke et al., 2011) treatment of reagents or HEPA-filtered environment (Swan et al., 2011). The second solution is to reduce the reaction volume, which will increase the ratio of single-cell microbial DNA to contaminated DNA because it lowers the reagent-based contamination (Rinke et al., 2014). In addition, a negative control in the experiment is necessary. The last solution is to use computational approaches to identify and remove contaminated DNA after sequencing. For example, contaminated DNA can be identified and removed by aligning all reads against the reference genomes such as human or all currently available microbial genome sequences. However, if the contaminated genome is similar to the target genome, this strategy has the risk to lose sequences aligned to their conserved regions. In addition, tetramer frequency-based composition analysis can be used to remove contaminated sequences (Woyke et al., 2009). Its drawback is that it is computationally expensive, while doing this step after genome assembly can reduce the computational cost.|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the biosafety precautions that applied by diagnostic laboratories in Khartoum state, 2009. Methods: A total number of 190 laboratories were surveyed about their compliance with standard biosafety precautions. These laboratories included 51 (27 %) laboratories from government, 75 (39 %) from private sectors and 64 (34 %) laboratories belong to organization providing health care services. Results: The study found that 32 (16. 8 %) of laboratories appointed biosafety officers. Only, ten (5. 2 %) participated in training about response to fire emergency, and 28 (14. 7 %) reported the laboratory accident occurred during work. 45 (23. 7 %) laboratories had a written standard operation procedures (SOPs), and 35 (18. 4 %) had written procedures for the lean-up of spills. Moreover, biosafety cabinet was found in 11 (5. 8 %) laboratories, autoclave in 28 (14. 7 %) and incinerator in only two (1. 1 %) <b>laboratories.</b> Sharp <b>disposable</b> containers were found in 84 (44. 2 %).

Furthermore, fed-batch cultivations with linear and exponential feeding of 500 g/L glucose solution were conducted. Finally, the scale-up potential of the microscale fermentations was evaluated by comparing the obtained results to that of fully controlled fermentations in a 2 L laboratory-scale fermenter (working volume of 1 L). The scale-up was realized by keeping the volumetric mass transfer coefficient k L a constant at a value of 460 1 /h. The same growth behavior of the E. coli cultures could be observed on both scales. Conclusion In microfluidic MTPs, pH-controlled batch as well as fed-batch fermentations were successfully performed. The liquid dosing as well as the biomass growth kinetics of the process-controlled fermentations agreed well both in the microscale and laboratory scale.

40|$|In {{order to}} counter the common {{perception}} that molecular diagnostics are too complicated to work in low resource settings, we have performed a difficult sample preparation and DNA amplification protocol using instrumentation designed to be operated without wall or battery power. In this work we have combined a nearly electricity-free nucleic acid extraction process with an electricity-free isothermal amplification assay to detect the presence of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) DNA in the stool of infected patients. We used helicase-dependent isothermal amplification (HDA) to amplify the DNA in a low-cost, thermoplastic reaction chip heated {{with a pair of}} commercially available toe warmers, while using a simple Styrofoam insulator. DNA was extracted from known positive and negative stool samples. The DNA extraction protocol utilized an air pressure driven solid phase extraction device run using a standard bicycle pump. The simple heater setup required no electricity or battery and was capable of maintaining the temperature at 65 °C± 2 °C for 55 min, suitable for repeatable HDA amplification. Experiments were performed to explore the adaptability of the system for use in a range of ambient conditions. When compared to a traditional centrifuge extraction protocol and a <b>laboratory</b> thermocycler, this <b>disposable,</b> no power platform achieved approximately the same lower limit of detection (1. 25 × 10 (- 2) pg of C. difficile DNA) while requiring much less raw material and a fraction of the lab infrastructure and cost.

40|$|Objective: To estimate, {{from the}} {{hospital}} perspective in Germany, the cost effectiveness of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium 40 mg once daily (ENOX) relative to no pharmacological prophylaxis (NPP) and relative to subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 IU three times daily (low-dose UFH [LDUFH]). Each is used in addition to elastic bandages/compression stockings and physiotherapy {{in the prevention of}} venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in immobilised acutely ill medical inpatients without impaired renal function or extremes of body weight. Methods: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the `additional cost for ENOX per clinical VTE avoided versus NPP' and `additional cost for ENOX per episode of major bleeding avoided versus LDUFH' were chosen as target variables. The target variables were quantified using a modelling approach based on the decision-tree technique. Resource use during thromboprophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of VTEs, episode of major bleeding and secondary pneumonia after pulmonary embolism (PE) was collected from a hospital survey. Costs were exclusively those to hospitals incurred by staff expenses, drugs, devices, <b>disposables,</b> <b>laboratory</b> tests and equipment for diagnostic procedures. These costs were determined by multiplying utilised resource items by the price or tariff of each item as of the first quarter of 2003. Safety and efficacy values of the comparators were taken from the MEDENOX (prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin) and the THE-PRINCE (THromboEmbolism-PRevention IN Cardiac or respiratory disease with Enoxaparin) trials and from a meta-analysis. The evaluation encompassed 8 (6 - 14) days of thromboprophylaxis plus time to treat VTE and episode of major bleeding in hospital. Point estimates of all model parameters were applied exclusively in the base-case analysis. Results: There were incremental costs of _ 1106 for ENOX per clinical VTE avoided versus NPP (_ 1 _ ~=_$US 1. 07; average of the first quarter of 2003). ENOX dominated LDUFH: cost savings of _ 55 _ 825 were obtained and 7. 7 episodes of major bleeding were avoided by ENOX compared with LDUFH, each per 1000 patients. In comprehensive sensitivity analyses, the robustness of the model and its results was shown. Conclusions: Results of this evaluation suggest that, in immobilised acutely ill medical inpatients, ENOX may offer hospitals in Germany a very cost-effective option for thromboprophylaxis compared with NPP and a cost-saving alternative compared with LDUFH.

40|$|The Department {{of organic}} {{chemistry}} {{was founded on}} October 1 st, 1922 {{as part of the}} Chemical Engineering Department of the High Technical School in Zagreb. The first-appointed professor of organic chemistry was Ivan Marek, formerly the professor at the School of Trade in Zagreb. The High Technical School with all its departments was soon (1926 / 27) incorporated into the University of Zagreb and became the nucleus of the Technical Faculty. The management of the faculty was fully aware of the necessity to engage the best scientists in the field as faculty professors. As far as organic chemistry was concerned, there was no better choice in the mid 1930 's, than to invite young but already recognized organic chemist Dr. Vladimir Prelog to join the staff and to succeed professor Marek, who retired in 1935. Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept the invitation and was eager to continue his scientific work in an academic laboratory in Zagreb. At the time of the invitation, Dr. Prelog was engaged in a small laboratory synthesizing special samples of rare chemicals to be sold through the chemical store "Dřiza" in Prague. There he was provided the modest opportunity to carry on his own research, and together with Rudolf Lukeš and Emil Votoček, published a number of papers concerning organic synthesis and chemistry of natural products. Elected in Zagreb for the lectureship of the assistant professor in organic chemistry, Prelog started teaching as early as in the summer semester of 1934 / 35. The ingenious and bright lecturing of young professor Prelog inspired his students, and many of them were attracted to organic chemistry. On the other hand, the working conditions in the <b>disposable</b> <b>laboratory</b> of the Organic Chemistry Department were too modest to accept a number of students. The budget was so small that it only covered tuition, while there was no research fund at the faculty. Luckily, Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept an offer for scientific co-operation from the small but prosperous pharmaceutical company "Kaštel" in Zagreb. On behalf of the agreement, Prelog and his department obtained funds to fit up the laboratory and to start very prosperous research in the synthesis and studies of pharmaceutically interesting compounds. With his assistants, students and other collaborators, Prelog started research of cinchona bark alkaloids, preferentially oriented to the synthesis of quinine. For example, Prelog's method of double intramolecular alkylation to synthetize the quinuclidine moiety of quinine was patented by "Kaštel". With R. Seiwerth he developed the first useful synthesis of adamantane. Prelog's group started research in the field of sulphonamides and commercial success of "Streptazole" stimulated the development of the research laboratories within "Kaštel". The collaboration in the research continued in fields of other chemotherapeutics, analeptics, spasmolitics, barbiturates etc. Within the period 1935 - 1941, Prelog published 48 scientific papers and 8 patents. In less than seven years, his results enormously influenced the entire organic chemistry in Zagreb till nowadays. Under the confused and uncertain circumstances caused by the beginning of World War II, Prelog left Zagreb in 1941 and continued his extraordinary scientific career at the ETH in Zürich. During the war (1942 - 1945) the tuition and the Department were run by Dr. Rativoj Seiwerth, former collaborator and first assistant to V. Prelog. In almost unbelievable conditions, the young assistant, then assistant professor (since January 1943), R. Seiwerth fully succeeded in continuing most activities founded by Professor Prelog.

40|$|Snažna prisutnost organske kemije u nastavnim programima kemijskog inženjerstva i tehnologije vidljiva je od samog osnivanja Kraljevske tehničke visoke škole u Zagrebu 1919. godine. Prvi {{profesor}} organske kemije, dr. Ivan Marek, djelovao je najprije u sklopu Zavoda za analitičku i fizikalnu kemiju. Dodatni impuls razvoju dalo je osamostaljivanje Zavoda za organsku kemiju 1922. godine, no znanstveni rad je zadržao orijentaciju ka analitici. Prekretnicu u nastavi i znanstvenom radu zavoda nakon umirovljenja I. Mareka, predstavlja dolazak u Zagreb kasnijeg nobelovca dr. Vladimira Preloga. Presudno je bilo unošenje, tada u svijetu opće prihvaćene orijentacije na organsku sintezu. V. Prelog je taj zaokret pretvorio u (kako danas možemo reći) "zlatno doba" organske kemije na našem fakultetu. Nepunih sedam godina (1935. - 1941.) njegova djelovanja u Zagrebu, sudbinski je utjecalo ne samo na današnji Zavod za organsku kemiju FKIT-a nego i na cjelokupnu hrvatsku kemijsku znanost, osobito u području organske kemije. Po izbijanju drugog svjetskog rata, profesor Prelog odlazi u Zürich, gdje na ETH nastavlja svoju fascinantnu karijeru. U Zagreb se nije vratio ni po svršetku rata, no njegova stalna pomoć i blagotvorni utjecaj ostavili susvoj trag do danas. Tijekom rata (1942. - 1945.) nastavu organske kemije i Zavod za organsku kemiju vodio je dr. Rativoj Seiwerth, višegodišnji suradnik i prvi asistent V. Preloga. U gotovo nevjerojatnim uvjetima, mladi asistent i zatim (od siječnja 1943.) docent, R. Seiwerth uspješno nastavlja večinu djelatnosti koje je uspostavio V. Prelog. Po svršetku rata 1945. godine, R. Seiwert je bio prisiljen odstupiti. Ipak, poslije kratkog vremena R. Seiwerth nastavlja sa svojim znanstveno-istraživačkim radom. Do 1952. djeluje u Institutu za industrijska istraživanja, a od 1952. do svog umirovljenja 1980. godine u Istraživačkom institutu farmaceutske tvrtke "Pliva". U poslijeratnim uvjetima (1945. / 46.) djelatnost Tehničkog fakulteta i njegova Zavoda za organsku kemiju bila je obnovljena. Za nastavnika i predstojnika zavoda pozvan je dr. Viktor Hahn, raniji student profesora V. Preloga i njegov suradnik od 1936. godine. Utjecaj profesora Hahna na razvoj Tehničkog fakulteta i Zavoda za organsku kemiju bio je presudan u razdoblju 1945. - 1970. ali prerana smrt (17. svibnja, 1970.) prekinula je njegov vrlo uspješan rad. Zahvaljujući odlično organiziranoj nastavi i znanstveno-istraživačkom radu, njegovi studenti i suradnici uspješno su nastavili s tim djelatnostima sve do današnjih dana.
