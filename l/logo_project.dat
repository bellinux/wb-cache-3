CCT Director Sheingold and new Psychology Department recruit from Clark University Roy Pea were co-investigators of this project, and {{researchers}} Jan Hawkins and Midian Kurland joined the grant team to plan and conduct empirical studies of children’s learning with Logo programming in their Bank Street classrooms, whose teachers were prepared by Seymour Papert and his team from MIT. The 1987 book edited by Pea & Sheingold: documents key aspects {{of many of these}} studies.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} {{commander of}} Joint Base Andrews approved a logo re-design {{in the spring}} of 2014, which aimed to improve the branding and the overall appearance of the installation across all platforms. The project took several months and went through numerous design changes before approval, but was finalized in the late summer. The new JBA <b>logo</b> <b>project</b> was led and chiefly designed by Senior Airman Dan Burkhardt with important contributions by Mr. Dean Markos, who were both serving the Air Force in the 11th Wing Public Affairs office. The logo was approved and disseminated across all digital platforms and marketed locally in the fall of 2014.|$|E

40|$|Several modern Logo {{implementations}} allow running concurrent processes. Imagine Logo {{is one of}} them (others are, for example, MicroWorlds EX and Terrapin Logo 2. 3). This {{feature is}} implemented not (only) because it is modern and recent operating systems allow its efficient implementation, but because it makes programming of many simple projects much easier. On the other hand, from the theory of concurrent processes we know, that if we start using concurrent processes which share data, some specific challenges will inevitably emerge solving of which is easily possible only by introducing some means of interprocess synchronisation. The article introduces the reader to processes in Imagine Logo. It shows a simple <b>Logo</b> <b>project</b> demonstrating the emerging challenges. The example is discussed to its details and the way how to solve it will be shown...|$|E

As part of a re-branding initiative, the City of North St. Paul was interested in developing a new <b>logo.</b> <b>Project</b> lead Laurie Koehnle worked with students in GDES 3352 : Identity and Symbols, to develop designs for a new city logo.

40|$|Programming Language This paper {{reports on}} a pilot study of 34 sixth-grade {{students}} engaged in mathematical explorations that {{was carried out in}} the context of a national <b>Logo</b> <b>project</b> in Costa Rica. Students worked in pairs investigating a mathematical microworld written in Logo. The investigation had three phases: (1) open exploration of the microworld, during which the students recorded their observa wad formulated hypotheses about how the program worked; (2) group discussion and sharing of hypotheses; and (3) additional guided discovery and problem solving. Through observations and collection of written worksheets, it was found that the students were successful in discovering certain functions of the microworld during the first phase, and their hypotheses were improved after discussion with their peers, guided by the instructor. The students were successful in applying their knowledge of the computer microworld in the problem-solving tasks during the third phase. Contains 12 references.

40|$|The SPADE theory uses {{linguistic}} formalisms {{to model}} the program planning and debugging processes. The theory begins with a taxonomy of basic planning concepts covering strategies for identification, decomposition and reformulation. A handle is provided for recognizing interactions between goals and deriving a lincnr solution. A complementary taxonomy of rational bugs and associated repair techniques is also provided. SPA OK. introduces a new data structure to facilitate debugging [...] the derivation tree of the program. SPADE generalizes recent work in Artificial Intelligence by Suasman and Sacerdoti on automatic programming, and extends The theory of program design developed by the Structured Programming movement. It provides a more structured information processing model of human problem solving than the production systems of Newell and Simon, and articulates the type of problem solving curriculum advocated by Papert's <b>Logo</b> <b>Project.</b> 1. A Multi-Faceted Approach The SPADE theory is being developed in three contexts: 1. Education: an editor called SPADEE- 0 has bern implemented that encourages students to define and debug programs in terms of explicit SPADE design choices, thereby providing a highly structured programming environment. 2. AI: an automatic programmer called PATN has been designed using an augmented transition network embodiment of the SPADE theory. This results in a framework which unifies recent work on planning and debugging by Sacerdoti [75] and Sussrnan [75]. 3. Psychology: a parser called PAZATN has been designed that applies the SPADE theory {{to the analysis of}} programming protocols. PAZATN produces a parse of the protocol that delineates the planning and debugging strategics employed by the problem solver. PAZATN extends the series of automatic protocol analysers develope...|$|E
