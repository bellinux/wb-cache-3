He {{purchased}} a <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policy from Arizona-based Empire Mutual Insurance Company that named McGee as the beneficiary. In 1948, International <b>Life</b> <b>Insurance</b> Co. ("International"), a Texas corporation, agreed to assume Empire's <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations.</b> International mailed a reinsurance certificate to the California policy holder, offering to insure Lowell according to the terms of the Empire policy. Lowell accepted the offer and paid premiums from California until his death in 1950. When Lowell's mother tried to collect on the policy, the insurance company refused to pay, claiming Lowell had committed suicide. International conducted numerous business in California aside from this policy.|$|R
40|$|Return {{guarantee}} {{constitutes a}} key ingredient of classical <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> premium calculation. In the current low interest rate environment insurers face increasingly strong {{financial incentives to}} reduce guaranteed returns embedded in <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts. However, return guarantee lowering efforts are restrained by associated demand effects, since a higher guaranteed return makes the net price of the insurance cover lower. This tradeoff between possibly higher future <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> {{and the possibility of}} a larger demand for <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products can theoretically also be considered when determining optimal guaranteed returns. In this paper, optimality of return guarantee levels is analyzed from a solvency point of view. Availability and some other properties of optimal solutions for guaranteed returns are explored and compared in a simple model for two measures of solvency risk (company-level and contract-level VaR). The paper concludes that a solvency risk minimizing optimal guaranteed return may theoretically exist, although its practical availability can be impeded by economic and regulatory constraints...|$|R
40|$|This article {{studies the}} pricing of {{securitization}} of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> under mortality dependence and stochastic interest rate. Following the empirical results of Brown and McDaid (2003), this paper models stochastic mortality intensity and then considers certain important risk factors (income, gender, age, and others) affecting mortality rate to derive the mortality probability for each policyholder. Further, multiple Clayton copula {{is used to}} measure the mortality dependence of multiple <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policies. Death time of each policyholder can be projected through multiple Clayton copula. This paper applies the estimated death time to design and price Collateralized <b>Insurance</b> <b>Obligation</b> under mortality dependence.

40|$|The {{improvements}} in longevity observed {{in many countries}} {{over the past century}} have been significant. The risk that the longevity experience is higher than the one forecasted, i. e. longevity risk, is explicitly consideredin Solvency II standard formula as a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. The life underwriting risk module includes all the <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance <b>obligations,</b> except the SLT health <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> (EIOPA 2012), where the longevity risk is one of the seven sub-modules. According to Solvency II, solvency capital requirements (from herein SCRs) can be computed by a standard formula or an internal model. Nevertheless, the scenario in which the insurance companies operate is often more complex than that one assumed by the standard formula. According to the standard formula the SCR is represented as the change in net asset value due to longevity shock which is a permanent 20 % reduction of mortality rates for all ages. A constant shock is not reasonable for all ages and maturities. The scenario related to the standard formula may lead to a biased allocation of capital, because of the volatility of longevity phenomenon in respect of different ages. In this paper we examine the adequacy of SCRs {{on the basis of the}} standard formula. To correctly calculate the solvency capital requirement we follow a multi-period approach in the sense that we evaluate at the beginning of each year the amount of capital that the insurer need to meet its future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force. We examine the adequacy of the shocks structure suggested by the standard formula studying its impact on the SCR for longevity risk (SCRLong) and liabilities at different ages...|$|R
