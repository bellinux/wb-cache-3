5|$|Ladislaus is {{a patron}} saint of Hungary, {{especially}} along the borders. In particular, soldiers and the Székely people venerate him. A <b>late</b> <b>medieval</b> legend says that Ladislaus appeared {{at the head of}} a Székely army fighting against and routing a plundering band of Tatars in 1345. He is also called upon during times of pestilence. He is often depicted as a mature, bearded man wearing a royal crown and holding a long sword or banner. He is also shown on his knees before a deer, or in the company of two angels.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Cathedral {{began as}} a parish church and was re-founded as a {{religious}} college in 1422, much of its structure being designed by John Wastell (1485 to 1506). It is very different in style from the earlier great churches, sometimes being listed with the 13 Anglican 'parish-church cathedrals'. Double aisles give it the widest nave of any English cathedral (115feet); and {{it also has the}} richest set of <b>late</b> <b>medieval</b> choir stalls and misericords in the country.|$|E

40|$|For the <b>late</b> <b>medievals</b> (cf. Ashworth 1972), an exponibilium or exponible {{proposition}} is {{an apparently}} simplex proposition {{that must be}} expounded (unpacked) into a formula involving the combination—typically via a simple conjunction—of two or more simpler propositions; derivatively, exponibilia also refers to those terms whose semantic analysis requires such an unpacking, e. g. the equivalents for only, every…but, begin, cease, insofar as. Even affirmative universals qualify as exponibles on the classical (Aristotelian) view, given the existential import of such statements: Every pleasure is good unpacks into There is no pleasure that is not good and There is pleasure. For our purposes, the key exponible is the converse of the universal, the exclusive proposition built on solus or tantum ‘only, alone’, and {{the key question is}} whether the conjunctive analysis of the medievals will suffice. But whence this analysis...|$|R

5|$|Survivals from <b>late</b> <b>Medieval</b> church {{fittings}} {{and objects}} in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. It {{is often difficult to}} decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E
5|$|The Crucifix by Cimabue at Santa Croce (c. 1265) is {{a wooden}} crucifix, painted in distemper, {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mosaicist Cimabue, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It {{is one of the}} first Italian artworks to break from the <b>late</b> <b>medieval</b> Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the <b>late</b> <b>medieval</b> period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E
50|$|Vänge Church {{dates from}} the Middle Ages, and the oldest parts of the {{building}} date from the 13th century. It was successively expanded during the 14th and 15th centuries. The <b>latest</b> <b>medieval</b> additions - among them, the brick vaults inside the church - were probably funded by a local guild called the Guild of St. John the Baptist, that existed in Vänge at the time. The church however derives much of its present-day appearance from a reconstruction and enlargement carried out in 1882-86, during which the church was re-made in Neo-Romanesque style both internally and externally. The reconstruction was carried out after the parish had been merged with neighbouring Läby parish, and the new congregation needed a larger church. In 1935 an attempt to restore the interior to its medieval appearance was carried out. During this time, church frescos by Albertus Pictor were uncovered.|$|R
