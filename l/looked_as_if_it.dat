5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E
5|$|With Ortona and Villa Grande captured, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{would require}} the Eighth Army only to regather itself and strike one more {{concentrated}} blow at Orsogna to complete the breaching of the Gustav Line's main Adriatic strongpoints. However, on 31 December, as V Corps probed along the coastal plain towards Pescara, a blizzard enveloped the battlefield. Drifting snow, sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while cloud ceiling and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce. Montgomery—realising the Eighth Army {{no longer had the}} strength or conditions to force its way to Pescara and the Via Valeria to Rome—recommended to General Alexander that the Eighth Army offensive should be halted. Alexander agreed but ordered him to maintain aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in the Adriatic sector and prevent Kesselring moving them to reinforce the XIV Panzer Corps front opposite Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army where the Allied offensive would continue.|$|E
25|$|Albus Dumbledore {{was tall}} and thin, with silver hair and beard (auburn in his youth) so long {{that they could be}} tucked into his belt. He had a very long and crooked nose that <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may {{have played a role in}} shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.|$|E

25|$|The {{next two}} decades were a time of steady growth and {{prestige}} for Alpha Epsilon Pi, {{as well as other}} fraternities. Expansion was occurring at an incredible rate for the Greek system as a whole. However, with the onset of fighting in Vietnam in the early 1960s, fraternity life faltered. Liberal student bodies revolted against authority and the Greek system, which was seen as a conservative, elitist group. Membership plummeted and nearly half the chapter roll was lost. It almost <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> might have been the end for Alpha Epsilon Pi. However the fraternity was able to reverse the trend and stabilize following the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|The second specimen, CAGS-IG-T1, also {{preserves}} {{the remains of}} several meals. Disarticulated bones were found, {{in front of the}} lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of Confuciusornis sanctus, a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long herbivorous ornithischian, perhaps Yueosaurus or a Psittacosaurus species. The bone surface of the scapula <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been etched by stomach acid for about thirteen days, leading to the conclusion the birds were swallowed later and in quick succession. This again would indicate a high metabolism for Sinocalliopteryx, necessitating a regular food intake.|$|E
25|$|Partridge was {{instrumental}} in the apprehension of the gang of murderers and body snatchers called the London Burkers, after the Edinburgh murderers Burke and Hare of three years earlier. On 5 November 1831, shortly after he had taken up the position of demonstrator of anatomy at King's College, the four members of the gang attempted to sell him the body of the so-called 'Italian Boy' for nine guineas. Both Partridge and the dissecting-room porter, William Hill, were suspicious of the fresh state of the body, which <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had never been buried, as well as of a cut on its forehead. Partridge is said to have delayed the gang members with the ruse of claiming to lack change for a fifty-pound note, whilst raising the alarm with his superior, Herbert Mayo. All four members of the London Burker gang were arrested while still awaiting payment.|$|E

25|$|It was the Adventure Comics run which {{established}} the Legion's general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated {{out of a}} clubhouse {{in the shape of}} an inverted yellow rocket ship which <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets. The regular police force in the United Planets was the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication.|$|E
25|$|Game 5, for {{the longest}} time, <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be the series {{clinching}} win for the Rays. B.J. Upton hit a 2-run {{home run in the}} 1st inning to make it 2–0. Carlos Peña would hit one of his own in the 3rd inning, immediately followed by a home run by Evan Longoria, giving the Rays a 5–0 lead. Upton would double in the 7th inning, scoring two more runs, increasing the lead to 7–0. In {{the bottom half of the}} 7th inning, with Rays starter Scott Kazmir having been removed from the game by manager Joe Maddon, the Red Sox would begin to rally. Boston would score four runs in that inning by virtue of a Dustin Pedroia RBI single, and a 3-run home run by David Ortiz which cut the Rays' lead to 7–4. With the Rays' bats quiet in the 8th inning, J. D. Drew hit a 2-run home run to bring the Red Sox within one run, and Coco Crisp would single home the tying run to make the score even at 7–7. In the 9th inning, with the score still tied and two out, Kevin Youkilis hit a ground ball to Rays third baseman Evan Longoria who made an errant throw which allowed Youkilis to advance to 2nd Base. After an intentional walk issued by the Rays, J. D. Drew came up big for Boston once again, sailing a fly ball over the head of Right Fielder Gabe Gross which fell to the ground and then bounced over the Right Field wall, scoring Youkilis on the ground rule double and capping off the largest comeback by a team facing elimination in postseason history. The Rays series lead was now down to only one game heading into Game 6, but would now return home as the series shifted back to Tropicana Field.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community of sentiment or interest. The center, of the throng was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly appreciative of the novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and streaked with gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> might have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E

500|$|The Derry Provisionals {{had little}} contact with the IRA elsewhere. [...] They had few weapons (about twenty) which they used mainly for sniping. [...] At the same time, they {{launched}} their bombing campaign in Derry. [...] Unlike in Belfast, they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people. [...] Eamonn McCann wrote that [...] "the Derry Provos, under Martin McGuinness, had managed to bomb the city centre until it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Passenger {{services}} on the Orawia Branch {{did not last}} even a decade. [...] By 1932, passengers were no longer carried and goods trains ran only twice weekly. [...] Passengers could travel {{on the rest of}} the line until the early 1950s, and around this time the daily Invercargill to Tuatapere and return goods train was withdrawn. [...] This was partially offset by a Monday to Friday goods train from the Wairio Branch junction at Thornbury to Tuatapere. [...] The Orawia Branch <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could be closed at any time until a cement works was constructed in the town in 1956. [...] It provided sufficient traffic to justify the Orawia Branch's existence.|$|E

President Kennedy was deeply dispirited and angered with the failure. [...] Several years after his death, the New York Times reported that he told an unspecified high administration official of wanting [...] "to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds." [...] However, following a [...] "rigorous inquiry into the agency's affairs, methods, and problems... did not 'splinter' it after all and did not recommend Congressional supervision."

2500|$|Alderman {{kept his}} first-team place {{throughout}} the golden {{years of the}} early to mid-1930s when, despite placing tenth in the 1932 County Championship table, fresh blood in the team was to give them their first, and as yet, only County Championship capture in 1936. During these years, Alderman {{was able to keep}} his batting average ticking over and around the 25 mark, and, having played more times during the 1936 season than any other to date, cemented his place in the Derbyshire opening attack, most notably with Test cricketer Stan Worthington and sometime wicket-keeper Harry Storer alongside him. Alderman was also noted for his deep fielding. At The Oval in 1936, Surrey batsman Tom Barling swept a ball from Bill Copson to leg which <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was carrying for six. Alderman sprinted 30 yards round the fine-leg boundary to catch it with his outstretched right hand just above the palings. Wisden pronounced that [...] "the catch should live in the memories of all those who were present on the Wednesday".|$|E
2500|$|The first 63 {{issues of}} Animal Man {{featuring}} Bolland's artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland's images maintaining a continuity {{of style and}} imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would [...] "go through and find a scene that <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{would make a good}} cover," [...] or [...] "find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what's going on inside the book." [...] This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison's tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of Animal Man to DC's new 'Mature Readers' imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to [...] "full color painted covers" [...] with issue No. 57. These of his covers were [...] "a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel," [...] which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that [...] "some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
