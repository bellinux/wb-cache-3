5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a <b>log-on</b> message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a <b>log-on</b> message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 <b>log-on</b> message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
5|$|The <b>log-on</b> message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a <b>log-on</b> message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Using the Internet {{to promote}} {{behavior}} change {{is becoming more}} desirable as Internet use continues to increase among diverse audiences. Yet we {{know very little about}} whether this medium is useful or about different strategies to encourage Internet use by various populations. This pilot study tested the usefulness of a Web-based intervention designed to deliver nutrition-related information to and increase fruit and vegetable consumption among adults from working-class neighborhoods. Methods Participants (N = 52) had access to the Web site for 6 weeks and received three e-mail reminders encouraging them to eat fruits and vegetables. The Web site provided information about overcoming barriers to healthy eating, accessing social support for healthy eating, setting goals for healthy eating, and maintaining a healthy diet, including recipes. We collected data on participants’ use of the Web site, their Internet access and use, and their fruit and vegetable consumption. Results The mean age of the participants was 46 years, 73 % were white, 46 % did not have a college degree, and 12 % had household incomes at or below 185 % of the federal poverty index. They reported consuming an average of 3. 4 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. More than half of the participants owned a computer, 75 % logged onto the Web site at least once, and those who visited the site averaged 3. 8 visits and viewed an average of 24. 5 pages. The number of <b>log-ons</b> per day declined over the study period; however, reminder e-mails appeared to motivate participants to return to the Web site. Roughly 74 % of participants viewed information on goal setting, 72 % viewed information on dietary tracking, and 56 % searched for main course recipes. Conclusion The results of this pilot study suggest that Internet-based health messages have the potential to reach a large percentage of adults from working-class neighborhoods who have access to the Internet...|$|R

40|$|In {{security}} science, efficient operation depends typically on {{the interaction}} between technology, human and machine detection and human and machine decision making. A perfect example of this interplay is ‘gatekeeping’, which is aimed to prevent the passage of people and objects that represent known threats {{from one end to}} the other end of an access point. Gatekeeping is most often achieved via visual inspections, mass screening, random sample probing and/or more targeted controls on attempted passages at points of entry. Points of entry may be physical (e. g. national borders) or virtual (e. g. connection <b>log-ons).</b> Who and what are defined as security threats and the resources available to gatekeepers determine the type of checks and technologies that are put in place to ensure appropriate access control. More often than not, the net performance of technology-aided screening and authentication systems ultimately depends on the characteristics of human operators. Assessing cognitive, affective, behavioural, perceptual and brain processes that may affect gatekeepers while undertaking this task is fundamental. On the other hand, assessing the same processes in those individuals who try to breach access to secure systems (e. g. hackers), and try to cheat controls (e. g. smugglers) is equally fundamental and challenging. From a security standpoint it is vital to be able to anticipate, focus on and correctly interpret the signals connected with such attempts to breach access and/or elude controls, in order to be proactive and to enact appropriate responses. Knowing cognitive, behavioral, social and neural constraints that may affect the security enterprise will undoubtedly result in a more effective deployment of existing human and technological resources. Studying how inter-observer variability, human factors and biology may affect the security agenda, and the usability of existing security technologies, is of great economic and policy interest. In addition, brain sciences may suggest the possibility of novel methods of surveillance and intelligence gathering. This is just one example of a typical security issue that may be fruitfully tackled from a neuroscientific and interdisciplinary perspective. The objective of our Research Topic was to document across relevant disciplines some of the most recent developments, ideas, methods and empirical findings that have the potential to expand our knowledge of the human factors involved in the security process. To this end we welcomed empirical contributions using different methodologies such as those applied in human cognitive neuroscience, biometrics and ethology. We also accepted original theoretical contributions, in the form of review articles, perspectives or opinion papers on this topic.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether Internal Medicine residents would find the use of an expert system (i. e. Clinical Diagnostic Decision Support System) to be a satisfactory experience when used during a clinical rotation in the hospital setting. Resident willingness to use the instrument was considered to be of particular importance because of growing concerns regarding the educational experience of residents in the hospital. Thus, our first goal was to assess resident satisfaction with the tool, prior to widespread implementation. STUDY POPULATION: Residents on the General Medical Hospital Service at St. Mary's Hospital, Rochester, Minnesota STUDY TYPE: Prospective cohort study METHOD: We provided unrestricted access DXplain, a Web-based Clinical Diagnostic Decision Support System, to five general medical teams in St. Mary's Hospital, Rochester, MN. All residents were particularly encouraged to access the system during the evaluation of new admissions. Usage of the system was recorded electronically each time a user logged on. At the conclusion of the 2 month study period, a survey was sent electronically to each of the participating residents. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 30 residents (G 1 = 20, G 3 = 10) rotated on the five medical services. 29 / 30 residents responded to the survey. 18 / 29 indicated that they had used the service, while 11 / 29 stated that they had not accessed the system. The resident's logged on 117 times to enter a case during the study period, with several entering more than one case per logon. The average number of <b>log-ons</b> per user was 2. 4 /week. Of the 18 who used the system, 15 found it useful (83. 3 %), 2 were unsure whether it was useful (11. 1 %), and 1 (5. 6 %) did not think it was helpful. However, when asked how often the system led the user to consider novel alternative diagnoses 13 / 18 (72. 2 %) responded "almost always to frequently" and 5 / 18 (27. 8 %) said "occasionally to sometimes". None of the users felt that the system "rarely" or "never" yielded additional diagnostic considerations. Seventeen out of eighteen users (94. 4 %) thought the system was "easy to use". When asked if they would like to have such a system regularly available 13 / 18 (72. 2 %) responded yes, while 4 / 18 (22. 2 %) were unsure. One resident said that they would not like to have DXplain available (5. 6 %). CONCLUSION: We believe the data reflect a significant level of satisfaction with the system among residents. Their recognition that it frequently led them to consider novel diagnoses suggests it had a positive educational impact...|$|R
500|$|At 02:25 MYT, the aircraft's {{satellite}} communication system sent a [...] "log-on request" [...] message—the first {{message on the}} system since the ACARS transmission at 01:07—which was relayed by satellite to a ground station, both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat. After logging on to the network, the satellite data unit aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat and two ground-to-aircraft phone calls, at 02:39 and 07:13, which went unanswered by the cockpit. The final status request and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08:10, about 1 hour and 40 minutes after it was scheduled to arrive in Beijing. The aircraft sent a <b>log-on</b> request at 08:19:29, which was followed, after a response from the ground station, by a [...] "log-on acknowledgement" [...] message at 08:19:37.

500|$|The BTO {{value was}} added to the ground station's data set to assist in geo-locating an {{aircraft}} following the Air France Flight 447 accident in 2009 and the initial BFO analysis—relating the BFO value to the elevation angle between the aircraft and satellite—was based on methods developed during the Flight 447 investigation. The first and seventh handshakes gave anomalous results and were excluded from the initial analysis, but the issue was later resolved. The initial analysis, accurate to approximately 1°, determined that elevation angle between the aircraft and satellite at the 08:11 handshake was 40°. When this was publicly disclosed by Malaysian officials, the arc was broken into two arcs—dubbed the [...] "northern corridor" [...] and [...] "southern corridor." [...] The first and seventh handshakes were later determined {{to be part of a}} <b>log-on</b> sequence, as opposed to the other handshakes that were <b>log-on</b> interrogation messages. The bias value during the logon sequence is different and was calculated using historical data for the aircraft's SDU.

500|$|The SATCOM link functioned {{normally}} from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT) {{until it}} {{responded to a}} ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07. Ground-to-air ACARS messages continued to be transmitted to Flight 370 until Inmarsat's network sent multiple [...] "Request for Acknowledge" [...] messages at 02:03, without a response from the aircraft. At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the SDU. At 02:25, the aircraft's SDU sent a [...] "log-on request". It is not common for a <b>log-on</b> request to be made in-flight, but it could occur for multiple reasons. An analysis of the characteristics and timing of these requests suggest a power interruption in-flight {{is the most likely}} culprit. As the power interruption was not due to engine flame-out, per ATSB, {{it may have been the}} result of manually switching off the aircraft's electrical system.|$|E
500|$|Knowing the {{location}} at the seventh handshake, investigators then {{needed to determine}} an appropriate width of the search area from the seventh arc. The seventh handshake was a 'log-on request' initiated by the aircraft and {{is believed to be}} the result of the SDU starting after power failure, resulting from fuel exhaustion and following the deployment of the ram air turbine and restart of the auxiliary power unit. The <b>log-on</b> request would have occurred 3 minutes and 40 seconds after fuel exhaustion—commonly known as flameout in aviation—of the second engine (flameout of both engines would not have occurred simultaneously), at which point the autopilot would have disengaged. The BFO value of this handshake indicates the aircraft may have been descending and the aircraft was travelling northeast to southwest. The ATSB has determined that an unresponsive crew/hypoxia event [...] "appeared to best fit the available evidence" [...] for the period of flight that Flight 370 tracked south over the Indian Ocean.|$|E
500|$|Aeronautical {{satellite}} communication (SATCOM) systems {{are used to}} transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit, as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may {{also be used to}} transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax and data links using other protocols. The aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) is used to send and receive signals with the {{satellite communication}}s network; it operates independently from other aircraft equipment that communicate through the SATCOM system, many using the ACARS protocol. Signals from the SDU are relayed by a satellite, which simply changes the signal's frequency, and then received by a ground station, which processes the signal and, if applicable, routes it to its destination (e.g., Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals to the aircraft are sent in reverse order. When the SDU is powered on and attempts to connect with the Inmarsat network, it transmits a <b>log-on</b> request, which the ground station acknowledges. This is, in part, to determine that the SDU belongs to an active service subscriber and also used to determine which satellite should be used to transmit messages to the SDU.
