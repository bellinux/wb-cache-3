5|$|The {{receivers}} {{are based}} on Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, with low noise amplifiers cooled to 15K, which have 20GHz bandwidths and provide 46dB of amplification. The signals are mixed with a <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> to reduce their frequency, prior to correlation with an analog correlator. The system temperatures are between 55 and 75K.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E

Heterodyne detection efficiency is directly correlated with the transverse mode structure and emphasizes the necessity of stable lowest order mode operation for lasers when used as <b>local</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The results obtained indicate that the continued development of these lasers provide suitable <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> {{for a variety of}} applications...|$|R

25|$|The {{frequency}} of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> fLO is set so the desired reception radio frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF±fLO. If the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> frequency {{is less than the}} desired reception frequency, it is called low-side injection (fIF = fRF − fLO); if the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> is higher, then it is called high-side injection (fIF = fLO − fRF).|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to keep stray radiation from the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> below the level that a nearby receiver can detect. The receiver's <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> can act like a low-power CW transmitter. Consequently, there can be mutual interference {{in the operation of}} two or more superheterodyne receivers in close proximity.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{influence}} of phase noise from free-running <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> on SAGE signal parameter estimation. Phase noise is here modeled as a random-walk process. We present phase noise estimates from our LUND RUSK MIMO channel sounder, and draw conclusions on requirements on <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> phase noise {{in terms of the}} Allan variance.

40|$|The {{theory and}} {{development}} of a VHF correlation radio interferometer for investigating ionospheric disturbances are discussed. The system was developed to receive signals from the geostationary Applications Technology Satellites. Amplitude and phase variations of the signal passing through the ionosphere can be detected by this instrument. The system consists of two superheterodyne receivers separated by a distance known as the baseline of the system. Since the system is a phase sensitive instrument, the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> of the two receivers must be phase coherent. This is accomplished by using phase-locked loops for generating the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The two signals from the separate receivers are cross-correlated by multiplying the two signals together and then time averaging the result. The sensitivity of the instrument is increased by off-setting one of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> by a small amount...|$|R
25|$|In digital {{wireless}} communication systems (GSM, CDMA etc.), PLLs {{are used to}} provide the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> up-conversion during transmission and down-conversion during reception. In most cellular handsets this function has been largely integrated into a single integrated circuit {{to reduce the cost}} and size of the handset. However, due to the high performance required of base station terminals, the transmission and reception circuits are built with discrete components to achieve the levels of performance required. GSM <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> modules are typically built with a frequency synthesizer integrated circuit and discrete resonator VCOs.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} {{significantly}} reducing the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{radiation from the}} receiver's antenna is to use an RF amplifier between the receiver's antenna and its mixer stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{parametric}} amplifier is implemented as a mixer. The mixer's gain {{shows up in}} the output as amplifier gain. The input weak signal is mixed with a strong <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> signal, and the resultant strong output is used in the ensuing receiver stages.|$|E
40|$|The Receiver Lab Telescope (RLT) is a groundbased {{terahertz}} telescope; it {{is currently}} the only instrument producing astronomical data between 1 and 2 THz. The capabilities of the RLT have been expanding since observations began in late 2002.

40|$|Abstract — A superconducting hot-electron {{bolometer}} mixer receiver {{operating from}} 1 to 1. 26 THz has been developed. This heterodyne receiver employs two solid-state <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> each {{consisting of a}} Gunn oscillator followed by two stages of varactor frequency multiplication. The measured receiver noise temperature is 1350 K at 1. 035 THz and 2700 K at 1. 26 THz. This receiver demonstrates that tunable solid-state <b>local</b> <b>oscillators,</b> supplying only a few micro-watts of output power, {{can be used in}} terahertz receiver applications.

25|$|Historically, {{vacuum tubes}} were expensive, so {{broadcast}} AM receivers would save costs by employing a single tube {{as both a}} mixer and also as the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator.</b> The pentagrid converter tube would oscillate and also provide signal amplification as well as frequency shifting.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E

The NASA Herschel Science Center, part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, also in Pasadena, has contributed science planning and data analysis software.|$|E
30|$|Certainly, {{utilizing}} {{just one}} of the WiFi channels is easier to manage than more WiFi channels because the base station only has to coordinate wireless stations operating in one channel, and the implementation is the same as shown in Figure 4. However, if the base station's operating channel is not fixed to a certain WiFi channel, the mobile station would have to control the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the up/down converter to shift GPRS signals to and from the proper WiFi channels. As shown in Figure 4, an interface in the GPRS device is provided to connect and control the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The UDOP ground {{receivers}} are double, superheterodyne, dual-channel {{units with}} common <b>local</b> <b>oscillators.</b> All resulting frequencies after mixing {{are related to}} the frequency standard except those experiencing doppler shift. Consequently, the doppler effects are measurable.|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{shows that}} the Doppler {{frequency}} shift affects the frequencies of the RF carrier, subcarriers, envelope, and symbol timing by the same percentage in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal or any other modulated signals. Then the SNR degradation of an OFDM system due to Doppler frequency shift, frequency offset of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> and phase noise is analyzed. Expressions are given and values for 4 -, 16 -, 64 -, and 256 -QAM OFDM systems are calculated and plotted. The calculations show that the Doppler shift of the D 3 project is about 305 kHz, and the degradation due to it is about 0. 01 to 0. 04 dB, which is negligible. The degradation due to frequency offset and phase noise of <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> will be {{the main source of}} degradation. To keep the SNR degradation under 0. 1 dB, the relative frequency offset due to <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> must be below 0. 01 for the 16 QAM-OFDM. This translates to an offset of 1. 55 MHz (0. 01 x 155 MHz) or a stability of 77. 5 ppm (0. 01 x 155 MHz/ 20 GHz) for the DI project. To keep the SNR degradation under 0. 1 dB, the relative linewidth (0) due to phase noise of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> must be below 0. 0004 for the 16 QAM-OFDM. This translates to a linewidth of 0. 062 MHz (0. 0004 x 155 MHz) of the 20 GHz RIF carrier. For a degradation of 1 dB, beta = 0. 04, and the linewidth can be relaxed to 6. 2 MHz...|$|R
25|$|In {{intelligence}} operations, <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> radiation gives a {{means to}} detect a covert receiver and its operating frequency. The method was used by MI-5 during Operation RAFTER. This same technique is also used in radar detector detectors used by traffic police in jurisdictions where radar detectors are illegal.|$|E
25|$|When {{so-called}} high-side injection {{has been}} used, where the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> is {{at a higher}} frequency than the received signal (as is common), then the frequency spectrum of the original signal will be reversed. This {{must be taken into}} account by the demodulator (and in the IF filtering) in the case of certain types of modulation such as single sideband.|$|E
25|$|With a 455kHz IF {{it is easy}} to get {{adequate}} {{front end}} selectivity with broadcast band (under 1600kHz) signals. For example, if the station being received is on 600kHz, the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> will be set to 600 + 455 = 1055kHz. But a station on 1510kHz could also potentially produce an IF of 455kHz and so cause image interference. However, because 600kHz and 1510kHz are so far apart, {{it is easy to}} design the front end tuning to reject the 1510kHz frequency.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E
500|$|Even in {{a design}} that is {{intended}} to be synchronously tuned, some staggered tuning effect is inevitable because of the practical impossibility of keeping all tuned circuits perfectly in step and because of feedback effects. [...] This can be a problem in very narrow band applications where essentially only one spot frequency is of interest, such as a <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> feed or a wave trap. [...] The overall gain of a synchronously tuned amplifier will always be less than the theoretical maximum because of this.|$|E
2500|$|To {{receive a}} radio signal, a {{suitable}} antenna is required. [...] The {{output of the}} antenna may be very small, often only a few microvolts. The signal from the antenna is tuned and may be amplified in a so-called radio frequency (RF) amplifier, although this stage is often omitted. One or more tuned circuits at this stage block frequencies that are {{far removed from the}} intended reception frequency. In order to tune the receiver to a particular station, the frequency of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> is controlled by the tuning knob (for instance). Tuning of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> and the RF stage may use a variable capacitor, or varicap diode. The tuning of one (or more) tuned circuits in the RF stage must track the tuning of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
