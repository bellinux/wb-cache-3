2500|$|Onstage, Big Black {{presented}} an intense spectacle {{to match their}} music. Albini would set off a brick of firecrackers onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling [...] "One, two, fuck you!" [...] While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put adhesive bandages on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would [...] "prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger", according to Azerrad. Gerard Cosloy recalls that [...] "It looked <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> plugged Steve into the amp [...] he was pretty scary to watch onstage." ...|$|E

The depth of his influence on Christian music is incalculable. We all owe him so much and I'll forever be grateful for the times we got to work together." ...|$|E

5000|$|The band's name—and the EP's title—stands for emerald, {{sapphire}}, {{and gold}}. Emerald and sapphire are Valerie and Renee Scroggins' birthstones, and gold {{refers to the}} record certification. The blue, green, and yellow cover artwork was adapted for ESG's 2000 compilation A South Bronx Story. The artwork for its 2015 Record Store Day release of The Moody EP is loosely based on the ESG cover.

5000|$|Quote from Alex Mendelssohn in Big Planet: [...] "Most {{of my work}} is spiritual. The {{spirits are}} {{definitely}} around us. And that drives us into a direction.

I can even talk to people while I am painting, but it is not me that is painting, I am only holding the brush. This does not happen every day. When it happens, the spirits and art become one." ...|$|R

50|$|Chapter 11 {{makes up}} the final chapter of the game's narrative. Conversing with Hayama, the protagonist realizes Urabe was never on any {{business}} trip, as he claimed before. When she went to school {{on the night of}} the Kaneda murder, through the window of the old school building did she see the bloody girl - this was likely Shinobu. Tazaki reveals that on that night he was indeed plastering the wall of the old school building, but he took a break.

50|$|Still another {{account of}} Kicking Bird's death {{maintains}} that something {{may have been}} wrong with his heart that caused his death.

Shortly after {{coming out of the}} water and having a cup of coffee, Kicking Bird died. This version fits descriptions in modern medical science of someone having a heart attack, but is not conclusive.|$|E

50|$|Charlie lets in the {{policeman}}, who notices {{some blood}} on the floor. Charlie, in the kitchen, grabs a knife and cuts himself, and then {{goes back to the}} policeman to explain that he cut himself on a vase. Right before leaving, the policeman decides to see what Charlie had been watching, much to Charlie's protests. He presses play, and watches the beginning of a children's movie Gus had secretly switched in. Satisfied, he leaves the house, but finds marks in the ground that look <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> been dragged.

5000|$|The {{band members}} were {{also known for}} {{creating}} their own artwork {{for use by the}} band on Album Covers, Tee-shirts and Posters. Tomas Del Balso [...] and Matt King are both visual artists within the group and are active with commissions and exhibitions. Interview with Harbour front Centre: [...] "We interviewed experimental indie rock band DD/MM/YYYY (Date-Month-Year), asking for illustrated answers, and their imaginative responses prove a picture really is worth a thousand words. We don’t know if we liked the drawings or the explanations better, but after we’d seen both, it felt <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> just stuffed our brains with ideas we wish we’d thought up ourselves. Their band name now also makes complete sense. It’s abstract, unconventional and futuristic, not unlike their thinking." ...|$|E

5000|$|Something {{has been}} sparked inside of me, {{watching}} them carry {{on over the}} last few days. We have had a very successful side and I think watching how we celebrate and how they celebrate, I think we have been pretty humble in the way we have gone about it. And personally, I think they have got far too carried away with their celebrations. It has definitely sparked passion inside of us. It has certainly spiced it up as well. Something gets triggered inside of you, something is burning inside of you - it is your will for success or your animal instinct that wants to bring another team down, We have been at the top for so long, it is <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> taken the favourite thing you own from you and you want it back.

5000|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London the IPC chose to {{reinstate}} the F46 classification to their programme. Rebisz felt cheated by the original decision to remove the T46 category and when discussing the reintroduction he stated that [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> done it to annoy me,". He entered the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, competing in the shot and discus. He came sixth in the shot put, but won gold in the discus. At London, he entered the only event available to him, the shot put, as his favoured discus event was not contested in the F46. He recorded a season's best of 15.01 metres, which was enough to win Rebisz a bronze, his first Paralympic medal in 16 years.|$|E
