Four of the aircraft provided diversionary attacks on ground targets, while the remainder took the photos with large F-56 cameras.

50|$|Photographs {{taken at}} an angle are called <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs.</b> If they are taken from a low angle earth surface-aircraft, they are called <b>low</b> <b>oblique</b> and <b>photographs</b> taken from a high angle are called high or steep oblique.|$|R
40|$|Several {{tentative}} conclusions can {{be derived}} from the results of the synoptic terrain photography experiment, with particular reference to the results from the Gemini mission. The photographs are additional confirmation of the feasibility and value of orbital photographs for geology, geography, and oceanography. The photographs have proven to be of value {{in the study of the}} tectonic problems. Although vertical or near-vertical photography is superior to <b>oblique</b> photography, <b>photographs</b> from the Gemini 12 mission have proven that <b>low</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs,</b> and even high <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs,</b> may be of value for certain situations. The oblique views of the Makran Range were useful substitutes for vertical photographs. Equivalent aerial coverage by vertical photographs would have necessitated a camera altitude of several hundred miles. The oblique views of the Sierra Madre Oriental have been used in the search for structures that are approximately normal to the horizon and are enhanced by the foreshortening because of the photograph...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 34, 000 aerial {{photographs}} covering {{large parts}} of Ethiopia and dating back to 1935 - 1941 have been recently recovered. These allow investigating environmental dynamics for a past period that until now is only accessible from terrestrial photographs or narratives. As the archive consists of both oblique and vertical aerial photographs that cover rather small areas, methods of image-based modelling were used to orthorectify the images. In this study, 9 vertical and 18 <b>low</b> <b>oblique</b> aerial <b>photographs</b> were processed as an ortho-mosaic, covering an area of 25 km(2), west of Wukro town in northern Ethiopia. Using 15 control points (derived from Google Earth), a Root Means Square Error of 28. 5 m in X 35. 4 m in Y were achieved. These values {{can be viewed as}} optimal, given the relatively low resolution and poor quality of the imagery, the lack of metadata, the geometric quality of the Google Earth imagery and the recording characteristics. Land use remained largely similar since 1936, with {{large parts of}} the land being used as cropland or extensive grazing areas. Most remarkable changes are the strong expansion of the settlements as well as land management improvements. In a larger effort, ortho-mosaics covering large parts of Ethiopia in 1935 - 1941 will be produced...|$|R
40|$|The depth, texture, {{and water}} holding {{capacity}} of the soil before {{the fire in the}} Bridge Creek area of Deschutes National Forest (1979) were determined from available aerial photography and LANDSAT MSS digital data. Three days after the fire was out, complete coverage of the burned area was acquired on 35 mm color infrared film from a near vertical or <b>low</b> <b>oblique</b> perspective. These <b>photographs</b> were used in assessing the condition of vegetation, and in predicting the likelihood of survival. Negatives from vertical natural photography obtained during the same flight were used to produce 3 R prints from which large scale mosaics of the entire burned area were obtained. LANDSAT MSS data obtained on the day the fire was under control were used to evaluate vegetative vigor (by calculating a band 7 /band 5 ratio value for each spectral class) and to determine the boundary between altered and unaltered land...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the value of}} analysing a range of remotely sensed imagery in order to study {{the development of the}} historic landscape in Southern Dobrogea (Romania). The methodology involves integrating within a GIS environment <b>low</b> altitude <b>oblique</b> aerial <b>photographs,</b> obtained through traditional observer-directed archaeological aerial reconnaissance; medium altitude historical vertical photographs produced by German, British and American military reconnaissance during the Second World War; and high altitude de-classified United States military satellite imagery (Corona) from the 1960 s. The value of this approach lies not just in that it enables extensive detailed mapping of large archaeological landscapes in Romania for the first time, but also that it allows the recording of previously unrecognised archaeological features now permanently destroyed by modern urban expansion or by industrial and infrastructural development. Various results are presented and illustrated, and some of the problems raised by each method of data acquisition are addressed...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{integrated}} aerial photographic {{assessment of}} Southern Dobrogea (Romania) {{is part of}} the first author's British Academy funded research programme 'Contextualizing change on the Lower Danube: Roman impact on Daco-Getic landscapes'. This seeks to study the effect of the Roman conquest and occupation on the native Daco-Getic settlement pattern on the Lower Danube. The methodology involves integrating a range of remotely sensed imagery including: <b>low</b> altitude <b>oblique</b> aerial <b>photographs,</b> obtained through traditional aerial reconnaissance; medium altitude vertical photographs produced by German, British and American military reconnaissance during the Second World War, selected from The Aerial Reconnaissance Achive at Keele University; and high altitude de-classified military satellite imagery (Corona) from the 1960 s, acquired from the USGS. The value of this approach lies not just in that it enables extensive detailed mapping of large archaeological landscapes in Romania for the first time, but also that it allows the recording of archaeological features permanently destroyed by more recent development across wide areas.

40|$|Despite the {{arguments}} {{in favour of}} <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs</b> acquired during observer-directed reconnaissance sorties, many aerial archaeologists have extracted much valuable information from verticals generated during total coverage mapping surveys.

However, after a theoretical and practical assessment of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of vegetation, it becomes clear that nadir views provide a more than satisfying alternative to the extremes of an oblique approach...|$|R

50|$|The two {{dimensions}} of a radar image are range and cross-range. Radar images of limited patches of terrain can resemble <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs,</b> but not ones {{taken from the}} location of the radar. This is because the range coordinate in a radar image is perpendicular to the vertical-angle coordinate of an oblique photo. The apparent entrance-pupil position (or camera center) for viewing such an image is therefore not as if at the radar, but as if at a point from which the viewer's line of sight is perpendicular to the slant-range direction connecting radar and target, with slant-range increasing from top to bottom of the image.|$|R
