We present a method for preparing a dedicated patient-specific, computer-optimized treatment plan for electrochemotherapy of deepseated tumors based on medical images. The treatment plan takes into account the patient’s anatomy, tissue conductivity changes during electroporation and the constraints of the pulse generator. Analysis of the robustness of a treatment plan made with this method shows that the effectiveness of the treatment is not affected significantly by small single errors in electrode positioning. However, when many errors occur simultaneously, the resulting drop in effectiveness is <b>larger,</b> <b>which</b> <b>means</b> {{that it is necessary to}} be as accurate as possible in electrode positioning. The largest effect on treatment effectiveness stems from uncertainties in dielectric properties and electroporation thresholds of treated tumors and surrounding tissues, which emphasizes the need for more accurate measurements and more research. The presented methods for treatment planning and robustness analysis allow quantification of the treatment reproducibility and enable the setting of suitabl...|$|E

This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar's light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a Gunn-Peterson trough.|$|R

It is noted that ICI can effectively be mitigated and the error floor is obviously lowered through our proposed algorithm.|$|R

At present, the number of China's listed port companies is the largest in the world; however, they have a very complex {{ownership structure}}. This study discusses the impact of ownership structure on the operation performance of the Chinese ports. This empirical research applies factor analysis to evaluate the operation performance of listed port companies, and then adopts linear regression analysis based on the evaluation results to explore the impact of ownership structure to operation performance. Finally, it proposes recommendations for optimizing the ownership structure of listed port companies, in order to promote a better and faster development of China's port industry. The empirical results show that for most of the listed port companies, the largest shareholder is in the absolute controlling position, and the gap between the largest shareholder and the second largest shareholder is very <b>large,</b> <b>which</b> <b>means</b> the ownership concentration is relatively high.

In this paper, we prove that, in many cases, G is <b>large,</b> <b>which</b> <b>means</b> that some finite index subgroup admits a surjective homomorphism onto a non-abelian free group. This has many consequences, including that O has infinite virtual first Betti number and G has super-exponential subgroup growth. Our first result, which {{forms the basis}} for the entire paper, is that G is commensurable with a lattice containing the Klein group of order 4. Our second result is that if G has a finite index subgroup with first Betti number at least 4, then G is large. This is known to hold for many arithmetic lattices. In particular, we show that it is always the case when G contains A_ 4, S_ 4 or A_ 5. Our third main result is that the Lubotzky-Sarnak conjecture and the geometrisation conjecture together imply that any arithmetic Kleinian group G is large. We also give a new 'elementary' proof that arithmetic Kleinian groups do not have the congruence subgroup property, which avoids the use of the Golod-Shafarevich inequality.
