40|$|Aircraft and {{ground-based}} radar {{data from the}} Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean– Atmosphere Response Experiment show that convective systems are not always vertical. Instead, many are tilted from vertical. Satellite passive microwave radiometers observe the atmosphere at an oblique angle. For example, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites and the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) on the TRMM satellite view at an incident angle of about 508. Thus, the brightness temperature measured from one direction of tilt may be different than that viewed from the opposite direction because of the different optical path. This paper presents an investigation of passive microwave brightness temperatures upwelling from tilted convective systems. To account for the effect of tilt, a 3 D backward Monte Carlo radiative transfer model {{has been applied to}} a simple tilted cloud model and a dynamically evolving cloud model to derive the brightness temperature. The radiative transfer results indicate that brightness temperature varies when the viewing angle changes because of the different optical path. The tilt increases the displacements between the high 19 -GHz brightness temperature (Tb 19) due to <b>liquid</b> <b>emission</b> from the lower level of cloud and the low 85 -GHz brightness temperature (Tb 85) due to ice scattering from the upper level of cloud.

This fungus emitted large quantities of exudates when cultivated on laboratory media. The exudates proved toxic towards four different mammalian test cells up to 10000 fold dilution. Toxins identified by LC-MS/MS were communesins and chaetoglobosin. Air dispersal of the toxic exudates was investigated with an experimental set-up where natural convection was generated by temperature gradient. It was found that the exudate with the contained toxins became airborne transported from the warmer surface to the colder surface. The results thus demonstrate transportation of microbially produced toxic substances across the air space.

40|$|SUMMARY: ISSeP {{has been}} {{controlling}} {{for ten years}} the gaseous and <b>liquid</b> <b>emissions</b> of main landfills in Wallonia. The monitoring of landfill surface gas-emissions is usually performed with portable FID analysers. Such devices offer high sensitiveness but measuring ranges are sometimes too short for high methane concentration. It is why another portable device, based on IR-analyzer technology (ECOPROBE), has been tested and compared to FID in several case studies. Synthetic air/methane gas mixture {{has been used to}} verify the exactness of both portable analysers. In a second time, the linearity of IR-device has been verified in its large measuring range from high-rated LFGes. Finally, performances of FID and IR technologies have been compared on “on-field sampled ” surface landfill gas (LFG). The tests show good proportionality and low detection limit of FID devices, but with low exactness and low upper saturation limit. The IR device shows good exactness and linearity on a wide measuring range, but his minimum detection value is higher than FID systems. This gap increases when analysing complex high-rated gas mixture as LFG. Despite this limitation, IR probe produces other simultaneous measurements such as carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations. These data are complementary to methane values and useful for landfill surface emissions monitoring. 1...|$|R

Moreover, the fate of the organic compounds within the landfill body is of primary importance since it directly influences the production of landfill gas. The aim of the paper is to propose an integrated mathematical model able to simulate, on one hand, the vertical leachate fluxes throughout a municipal solid waste landfill (considering the fate of both inorganic and organic contaminants within the landfill leachate pathway), while, on the other hand, the production of landfill gas by means of two different approaches.

The simulation of landfill gas production was based on two different approaches. The integrated model has been applied to a real landfill considered as a case study, the landfill of Pescantina (Italy), with the landfill body divided into N horizontal layers.

40|$|The Intec Copper Process is an {{environmentally}} advantageous hydrometallurgical {{process for the}} production of high purity copper and associated precious metals from copper sulphide concentrates. The process uses a mixed chloride-bromide lixiviant in an elegant cyclic circuit to leach the copper into solution, rejecting the iron as stable hematite rather than as unstable jarosite. After purification of the pregnant liquor, copper is electrowon at London Metal Exchange Grade A purity, while the anodic energy of the cell is stored as the soluble species, Halex TM, for recycle as the regenerated lixiviant to the leach circuit. Both gold and silver are leached and recovered directly from this cyclic process without resorting to cyanide leaching of the residue. No <b>liquid</b> <b>emissions</b> result from the Intec Copper Process, whilst spent air and water vapour from the leach are released to the atmosphere. The sulphur in the minerals reports to the solids residue in elemental form, without the need for expensive handling of voluminous gaseous sulphur dioxide streams found in smelters. A significant difference to competing smelting and hydrometallurgical processes is that any mercury entering the process from the sulphide concentrate feed is recovered rather than reporting directly to waste or polluting the environment. Outside the process circuit itself, the Intec Copper Process has several notable environmental advantages over competing technologies: 1. Flexibility of scale with low capital and operating costs allow operation directly at the mill head at production rates as low as 15 000 tpa, significantly reducing environmental impacts from concentrates transport. 2. The ability to handle low-grade and dirty concentrates often allows greater recoveries in the mill, improving both the economics and environmental acceptability of a mine by reducing metal losses to tailings. 3. A comparison of the total energy requirements of the Intec Copper Process with those of competing technologies shows that the Intec Copper Process has the lowest energy consumption of any of the known hydrometallurgical processes, as well as improving upon pyrometallurgy under appropriate conditions...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the nuclear era, starting during the 1940 s, large amount of radioactivity has been released into the environment. This thesis deals with the temporal and spatial distribution of the anthropogenic radioisotope 129 I (T 1 / 2 = 15. 7 Myr) in northern Europe. A routine sample preparation procedure for extraction of iodine from milligram amounts of solid materials has been developed and aimed for measuring the 129 I concentration by the ultra-sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry method. The technique was further used for the analysis of 129 I in sediments collected from two lakes in Sweden and one lake in Finland as well as sediments from two sites in the Baltic Sea. In addition, 129 I concentrations in aerosol samples from northern and southern Sweden covering the period 1983 to 2000 have been measured. The results reveal a gradual increase in the anthropogenic 129 I fluxes since the 1950 s that are linked to emissions from the nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France). A sharp increase coinciding with the Chernobyl accident is identified from the Swedish lakes located in areas characterised by relatively high Chernobyl fallout. Numerical modeling of the 129 I deposition predicts that > 50 % of the flux to the lake sediments is related to the <b>liquid</b> <b>emissions</b> from the reprocessing facilities. The modeling also reasonably simulates the contribution of the Chernobyl event to the total 129 I flux. The novel time series from northern Europe on 129 I in aerosols show about one order of magnitude higher concentration in northern compared to southern Sweden. Estimate of 129 I dry fallout based on the aerosol data suggests < 25 % contribution to the total fallout.

40|$|When {{attention}} {{is drawn to}} the recovery of resources within waste, the amount and types of waste disposed of at landfills change. A waste management system based on separate kerbside collection, sorting, recycling, and pretreatment with material and/or energy recovery produces new residues, which finally end up at landfills. This is the case in, for example, the US and the EU. As a possible result, the amount of organic material being deposited at landfills is reduced. In the EU, the remains from pretreatment are landfilled in containments, which have {{to be kept dry}} after closure, and the contact between the waste and its surroundings is restricted. The potential and actual emissions from landfills might be altered compared to the renowned waste management system unambiguously built on discarding untreated waste. The scope of this work is to elucidate possible resulting changes in emission potentials from landfilled municipal solid granular waste with their leachates, and to develop methods describing both emission potentials and actual emissions more accurately. A combination of different lab-scale experimental setups and analytical approaches are utilized in this work. The characterization of emission potentials is undertaken by analyzing total contents, the waste material's dielectric permittivity and the mineral phases of fresh and leached wastes. This is accompanied by testing their susceptibility for degradation with the aid of respiration activity and gas formation potential tests. Actual emissions are assessed by measuring ions of soluble salts, metals, and potentially oxygen depleting substances in the leachate emitted from granular waste materials leached with water. In order to verify the interconnection of parameters for determining emissions and those determining emission potentials, multivariate statistical analyses are used. Organic material plays an important role for leachate emissions from pretreated wastes. On the one hand, heavy metals might be bound to solid humic material to a higher extent after pretreatment. On the other hand, they might be mobilized with organic matter transported in the leachate even after pretreatment. Total organic carbon content of waste, a limit value employed in Sweden for diverting waste from landfills, proves to be less accurate in defining reduced emission potential by pretreatment than degradation tests, or analyzing the properties of organic carbon left in the solid. In standard laboratory percolation tests, which are used to describe emissions caused by moving water, the contact between solution and solute, measured as liquid to solid ratio, is artificially enhanced and accelerated. This modification is employed in order to resemble a worst case scenario within a limited time frame for the experiments. Up till now, neither the intensity of this contact nor the pore water velocity are tested nor controlled. The reaction of water with the solid waste and pore heterogeneities adds to the unreliability of translating liquid to solid ratios from the laboratory to field situations. The former issues can have a large impact on emissions and remaining emission potentials of wastes. By introducing an electromagnetic measuring technique, called Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR), into a column percolation test, monitoring the movement of water and solutes through wastes can be achieved. The effect of mean travel time on <b>liquid</b> <b>emissions</b> outweighs the importance of introducing a potentially mobilizing leaching agent, in this case dissolved organic carbon. Inorganic material and the supersaturation of calcite are identified as issues which deserve more attention in future work for assessing emissions and emission potentials regarding heavy metals from pretreated, granular wastes. Characterization of granular wastes by means of percolation tests in combination with chemical speciation modelling, monitoring of solution and solute, and evaluating the data with advanced statistical tools can enhance information on how potential emissions from waste change when alternative management options are chosen. Specific landfill scenarios with reduced <b>liquid</b> <b>emissions</b> and reduced emission potential can be developed. In the case of an air pollution control residue from waste incineration, forced leaching until a liquid to solid ratio of 2 with subsequent tight capping is suggested as a landfill scenario with minimum remaining emission potential in the long term. The performance of mitigation measures such as leachate treatment is ideally taken into regard, when environmental impacts of waste management options are elucidated. The severity of environmental impacts of pretreated wastes depends also on their final use and location, and the recipient's susceptibility for its emissions, as shown for a recovered refuse material in this work...|$|R

According to the observed data, the Maharagama cover soil can be expressed as a less gas exchangeable material (but a good capping soil). In the future methane emission can be increased through the loose compacted points and this can become hotspots. Further, formation of cracks around the ground area will also be possible...|$|R
