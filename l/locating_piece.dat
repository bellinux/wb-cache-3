These components {{ensure that}} the workpiece is positioned correctly, and remains {{in the same position}} throughout the operation. Surfaces provide support for the piece, pins allow for precise location at low surface area expense, and clamps allow for the workpiece to be removed or its position adjusted. <b>Locating</b> <b>pieces</b> tend to be designed and built to very tight specifications.|$|R

40|$|In Schenkerian analysis, one {{seeks to}} find {{structural}} dependences among the notes of a composition and organize these dependences {{into a coherent}} hierarchy that illustrates the function of every note. This type of analysis reveals multiple levels of structure in a composition by constructing a series of simplifications of a piece showing various elaborations and prolongations. We present a framework for solving this problem, called IVI, that uses a state-space search formalism. IVI includes multiple interacting components, including modules for various preliminary analyses (harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and cadential), identifying and performing reductions, and <b>locating</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Ursatz. We describe {{a number of the}} algorithms by which IVI forms, stores, and updates its hierarchy of notes, along wit...|$|R
40|$|Feature {{location}} aims at <b>locating</b> <b>pieces</b> of {{code that}} implement a given set of features (requirements). It {{is a necessary}} first step in every program comprehension and maintenance task if the connection between features and code has been lost. We have developed a semi-automatic technique for feature location {{using a combination of}} static and dynamic program analysis. Formal concept analysis is used to explore the results of the dynamic analysis. We describe new experiences with our technique. Specifically, we investigate the gain of information and increase of costs when the system under analysis is profiled at basic block level rather than routine level as in our earlier work. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the scenarios used for the dynamic analysis (minimal versus combined scenarios) ...|$|R

Therefore we are concerned with the comparison of frequency and time of TV signals either via satellite or near-ground level between two remotely <b>located</b> <b>pieces</b> of equipment. In this system, the microcomputer (NEC PC- 8001) widely used is equipped with its I/O devices. Separate interfaces were made for the phase comparator, the counter, and the timer. And their respective programs concerning frequency and time were also made. By making use of those interfaces and programs we can deal with speedily input data itself from the phase comparator, the counter, and the timer in agreement with output form. It was found from the output data of the microcomputer that the standard frequency deviation is of the order of 10 ^ and the accuracy of the time comparison is almost less than 100 nano-seconds...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge-refinement is {{a central}} problem {{in the field of}} expert systems. For {{rule-based}} systems, refinement implies the addition, deletion and modification of rules in the system so as to improve the systemâs overall performance. The goal of this research effort is to understand the methodology for refining large rule-based systems, as well as to develop tools that will be useful in refining such systems. The vehicle for our investigation is spam, a production system (rule-based system) for the interpretation of aerial imagery. Complex and compute-intensive systems like spam impose some unique constraints on knowledge refinement. More specifically, the credit/blame assignment problem for <b>locating</b> <b>pieces</b> of knowledge to refine becomes difficult. Given that constraint, we approach the problem in a bottom-up fashion, i. e., begin by refining portions of spamâs knowledge base, and then attempt to understand the interactions between them. We begin by identifying gaps and/or faults in the knowledge base by comparing spamâs intermediate output to that of an expert, then modifying the knowledge base so that the systemâs output more accurately matches the expertâs output. While this approach leads to some improvements, it also raises some interesting issues concerning the evaluation of refined knowledge at intermediate levels and of interaction between the refinements. This paper presents our initial efforts toward addressing these issues. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{birth of}} the {{technique}} of collage in the XXth century is the attempt {{to break through the}} borders between art and life. The art abandons fiction, for the first time annexing into its field waste and splinters of reality and next entering the real life. Anthropological understanding of artistic phenomena enables alternative to poststructuralist and postmodern view on the art of collage. It allows a constructive question to the phenomena to be posed and answered: what collage constructs, what it expresses and to what it reacts, whether it expresses the new consciousness? The slogan: "life itself is art and art is life" is the effect of collage, which participates in all genres and artistic forms that attempt to embrace non-artistic activities, melt into the sequence of events, act in the real space, conduct single actions, blowing over like events in the real life. Making art may be understood as the synonym for humanity. With the use the collage technique artists realize first of all that the artistic activity is part of reality and natural consequence of creative potential of humankind. Collage teaches how to <b>locate</b> <b>pieces</b> of art among other creative work. The collage technique shows that the Art is an everyday creation and output...|$|R
5000|$|The coding {{process is}} rarely {{completed}} the first time. Each time, researchers {{should strive to}} refine codes by adding, subtracting, combining or splitting potential codes. Start codes are produced through terminology used by participants during the interview {{and can be used}} as a reference point of their experiences during the interview. Dependability increases when the researcher uses concrete codes that are based on dialogue and are descriptive in nature. [...] These codes will facilitate the researcher's ability to <b>locate</b> <b>pieces</b> of data later in the process and identify why they included them. Initial coding sets the stage for detailed analysis later by allowing the researcher to reorganize the data according to the ideas that have been obtained throughout the process. Reflexivity journal entries for new codes serve as a reference point to the participant and their data section, reminding the researcher to understand why and where they will include these start codes in the final analysis. [...] Throughout the coding process, full and equal attention needs to be paid to each data item because it will help in the identification of unnoticed repeated patterns. Coding for as many themes as possible and coding individual aspects of the data may seem irrelevant but can potentially be crucial later in the analysis process.|$|R

5000|$|Conversely, {{the concept}} of a single route called the Pilgrims' Way could be no older than the Victorian Ordnance Survey map of Surrey, whose surveyor, Edward Renouard James, {{published}} a pamphlet in 1871 entitled Notes on the Pilgrims' Way in West Surrey. Here he asserted that the route was [...] "little studied" [...] and that [...] "very many persons in the neighbourhood" [...] had not been aware of it. His insertion of the route name on the Ordnance map gave an official sanction to his conjecture; and writers such as Hilaire Belloc were eager to follow it up. In fact, the route as shown on modern maps is not only unsuitable for the mass movement of travellers but has also left few traces of their activity. The official history of the Ordnance Survey acknowledges the [...] "enduring archaeological blunder", blaming the enthusiasm for history of the then Director, General Sir Henry James. Together, romantically inclined authors have succeeded in creating [...] "a fable of...modern origin" [...] to explain the existence of the Way. However, F.C.Elliston-Erwood, A Kentish historian, notes that tithe records dating from before 1815 use the well established name [...] "Pilgrims' Way" [...] to reference and <b>locate</b> <b>pieces</b> of land.
