In this article, a Hypo-Steiner light-tree algorithm (HSLT) is proposed {{to construct a}} HSLT light-tree to include as many destinations as possible. The upper bound cost of the light-trees built by HSLT is given as N(N − 1) / 2, where N {{is the number of}} nodes in the network. The analytical model proves that, under the same condition, more destinations could be held in a HSLT than a Member-Only (Zhang et al., J. <b>Lightware</b> Technol, 18 (12), 1917 – 1927 2000.) light-tree. Extensive simulations not only validate the proof but also show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the existing multicast routing algorithms by a large margin in terms of link stress, throughput, and efficiency ofwavelength usage...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} query execution system Qios. It serves as a <b>lightware</b> system for the manipulation of XML data. Qios employs the relational technology for query processing. The main aim in the implementation {{is to provide a}} querying system that is easy to use and does not require any additional knowledge about the internal representation of data. The system provides robust and simple solutions for many design problems. We aimed to simplify the internal structures of query processors rooted in the design of relational and object-relational query processors. We propose efficient internal data structures for the representation of queries during all phases of query execution. The query optimization is based on dynamic programming and uses beam search to reduce the time complexity. The data structure for storing queries provides efficient representation of queries during the optimization process and the simple means to explore plan caching. Finally, main memory indices can be created on-the-fly to support the evaluation of queries...|$|E
40|$|Current {{restoration}} signaling is a two-phase messaging procedure {{between the}} sender and {{the receiver and}} depends heavily on the message propagation delays during the recovery process and the cross-connect switching times. Offset time (OT) based restoration was proposed in [C. Assi, Y. Ye, S. Dixit, M. Ali. Control and management protocols for survivable optical mesh networks, IEEE Journal of <b>Lightware</b> Technology, November 2003. ] to address {{the impact of these}} parameters and upper bound (OT-UB) expressions were derived. However, our closer investigation showed that as the network conditions change (e. g. increasing the number of wave-length channels per link) the benefits this restoration paradigm offer rapidly diminish, thereby rendering the argument of avoiding conventional restoration signaling inappropriate. In this paper, we propose a more accurate model to estimate the OT of each failed connection using a time-driven scheduling procedure. We also study the applicability of the proposed recovery protocol under double link failures assumption and we propose extensions to the protocol. We evaluate our proposal through simulation experiments and we show that substantial restoration gain can be achieved under varying network conditions. q 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This release {{enables the}} use of three {{different}} estimators and switches the default estimators for multicopters, fixed wing and VTOL to more modern variants. Default estimator for multicopters is attitude_estimator_q and LPE (new). Better position and alt hold. Default estimator for VTOL is attitude_estimator_q and LPE (new). Better position and alt hold. Default estimator for fixed wing is ekf 2 (new). Better attitude estimation and general performance. This release also includes a long list of improvements: Yaw control performance fix / increase for VTOL Better default gains for Delta Quad u-Blox RTK / RTCM relay support Yaw limit mixer fix for multicopter Preliminary support for Parrot Bebop Full support for RPI 2 + Navio 2 (was present for a while, now integrated / flight tested) <b>LightWare</b> Lidar fixes for I 2 C Sony QX 1 triggering through SeaGull MAP 2 cable Geotagging script for QX 1 and PX 4 logs 30 x faster log download (now more than 300 KB/s, which is sufficient for realistic use) MAVLink shell support: A python script in Tools now allows to use NSH via MAVLink Sensors app cleanup for failover handling and integrals New logger support for. ulog files (will replace sdlog 2). This logger logs directly uORB topics, which makes analysing logs a lot more convenient and efficient as they directly relate to the C code now Replay of complete system via. ulog files which contain all topics. This is the equivalent of replaying a ROS bag. New derivation for EKF 2 estimator, resilience for large yaw changes Rewrite and hardening of the land detector VTOL: Dedicated transition switch for manual operation.
