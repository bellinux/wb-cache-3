50|$|Compound bows are {{designed}} to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels {{on the ends of}} the limbs to achieve this. A typical <b>let-off</b> is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% <b>let-off</b> only requires 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% <b>let-off</b> is possible. The compound bow was invented by Holless Wilbur Allen in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bows, {{replacing the}} string or making adjustments to <b>let-off</b> or draw length often requires a bow press.|$|E
5000|$|The pulley/cam {{system also}} confers a benefit called [...] "let-off". As the string is drawn back, the pulleys rotate. The pulleys are {{eccentric}} rather than round, and so their effective radius changes as they rotate. The pulleys feature two cam tracks. An inner cam track which connects mechanically to the limbs or opposite cam and an outer cam track which the bowstring runs through. As the bow is drawn {{the ratio of}} bowstring pay-out and bowstring take-up relative to limb-weight and leverage of the cams changes. By manipulation of the shapes of these cam tracks, different draw-stroke profiles can be created. A compound bow can be soft-drawing with a slow build-up to peak weight and a gradual <b>let-off</b> with a long [...] "valley" [...] at the end. It can also be hard-drawing with a very fast build-up to peak draw-weight, a long plateau where weight is maintained, and a quick <b>let-off</b> with a short valley. The <b>let-off</b> itself {{is the result of}} the cam profiles having passed center and approaching a condition very similar to a cam-lock. In fact some compound bows, if the draw-stops or draw-length modules are removed, will self-lock at full draw and require professional equipment to unlock safely.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} new program has developed in U.S. schools called the National Archery in Schools Program (NASP). In this students use Genesis bows (a compound-style bow without a <b>let-off).</b> This {{is similar to}} a physical education programs, and students who want to can also go to state and national shoots to compete against other schools. Though started in the United States, it has begun to spread to other countries.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} quite a few youth-oriented {{compound}} bows with low draw weights that have no <b>let-off</b> and have a maximum draw length deliberately set farther than the majority of young shooters would reach. This effectively makes the bow function very similar to a recurve, with the draw length determined by the shooter's preferred anchor point. This removes the necessity to adjust the bow draw length or use a different bow for different shooters (or to change bows as the shooter gets older). This type of bow is required for use in the U.S. National Archery in the Schools Program.|$|E
50|$|Bows {{are usually}} very simple. Most {{do not have}} sights, and aiming is by {{line-of-sight}} judgment down the arrow. There {{are a couple of}} types of rests including the hook and roller rest. Most bows have little to no <b>let-off</b> and not much draw weight. This differs with what one has available and personal preference. There are two main types of bows. Traditional bows include long bows and recurve bows. In more modern times, compound bows came into use. They use a system of pulleys to help the archer. Modern bows can have as much as 120 pounds (50 kg) draw weight.|$|E

5000|$|The {{photo on}} the right shows the axle {{attaching}} the limb to cam is mounted {{at the edge of}} the cam as opposed to the center. As the string is drawn the cam turns and imparts force to compress the limb. Initially, the archer has the 'short' side of the cam, with the leverage being a mechanical disadvantage. High energy input is therefore required. When near full draw is reached, the cam has turned to its full extent, the archer has gained mechanical advantage, and the least amount of force needs to be applied to the string to keep the limbs bent. This is known as [...] "let off". The lower holding weight enables the archer to maintain the bow fully drawn and take more time to aim.

50|$|The {{internal}} preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is {{a departure}} from previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled, the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N. Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a <b>let-off</b> point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It {{should be noted that}} the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{function}} of the cam systems (known as the 'eccentrics') is to maximize the energy storage throughout the draw cycle and provide <b>let-off</b> {{at the end of}} the cycle (less holding weight at full draw). A traditional recurve bow has a very linear draw weight curve - meaning that as the bow is drawn back, the draw force becomes heavier with each inch of draw (and most difficult at full draw). Therefore, little energy is stored in the first half of the draw, and much more energy at the end where the draw weight is heaviest. The compound bow operates with a different weight profile, reaching its peak weight within the first few inches of the draw, and remaining more flat and constant until the end of the cycle where the cams [...] "let-off" [...] and allow a reduced holding weight. This manipulation of the peak weight throughout the draw (accomplished by the elliptical shape of the cams that change leverage and mechanical advantage) is why compound bows store more energy and shoot faster than an equivalent peak weight recurve bow or longbow.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the most}} common configuration, there is a cam or wheel {{at the end of}} each limb. The shape of the cam may vary {{somewhat}} between different bow designs. There are several different concepts of using the cams to store energy in the limbs, and these all fall under a category called bow eccentrics. The four most common types of bow eccentrics are Single Cam, Hybrid Cam, Dual Cam and Binary Cam. However, there are also other less common designs, like the Quad Cam and Hinged. Cams are often described using their [...] "let-off" [...] rating. As a cam is rotated, the force required to hold the bow in position reaches a peak and then decreases as the bow approaches maximum extension (a position known as [...] "the wall"). The percent-difference between the maximum force encountered during the draw and the force required to hold the bow in full extension is the [...] "let-off". This value is commonly between 65% and 80% of the peak weight for recently designed compound bows, although some older compound bows provided a <b>let-off</b> of only 50% and some recent designs achieve let-offs in excess of 90%.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{innovative}} lightweight materials are rapidly {{increased in the}} recent years, owing to their cost-effective, high-strength, environmentally-sound use of materials and process technologies, {{in addition to that}} they reduce the weight of a product. The characteristics of 3 D-spacer fabrics {{as one of the most}} important lightweight materials in future are multifaceted not only owing to its extremely light materials, but also because of exceptionally high stiffness to weight ratio compared to other constructions. It is also one possible method for improving the properties of fabric-reinforced composites. It can enhance the through-the-thickness properties, such as shear strength, dimensional stability, damage, tolerance, and fracture toughness that are critical for many structural applications. Spacer fabric has been employed in high-technology applications because of its critical mechanical properties related to high tensile strength, tear strength and stiffness. Furthermore, its multidirectional structures allow with more reinforcement along the thickness direction leading to an increase in stiffness and strength properties. The fundamental aim of this thesis exists in the development of a new kind of woven spacer fabrics for the light weight composites materials, in an effort to weave spacer fabrics that can not be realized with the old technology which are mentioned above. Therefore, the work in brief focuses on two main goals: 1. Development of a new kind of spacer fabrics for composites in the lightweight constructions. 2. Development of special devices of a narrow weaving machine for standing the process of the new kind of spacer fabrics production. The slippage strength test had to be carried out for the floated warp yarns through the ground fabrics by using different elements of woven fabric structures variables represented in different fabric constructions, different weft densities and different repeats of constructions by using different materials. The importance of this test related to the backward-movement of the floated warp yarns which is the crucial stage in the weaving process of spacer fabrics during the backward-movement. The results of this test determine the required forces for the backward-movement, on the other side it is the best method to observe the behavior of structure elements during the backward movement. The results of the slippage strength had been statistically analyzed, and the weaving process for the spacer fabrics had been achieved. It was concluded that the best properties for the woven spacer fabrics and the optimum case for the weaving process on the test weaving machine had been achieved when the following items are realized: Development of the narrow weaving machine is closed in assisting operations, <b>let-off</b> and take-up and enhancement for take-up processes. Extra <b>let-off</b> and take-up devices must be constructed at the weaving machine. Extra <b>let-off</b> device has to be used for controlling the floated warp yarns of ground fabrics. On the other side, extra take-up and the developed take-up devices have to be used for controlling the woven spacer fabrics. The experimental results give fundamental knowledges for the next steps in research and development of woven spacer fabrics made of high-performance yarns on the wide weaving machine. Die Ziele der Arbeit bestanden in der Entwicklung der Geometrie der Spacer Fabrics und der notwendigen Falteneinrichtung an der Bandwebmaschine. Spacer Fabrics werden ausschließlich aus zwei Deckflächen, die durch eingewebte Stege verbunden sind, gefertigt. Zur Entwicklung der Spacer Fabrics muss eine Doppelnadel-Bandwebmaschine mit zwei Webfächern eingesetzt werden. Für die Faltenwebeinrichtung werden der entwickelte Extra-Kettablass und der Extra-Abzug benötigt.

The first compound bow was invented in Missouri in 1969. [Allen, 1968] Compound bows are uniquely different from other types of bows in that they use a set of cables, cams and pulley, and two elastic limbs that act as springs, to create a mechanical advantage while the bowstring is being drawn. In {{what is known as the}} <b>let-off</b> (draw force verses draw length) curve, this allows the archer to hold the bow at a fully drawn length with significantly less force than the maximum draw force. This design is advantageous for hunting, where arrow speed, accuracy, and holding weight become important requirements in being successful. Since the invention, technology has progressed in improving the bow's efficiency, accuracy, and arrow speed through patented empirical methods. However, very little has been shown in analytically modeling and optimal design of this complex mechanical system. A preface to various types of bows as well as subtypes of compound bows will be introduced. A kinematic analysis will be shown for an eccentric-circular cam design and a one-cam one-pulley design. By iteratively determining the bow limb, cam, and cable positions a relationship between the drawn length and drawn force will produce a draw-force curve. In fact, this curve represents the strain energy stored within the system, and upon arrow release will be transferred into kinetic energy. Like all mechanical systems, there is a loss in energy and efficiency. A method for accurately determining efficiency will be explained. Experiments are also conducted using carbon fiber composites to create an adequate limb design...|$|E
