40|$|Engineering Development is {{one stage}} from the huge {{development}} method called Systems Engineering. In this Thesis, Engineering Development is studied and applied for two Case studies. The main {{emphasis is on}} the Requirements Management, Design and Testing. Two Remote Handling (RH) capable tools are developed in the case studies: Water Hydraulic Jack (WHJ) and Wrench-Pin Tool (WPT). WHJ is developed from the first prototype and WPT is developed from a concept level. The tools are used remotely for Gradel Cassette locking and unlocking processes by a robot called Water Hydraulic MANipulator (WHMAN) at Divertor Test Platform 2 (DTP 2). The Gradel Cassette is a full scale Mock-Up from a Divertor Cassette that will be used in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The RH specific Requirements are developed by gathering Operator Feedback (OF), performing Potential Problem Analysis (PPA) and Task Description (TD) for the locking process. The Divertor Cassette <b>Locking</b> <b>Tools</b> are designed according to these RH specific requirements. After the design process, the tools are tested in a full scale test environment and the RH requirements are verified. The development and testing procedure that is performed for the RH tools may be used as a guideline for forthcoming new generation Divertor Cassette <b>Locking</b> <b>Tools...</b>|$|R

50|$|In some countries, such as Japan, <b>lock</b> picking <b>tools</b> {{are illegal}} {{for most people}} to possess, but in many others they are {{available}} and legal to own {{as long as there}} is no intent to use them for criminal purposes.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, {{possession}} of <b>lock</b> picking <b>tools,</b> {{with the exception}} of key duplication <b>tools,</b> is legal. <b>Lock</b> pick <b>tools</b> fit in the same category as crowbars or hammers, meaning they are legal to possess and use unless they are used to commit a crime or if it is shown there was intention to commit a crime. Section 351 of the Canadian Criminal Code criminalizes the [...] "possession any instrument suitable for the purpose of breaking into any place, motor vehicle, vault or safe under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for such a purpose", and carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.|$|R

40|$|The {{architecture}} of a mission critical power {{system has to}} be designed with structures that allow the simultaneous operation of multiple sources (architecture efficiency). Opportunely organized, the Business Continuity Management (BCM) will project its program and take actions on the sources. Complete control {{of the system is}} necessary for all operating occurrences in an electrical power system. Complexity requires that “safe sets” of operating procedures have to be identified, selected and authorized, as adopting the Parise program. A Human Competent Reaction HCR has to guarantee the operation efficiency as providing decision-making in emergency statuses. The paper deals with a sample case of a system with multiple sources applying the micro approach of the “flock” logic that consists in managing exclusively the adjacencies of each node. The adoption of mechanical <b>locking</b> <b>tools</b> assists the switching procedures...|$|R
5000|$|Each time a {{potential}} intruder tries {{enter into a}} house, she or he tests whether it is closed and <b>locked,</b> uses <b>tools</b> on openings, or/and applies pressure, and therefore he or she creates low-frequency sound vibrations. Such actions are immediately detected by the infrasound detector before the intruder breaks in.|$|R

5000|$|Quick Pick - The Quick Pick is {{a unique}} <b>lock</b> picking <b>tool</b> of Curt's design.

As a result, no standard lock is safe from this device.|$|R

50|$|Iron was {{not worked}} in the Mesoamerican period, with its mining and working {{introduced}} by the Spanish. Exploration of the metal was initially banned to protect the industry in Spain, but as tools made from the metal were essential for exploration and conquest, the prohibition was soon ignored. Initially the items were purely utilitarian such as <b>tools,</b> <b>locks,</b> horseshoes and <b>tools.</b> Later in the colonial period, iron began {{to be used in}} other ways, including decorative elements in churches and mansions such as railings and balconies. The height of traditional Mexican ironworking was in the 17 and 18th centuries.|$|R
50|$|A shove knife is a forcible entry tool used {{mainly by}} firefighters. Generally, they {{will consist of}} a small semi rigid piece of 10 gauge steel with an {{indented}} end.

50|$|A {{tubular lock}} pick is a {{specialized}} lockpicking tool used for opening a tubular pin tumbler lock. Tubular lock picks {{are all very}} similar in design and come in sizes to fit all major tubular locks, including 6, 7, 8, and 10-pin <b>locks.</b> The <b>tool</b> is simply inserted into the lock and turned clockwise with medium torque. As the tool is pushed into the lock, each of the pins is slowly forced down until they stop, thus binding the driver pins behind the shear line of the lock. When the final pick is pushed down, the shear plane is clear and the lock opens. This can usually be accomplished {{in a matter of}} seconds.|$|R

Jesper was a thief and {{has been}} known to steal bracelets off people's wrists while talking to them just to prove he had the skill. He does however always return them, just because he likes the joy of it. Jesper is also a very fast runner as people do not {{appreciate}} him stealing their things, but known to complain (which has sparked Hal, Stig and Thorn's ire on several occasions). He also is very good at picking locks and stealth. Despite leaving those days behind him, he still keeps his <b>lock</b> picking <b>tools,</b> which he uses to break them out of jail in the third book.|$|R

50|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{foundation}} was to save some of the historical buildings that were built between the years 1870 and 1910.

The foundation purchased 90 acres of land in north Phoenix and the museum was inaugurated in February 15, 1969. Among the exhibits found in the museum is the Exhibit Hall Firearms, <b>Tools,</b> <b>Locks</b> & Keys.|$|R
