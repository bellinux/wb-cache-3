500|$|After {{the first}} {{recording}} session on 6 June 1962, Martin had one reservation, {{as he felt}} that using an experienced studio session drummer would improve the recording, rather than using Pete Best (this was normal practice at the time). Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison asked Epstein to sack Best when they learned that Martin wanted to replace him on their recordings. Epstein agonised about the decision, asking The Cavern Club's DJ Bob Wooler {{if it was a}} good idea. Wooler replied that Best was [...] "very popular with the fans" [...] who would not <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August, over two and half months after the first recording session at EMI studios. Best was never given an explanation for his dismissal.|$|E
2500|$|Little Man (Clayton Chester Logan): [...] A meticulously neat 6 year-old first-grader, Little Man is the {{youngest}} of the Logan children. He also doesn't understand why blacks get treated so badly and does not understand why blacks and whites are different. All that he knows is that he does not <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Yes, but I don't like it. I {{have to do}} it, but I don't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> because I don't {{like the}} kind of voice I have. I really hate {{listening}} to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, [...] "Oh, that was really well sung," [...] or [...] "It was nearly perfect." ...|$|E

Of course I was obliged to ask some one; and who else was there that {{would be able to}} tell me so well as Mr. Comfort?

2500|$|In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder Sheila Johnson {{said that}} she herself is [...] "ashamed" [...] of what the network has become. [...] "I don't watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don't watch it," [...] she said. [...] "When we started BET, {{it was going to}} be the Ebony {{magazine}} on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called Teen Summit, we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn't like the way women were being portrayed in these videos." ...|$|E

60|$|Laura, {{as soon as}} her {{brother-in-law}} {{had been in the}} room a moment, had a particular fear; she had seen him twice noticeably under the influence of liquor; she had not <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and now there were some of the same signs. She was afraid the children would discover them, or at any rate Miss Steet, and she felt the importance of not letting him stay in the room. She thought it almost a sign that he should have come there at all--he was so rare an apparition. He looked at her very hard, smiling as if to say, 'No, no, I'm not--not if you think it!' She perceived with relief in a moment that he was not very bad, and liquor disposed him apparently to tenderness, for he indulged in an interminable kissing of Geordie and Ferdy, during which Miss Steet turned away delicately, looking out of the window. The little boys asked him no questions to celebrate his return--they only announced {{that they were going to}} learn botany, to which he replied: 'Are you, really? Why, I never did,' and looked askance at the governess, blushing as if to express the hope that she would let him off from carrying that subject further. To Laura and to Miss Steet he was amiably explanatory, though his explanations were not quite coherent. He had come back an hour before--he was going to spend the night--he had driven over from Churton--he was thinking of taking the last train up to town. Was Laura dining at home? Was any one coming? He should enjoy a quiet dinner awfully.|$|R
5000|$|However, Canon Giles Fraser, an Anglican {{canon of}} St Paul's Cathedral, preaching at an ecumenical service at Nichols' own cathedral in Westminster, {{suggested}} [...] "...there are some - and indeed in both churches - {{who do not}} see <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> For from the Anglican perspective, this new invitation to swim the Tiber can sometimes have a slightly predatory feel; in corporate terms, {{a little like a}} take over bid in some broader power play of church politics." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I come often," [...] she said. [...] "I {{love this}} place, but I'm terrible, in general, for churches.

[...] Looking about for a chair, so that he {{instantly}} pulled one nearer, she sat down with him again to the sound of an [...] "Oh, I like so much your also being fond--!" ...|$|R

"Whether Zack really {{turns out}} a painter or not," [...] said Valentine to himself, {{as the door}} closed on the two young people, [...] "I believe I have hit on the best plan that ever was devised for keeping him steady.

5000|$|Originally, [...] "Don't Change Your Plans" [...] was {{preceded by}} a long {{instrumental}} passage; Folds credits producer Caleb Southern for helping edit down the song to its final product, and told an interviewer that Southern, [...] "just cut it away {{and then all of}} a sudden it was this pop song.

40|$|First of all, I'd like {{to express}} my thanks to René Raffray, the {{outgoing}} chair of the Fusion Energy Division, for his leadership over the past year. It's been an interesting year for the fusion community. The siting of ITER has dragged on far longer than we all would have <b>liked</b> and <b>it</b> isn't <b>at</b> <b>all</b> clear how <b>it</b> will be resolved. I {{have to believe that}} it will get worked out somehow, as the stakeholders will ultimately realize that it is critical that they find some way to get the device built. Meanwhile we all sit back and wait (and speculate!). In more concrete news, the US has chosen a partnership of PPPL and ORNL to host the US ITER Project Office; further members of the multi-institutional team will be selected competitively. The US ITER Project Office will be at PPPL and the effort will be led by Dr. Ned Sauthoff. The Office will be responsible for project management of the US activities supporting the construction of ITER. See Sauthoff’s article {{for more information on the}} US contributions to ITER. With regard to the Fusion Energy Division, things are going pretty well. We have had a relatively steady bank balance for years and that should continue as we expect a generous income from the recent Topical Meeting. These funds are typically used for awards and for helping students travel to meetings, including ANS National meetings, our Topicals, and the ANS student conferences. We have a slowly increasing membership in the Division and have done well in the recent ANS Division assessment efforts. In an attempt to increase our involvement in ANS National Meetings, we have begun to pursue joint sessions with other Divisions. We are planning on two joint sessions with the Radiatio...|$|R
