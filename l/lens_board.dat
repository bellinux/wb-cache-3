50|$|A <b>Lens</b> <b>board</b> (commonly spelled as lensboard) is a {{photographic}} part used for securing a lens {{to the front}} standard of a large format view camera. The <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> itself is usually flat, square, and made of metal (most commonly Aluminum) or wood and sometimes plastic. The <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> will have a hole of various diameters drilled dead center on the board. A <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> typically varies between 1 and 4 millimeters in thickness. The overall {{size and shape of}} the <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> depends on the brand of camera and film format used. Some cameras will use 2 to 4 screws to secure the <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> to the front standard of the view camera, most commonly however, the <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> will be secured by one or more locking levers or tabs to allow tool-less removal of the <b>lens</b> <b>board.</b> The rear surface of a <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> is usually painted matte black to keep light entering the camera through the lens during exposure from reflecting off the surface and interfering with the projected image.|$|E

50|$|Classical view camera.Designed for studio photography, it has full {{micrometric}} movements. All {{the parts}} related to lenses and backs are interchangeable. The <b>lenses</b> are on <b>board</b> or on bayonet, le <b>lens</b> <b>boards</b> are flat or recessed, the lenses {{have no need}} of helical focusing mount. The backs and their accessories are {{in common with the}} Bicam system. The bellows is interchangeable. The peculiarity of the S5 micron is to be built on two separate shifting blocks that do not interfere between them allowing the two standards to get to touching. This characteristic make it possible to use extreme wide angle lenses and to perform adjustment movements otherwise impossible. The S5 camera was published in the ADI Index 2005 for the industrial design award the Compasso d'oro.|$|R
50|$|The S4 {{camera was}} {{designed}} later {{to answer the}} need of full coverage of the 4x5 inches format, where the SLV camera could not give enough versatility with this format. Standard 4x5 inches back with format adapters for 6x9 and 6x12, interchangeable backs with short rotation attachment 8° and bayonet attachment or interchangeable <b>lens</b> <b>boards</b> for the <b>lenses.</b> Large in dimension, it is later on provided with a front bellows (Flexibellow) that performs the lens focusing, tilting and swinging. With this accessory the lenses can be used without focusing mount and permitted the focus extension on the two orthogonal axis by using the lens tilting and swinging. The S4 camera is still in production.|$|R

50|$|The Fuji GX680 is {{a single}} lens reflex system camera for medium format film {{produced}} by Fujifilm with interchangeable camera lenses and interchangeable film holders for the unusual film format 6x8cm on 60mm roll film type 120 and 220. One highlight is the mounting of the lens on a <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> running on a rail connecting lens and camera body by a bellows like a view camera. In contrast to related medium-format-cameras of other makers, e.g. Mamiya RB67 and RZ67 and Rolleiflex SL66, the <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> can be shifted right, left, up and down for perspective control, the <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> can also be tilted on horizontal and vertical axis for control of depth of field using the Scheimpflug principle. Therefore the Fuji GX680 has the optical skills of a large format camera, only limited by restricted movability of the <b>lens</b> <b>board,</b> enabling the camera also for architectural photography. The Fuji GX680 has quite large physical dimensions for a medium-format-camera, but compared to studio-large-format-cameras the Fuji GX680 is a somewhat more compact model. Although the Fuji GX680 was designed for studio-work due to its size and weight, a neck-strap was offered for mobile work.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the size}} and focal length of a {{particular}} lens, a certain diameter of hole must be drilled {{in the center of}} the <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> to accommodate the shutter assembly [...] Lens boards are typically available pre-drilled by the camera manufacturer, however, if no replacement <b>lens</b> <b>board</b> is available from a camera manufacturer, then one must be custom fabricated by a machinist. Nowadays, nearly all large format leaf shutters are manufactured by the Nidec Copal Corporation, therefore the diameter of hole drilled is commonly referred to as the ‘Copal Number’.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the performance effect of prestigious directors is ambiguous. Our study addresses this issue by integrating the theoretical <b>lens</b> of <b>board</b> capital and the institutional perspective. We argue that prestigious directors can bring benefits as well as costs. We claim that the emergence of these costs depends on the institutional context, specifically the institutional characteristics of the country 2 ̆ 7 s corporate elite circle which {{is characterized by the}} elite cohesion and the elite exclusiveness. Our empirical results with a 15 -country sample covering the period of 2005 to 2014 provide evidence for the overall existence of a positive performance effect of prestigious boards. However, our results also indicate that these beneficial effects of prestigious boards are mitigated in countries with high elite exclusiveness. Hence, under these certain institutional conditions, the elite-favouring behaviour of prestigious directors also brings costs...|$|R

40|$|General {{relativity}} and {{quantum mechanics}} predict phenomena on very different scales. Several models predict a decoherence like effect due to gravity. A recent advance {{based on the}} event formalism predicts a nonlinear quantum effect that can only be observed using entangled systems. We present a detailed mission proposal to measure this gravitational decoherence using an Optical Ground Station (OGS) and the International Space Station (ISS). Using time-energy entangled photon pairs form a Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion source, shows that the gravitational decoherence effect will result in a loss of correlation in the arrival times of the photons from a pair. Our experimentally feasible scheme utilizes the NightPod and the 400 mm telephoto <b>lens</b> already on <b>board</b> the ISS. Using proof of principle experiments on a 144 km free-space optical link as well as calculations, we study the effect of losses, background noise, pointing errors, orbital motion and atmospheric effects. Further, our experimental scheme is ideal for ground to space quantum communication and testing other aspects of fundamental quantum mechanics, like Bell tests, over unprecedented length scales which are inaccessible on the ground.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, {{and the amount of}} invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003 - 2005 time period, and after classifying 4, 408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that {{examines the}} economic determinants of board structure (Boone "et al. ", 2007; Coles "et al. ", 2005; Gillan "et al. ", 2003; Linck "et al.

40|$|As {{the term}} "bureaucracy" has {{acquired}} increasingly negative connotations, one important {{set of problems}} concerning both scholars and policy makers interested {{in the public sector}} relates to incentives and institutions that are conducive to good performance. Recent developments in agency and contract theory shed some new light on old questions about public sector performance, of which I address three in this dissertation. The first question {{has to do with the}} manner in which institutional design in general, and decision rights allocations in particular, affect performance. The second has to do with the design of boards of governance in semi-autonomous, corporatized public agencies and how that affects incentives for performance. The third question has to do with incentives that drive innovation in the public sector, and encourage managers to create value in their work. I address the first two questions in empirical papers drawing on the recent experience in public hospital reform in Lebanon. In one paper, I develop a framework that analyzes decision rights evolutions in an innovative, quasi-legally corporatized public hospital. In another, I use the multi-tasking common agency model as an analytical <b>lens</b> to understand <b>board</b> member (principal) appointments and decision rights on corporatized hospital boards. I draw lessons from these two papers for the reform of the public hospital corporatization law in Lebanon.

The top-to-bottom motion of the focal plane shutter exposed the upper portion of the film first (i.e., the bottom of the inverted image as seen at the focal plane), so many photographs of automobile racing taken with Speed Graphics depicted the wheels of cars in an oval shape leaning forward.
