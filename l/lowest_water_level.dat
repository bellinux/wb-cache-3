In this study, wetland ET was estimated with MODIS data and meteorological data. The wetland ET partitioning and its relationship with abnormally <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> were analyzed for 2000 – 2013. The results showed that the water evaporation rate (Ewater) was larger than the land ET rate (ETland); the ETland/Ewater ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 99. When the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> was below 12. 8 [*]m, the ET partition ratio was larger than 1, which indicates that wetland ET comes from land surface ET more than water evaporation. The negative standardized <b>water</b> <b>level</b> index (SWI) was used to represent an abnormally <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in the wetland. Although the monthly wetland ET decreased as the negative SWI decreased, ETland was higher than the average under negative SWI conditions from September to December, when the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> decreased.

During the recent drought experienced in California, the water levels have been declining from the period of 2011 to 2015. This {{is due to the}} decreased amount of precipitation and snowpack melt water received in the Mokelumne River. The drought caused the water levels to reach low levels in late 2015.The month showing the <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> was August, 2015 with the water volume in the reservoir decreasing to 81940 AF, approximately 19.6% of the reservoirs maximum capacity.

50|$|The {{variable}} {{water level}} has also caused other recent {{changes to the}} lake. At the time of <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in the late 1970s, the lake's largest island, Spruce Island, was connected by dry land to the mainland, and a large gravel bar in the lake's north basin was exposed. Now, however, the land corridor to Spruce Island is bisected by a stretch of marsh. The gravel bar has similarly been resubmerged, becoming a hazard to boating and unfortunately extirpating the colony of common terns and herring gulls that bred there. These two species are no longer commonly seen on the lake now that their breeding site has drowned, but the recent rise in water level is to the apparent benefit of the lake's common loon, red-necked grebe, and beaver populations. Ducks are also thriving in the stretches of now-flooded shoreline. And fish catches have improved markedly since the low water days of the late 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Detention dams are {{constructed}} for multiple purposes including: flood control, flow rate restriction, subsurface water replenishment, and sediment trapping. Detention dams {{are used in}} flood prone areas for flood control. A detention dam is built at an elevation above the flood prone zone. Flood water is collected in the basin above the dam and released at a flow rate the flood zone and channel can accommodate. Channels can include dikes, canals, streams, drain pipes, and rivers. The basin above a flood detention dam should remain at the <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> {{in order to prevent}} overtopping. Overtopping is when the water level behind the dam exceeds the dam crest height. The dam crest is the top edge of the dam. Overtopping is caused by extreme flooding or severe waves. The severe waves can be a result of high winds, landslides, and earthquakes. The detention dam design must take into account the probability of overtopping occurring and be designed accordingly. Detention dams built to restrict flow rate regulate the amount water released into channels. Detentions dams used to replenishment the subsurface water or groundwater hold surface runoff to allow the ground to absorb the water. Groundwater is water that has drained into an aquifer due to the force of gravity. An aquifer is layers of permeable soils and rocks below the earth's surface that allow water to accumulated between the rocks and soils. Debris dams are a type of detention dam used to collect sediment to prevent it from flowing into areas where large sediment buildup may be damaging.|$|E

5000|$|The dam {{construction}} involves {{building of}} a 1.5 m thick concrete diaphragm wall up to depths from 40 to 120 m below the river bed under the earth dam which is {{first of its kind}} in India. The purpose of diaphragm wall is to secure the river bed stability for withstanding the water pressure across the dam. The project would constitute an earth-cum-rock fill dam of 2310 m length, spillway of 907 m with 44 vents to enable discharge of [...] of water. The spillway is located on the right bank of the river for which nearly 5.5 km long and 1.0 km wide approach and spill channels up to river bed level is envisaged involving nearly 70 million cubic meters earth/rock excavation which is nearly 2/3rd of the project's total earth work. The maximum flood level at Polavaram is 28 m MSL and <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is 10.9 m MSL. Two cofferdams are planned, one up to 41 m MSL, to facilitate faster pace of work on earth-cum-rock fill dam to complete {{the first phase of the}} project by June 2018. With coffer dams inclusion and the bed level of the approach and discharge canals of the spillway increased to 17 m MSL, the spillway related rock excavation is reduced by 70% leading to substantial cost reduction in the project's head works cost. Ultimately, the cofferdams would become peripheral portion of the main earth-cum-rock fill dam. On the left side of the river, 12 water turbines, each having 80 megawatt capacity, were to be installed. The right canal connecting to Krishna River in the upstream of Prakasam Barrage (173 km long) discharges [...] at head works and left canal (182 km long) discharges [...] of water.|$|E

There are about 11 year periods of high and low water level stands (Jaani, 1973). After the great flood of 1924, the first serious steps were taken to lower the water level of the lake through improving the outflow conditions at the head of the Narva River.
