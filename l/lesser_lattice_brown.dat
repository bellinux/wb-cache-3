40|$|Highly {{oriented}} $SrMoO_ 3 $ {{thin films}} have been fabricated by pulsed laser deposition of $SrMoO_ 4 $ in hydrogen. The films {{are found to}} grow along the (1 0 0) direction on $LaAlO_ 3 $ (1 0 0) and $SrTiO_ 3 $ (1 0 0) substrates. The method has been extended for the fabrication of oxynitride thin films, using ammonia as the reducing medium. The resistivity measurements show nonlinear temperature dependent $(T^n) $ behaviour in the temperature interval of 10 – 300 K. The conduction mechanism is largely affected by the strain due to the substrate lattice. A combination of $T$ and $T^ 2 $ dependence of resistivity on temperature is observed for films having <b>lesser</b> <b>lattice</b> mismatch with the substrate. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies confirm the formation of $SrMoO_ 3 $ and $SrMoO_{ 3 -x}N_x$ films...|$|R
25|$|At {{least two}} covered bridges make {{the claim of}} being the first built in the United States. Town records for Swanzey, New Hampshire, {{indicate}} their Carleton Bridge was built in 1789, but this remains unverified. Philadelphia, however, claims a bridge built in the early 1800s on 30th Street and over the Schuylkill River was the first, noting that investors wanted it covered to extend its life. Beginning around 1820, new designs were developed, such as the Burr, <b>Lattice,</b> and <b>Brown</b> trusses.|$|R
40|$|The {{latent heat}} (L) {{associated}} with the orbital order-disorder transition at T_JT is found to depend significantly on the average particle size (d) of LaMnO 3. It rises slowly with the decrease in d down to ~ 100 nm and then jumps by more than {{an order of magnitude}} in between d ~ 100 nm and ~ 30 nm. Finally, L falls sharply to zero at a critical particle size d_c ~ 19 nm. The transition temperature T_JT also exhibits an almost similar trend of variation with the particle size, near d ~ 30 nm and below, even though the extent of variation is relatively small. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization versus temperature study over a temperature range 10 - 300 K reveals that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature decreases with d while the temperature range, over which the ZFC and FC data diverge, increases with the drop in d. The FC magnetization also is found to increase sharply with the drop in particle size. A conjecture of nonmonotonic variation in orbital domain structure with decrease in particle size - from smaller domains with large number of boundaries to larger domains with small number of boundaries due to <b>lesser</b> <b>lattice</b> defects and, finally, down to even finer domain structures with higher degree of metastability - along with increase in surface area in core-shell structure, could possibly rationalize the observed L versus d and T_JT versus d patterns. Transmission electron microscopy data provide evidence for presence of core-shell structure as well as for increase in lattice defects in finer particles.

Bubble lattices were observed to form between − 100 and 100 °C, but at 200 °C lattice formation was impeded by continued growth and agglomeration of bubbles.

40|$|The world 2 ̆ 7 s oldest sediments {{occur in}} {{high-grade}} terrains that were recrystallised during polyphase amphibolite to granulite metamorphism (3 ̆e 500 °C) accompanied by intense ductile deformation, during which, open system behaviour can corrupt any biogenic carbon-isotopic signatures. A 13 C-depleted signature from apatites in the Akilia BIF (quartz + magnetite + pyroxene ± garnet), was reported as strong evidence for oldest life. Specifically, this signature {{was attributed to}} reduced C inclusions (now graphite), regarded as protected in the apatite crystals since deposition/diagenesis (Mojzsis, S. J., Arrhenius, G., McKeegan, K. D., Harrison, T. M., Nutman, A. P., Friend, C. R. L., 1996. Evidence for life on Earth before 3, 800 million years ago. Nature, 384, 55 - 59). Neither Lepland et al. (Lepland, A., van Zuilen, M. A., Arrhenius, G., Whitehouse, M. J., Fedo, C. M., 2005. Questioning the evidence for Earth 2 ̆ 7 s earliest life-Akilia revisited. Geology, 33, 77 - 79.) nor us have found these graphite inclusions. Instead, infrared absorbance spectroscopy shows that carbon occurs in Akilia apatites as carbonate substituting at phosphate and to a <b>lesser</b> degree hydroxyl <b>lattice</b> sites. Furthermore, although Isua and Akilia BIF have similar whole rock REE patterns, compared with Isua BIF apatites the REE patterns for Akilia apatites show depletion of the heavy versus light REE. This {{can be explained by}} the Akilia apatites having equilibrated with garnet, strongly suggesting that the Akilia apatites are metamorphic in origin. More detailed evidence is required to support the previous proposal that Akilia metasediments host the evidence for Earth 2 ̆ 7 s oldest life via 13 C-depleted graphite inclusions protected within apatite since the pre-metamorphic history of the rock. © 2006 Elsevier B.
