40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} the degree of public {{attention}} influences the price <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> in a systematic way. We employ a simple discounted cash flow model with adverse selection and fixed transaction costs that determine an endogenous bid-ask-spread. In the model, rational and risk neutral investors incorporate future trading conditions into their price setting behavior. These trading conditions are driven by the degree of public attention and entail an attention-dependent impact of the bid-ask-spread on required gross returns. Specifically, given a high level of public attention a higher bid-ask-spread may negatively affect required asset returns. We argue that the model implications are consistent with empirical findings, i. e. size, bookto-market, and the momentum effect...|$|E

Market inversions in nearby spreads rarely occur during early months of the crop year since stocks are usually abundant after harvest.

Simulations are conducted to determine whether a market inversion is a signal to sell the stocks. The results of the paired-difference tests reveal that as the crop cycle advances towards the end of the crop year, market inversions clearly reflect the market's signal to release stocks in anticipation of new crop supplies. The regressions of actual returns to storage on predicted returns to storage clearly show that a market inversion is a signal to sell. The results support the behavioral finance hypothesis that producers are choosing to hold excess stocks because of some type of biased expectations. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E

40|$|The {{flexible}} accelerator {{concept has}} provided {{the rationale for the}} regression equations used in several recent econometric studies of inventory behavior. In such a model a desired (or equilibrium) level of inventories is defined, but because of costs involved in changing the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> only a partial adjustment of inventories to their desired level is achieved in any time period. This leads to the familiar decision rule in which current inventory is a linear function of the previous period 2 ̆ 7 s stock plus a variable or set of variables representing current demand. The purpose of this note is to question whether there are any significant costs specifically associated with changing the level of inventories other than those directly associated with changes in the level of production which may (or may not) be required to bring about the necessary stock adjustment. If none exist, it is shown that a given time pattern of demand can lead a firm which acts according to the flexible accelerator to behave 2 ̆ 2 irrationally 2 ̆ 2 and incur unnecessary costs.

40|$|The {{problem is}} to {{determine}} a review period and stocking policy that are mutually bene®cial to a producer and a retailer. In our model, the retailer uses a periodic review, base stock policy for ordering the item from the producer's Distribution Center (DC). Excess customer demand {{is assumed to be}} lost. A make-to-order production system supplies to the DC. We show that given a review period, unless the manufacturer agrees to share the cost of carrying a fraction of the safety stocks at the retailer, the two will not agree upon the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> to be carried in the store. We prove that there is an equilibrium value for this fraction, such that the retailer and the manufacturer are always in agreement with regard to the stocking level. We then show that complete coordination on the stocking level as well as the review period can be achieved solely through carrying out negotiations on credit terms. These theoretical results are used to construct an algorithm for calculating the optimal policy parameters for a supply chain. As part of the analysis we suggest a modi®cation of the base stock policy for the positive lag lost sales case of periodic review inventory models that consistently outperforms the base stock policy in our numerical studies. 1...|$|E

Management of spare parts {{is seen as an}} important criterion to ensure the efficiency of scheduled maintenance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the contributors of spare parts management and investigate the relationship between these contributors and maintenance cost performance. Design/methodology/approach - This research adopted a quantitative approach, which utilised questionnaire surveys to study the relationship between the contributors of spare parts management and maintenance cost performance. The data were analysed through descriptive analysis, correlation, and regression analysis. Additionally, a case study was examined to validate the results obtained from the survey. Findings - The results of this research demonstrated that the quality of spare parts (QSP), budget allocation for acquisition of spare parts, and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> were significantly correlated to the maintenance cost variance (MCV). Moreover, the results of the regression analysis indicated that the QSP was the significant predictor of MCV. Originality/value - This research highlights the importance of spare parts management in building maintenance. It recommends that maintenance management set up a spare parts management department for updating stocks frequently. Meanwhile, the management should avoid ad-hoc acquisition of spare parts, as this is always more expensive. The management should also select spare parts based on quality instead of lowest cost. In addition, building managers should also apply the developed regression model in practice to predict and improve maintenance performance...|$|E
