Propane (C3H8) is however easily liquefied, and exists in 'propane bottles' mostly as a <b>liquid.</b> <b>Butane</b> (C4H10) is so easily liquefied {{that it provides}} a safe, volatile fuel for small pocket lighters. Pentane (C5H12) is a clear liquid at room temperature, commonly used in chemistry and industry as a powerful nearly odorless solvent of waxes and high molecular weight organic compounds, including greases.

At the opposite extreme from methane lie the heavy tars that remain as the lowest fraction in a crude oil refining retort.

40|$|Many {{advanced}} {{fine coal}} cleaning technologies {{have been developed}} in recent years {{under the auspices of}} the U. S. Department of Energy. However, they are not as widely deployed in industry as originally anticipated. An important reason for this problem is that the cleaned coal product is difficult to dewater because of the large surface area associated with fine particles. Typically, mechanical dewatering, such as vacuum filtration and centrifugation, can reduce the moisture to 20 - 35 % level, while thermal drying is costly. To address this important industrial problem, Virginia Tech has developed a novel dewatering process, in which water is displaced from the surface of fine particulate materials by <b>liquid</b> <b>butane.</b> Since the process is driven by the hydrophobic interaction between coal and <b>liquid</b> <b>butane,</b> it was referred to as hydrophobic dewatering (HD). A fine coal sample with 21. 4 pm median size was subjected to a series of bench-scale HD tests. It was a mid-vol bituminous coal obtained from the Microcel flotation columns operating at the Middle Fork coal preparation plant, Virginia. All of the test results showed that the HD process can reduce the moisture to substantially less than 10 %. The process is sensitive to the amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> used in the process relative to the solids concentration in the feed stream. Neither the intensity nor the time of agitation is critical for the process. Also, the process does not require long time for phase separation. Under optimal operating conditions, the moisture of the fine coal can be reduced to 1 % by weight of coal...|$|E

It is very difficult to distinguish between individual the contributions, especially because the pores have no uniform pore diameter. Two basic types of experiments were made to study the transport mechanisms of a condensable gas (butane) through a Vycor membrane: steady state permeation and measurements of liquid flux. Steady state experiments enable to study butane transport for different concentration profiles in the pores. Measurements of liquid flux are indispensable for the verification of the presence of condensate in pores during gas permeation. Differences between the <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> flux (on high pressure side of membrane is liquid, on opposite side is gas) and the gas flux (at both sides butane is in the gas phase) for the same pressure gradients across the membrane were observed.

For a pressure gradient higher than 2 bars (<b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> P 1 = 2. 25 bar; P 2 = 0 bar, gas butane P 1 = 2. 24 bar; P 2 = 0 bar) the flux of the <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> is approximately 2 times higher.

40|$|The {{transport}} and the separation efficiency in porous membranes can be {{strongly influenced by}} the condensation of permeating gases. An accurate experimental monitoring of permeating vapors and condensates in small pores of membranes is very desirable. The dynamic permeation method {{is one of the}} methods which can be used to perform a corresponding study. The following experimental arrangement was applied: a constant higher pressure P 1 was set on an open side of the membrane; on the opposite closed side the change of a lower pressure P 2 was measured. The dynamic permeation set-up was used at first in transport measurements of a noncondensable gas through a Vycor glass membrane (mean pore radius around 2 nm). The obtained data were compared with the results of alternatively performed steady state permeation measurements. Subsequently, the permeability was studied for the condensable gas butane through the Vycor glass membrane, particularly for elevator pressure conditions near the saturated vapor pressure. Also for this purpose the dynamic permeation experiment was found to be very convenient. It enables to measure the mass transport for very small pressure gradients across the membrane. The permeation results obtained correspond well with the <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> permeability of Vycor membrane quantified previously in independent pervaporation experiments.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{focus of}} this project was to {{investigate}} the working of a liquefied gas micro satellite thruster. An introduction is given in which the significance of the project in relation to the literature is stated. The objectives of the project are also stated. In the literature survey the historical development and design specifications of some relevant thruster systems is discussed. An experimental model was designed and built to test the working of a thruster system. Attention is also given to the measurement and calibration techniques used to obtain experimental data. A computer program was written to simulate the thruster system. The experimental set-up was designed so that an accumulator could be charged with <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> from a storage tank. The accumulator was charged with 13 ml of <b>liquid</b> <b>butane,</b> which was heated and then exhausted through a nozzle. Copper mesh was placed in the accumulator to improve the heat transfer to the butane vapour before it was exhausted through the nozzle. A cantilever beam was used to measure the thrust of the system. The system was tested under atmospheric conditions of 100 000 Pa as well as under vacuum conditions of 20 Pa. Two nozzles were also tested: nozzle- 1 with a throat diameter of 1 mm and an exit diameter of 5 mm and nozzle- 2 with a throat diameter of 1 mm and an exit diameter of 1. 6 mm. A computer program was written to simulate the flow of the butane vapour through the nozzle, as well as the complex two-phase behaviour of the butane in the accumulator. Traditional gas dynamic theory was used to model the flow through the nozzle. The transient behaviour of the system was modelled to predict the rate of liquid to vapour mass transfer in the accumulator. Additionally, the computer program was developed to simulate the system with copper mesh placed in the accumulator. From the experimental results it was shown that the addition of copper mesh in the accumulator improved the total thrust achieved with a 13 ml charge of <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> by more than 50 %. Under atmospheric conditions shockwaves were present in both of the two nozzles tested. Nozzle- 2 showed an increase of 91 % in the total thrust achieved over a 5 second burst compared to the total thrust achieved using nozzle- 1. With no copper mesh in the accumulator and using nozzle- 1 a peak thrust of 39 mN was achieved under atmospheric conditions while under vacuum conditions a peak thrust of 495 mN was achieved. This resulted in a total thrust of 0. 365 Ns under atmospheric conditions and 4. 88 Ns under vacuum conditions with a 13 ml charge of <b>liquid</b> <b>butane.</b> Using the total thrust achieved the specific impulse of the system was calculated as 5 seconds under atmospheric conditions and 67. 5 seconds under vacuum conditions with no mesh in the accumulator and using nozzle- 1. The theoretical model compared well with the experimental results except when nozzle- 1 was modelled under atmospheric conditions. Under vacuum conditions the results obtained from the theoretical model compared well with the experimental results using both of the nozzles. In the modelling of the mesh in the accumulator an overall heat transfer factor was incorporated into the model {{to take into account the}} uncertainty of the heat transfer area as well as the overall heat transfer coefficient. The theoretical model and experimental test results are discussed and thereafter conclusions are also drawn. There are also recommendations made for future work that could be done in the further development of a liquefied gas micro satellite thruster system. It is recommended that a “resistojet” type thruster should be tested at the University of Stellenbosch and that further testing be done with mesh in the accumulator to find the optimum amount of mesh that should be placed in the accumulator...|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{propulsion}} systems are typically complex and costly, and require extensive {{ground support equipment}} and personnel to implement. While these systems may be feasible for large commercial or government programs to execute, they are impractical for micro- and nano-satellite systems. In particular, these small spacecraft cannot utilize classical hazardous or high-pressure components, as small satellites are often hosted as secondary payloads with stringent restrictions imposed. In contrast to this paradigm, an effort to develop, manufacture, and validate a low-cost propulsion system suitable for small, secondary payloads was pursued. Intended for orbit insertion, stationkeeping, and de-orbit operations, this system was developed to operate within the typical constraints of a small satellite. In addition to the aforementioned cost and safety concerns, small satellites possess limited mass, volume, and electrical power. Given these considerations, a straightforward warm gas system was chosen, with <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> as propellant. This configuration is not only inherently simple, but can also be manufactured using primarily off-theshelf components, which can be quickly procured in small quantities.

40|$|In an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} transient processes that occur when a single droplet of butane at the superheat limit vaporizes explosively, short-exposure photographs and fast-response pressure measurements {{have been used to}} construct a description of the complete explosion process. It is observed that only a single bubble forms within the drop during each explosion, and that the growth proceeds on a microsecond time scale. An interfacial instability driven by rapid evaporation has been observed {{on the surface of the}} bubbles. It is suggested that the Landau mechanism of instability, originally described in connection with the instability of laminar flames, also applies to rapid evaporation at the superheat limit. The photographic evidence and the pressure data are used to estimate the evaporative mass flux across the liquid-vapour interface after the onset of instability. The;ate of evaporation is shown to be two orders of magnitude greater than would be predicted by conventional bubble-growth theories that do not account for the effects of instability. An estimate of the mean density within the bubbles during the evaporative stage indicates that it is more than one half of the critical density of butane. Additional interesting dynamical effects that are observed include a series of toroidal waves that form on the interface between the butane vapour and the external host liquid in the bubble column apparatus after the bubble has grown large enough to contact the outer edge of the drop, and violent oscillations of the bubble that occur on a millisecond time scale, after evaporation of the <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> is complete, that cause the disintegration of the bubble into a cloud of tiny bubbles by Rayleigh-Taylor instability...|$|E

Digitally Filtered Molecular Dynamics (DFMD) applies the well-established theory of digital filters to molecular dynamics simulations, enabling atomic motion to be enhanced or suppressed in a selective manner {{solely on the basis of}} frequency. The basic theory of digital filters and its application to molecular dynamics simulations is presented, together with the application of DFMD to the simple systems of single molecules of water and butane. The extension of the basic theory to the condensed phase is then described followed by its application to <b>liquid</b> phase <b>butane</b> and the Syrian hamster prion protein. The high degree of selectivity and control offered by DFMD, and its ability to enhance the rate of conformational change in butane and in the prion protein, is demonstrated. The DFMD method is then modified and extended to become Reversible Digitally Filtered Molecular Dynamics (RDFMD). The RDFMD method improves the degree of control possible over that of DFMD. DFMD is applied to gas-phase pentane, alanine dipeptide, solvated alanine dipeptide and the pentapeptide YPGDV. In all four systems, RDFMD was able to enhance the rate of conformational change via reasonable transition paths. Finally, the new method of the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is described and applied to the analysis of conformational transitions. The HHT is shown to provide clear indications of the changes in energy and frequency during conformational transitions. <br/...|$|R

A literature survey confirmed the desirability of establishing such a process with emphasis on the decortication, size, reduction, detoxification-deallergenization, and solvent·extraction operations.

The degree of dehulling varied according to the pressure applied {{and the size of}} the beans. Some of the batches were difficult-to-hull, and this phenomenon was investigated using the scanning electron microscope and by thickness and compressive strength measurements. The other variables studied to lesser degrees included residence time, moisture, content, and temperature. The method was successfully extended to cocoa beans, and (with modifications) to peanuts. The possibility of continuous operation was looked into, and a mechanism was suggested to explain the method works.

40|$|Natural gas liquid (NGL), {{a mixture}} {{consisting}} primarily of ethane, propane, and butane, {{is an excellent}} enhanced oil recovery (EOR) solvent. However, NGL is typically about ten times less viscous than the crude oil within the carbonate or sandstone porous media, which causes the NGL to finger through the rock toward production wells resulting in low volumetric sweep efficiency of the NGL solvent. In this work, targeted thickeners are broadly classified into two categories, polymeric thickener and small associative molecule thickener. In either case, the resultant thickened ethane, propane or butane solution {{is expected to be}} thermodynamically stable, transparent, and capable of flowing through the pore throats (1 micron) of sandstone or carbonate rock. In the category of polymeric thickeners, a dilute concentration of a drag-reducing agent (DRA) poly(α-olefin) that has an average molecular weight greater than 20, 000, 000 was proposed as a thickener for <b>liquid</b> <b>butane,</b> liquid propane and liquid or supercritical ethane. High molecular weight polydimethyl siloxane polymer (molecular weight of 1, 000, 000) and polyisobutylene (PIB) (molecular weight 10, 000, 000) were also assessed as potential thickeners for NGLs. Phase behavior data (cloud points) and viscosity induced by these polymeric thickeners were obtained as a function of temperature, pressure and concentration. Results indicate that butane is the most effective NGL component at both dissolving the polymer and expanding the polymer coils. In general, viscosity enhancement increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure, reflective of increased NGL solvent strength at low temperature and high pressure. Only the DRA induced significant viscosity changes for NGL at dilute polymer concentrations. To the best of my knowledge, the DRA-alkane mixture data presented in this thesis represent the most significant polymer-induced increases in viscosity reported to date for butane and propane and the first report of thickening ethane. Three types of small associating molecule thickeners were considered; trialkyltin fluoride, aluminum di-soaps, and crosslinked phosphate esters. Phase behavior (cloud point) and viscosity data were obtained as a function of temperature, pressure and concentration. The crosslinked phosphate ester mixture was difficult to dissolve completely in NGL and induced very modest viscosity changes, especially for ethane. Hydroxyaluminum di(2 -ethyl hexanoate) was insoluble in ethane, but was the best thickener for propane and butane at temperatures above 40 oC. However, the hydroxyaluminum di(2 -ethyl hexanoate) mixtures required heating to 100 oC to attain dissolution prior to cooling to the temperature of interest. Tributyltin fluoride was a remarkable thickener for ethane, propane and butane that did not require heating for dissolution. To the best of my knowledge, these tributyltin fluoride-ethane mixture results represent the first report of thickening ethane with a small associating molecule...|$|E

By mixing MeOH and MEG together, a freeze out temperature lower than the freezing point of the components themselves will be experienced.

Two different CPA-EoS was evaluated for solubility calculations: CPA-DTU and CPA-NeqSim.

Four different process solutions has been performed and evaluated in HYSYS using the CPA-DTU. Two processes were designed for production of sales gas, where one processes had an initial CO 2 content of 2 mole %, and the other 15 mole % CO 2. Flow rate of gas was 20 MSm 3 /d. The first process included an extraction process for dew point control of the gas, with injection of a MeOH-MEG mixture to avoid freeze out and hydrate formation. A fractionation process was also included, making <b>liquid</b> propane, <b>butane</b> and naphta. The second process was expanded with an absorption process downstream the extraction process for removal of CO 2 from 15 mole % to 2, 5 mole %. A MeOH-MEG-water mixture was used as physical solvent in the absorption process. A case study was performed on the two cases, {{to see if it was}} possible to achieve LNG-specifications for water, CO 2 and HHC by using a MeOH-MEG mixture. A cascade process was implemented for liquefaction of the natural gas and for process integration with the extraction process and the absorption process. Results from the simulations performed in HYSYS show that the mixture achieves LNG specifications for water and HHC of 1 ppm and 1000 ppm, repectively. This is achieved in an extraction process using an expander, where injection of MeOH-MEG is used for prevention of freeze out and hydrate formation. An absorption process is installed downstream the extraction process for removal of CO 2 from 15 mole % to 2, 5 mole %. A case study was performed to evaluate if a MeOH-MEG-water mixture could reach CO 2 specifications of 50 ppm in a physical absorption process. It was clearly stated that unfeasible circulation rates was necessary with the operating temperatures and pressures chosen in this thesis. An adsorption process was therefore installed downstream the absorption process for deep removal of CO 2 to 50 ppm. After have met all specifications regarding water, CO 2 and HHC, the natural gas was liquefied in a convential cascade process using pure refrigerants. The cascade process was integrated with the extraction and absorption process and proved to reduce the power consumption of the absorption process with 50 %, for the case with 15 mole % CO 2. This thesis indicates that the biggest potential for a MeOH-MEG mixture lays in processing of gas for sales gas. For a CO 2 content of 2 mole %, a simple extraction process with injection of MeOH-MEG was used to achieve low water and HC dew point of the gas. For a CO 2 content of 15 mole % an absorption process using a MeOH-MEG-water mixture as physical solvent was used to achieve a CO 2 content of 2, 5 mole % in the sales gas. However; high losses of MeOH are indicated for the extraction process, and as much as 0, 53 Sm 3 /h is lost. The loss of MeOH in the absorption process is calculated to 0, 02 %, and make up of MeOH is therefore needed for both the extraction and absorption process. The absorption process is operating with a circulation of 5047 Sm 3 /h, consisting of a MeOH-MEG-water mixture. Loss of methane is calculated to 1, 4 % and total power consumption is 20 MW. Over 40 % of the MeOH lost in the extraction process follows the propane product in the fractionation process. Specification for MeOH in propane is therefore not achived, and also CO 2 content in propane exceeds the specifications. This indicates that the process needs further optimization to achieve all specifications related to NGL and condensate for natural gas. Evaluating other mixtures like MEG-TEG could be interesting to reduce the loss of solvent in the extraction process, and achieve these specifications. &# 8195; </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} experimental {{investigation of}} the vapor explosion of a single droplet (1 mm diameter) of <b>liquid</b> <b>butane</b> at the superheat limit has been completed. These experiments provided the first detailed look at rapid evaporation taking place under conditions such that departures from equilibrium, evaporative fluxes and fluid accelerations are orders of magnitude larger than observed under ordinary circumstances. Single short-exposure photographs and fast-response pressure measurements were used to obtain {{a description of the}} complete explosion process within a superheated drop immersed in a bubble-column apparatus. Emphasis was placed on the early (microsecond-time-scale) evaporative stage. Despite the apparant simplicity of the vapor explosion of a single superheated droplet, the present experiments revealed a wide range of phenomina of varying complexity occurring at different stages of the explosion. The explosion is initiated by the spontaneous formation within the drop of a single vapor bubble, which grows until the drop liquid is completely evaporated. The resulting vapor bubble undergoes volume oscillations and eventually breaks up via Taylor instability. Several new and unusual features of the early evaporative stage of the explosion have been observed, three of which are remarkably repeatable. First, photographs of the evaporative surface show a highly roughened and disturbed interface for most of the evaporative stage. At the earliest observed times (8 [mu]sec) the roughening appears to begin as a rather regular pattern on an otherwise spherical surface, suggestive of a fundamental instability due to evaporative mass flux. Second, due to the asymmetric location of the initial nucleus within the drop, a portion of the evaporating surface contacts the surrounding fluid first and becomes nonevaporating. As the bubble grows, a unique, axisymmetric structure of circumferential waves terminated by a spherical cap appears on this nonevaporating surface. Apparently, these waves are driven by the impinging jet of vapor coming from the opposing evaporating surface. Third, nucleation and initial development of the bubble in the first 10 [mu]sec is accompanied by a characteristic two-step pulsating pressure signal, suggesting that a fundamental and repeatable unsteadiness, perhaps connected with the above mentioned instability, is taking place at this stage. A preliminary estimation of the evaporative mass flux has been made from photographically-determined bubble volumes and pressure signals measured in the first 30 [mu]sec. As might have been expected in view of our observations of the highly roughened surface, the inferred mass flux (400 gm/cm[superscript 2]-sec) is two orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by the classical, diffusion-limited theory of bubble growth. We propose that the interface roughening is due to an inertial instability of the evaporative surface. A preliminary calculation for the Landau mechanism of instability, supplemented by an ad hoc correction for sphericity indicates that, indeed, the classical mode of bubble growth would be unstable under the conditions found in the present experiment. An explanation of the present observations that is consistent with this theoretical prediction is that the actual instability does occur in the first 1 - 2 [mu]sec of bubble growth and the instability has developed well into the nonlinear stage by 8 [mu]sec, the earliest time at which bubbles have been observed in the present experiment. The present observations are completely different than what might be predicted from previous experiments and analyses of near-equilibrium evaporation. The generality of the present results needs to be verified in detail, but they clearly indicate that evaporation at the superheat limit can be much more complex than previously expected. </p...|$|E
