The aim of PBL is to stimulate student learning and to enrich the process of attaining knowledge, by incorporating analysis of real world problems into traditional topic-based courses. The following analysis represents a completed case study of two industry, client-initiated PBL projects that were incorporated into a supply chain management (SCM) undergraduate engineering course. Results suggest that key project characteristics can determine the educational significance of the learning experience. The projects that were too tightly defined by one client, {{compared to the other}} client’s more loosely defined project objectives, were less successful in both engaging students and illustrating the application of course concepts. Ultimately, for PBL to be effectively implemented in undergraduate application-based engineering courses (e. g. SCM), a connection to the primary course concepts must be readily identifiable.

The program uses a top-down approach by assigning the students a series of labs and projects designed to engage and challenge. The labs are building blocks for the main element of the program, which is the design of a semi-autonomous robotic vehicle whose mission emulates that of NASA’s Martian rovers. The project culminates with graded testing of their vehicles on an obstacle course.

It is seen that the difficulties they cite fall into four categories, the most serious of which are omitted heuristics, and the most common of which are miscommunications. Their considerations, and our post-AM work on machines that learn, have clarified why AM succeeded in the first place, and why it was so difficult to use the same paradigm to discover new heuristics. Those recent insights spawn questions about &quot;where the meaning really resides &quot; in the concepts discovered by AM. This in turn leads to an appreciation of the crucial and unique role of representation in theory formation, specifically the benefits of having syntax mirror semantics.

Three sources of data were used to determine whether students who had <b>learned</b> <b>by</b> <b>discovery</b> were better able to avoid and revise run-on sentences than students who did not learn through discovery pedagogy. The data sources include two sets of essays, surveys taken by the students, and teacher analyses of essays for readability. The results of the data analysis indicate that use of run-on sentences, especially early in an essay, detrimentally affects the readability of student written work; discovery learning activities improve student understanding, application, and transfer of skill; and while students believe they understand more than their written work indicates, the results provide teachers direction for further instruction. The findings of this study indicate that use of discovery learning for writing instruction with struggling learners holds great promise: a group of students generally regarded as academically weak showed greater understanding and application of run-on sentence avoidance than slightly stronger students who learned without discovery methods. This indicates that discovery learning is a method that improves learning among reluctant secondary students, a population many teachers struggle to reach effectively.
