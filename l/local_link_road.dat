50|$|As {{far back}} as Celtic times, {{there must have been}} a {{bridleway}} from Trier going towards Worms by way of Odenbach.

A path through the Hellerwald (forest) linked Odenbach with Otterberg. All of these <b>road</b> <b>links</b> still existed until the 19th century, then losing their traditional importance as the valley roads were extended. Work began on the roadbed for the Odenbach valley road in 1835 from Schneckenhausen, ending in Odenbach ten years later. The <b>local</b> <b>linking</b> <b>road</b> to Roth and Reiffelbach got a new roadbed in 1885. In 1938, on military grounds, the Nazis expanded the road now known as Bundesstraße 420. In 1896, the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn) from Lauterecken to Staudernheim came into service, and only a short time later, in 1903-1904, was double-tracked for strategic reasons throughout the Glan valley.
