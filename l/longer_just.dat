5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling that drew in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E
5|$|Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed, {{although}} {{this was only}} partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> {{the most powerful man}} in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and the establishment of English as the primary language.|$|E
25|$|However, the amended laws {{no longer}} include {{specific}} penalties for uttering seditious words, nor provisions relating to seditious enterprises, although {{the definition of}} seditious intent continues to apply in the determination of unlawful organisations. Additionally, all prosecutions for sedition (no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> summary prosecution) now require {{the approval of the}} Attorney-General, although this does not apply to arrests.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad Subuh saw {{the present}} age {{as one that}} demands {{personal}} evidence and proof of religious or spiritual realities, as people no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> believe in words. He claimed that Subud {{is not a new}} teaching or religion but only that the latihan kejiwaan itself is the kind of proof that humanity is looking for. There are now Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} is no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> {{a place where}} people come to work. For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community. The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.|$|E
25|$|Informal {{learning}} {{consists of}} the learner setting the goals and objectives. It has been claimed that media no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> influence human culture; they are human culture. With such {{a high number of}} users between the ages of 13–18, a number of skills are developed. Participants hone technical skills in choosing to navigate through social networking services. This includes elementary items such as sending an instant message or updating a status. The development of new media skills are paramount in helping youth navigate the digital world with confidence.|$|E

Their fans, who for a long time could not compete with the teams of the capital, steadily grew in number and started to compete with the massive Morumbi crowd, and significantly passed São Paulo and Palmeiras.|$|E
25|$|Commenting on {{the rape}} of women and {{children}} in recent African conflict zones, UNICEF said in 2008 that rape was no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> perpetrated by combatants but also by civilians. According to UNICEF rape is common in countries affected by wars and natural disasters, drawing a link between the occurrence of sexual violence and significant uprooting of a society and the crumbling of social norms. UNICEF states that in Kenya reported cases of sexual violence doubled within days of recent post-election conflict erupting. According to UNICEF rape was prevalent in conflict zones in Sudan, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.|$|E
25|$|Because {{multimodality}} {{is continually}} evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, {{the speaker and}} audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation is no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important related term to multimodality is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as sound and image. Whether and how a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.|$|E

500|$|These electoral successes {{tap into}} the [...] complex {{politics}} of these countries. Viewed from afar, they are all open, successful, externally orientated.

500|$|Such {{techniques}} were also integral to Maria Montessori's methods {{in the twentieth}} century. According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show Sesame Street is also [...] "based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially in the inner cities, the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide." [...] In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century {{has been dominated by}} the [...] "nature vs. nurture" [...] debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic [...] "environmentalism," [...] though qualified in his text, is now no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> a moral issue – it is also a scientific issue.|$|E
500|$|The 1966 edition was {{the last}} to be {{published}} after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made the guide effectively obsolete by outlawing racial discrimination in public accommodations. The last edition of the Green Book included significant changes that reflected the post-Civil Rights Act outlook. The title was changed to Traveler's Green Book: International Edition – no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> for the Negro, or the motorist – as its publishers sought to widen its appeal. Although the content continued to proclaim its mission of highlighting leisure options for black travelers, the cover featured an affluent white blonde water-skiing – a sign of how, as Michael Ra-Shon Hall puts it, [...] "the Green Book ‘whitened’ its surface and internationalized its scope, while still remaining true to its founding mission to ensure the security of African-American travelers both in the US and abroad." ...|$|E

GameSpy praised BioShock [...] "inescapable atmosphere", and Official Xbox Magazine lauded its [...] "inconceivably great plot" [...] and [...] "stunning soundtrack and audio effects." [...] The gameplay and combat system have been praised for being smooth and open-ended, and elements of the graphics, such as the water, were praised for their quality. It has been noted that the combination of the game's elements [...] "straddles so many entertainment art forms so expertly that it's the best demonstration yet how flexible this medium can be. It's no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> another shooter wrapped up in a pretty game engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic game world ever conceived." ...|$|E

In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so hopefully it goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, but this time I want to do more John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully I can write with people like him. I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Box Car Racer, {{intended}} as a one-time experimental project, became a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit and Hazen Street guitarist David Kennedy on guitar. Blink bassist Mark Hoppus felt betrayed and jealous, and it would create an unresolved tension within the trio that followed the band for several years. [...] "At the end of 2001, it felt like Blink-182 had broken up. It wasn’t spoken about, but it felt over", said Hoppus later. Barker, meanwhile, joined rap rock group Transplants in 2002 and was featured on their first album, Transplants. In addition, Blink-182 co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day, alongside opening acts Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, and Kut U Up in 2002. It was an [...] "uncomfortable" [...] time in the band according to Hoppus, but they had [...] "hundreds of discussions about it" [...] and seemingly moved on. Barker felt {{the dynamics of the}} band changed with Hoppus and DeLonge's marriages: [...] "Blink-182 were no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> three inseparable guys who were touring together." [...] Meanwhile, he began dating model Shanna Moakler, inviting tabloid attention, adding to the [...] "awkwardness" [...] present in the band.|$|E
500|$|Sholay {{has been}} {{labelled}} by Chopra as {{the gold standard}} in Indian cinema, and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts. Over the years, the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture, and {{has been called the}} greatest Hindi film of all time. It belongs to only a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), which are repeatedly watched throughout India, and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. The lasting effect of Sholay on Indian cinema was summarised by Anupama Chopra, when in 2004 she called it [...] "no <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> a film, [...] an event". In the 2000 book Sholay: The Making of a Classic, the noted director Shekhar Kapur stated [...] "there has never been a more defining film on the Indian screen. Indian film history can be divided into Sholay BC and Sholay AD". The film was jointly released in Pakistan by Geo films and Mandviwalla Entertainment on 17 April 2015, almost 40 years after its theatrical release. The film's premiere in the country was held in Karachi.|$|E
