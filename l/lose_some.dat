5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E
5|$|As they progress, players gain {{experience}} points through defeating {{enemies and}} completing quests for non-player characters (NPCs) scattered around environments: these raise a character's experience level, which grant access to fresh skills and points {{that can be}} used to upgrade character attributes such as health and energy levels, dexterity, intelligence, or strength. If the player dies, they respawn at rebirth fountains scattered through the world, although they <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> accumulated experience points. Quests are divided into Main Quests related to the central narrative, and side quests unique to particular areas of the world. Other NPCs can be found in towns and cities that act as Merchants selling equipment and items: these can be both bought and sold. Player characters have multiple equipment slots, which can take armor for limbs and torso, weapons or shields, and accessories that grant passive boons.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E

5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

25|$|As {{already noted}} when the {{standard}} values were first formulated , the relative {{strength of the}} pieces changes as a game progresses to the endgame.

Also, according to Mainichi, the Japanese Communist Party will probably retain its previous 9 seats, while the Komeito Party and the Social Democratic Party may <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of their shares.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of water stress {{is an area}} of continuing research in viticulture. Of particular focus is the connection between yield size and the potential benefits of water stress. Since the act of stressing the vine does contribute to reduce photosynthesis-and by extension, reduce ripening since the sugars produced by photosynthesis is needed for grape development-it is possible that a stressed vine with high yields will only produce lots of under ripe grapes. Another interest of study is the potential impact on white grape varieties with enologists and viticulturists such as Cornelius Van Leeuwen and Catherine Peyrot Des Gachons contending that white grape varieties <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of their aromatic qualities when subjugated to even mild forms of water stress.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the French Revolution and First Empire, France {{expanded}} temporarily on the left bank of the Rhine. The frontier in the north east lost its definition.

France did <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> places such as Landau and Saarlouis. These strategic losses and the construction of a powerful German state may be seen as giving rise to later diplomatic and military events. But even after the Armistice of 1918, France was unable to make new territorial gains towards the north-east, into the Saarland.|$|E
