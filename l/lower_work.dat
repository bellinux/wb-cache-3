The government decided to violently suppress the uprising and turned to the Soviet Union for military support. In total, around 16 Soviet divisions with 20,000 soldiers as well as 8,000 Kasernierte Volkspolizei members were used to quell the uprising.|$|E
25|$|Single carrier {{devices are}} {{typically}} {{used to study}} the kinetics and charge transport mechanisms of an organic material and can be useful when trying to study energy transfer processes. As current through the device is composed of only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, recombination does not occur and no light is emitted. For example, electron only devices {{can be obtained by}} replacing ITO with a <b>lower</b> <b>work</b> function metal which increases the energy barrier of hole injection. Similarly, hole only devices can be made by using a cathode made solely of aluminium, resulting in an energy barrier too large for efficient electron injection.|$|E
2500|$|Clashes between {{organized}} labor and Pacific Electric simmered until labor efforts were renewed in 1910. Metal trade workers began a large strike and great tensions were created between employers and workers in Los Angeles as a result. [...] The Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees {{took advantage of}} the discourse and organized the Los Angeles trainmen and created Carmen's Local No. 410. The organization lobbied the state to create a ten-hour workday for local and interurban railway workers. The movement failed because employers threatened to fire anyone found participating in the movement. From 1913 to 1915, the amalgamated workers fought for <b>lower</b> <b>work</b> shifts and higher wages but found themselves blocked off by powerful enemies of labor.|$|E

2500|$|Experimental {{research}} has proven that {{the properties of}} the anode, specifically the anode/hole transport layer (HTL) interface topography {{plays a major role in}} the efficiency, performance, and lifetime of organic light emitting diodes.

[...] Mechanisms to decrease anode roughness for ITO/glass substrates include the use of thin films and self-assembled monolayers. [...] Also, alternative substrates and anode materials are being considered to increase OLED performance and lifetime.

These measures are not based on the revised RST, and may confound fear and anxiety. Alternatively, the Jackson 5 has recently been validated {{as a measure of}} the revised RST and shows convergent validity with measures of fear and anxiety. The proposed fear (FFFS) subscale is associated with avoidance behaviors (example item: 'If approached by a suspicious stranger, I run away') while the anxiety (BIS) subscale includes social situations wherein reward and punishment stimuli result in conflict between approach and avoidance motivations (example item: 'I prefer to work on projects where I can prove my abilities to others'). Clark and Loxton (2011) used the Jackson 5 to investigate mediators between fear, psychological acceptance, and work engagement. Self-reported fear, not anxiety, best predicted psychological acceptance, and <b>lower</b> <b>work</b> performance in turn. Thus, current research aims to apply measures based on the revised RST to more accurately clarify relations between fear, anxiety, and job performance.|$|E
