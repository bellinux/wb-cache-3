40|$|Abstract. Pointing {{mirror is}} one of the {{critical}} components of space camera to get earth images. <b>Lightweighting</b> design and simulation analysis of mirror {{play a major role in}} weight minimization and performance optimization of camera. Based on concept of design of experiments, this paper introduces a method combined curve fit with finite element simulation analysis and optimization to the <b>lightweighting</b> design of pointing mirror, as well as demonstrates design procedure, performance analysis and checkout of mirror. The results indicate that this method has good maneuverability and utility. This technique could be applied to <b>lightweighting</b> design of mirror which has a regular topological structure. 1...|$|R

5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} one of Ippo's senpai, Masaru Aoki, who has been boxing {{for a number of}} years before Ippo. He enters the Class A Tournament, but loses. Afterward, he begins his {{comeback}} and rises through the <b>Lightweight</b> division to win the <b>Lightweight</b> Championship against Katsutaka Imae. Aoki's story differs from the manga in that Aoki lost several of the fights, and achieved a draw in the Title bout. After Aoki's story arc, the game shifts again to another of Ippo's senpai, Tatsuya Kimura, who began boxing with Aoki. His story is very similar to Aoki's in that he also enters the Class A Tournament and loses. Afterward, he begins his comeback that eventually leads to winning the Junior <b>Lightweight</b> Championship fight against Ryo Mashiba. Kimura's story is also different than the manga in that he lost several of the fights and did not become the Junior <b>Lightweight</b> Champion.|$|E

These were the Seagull 60 for front-engined <b>lightweights</b> and the Seagull 70 for underfloor-engined chassis. By August 1960, Duple Motor Bodies Limited had acquired 100% of the share capital of H. V. Burlingham Ltd at a price of £550,000.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} how {{the costs and}} benefits of improving fuel economy of vehicles via <b>lightweighting</b> with aluminum closures change with gas price. A process-based cost model is used to evaluate the costs of <b>lightweighting</b> with aluminum for six representative vehicles, and an industry choice-based conjoint decision analysis market model is used to evaluate the benefits of <b>lightweighting</b> given a 0. 5 mpg increase in fuel economy. Vehicles were examined by class size. Compact car owners were observed to be willing to pay for improved fuel economy but consumer preferences indicate insufficient willingness to pay to cover the costs of <b>lightweighting</b> with aluminum for a representative compact car, the Toyota Corolla. However, no conclusion can be made as to whether larger car owners are or are not willing to pay for improved fuel economy.

40|$|The Future Automotive Systems Technology Simulator (FASTSim) is the U. S. Department of Energy's {{high-level}} vehicle powertrain model {{developed at}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It uses a time versus speed drive cycle to estimate the powertrain forces required to meet the cycle. It simulates the major vehicle powertrain components and their losses. It includes a cost model based on component sizing and fuel prices. FASTSim simulated different levels of <b>lightweighting</b> for four different powertrains: a conventional gasoline engine vehicle, a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), a {{plug-in hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV), and a battery electric vehicle (EV). Weight reductions impacted the conventional vehicle's efficiency more than the HEV, PHEV and EV. Although <b>lightweighting</b> impacted the advanced vehicles' efficiency less, it reduced component cost and overall costs more. The PHEV and EV are less cost effective than the conventional vehicle and HEV using current battery costs. Assuming the DOE's battery cost target of $ 100 /kWh, however, the PHEV attained similar cost and <b>lightweighting</b> benefits. Generally, <b>lightweighting</b> was cost effective when it costs less than $ 6 /kg of mass eliminated...|$|R
