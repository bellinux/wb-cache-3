50|$|Chittaranjan is {{well known}} for Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW), which {{manufactures}} mainline electric broad gauge locomotives. This factory commenced production in 1950; and up to 1972, it was involved in the production of broad gauge and metre gauge steam <b>locomotives.</b> Production <b>of</b> electric <b>locomotives</b> commenced in 1963. In addition to steam and electric locomotives, CLW also produced narrow gauge (762mm) diesel <b>locomotives</b> <b>of</b> the ZDM class metre gauge (1000 mm) diesel <b>locomotives</b> <b>of</b> YDM class and broad gauge hydraulic shunting <b>locomotives</b> <b>of</b> the WDS4 class. It also produced few special narrow gauge (2 ft, as in Darjeeling Himalayan Railway) diesel <b>locomotives</b> <b>of</b> NDM class. Production <b>of</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> was discontinued in 1972 when the last steam locomotive, titled 'ANTIM SITARA' (The Last Star), was rolled out.
