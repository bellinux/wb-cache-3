5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, {{the effects of the}} two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E
5|$|In Western European {{medieval and}} Renaissance {{versions}} of the legend, Troilus is the youngest of Priam's five legitimate sons by Hecuba. Despite his youth {{he is one of}} the main Trojan war leaders. He dies in battle at Achilles' hands. In a popular addition to the story, originating in the 12th century, Troilus falls in love with Cressida, whose father has defected to the Greeks. Cressida pledges her love to Troilus but she soon switches her affections to the Greek hero Diomedes when sent to her father in a hostage exchange. Chaucer and Shakespeare are among the authors who wrote works telling the story of Troilus and Cressida. Within the medieval tradition, Troilus was regarded as a paragon of the faithful courtly lover and also of the virtuous pagan knight. Once the custom of courtly <b>love</b> <b>had</b> faded, his fate was regarded less sympathetically.|$|E

50|$|Love showcases the {{different}} types of relationships: family, friends, lovers, co-workers, and also those between strangers are shown to express {{the different}} types of <b>love</b> people <b>have</b> every day. Through the three sub-plots of eight interwoven characters, {{the ups and downs of}} <b>love,</b> what <b>love</b> <b>has</b> to offer and what <b>love</b> <b>has</b> to take, the film shows the relative situations in which love can take hold.|$|R

5|$|The Ways of Fate is a 1913 American silent short romance film {{produced}} by the American Film Manufacturing Company. The film's directorial and producer roles have been both attributed to Allan Dwan, but other sources point to Wallace Reid as director. The film's fictional plot is centered on Jim Conway, who grew up wanting to avenge his father's death and headed West to seek his father's killer. Lost in the mountains, he is saved by a young woman and the two fall in love. After a few weeks with her, Conway reveals the reason he came west and the young woman's father overhears it. The old man confesses to killing Conway's father, over a game of cards, and bares his chest. Conway refuses to take revenge, because <b>love</b> <b>had</b> diminished such feelings. The film was released on April 19, 1913 {{and it had a}} widespread national release. It is not known whether the film currently survives, but it is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of Hank Harrison and psychotherapist Linda Carroll, <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> an itinerant early life. She spent her formative years in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, {{where she was}} in a series of short-lived bands before being cast in two films by British director Alex Cox. After forming Hole in 1989, she received substantial attention from underground rock press for the group's debut album, produced by Kim Gordon. Hole's second release, Live Through This (1994), gave her high-profile renown with critical accolades and multi-platinum sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Miloš Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, she saw further mainstream success with the release of Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), which was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half and five minutes into the half Liverpool defender Josemi was shown a yellow card for fouling Miloš Krasić. Liverpool's poor play in front of goal {{continued}} after the restart; Josemi {{had a chance to}} score, but his shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area went over the crossbar. After the attack, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match; Florent Sinama Pongolle replaced Finnan. After just over an hour's play, a mix-up between Reina and Sami Hyypiä nearly contrived to present a goal to CSKA, before Hyypiä intervened to clear the ball. CSKA made their first substitution in the 66th minute with Deividas Šemberas replacing Yuri Zhirkov. Liverpool followed this by replacing Xabi Alonso with Mohamed Sissoko. Vágner <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> a chance to extend CSKA's lead in the 77th minute, but he was unable to control the ball after a high pass and lost possession. Despite their lead CSKA were negative in their play; they were punished when Liverpool replaced John Arne Riise with striker Djibril Cissé. Cissé made an immediate impact; he ran onto to a pass from García. The pass was cleared by CSKA defender Sergei Ignashevich but it ricocheted off Cissé and left him with an open goal after Akinfeev had come off his line in an attempt to clear the ball. Cissé's goal meant the match was now drawn at 1–1 and with no further goals the match went into extra-time.|$|E

No longer was it necessary for industry to locate near the source of electrical power.|$|E
25|$|According to Wood his {{character}} had long hankered {{for a sense}} of normality that other characters on the show have. He said that finding <b>love</b> <b>had</b> changed {{his character}}'s priorities. Grace had become Trevor's main focus and the gangster business played second. In one story, Grace has Trevor arrested for her father's murder. Wood believed that Trevor was understanding of the betrayal because she was grieving. He added that Trevor's understanding was the reason they were able to move on in their relationship.|$|E
25|$|In December 1953 Blair, {{playing for}} New Zealand against South Africa at Johannesburg, {{received}} news that his fiancée, Nerissa <b>Love,</b> <b>had</b> {{been killed in}} the Tangiwai railway disaster on Christmas Eve.

In the event, however, he appeared at the crease to join Bert Sutcliffe, who had already started to walk off the field. The packed crowd stood in silence.|$|E

After unsuccessful attempts at forming bands in San Francisco (where she was briefly a member of Faith No More) and Portland, Love relocated to Los Angeles, where she found work as an actress in two Alex Cox films (Sid and Nancy and Straight to Hell). Erlandson was a California native {{and a graduate of}} Loyola Marymount University, and was working as a royalties manager for Capitol Records at the time he met Love.|$|E
25|$|Gertrude Bell's first <b>love</b> <b>had</b> {{always been}} archaeology, thus she began forming {{what became the}} Baghdad Archaeological Museum, later renamed the Iraqi Museum. Her goal was to {{preserve}} Iraqi culture and history which included the important relics of Mesopotamian civilizations, and keep them in their country of origin. She also supervised excavations and examined finds and artifacts. She brought in extensive collections, such as from the Babylonian Empire. The museum was officially opened in June 1926, shortly before Bell's death. After her death, at the Emir's suggestion, {{the right wing of}} the Museum was named as a memorial to her.|$|E
25|$|By 1610 {{the short}} novel of <b>love</b> <b>had</b> largely disappeared, as tastes {{returned}} to longer adventure novels (romans d'aventures) and their clichés (pirates, storms, kidnapped maidens) {{that had been}} popular since the Valois court. Amadis of Gaul was the favorite reading matter of Henri IV; Béroalde de Verville was still writing, and Nicolas de Montreux had just died in 1608. Both Nervèze and Des Escuteaux in their later works attempted multi-volume adventure novels, {{and over the next}} twenty years the priest Jean-Pierre Camus adapted the form to tell harrowing moral tales heavily influenced by the histoire tragique. The best known of these long adventure novels is perhaps Polexandre (1629–49) by the young author Marin le Roy de Gomberville.|$|E

25|$|Another {{plan was}} in the works, this one against two night watchmen, Pat McCarron and Benjamin K. Yost, a Tamaqua Borough Patrolman. Jimmy Kerrigan and Thomas Duffy were said to despise Yost, who had arrested them on {{numerous}} occasions. Yost was shot as he put out a street light, which at that time necessitated climbing the lamp pole. Before he died, he reported that his killers were Irish, but were not Kerrigan or Duffy. McParland recorded that a Mollie named William <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> killed a Justice of the Peace, surnamed Gwyther, in Girardville. Unknown Mollies were accused of wounding a man outside his saloon in Shenandoah. Gomer James was killed while tending bar. Then, McParland recorded, a group of Mollies reported to him that they had killed a mine boss named Sanger, and another man who was with him. Forewarned of the attempt, McParland had sought to arrange protection for the mine boss, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In their rooms, Raoul expresses disgust {{that their}} host would send circus freaks to receive them ("What a Dreadful Town!..."). He upsets Gustave {{by refusing to}} play with him and storms out to find a bar, leaving Christine to explain his {{behavior}} to their son ("Look With Your Heart"). When Gustave goes to bed, the Phantom enters and reveals to a stunned Christine that {{it was he who}} summoned her to sing at Phantasma. Initially outraged, Christine eventually succumbs to the memory of a clandestine evening the two shared before she was married. As they recall their one night of passion, it is revealed that Christine was prepared to abandon Raoul for the Phantom, but awoke in the morning to find herself alone. The Phantom explains that he fled out of fear that she would reject him again when she saw his face in the morning light ("Beneath a Moonless Sky"). Both concede that they once thought their <b>love</b> <b>had</b> a chance, but the circumstances of the present day make it impossible ("Once Upon Another Time"). They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
500|$|Love's {{first major}} media {{exposure}} was a 1992 profile {{of herself and}} husband Kurt Cobain for Vanity Fair by journalist Lynn Hirschberg, entitled [...] "Strange Love." [...] After being asked {{to participate in a}} cover story for the magazine, Love was urged by her manager, Janet Billig, to accept the request. In the year prior, <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> been addicted to heroin along with Cobain, and the profile, published in September 1992, painted the couple in an unflattering light and suggested that <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> been addicted to heroin during her pregnancy. The article ultimately resulted in the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigating, and custody of Love and Cobain's newborn daughter, Frances, was temporarily awarded to Love's sister, Jaimee.|$|E

500|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points to}} the theme of international travel in Diamonds Are Forever, which was still a novelty to most people in Britain at the time. This travel between a number of a locations exacerbates one of the problems identified by Black: that there was no centre to the story. In contrast to the other novels in the Bond canon, where Casino Royale had Royale, From Russia, with <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> Istanbul and Dr. No had Jamaica, Diamonds Are Forever had multiple locations and two villains and there was [...] "no megalomaniac fervour, no weird self-obsession, at the dark centre of the plot".|$|E
