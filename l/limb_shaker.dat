40|$|An inertia type <b>limb</b> <b>shaker</b> were {{developed}} to mechanically harvest of tree fruits. The shaker, hydraulically powered and driven by the tractor power take off, was used for mechanical harvesting of almond. The study included optimum frequency and amplitude to obtain maximum fruit removal percentage, harvesting rate of the shaker. Harvesting rate was calculated by weighing both the harvested and unharvested almonds. In the tests the limbs of trees were shaken at 40 and 50 mm amplitude of the connecting rod attached to the crankshaft and 10, 15, 20 Hz frequencies. The results were analysed according to the maximum fruit removal percentage. Shaking time was 10 s {{for all of the}} frequency and amplitude tests. Maximum fruit removal (97 and 100 %) was achieved by operating the shaker at amplitude of 50 mm and a frequency of 15 and 20 Hz. Therefore it can be suggested an amplitude of 50 mm and a frequency of 20 Hz for mechanical harvesting of almond. Moreover, the appropriate harvesting time for nonpearl variety of almond was found the second week of August. Because, the ratio of Fruit Detachament Force (FDF) to Weight (W) at different maturity times was found 1. 8 N/g at the second week of August...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to design and develop an experimental shaker for vibratory date detachment. The prototype machine was constructed and tested on Shahani dates fruit bunch. The bunch shaker was powered by a continuous variable speed motor. The rotational speed of the power unit could be continuously varied from 0 to 1400 rpm by means of a volume control knob on a digital board. The rotating output power of the motor was transmitted to a small flywheel through a V-belt drive system, where it was converted to a reciprocating motion by a slider-crank mechanism. The eccentricity of the crank mechanism was adjustable to provide stroke lengths of 20, 40, 80, 100 and 120 mm. The slider motion was transmitted to the shaker clamp by a 500 mm long boom made of 20 mm steel tubing. The boom could reciprocate vertically and horizontally in a brass guide. By this shaker date fruit bunch can be oscillated in vertical, horizontal and hanging modes. At the vertical shaking mode, the resulting motion of slider-crank mechanism was transmitted to the fruit bunch clamped to the shaker frame, through a boom and a clamping device. The required average power for bunch shaking was estimated to be about 1 kW by assuming constant-displacement <b>limb</b> <b>shaker</b> model. Result showed the bunch shaker was capable of removing ripe fruit from the bunch at 5 - 7 second without imparting rubbing and bruising damage to the fruits...|$|E
40|$|An inertia type <b>limb</b> <b>shaker</b> hydraulically, powered {{and driven}} by the tractor power take-off, was {{designed}} and constructed for the mechanical harvesting of apricots. The study included some properties of apricot fruits, the apparent stiffness with respect to limb diameter, {{the time needed to}} shake a limb, optimum frequency and amplitude to obtain maximum fruit removal with minimum reactive force, limb amplitude, the effects of limb and tree properties on the fruit removal percentage, fruit damage, harvesting rate of the shaker; and comparisons with other harvesting methods. Harvesting rate was calculated by weighing both the harvested and unharvested apricot fruits. Fruit damage was evaluated from the modulus of elasticity of apricot fruit before and after harvesting. In order to study fruit damage, the effect of surface of different materials were examined: plastic canvas; nylon; and sponge. In the tests, the limbs were shaken at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mm amplitude of the connecting rod attached to the crankshaft and 10, 15 and 20 Hz frequencies for optimum shaking time. The results were analysed according to the maximum fruit removal percentage. The limb amplitude was calculated using the apparent stiffness, masses of shaking mechanism, shaker arm and reduced mass of limb. Shaking time, frequency and amplitude for a limb were found as 5 s, 15 Hz, and 40 mm, respectively. Limb position, limb length and tree size affected the fruit removal percentage at the 5 % significance level. The least fruit damage was obtained with the plastic canvas catching surface. The tim...|$|E
50|$|The Cherry {{industry}} that is so prevalent in Northport today had just begun in 1853 on Reverend Smith's farm. Farmers began producing cherries so much within those first few years that cherries were being shipped to nearby cities for their markets. By the 1960s cherry industry took a turn. In 1853 cherries were being harvested by hand or mechanically operated <b>limb</b> <b>shakers,</b> by the 1970s most farmers were using mechanical trunk shakers due to the damage that the tree was undertaking.|$|R
40|$|A 4 x 4 {{factorial}} experiment with a completely randomized design with three replications was conducted separately on two major pistachio varieties, Ohady and Kaleghoochy, {{to investigate the}} effects of shaking amplitude and frequency on pistachio nut and cluster detachment. Four levels of shaking frequencies used for Ohady were 5, 7. 5, 10 and 12. 5 Hz, while those of Kaleghoochy were 7. 5, 10, 12. 5 and 15 Hz. Four levels of shaking amplitude for Ohady were 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm, while those of the Kaleghoochy were 40, 60, 80 and 100 mm. Analysis of variance and mean comparison showed {{that the effects of}} shaking amplitude and frequency on pistachio nut and cluster detachment were significant on both varieties. It was found that in Ohady, at frequency of 12. 5 Hz and amplitude of 80 mm, the maximum effective nut detachment occurred. But considering the need to limit both yield loss and limb damage to 5 % and minimizing the power requirement of the <b>limb</b> <b>shaker,</b> applying shaking amplitude of 60 mm and frequency of 10 Hz, which detaches 95 % of the nuts, is considered as the most suitable combination of shaking amplitude and frequency. Also, at amplitude of 80 mm and frequency of 12. 5 Hz, the highest percentage of cluster detachment occurred. Here again, by considering limb damage and power requirement, applying shaking frequency of 12. 5 Hz at 60 mm amplitude with 69 % cluster detachment was selected as the most suitable combination. In Kaleghoochi, at amplitude of 100 mm and frequency of 15 Hz, nut detachment was 100 %, while the need to limit limb damage and power consumption, the combination of 60 mm amplitude and 15 Hz frequency with 97. 2 % nut detachment was selected as the most suitable one. For cluster harvesting of Kaleghoochy, shaking amplitudes of 60 and 40 mm and frequency of 12. 5 Hz with cluster detachment of 75 and 69 percent, respectively were selected as the most suitable ones. The average ratio of tensile force required for removing pistachio nut to its weight (F/W), and the ratio of tensile force required for removing pistachio cluster to its weight (V/W), which could be considered as an index of ease of detachment, were measured 6. 2 and 37 for Ohady and 9 and 37. 8 for Kaleghoochy, respectively. Finally, we may conclude that by applying the suitable combination of shaking amplitude and frequency, shake harvesting of pistachio could be practiced successfully...|$|E
