500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Megan Aldrich writes, [...] "He founded no school... had few adherents {{outside the}} circle of his practice... and trained no further generation of designers." [...] In comparison with more prolific contemporaries, he completed relatively few works and lost many architectural competitions. Burges's collaborator, the artist Nathaniel Westlake, lamented [...] "competitions are seldom given to the best manâ€“ <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> poor Burges won, or should have won, and I think he executed only one." [...] Burges occasionally acted as a judge in architectural competitions and Eastlake also commented on Burges's failure to win them; [...] "in one case only has he traversed this always arduous road to fame with anything like substantial success." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group E, along with Dutch champions PSV, Greek club Panathinaikos and Norwegian side Rosenborg. An Alex own goal {{was enough for}} Arsenal to claim three points against PSV on the first matchday. The team drew away to Rosenborg and earnt a point at Panathinaikos, despite twice having taken the lead at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences. Wenger accepted referee Herbert Fandel's decision, but added his surprise that Mark van Bommel was not cautioned: [...] "If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of fouls he made without being punished it is very surprising because he made some deliberate fouls. Some people might criticise Patrick when we were down to 10 men but {{he felt he had}} to fight harder to win the ball." ...|$|E

He merely cast an occasional <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> {{and quality of the}} warriors, who, from time to time, signified their readiness to accompany Uncas to the field. In this particular he was soon satisfied; for, as has been already seen, the power of the young chief quickly embraced every fighting man in the nation. After this material point was so satisfactorily decided, he despatched an Indian boy in quest of [...] "Killdeer" [...] and the rifle of Uncas, to the place where they had deposited the weapons on approaching the camp of the Delawares; a measure of double policy, inasmuch as it protected the arms from their own fate, if detained as prisoners, and gave them the advantage of appearing among the strangers rather as sufferers than as men provided with the means of defence and subsistence. In selecting another to perform the office of reclaiming his highly prized rifle, the scout had lost sight of none of his habitual caution. He knew that Magua had not come unattended, and he also knew that Huron spies watched the movements of their new enemies, along the whole boundary of the woods. It would, therefore, have been fatal to himself to have attempted the experiment; a warrior would have fared no better; but the danger of a boy would not be likely to commence until after his object was discovered. When Heyward joined him, the scout was coolly awaiting the result of this experiment.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} for students to understand the goals and the criteria for success when learning in the classroom.

[...] "When teachers start from {{what it is they}} want students to know and design their instruction backward from that goal, then instruction is far more likely to be effective". In a study done by Gray and Tall, they found that 72 students between the ages of 7 and 13 had different experiences when learning in mathematics. The study showed that higher achieving students looked over mathematical ambiguities, while the lower achieving students tended to get stuck on these misunderstandings. An example of this {{can be seen in the}} number [...] Although it is not explicitly stated, the operation between these two numbers is addition.

Note that the phrase [...] "maximum power output" [...] that is found in the regulation (but omitted in the explanation) may create confusion because some e-bike motor manufacturers advertise and print on the motor their [...] "maximum input power" [...] because that number is larger (typically motors run at about 80% efficiency [...] ) thus give the impression the buyer is getting a more powerful motor.

He created this platform so that he could give photographers the tools that they would need to deal with life outside of school.

He has been able to help such individuals as [...] Kimberly Yatsko and [...] Tijana Vuckovic with their fashion photography careers.
