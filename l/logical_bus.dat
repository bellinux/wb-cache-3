40|$|Abstract — Backbone routers {{typically}} require large buffers to hold packets during congestion. A thumb rule is {{to provide}} a buffer at every link, equal to the product of the round trip time and the link capacity. This translates into Gigabytes of buffers operating at line rate at every link. Such a size and rate necessitates the use of SDRAM with bandwidth of, for example, 80 Gbps for link speed of 40 Gbps. With speedup in the switch fabrics used in most routers, the bandwidth requirement of the buffer increases further. While multiple SDRAM devices can be used in parallel to achieve high bandwidth and storage capacity, a wide <b>logical</b> data <b>bus</b> composed of these devices results in suboptimal performance for arbitrarily sized packets. An alternative is to divide the wide <b>logical</b> data <b>bus</b> into multiple <b>logical</b> channels and store packets into them independently. However, in such an organization, the cumulative pin count grows due to additional address buses which might offset the performance gained. We find that due to several existing memory technologies and their characteristics and with Internet traffic composed of particular sized packets, a judiciously architected data channel can greatly enhance the performance per pin. In this paper, we derive an expression for the effective memory bandwidth of a parallel channel packet buffer and show how it can be optimized for a given number of I/O pins available for interfacing to memory. We believe that our model can greatly aid packet buffer designers to achieve the best performance. I...|$|R
40|$|The Data Diffusion Machine (DDM) is a {{scalable}} {{shared memory}} multiprocessor {{in which the}} location of a datum in the machine is completely decoupled from its address. A data access "snooping" protocol provides an automatic duplication and migration of the data to wherever needed. The protocol also handles data coherence and replacement. The hardware organization consists of a hierarchy of buses and data controllers linking an arbitrary number of processors each having a large set-associative memory. Each data controller has a set-associative directory containing status bits for data under its control. The rest of the system appears to one processor like shared memory system, which makes the DDM a general architecture. The DDM is scalable in that there may be any number of levels in the hierarchy. The <b>logical</b> topmost <b>bus</b> (or any other bus) can be implemented by an unlimited number of physical buses removing an anticipated bottleneck.

50|$|Event {{monitoring}} {{makes use}} of a <b>logical</b> <b>bus</b> to transport event occurrences from sources to subscribers, where event sources signal event occurrences to all event subscribers and event subscribers receive event occurrences. An event bus can be distributed over a set of physical nodes such as standalone computer systems. Typical examples of event buses are found in graphical systems such as X Window System, Microsoft Windows as well as development tools such as SDT.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of bus snooping is limited scalability. Frequent snooping on a cache causes a race with an access from a processor, thus it can increase cache access time and power consumption. Each of the requests {{has to be}} broadcast to all nodes in a system. It means {{that the size of}} the (physical or <b>logical)</b> <b>bus</b> and the bandwidth it provides must grow, as the system becomes larger. Since the bus snooping does not scale well, larger cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA) systems tend to use directory-based coherence protocols.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, logical {{topology}} is the {{way that}} the signals act on the network media, or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices. A network's logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology. For example, the original twisted pair Ethernet using repeater hubs was a <b>logical</b> <b>bus</b> topology carried on a physical star topology. Token ring is a logical ring topology, but is wired as a physical star from the media access unit. Logical topologies are often closely associated with media access control methods and protocols. Some networks are able to dynamically change their logical topology through configuration changes to their routers and switches.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common {{mechanisms}} of ensuring coherency are snooping and directory-based, each having their own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping based protocols {{tend to be}} faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping isn't scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system, meaning that as the system gets larger, {{the size of the}} (<b>logical</b> or physical) <b>bus</b> and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (>64 processors) use this type of cache coherence.|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{presents}} several interoperability features {{applied to}} a local distributed information system, CardioNET, meant to improve quality of healthcare services, {{through the use of}} the latest medical and IT&C technologies. Modern healthcare systems require a patient-centric vision, where patients must receive medical attention or treatment anytime, regardless of their physical location. The eHealth distributed system we present – CardioNET is based on a SOA producer-consumer model taking a patient centric approach where every hardware, software and medical activities become “services”. The system offers tools for remote interactions between patients, doctors, medical entities (e. g. hospitals, labs) and authorities. Based on international standards (IDC 10, LOINC, HL 7), the system assures interoperability and data exchange in widely accepted XML formats. A <b>logical</b> domain <b>bus,</b> called Pervasive Health Service Bus-pHSB, exchanges HL 7 compliant data messages between the integrated elements of the platform, through high level protocols (SOAP/HL 7). The paper addresses interoperability problems between medical informational platforms proposing an eHealth architecture composed of: - production systems (nodes) : General Practitioner, Analysis Laboratories, Clinics, Hospitals, Home Health Care Units (H-HCU);- portal with specialized web services, registries and shared data repositories – distributed, boundary-less environment for decision support, research and educational activities...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of changes and improvements to the Architecture Analysis 2 ̆ 6 Design Language (AADL) standard for describing both the software architecture and the execution platform architectures of performance-critical, embedded, real-time systems. The standard was initially defined in the document SAE AS- 5506 and published in November 2004 by SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers). SAE International published the revised language, known as AADL V 2, in January 2009. Feedback from users of the standard guided the plan for improvements. Their experience and suggestions resulted in the addition of component categories to better represent protocols as <b>logical</b> entities (virtual <b>bus),</b> scheduler hierarchies and logical time partitions (virtual processor), and a generic component (abstract). The revisions also led to the abilities to (1) explicitly parameterize component declarations to better express architecture patterns, (2) specify multiple instances of the same component in one declaration (component array) and corresponding connection patterns, (3) set visibility rules for packages and property sets that access other packages and property sets, (4) specify system-level mode transitions more precisely, and (5) use additional property capabilities including property value records...|$|R
50|$|The star {{topology}} reduces {{the probability of}} a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes (computers, etc.) to a central node. When the physical {{star topology}} is applied to a <b>logical</b> <b>bus</b> network such as Ethernet, this central node (traditionally a hub) rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only. The failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others, but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected. However, the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes.|$|E

It is demonstrated that the wireless access networks having star or bus logical topologies can be realized within the proposed optimal SMT conduit structure.

Gigaplane mechanical and board designs, described in Section 2. 1, result in a modular, cost-effective and highly configurable system. One reason for the high bandwidth of the bus is the ability to switch bus drivers without inserting a dead cycle, which results in 33 % savings in bandwidth.
