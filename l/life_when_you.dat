The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was feeling at the time her third studio album Control (1986) was recorded. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of <b>life</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on}} in her life then that I just thought her album should be called that", Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled [...] "So Excited".

[...] "War Machine" [...] {{was based on a}} documentary on Hannibal, which led {{to the conclusion that the}} military has not changed since Ancient Rome. [...] "Wheels" [...] tells about Johnson's passion for motorcars. He described the album's release as the [...] "best one we've done", he felt that while Back in Black was great for its time, Black Ice shows the band's versatility.

500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you ever want to be something your whole <b>life?</b> ... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come." [...] Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your <b>life</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete."

With its explicit language and cynical attitude to politicians, it roused one British Member of Parliament's ire at the magazine's partial funding by the British Arts Council.

2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy <b>life</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E

Conversations between the group began before December 2005, when they elaborated the first themes, and songwriting and recording began in earnest in February. The discussion turned to how Jackson was feeling during the recording of her third studio album Control in 1986. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of <b>life</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on in}} her life then that I just thought her album should be called that", Dupri said. Jam agreed, saying it made sense as a concept because it meant a sense of rejuvenation for her. A sense of that excitement that people have when they are 20 years old, when their life are beginning. He finished saying Jackson had that same sense of hunger and excitement than she had when she was younger. Jackson wanted to create an R and dance album, but with an emphasis on dance. Rather than contribute to separate songs for the album, Dupri Jam and Lewis decided to collaborate. According to the group, the process caused ego and procedural conflicts, but they complimented each other. Jam said: [...] "The great thing about working with Jermaine, he came in with total respect for us, we had total respect for him. The fact is that we were fans of each other and for Janet".
