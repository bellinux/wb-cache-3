This bridge, which crosses Braddock Run, was built in 1812, with <b>later</b> <b>work</b> being done in 1843. The stone arch bridge, located {{just south of the}} current alignment of Alt US40, was restored in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Escher's <b>later</b> <b>work</b> Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure) {{returned}} {{to the theme of}} polyhedral compounds, depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the compound of the cube and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and icosahedron.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the novel}} {{has had its}} {{defenders}} among feminists in the academy, such as Alison Hennegan, {{pointing out that the}} novel did raise awareness of homosexuality among the British public and cleared the way for <b>later</b> <b>work</b> that tackled gay and lesbian issues.|$|E

5|$|In a 2010 book, the {{environmentalist}} Tim Flannery {{claimed that}} Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,' {{and suggested that}} Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his <b>later</b> <b>work</b> on the atmosphere {{be seen as a}} forerunner to modern ecological thinking.|$|E
5|$|Philip Morrison (November 7, 1915 – April 22, 2005) was a {{professor}} of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by Louis Agassiz in 1831 as Lobotes ocellatus, as he mistakenly believed the species was marine; <b>later</b> <b>work</b> assigned the species to the genus Astronotus.

5|$|Though Tupper {{was not an}} officer, he {{frequently}} served as a chaplain, ministering to sick and injured soldiers, and organizing prayer meetings and bible studies among soldiers. While in the army, he became acquainted with the plight of African-American slaves. This inspired his <b>later</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam's early {{compositions}} {{relied heavily}} on the Roland MC-505 music sequencer and drum machine. Her <b>later</b> <b>work</b> marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years <b>later,</b> <b>work</b> began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E

5|$|Charles Tingwell as Dr Tony Grant. Appearing in {{the medical}} drama Emergency – Ward 10 in the 1960s, Tingwell was {{approached}} by the Andersons on recommendation from Ray Barrett. His <b>later</b> <b>work</b> for the Andersons included Thunderbirds Series Two, Captain Scarlet (for which he {{was the voice of}} Doctor Fawn) and one episode of UFO, after which he returned to his native Australia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's <b>later</b> <b>work,</b> the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal {{and the loss of}} their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his <b>later</b> <b>work</b> on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. <b>Later</b> <b>work</b> pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Swedish team {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} Berkeley team's inability to detect element 102 in 1958, maintaining that they did discover it. However, <b>later</b> <b>work</b> has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259No (no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the Swedish experiments) with a half-life over 3minutes exist, and that the Swedish team's results are most likely from thorium-225, which has a half-life of 8minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium-213, which has a decay energy of 8.53612MeV. This hypothesis is lent weight {{by the fact that}} thorium-225 can easily be produced in the reaction used and would not be separated out by the chemical methods used. <b>Later</b> <b>work</b> on nobelium also showed that the divalent state is more stable than the trivalent one and hence that the samples emitting the alpha particles could not have contained nobelium, as the divalent nobelium would not have eluted with the other trivalent actinides. Thus, the Swedish team later retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature. After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein– concanavalin A– except that the ends were circularly permuted. <b>Later</b> <b>work</b> confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, an unofficial, high-definition remake was {{announced}} titled Sonic the Hedgehog 2 HD, which included development members who would <b>later</b> <b>work</b> on Sonic Mania. In 2012, {{it was reported}} that a potential keylogger was included with an alpha build of the game, which led to the project being discontinued due to the controversy. In 2014, the project was restarted under a new development team. The final version is planned to feature additional stages and the option to play levels as Knuckles the Echidna.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period Scotland {{continued}} to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926–92), who, with James Gowan (1923–) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955–58), considered a landmark {{in the development}} of modernist, brutalist residential planning, a style which would have a profound impact in Scotland. Their <b>later</b> <b>work,</b> almost all of it outside Scotland, would be highly influential on an international scale.|$|E
5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his <b>later</b> <b>work.</b> His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E
