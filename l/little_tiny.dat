500|$|Welch {{has said}} the album is about American history, rock 'n' roll, and country music. [...] There are songs about the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, the Titanic Disaster, John Henry, and Elvis Presley. [...] Time continues Welch and Rawlings' style of mellow and sparse arrangements. Welch explained, [...] "As opposed to being <b>little</b> <b>tiny</b> folk songs or traditional songs, they're really tiny rock songs. They're just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a <b>little</b> <b>tiny</b> chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E

"See, {{now what}} we're asking {{is for people}} to make that <b>little</b> <b>tiny</b> gesture to show that we're willing to {{inconvenience}} ourselves {{a little bit and}} to begin to shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation Center." ...|$|E

Everything was on such a delightfully tiny scale. You lived in a <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> room; you slept on a <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> bed, in a <b>tiny,</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> bedroom; and you cooked your little dinner by a <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> fire, in the <b>tiniest</b> <b>little</b> kitchen that ever you did see. [...] "Oh, it must be lovely, living on a houseboat," [...] said Ethelbertha, with a gasp of ecstasy; [...] "it must be like living in a doll's house." ...|$|R

2500|$|The album's {{title is}} taken from a lyric in the song [...] "Raindrops"; [...] "And now love can grow without tiny little raindrops. Tiny <b>little,</b> <b>tiny</b> little, messy little raindrops." [...] Cole said, [...] "when it rains, {{everything}} she's washed [...] it feels hopeful." [...] Cole is seen in a bright pink and orange off-the-shoulder dress and ﬁve-inch animal print Christian Louboutin heels on the album cover, which was unveiled on 14 October 2010. It also features the album title and her name scrawled in orange text. Cole's barbed-wire and rose tattoo, located on her right thigh, was airbrushed out of the shot.|$|E
2500|$|... "There's nobody like Ichiro {{in either}} league—now or ever. He exists {{strictly}} {{within his own}} world, playing a game 100 percent unfamiliar to everyone else. The game has known plenty of 'slap' hitters, but none who sacrifice so much natural ability {{for the sake of}} the art... Ichiro, a man of wondrous strength, puts on impressive power-hitting displays almost nightly in batting practice. And he'll go deep occasionally in games, looking very much like someone who could do it again, often... the man lives for hits, <b>little</b> <b>tiny</b> ones, and the glory of standing atop the world in that category. Every spring, scouts or media types write him off, swearing that opposing pitchers have found the key, and they are embarrassingly wrong".|$|E

She called me one day and asked if she could bring her sister along with her onto location. I said, 'Sure, of course, no problem.' And I was delighted because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining about whatever. But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on for a half hour just in case. Interested in everything that went on, and was a total joy. I couldn't ask for a more cooperative actor." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show also {{received}} some negative criticism. Tim Walker {{wrote in the}} Sunday Telegraph: [...] "It is a great big empty vessel of a show that {{makes a lot of}} noise and not much else, and would have been better entitled 'Irredeemably Bland'. I was aware that for the whole of the two hours and 25 minutes that it ran, I was sitting among a group of people with vacant smiles on faces that otherwise seemed entirely numbed. That was how I looked, too. It is the expression that registers when what one is seeing doesn't entirely sync with {{what is going on in}} one's brain." [...] Quentin Letts wrote for Daily Mail, [...] "It is pink not just in the colour of many of the clothes and stage effects. It is pink to the core of its <b>little,</b> <b>tiny</b> soul ...
