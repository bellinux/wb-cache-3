All of Upminster is contained within these wards, however they also cover the connected settlement of Cranham and the rural outlier of North Ockendon. In 2001 the population of Upminster ward was 12,674 and Cranham ward was 12,242, giving a total population of 25,098. 80.95% in Upminster and 81.73% in Cranham report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 10.08% in Upminster and 10.46% in Cranham report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England. With a black and minority ethnic population of 3% in 2001, Cranham and Upminster wards have the lowest Simpson index for ethnic diversity in London. The level of home ownership is atypically high compared to the rest of London and England, with over 90% of housing tenure under owner-occupation in both wards.

5|$|The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the {{expected}} amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts {{tend to be}} bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting {{in the mid to}} late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the <b>lowest</b> <b>levels</b> of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.|$|E

40|$|Hyperheuristics {{give us the}} {{appealing}} {{possibility of}} abstracting the solution method from the problem, since our hyperheuristic, at each decision point, chooses between different <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics rather than different solutions as is usually the case for metaheuristics. By assembling <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics from parameterised components we may create {{hundreds or thousands of}} <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics, and there is increasing evidence that this is effective in dealing with every eventuality that may arise when solving different combinatorial optimisation problem instances since at each iteration the solution landscape is amenable to {{at least one of the}} <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics. However, the large number of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics means that the hyperheuristic has to intelligently select the correct <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristic to use, to make best use of available CPU time. This paper empirically investigates several hyperheuristics designed for large collections of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics and adapts other hyperheuristics from the literature to cope with these large sets of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics on a difficult real- world workforce scheduling problem. In the process we empirically investigate a wide range of approaches for setting tabu tenure in hyperheuristic methods, for a complex real-world problem. The results show that the hyperheuristic methods described provide a good way to trade off CPU time and solution quality...|$|R

M249 users had the <b>lowest</b> <b>levels</b> of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a collapsible stock.|$|E
