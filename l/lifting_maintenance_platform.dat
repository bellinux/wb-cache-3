40|$|International audienceTo meet {{increasing}} {{needs in}} the field of maintenance, we studied the dynamic aspect of process and services on a <b>maintenance</b> <b>platform,</b> a major challenge in process mining and knowledge engineering.

Our proposal makes explicit the underlying knowledge of platform users by means of a trace-based system called "PETRA". The goal of this system is to extract new knowledge rules about transitions and activities in maintenance processes from previous platform executions as well as its user (i. e. maintenance operators) interactions. While following a Knowledge Traces Discovery process and handling the maintenance ontology IMAMO, "PETRA" is composed of three main subsystems: tracking, learning and knowledge capitalization. The capitalized rules are shared in the platform knowledge base in order to be reused in future process executions. The feasibility of this method is proven through concrete use cases involving four maintenance processes and their simulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>platform</b> for {{business}} vehicles which detects failure sign using IoT {{data on the}} move, orders to create repair parts by 3 D printers and to deliver them to the destination. Recently, IoT and 3 D printer technologies have been progressed and application cases to manufacturing and maintenance have been increased. Especially in air flight industry, various sensing data are collected during flight by IoT technologies and parts are created by 3 D printers. And IoT platforms which improve development/operation of IoT applications also have been appeared. However, existing IoT platforms mainly targets to visualize "things" statuses by batch processing of collected sensing data, and 3 factors of real-time, automatic orders of repair parts and parts stock cost are insufficient to accelerate businesses. This paper targets maintenance of business vehicles such as airplane or high-speed bus. We propose a <b>maintenance</b> <b>platform</b> with real-time analysis, automatic orders of repair parts and minimum stock cost of parts. The proposed platform collects data via closed VPN, analyzes stream data and predicts failures in real-time by online machine learning framework Jubatus, coordinates ERP or SCM via in memory DB to order repair parts and also distributes repair parts data to 3 D printers to create repair parts near the destination.
