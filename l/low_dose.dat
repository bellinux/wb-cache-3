40|$|Abstract—There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that ionizing radiation increases cancer risks at high doses (e. g.,> 1 Gy), and persua-sive, if controversial, epidemiological evidence that cancer risks are increased at <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> (10 mGy). Discussed here are the issues related to extrapolating radiation risks from <b>low</b> radiation <b>doses</b> to very <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> (< 1 mGy) — for which purpose {{we are forced to}} rely on radiobiological evidence and biophysical arguments. At high doses, cells are typically hit by many tracks of radiation, while at <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> most cells are typically hit by a single track of radiation; at very <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> proportionately fewer cells are hit, again only by a single track of radiation. Thus, in comparing <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> to very <b>low</b> <b>doses,</b> the damage to hit cells remains essentially the same (a single radiation track passing through a cell), but what changes is the number of cells that are subjected to this same damage, which decreases linearly as the dose decreases. This is the argument for a linear no-threshold (LNT) model. It is important to emphasize that this LNT argument only applies to the extrap-olation from <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> to very <b>low</b> <b>doses,</b> not from high to <b>low</b> <b>doses.</b> Of course there are caveats to this argument, such as the potential effects of phenomena such as inter-cellular commu-nication and immunosurveillance, and the possibility of differ-ent radiobiological processes at very <b>low</b> <b>doses,</b> compared to <b>low</b> <b>doses.</b> However, there is little conclusive experimental evidence about the significance of these phenomena at very <b>low</b> <b>doses,</b> and comparative mechanistic studies at high <b>doses</b> vs. <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> will not be informative in this context. At present, we do not know whether such radiobiological phenomena would produce small or large perturbations, or even whether they would increase or decrease cancer risks at very <b>low</b> <b>doses,</b> compared with the prediction of a linear extrapolation from <b>low</b> <b>doses...</b>|$|R

Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E

Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease.

There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear.

5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular <b>low</b> <b>dose</b> (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBecause cardiac {{contractility}} is impaired {{in chronic}} heart failure, many pharmacologic agents {{have been developed}} to increase the contractile state of the failing heart. These drugs produce impressive hemodynamic effects, but long-term therapy has to failed to produce clinical benefits and has increased mortality in treated patients. This experience has led many physicians to suggest that positive inotropic therapy be abandoned as a therapeutic approach for heart failure. However, recent studies suggest that the efficacy and safety of many (if not all) positive inotropic drugs can be greatly enhanced by reducing the dose of these drugs. The importance of dose is dramatically illustrated by the results of trials with vesnarinone, which decreases mortality when used in <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> but increases mortality when administered in doses only twice as large. Although <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of positive inotropic drugs may be clinically superior to high doses, {{it is not clear that}} these <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> exert significant inotropic effects. All positive inotropic drugs exert actions on the circulation in addition to stimulating the heart, and these ancillary properties may be particularly important at <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of these drugs. <b>Low</b> <b>doses</b> of milrinone and pimobendan may act primarily to dilate peripheral blood vessels; <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of digitalis may exert only neurohormonal effects, and <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of vesnarinone may act as an antiarrhythmic agent. If the noninotropic actions of <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> account for the therapeutic benefits of these drugs, then the positive inotropic effects seen at high doses may be primarily responsible for their adverse effects. Therefore, hemodynamic activity should not be viewed as a prerequisite for the selection of the dose of a positive inotropic drug. Prior emphasis on the use of high doses with significant cardiostimulatory effects may have derailed the proper development of many positive inotropic agents for the treatment of heart failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{health effects}} arising from {{exposure}} to <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of ionizing radiation are of particular concern, mainly due to the increased application of diagnostic and therapeutic X-ray modalities. The mechanisms behind the cell and tissue responses to <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> remain to be elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of ionizing radiation induce activation of the immune response; however, the processes involved {{have yet to be}} adequately investigated. Monocytes are key players in the induction of an immune response. Within the context of this study, we investigated the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-B signaling in isolated human primary monocytes in response to <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> (0. 05 and 0. 1 Gy) and a high dose (1 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Using quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA techniques, our results showed a positive regulation of TLR signaling in response to <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> but a less significant response at high doses. This activation was demonstrated via the activation of TLR signaling molecules (HMGB 1, TLR 4, TLR 9, MyD 88 and IRAK 1). Furthermore, and in contrast to the high <b>dose,</b> the <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> showed increased phosphorylation levels of the protein IB, and therefore positive signaling of the NF-B pathway. This result denotes pro-survival and pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, MAPKs were activated in response to 0. 05 Gy, while 0. 1 and 1 Gy showed a downregulatory trend that may be related to activation of the PF 4 gene. On the other hand, there was highly significant involvement of activated p 53 and damaged genes in response to high but not <b>low</b> <b>doses.</b> In conclusion, this study addressed the need to re-evaluate health risks arising {{from exposure to}} <b>low</b> <b>doses</b> of ionizing radiation, particularly in view of the accumulating evidence reporting inflammatory and oncogenic consequences from these exposures...|$|R

5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from <b>low</b> <b>dose</b> oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E
