5|$|For the 2009 <b>legislative</b> <b>session,</b> Marostica {{was named}} to {{a seat on the}} legislature's Joint Budget Committee, and a seat on the House Appropriations Committee as the ranking Republican member. During {{hearings}} before the beginning of the <b>legislative</b> <b>session,</b> Marostica supported withdrawing all state funding from public research universities, a move opposed by university leaders, but which was discussed more seriously after poor economic forecasts. Marostica also helped to lead an effort to allow the state to tap the financial reserves of Pinnacol Assurance, a quasi-governmental worker's compensation insurer, in order to balance the state budget. Following the <b>legislative</b> <b>session,</b> Marostica served on Colorado's Long-Term Fiscal Stability Commission, a panel created by legislation during the 2009 General Assembly to consider changes to constitutional constraints on the state budget.|$|E

5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special <b>legislative</b> <b>session</b> to {{consider}} the issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 <b>legislative</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E

Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the <b>legislative</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of Combs' first {{official}} actions as governor {{was to call}} a special session of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had been in effect since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting {{the issue of a}} convention on the ballot in two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by legal scholars that the constitution was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special <b>legislative</b> <b>session.</b> The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special <b>legislative</b> <b>session</b> and again during the subsequent regular <b>legislative</b> <b>session</b> in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on the ballot in November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1979, under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. Brown was frequently {{out of the}} state, leaving Collins as acting governor for more than 500 days of her four-year term. In 1983, she defeated Republican Jim Bunning to become Kentucky's first woman governor. Her administration had two primary focuses: education and economic development. After failing to secure increased funding for education in the 1984 <b>legislative</b> <b>session,</b> she conducted a statewide public awareness campaign in advance of a special <b>legislative</b> <b>session</b> the following year; the modified program was passed in that session. She successfully used economic incentives to bring a Toyota manufacturing plant to Georgetown, Kentucky in 1986. Legal challenges to the incentives– which would have cost the state the plant and its related economic benefits– were eventually dismissed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. The state experienced record economic growth under Collins' leadership.|$|E

5|$|During the 1988 <b>legislative</b> <b>session,</b> Governor Wilkinson {{proposed}} {{an amendment to}} the Kentucky Constitution that would allow state officials, including the sitting incumbents, to succeed themselves in office once. As presiding officer in the Senate, Jones insisted that any such measure also include a runoff provision if a candidate did not receive a majority of votes in the party primary. Wilkinson opposed this provision, and the measure died in the state senate. Wilkinson's proposed education program also failed in the session, and Jones suggested that the governor should build a consensus among legislators before including the program on the agenda of a special <b>legislative</b> <b>session,</b> which Wilkinson had proposed for January 1989. After the 1988 session, Wilkinson called Jones a backstabber and accused him of sabotaging the succession amendment. The two did not meet for six months following the session.|$|E
