In January 2006 the <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked</b> EP {{was released}} on techno DJ Vitalic’s record label Citizen Records in France. This EP includes the tracks “Borschtchick” and “Cocked, Locked and Ready to Rock”.|$|R
50|$|The MG 08, {{like the}} Maxim gun, {{operated}} {{on the basis}} of short barrel recoil and a toggle <b>lock.</b> Once <b>cocked</b> and fired the MG 08 would continue firing rounds until the trigger was released or until all available ammunition was expended. Its practical range was estimated at some 2000 m up to an extreme range of 3600 m. The MG 08 was mounted on a sled mount (Schlittenlafette) that was ferried between locations either on carts or else carried above mens shoulders {{in the manner of a}} stretcher.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{the command}} [...] "Make Ready", the musket was brought {{straight}} up, {{perpendicular to the}} ground, with the left hand on the swell of the musket stock, the lock turned toward the soldier's face, and the soldier's right hand pulled the <b>lock</b> to full <b>cock,</b> and grasped the wrist of the musket.|$|R
60|$|Taking a {{very long}} and {{deliberate}} aim at the bear's heart, he pulled the trigger, but the faithless lock of his old flint-gun missed fire. Without a sign of annoyance or agitation, the trapper recocked the gun, again pulled the trigger, and with the same result. Three times this occurred, and at each click of the <b>lock</b> the bear <b>cocked</b> his ears inquiringly. The third time, he rose and sauntered slowly towards {{the spot where the}} men lay concealed.|$|R
50|$|Relations between Tyler and Perry soured in wake of Tyler {{falling off}} the stage in Sturgis and reached a fever pitch in late November when a heavily publicized feud erupted in which Tyler was {{supposedly}} {{going to leave the}} band and be replaced by another singer. Tensions cooled after Tyler returned from rehab, where he was seeking treatment for an addiction to painkillers, and the band announced a world tour to take place in 2010, entitled the <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> Ready to Rock Tour.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> Ready to Rock Tour was {{a concert}} tour by American hard rock band Aerosmith {{that took place}} during mid-2010. In late {{spring and early summer}} of 2010, the band {{performed}} in South America and Europe, respectively, marking their first concerts on those continents since 2007. During the second half of summer, the band toured North America. Prior to the tour, the band confirmed that the lead singer would be Steven Tyler, after rumors of his departure in late 2009.|$|R
5|$|While {{announcing the}} <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> and Ready to Rock Tour in 2009, Tyler and Perry {{said that the}} next item on the agenda was a new Aerosmith album, the group's first since 2004's Honkin' on Bobo. The group did some {{recording}} with producer Brendan O'Brien in 2008 but halted because of Tyler's health problems. Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the {{time and energy to}} continue fronting the band while also being a judge on American Idol.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{like the}} later flintlock devices, it {{contained}} the flint, frizzen, and pan, yet had an external catch as a half-cock safety, {{known as the}} [...] "dog". This type of lock had no internal, half-cock loading position as the later flintlock mechanism contained. To load a firearm with a dog <b>lock,</b> the <b>cock</b> was secured with the external dog, preventing it from moving forward to strike the frizzen and begin the firing sequence. The user could then safely load the musket or pistol. To fire, the cock {{was moved to the}} full-cock position, which caused the dog to fall backward and no longer prevent the lock from firing. A pull of the trigger would then fire the piece. This fell out of favor with the British before 1720. Later flintlocks would contain no such catch, as the half-cock position had been created with the internal parts of the lock.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} {{a staple of}} Aerosmith concerts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was {{included}} on the album Classics Live!. This version was also included on Pandoras Box. However, the band has rarely played it since. The band brought the song back into the set list during shows in Providence, Rhode Island and Anaheim, California in 2005 and 2006 on the Rockin the Joint Tour, and in São Paulo, Brazil and Sölvesborg, Sweden in 2010 on the <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> Ready to Rock Tour. However, the band tends to favor performing Draw the Lines other single, the title track, {{which has become a}} live staple as of late.|$|R
500|$|Problems on the band's <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> and Ready to Rock Tour {{arose in}} August 2010, {{including}} Tyler accidentally hitting Joe Perry {{in the head}} with his microphone stand at a show in Wantagh, New York and Perry bumping into Tyler at the Toronto show, which caused Tyler to tumble off the stage. Perry suffered a minor head injury at the Wantagh show and Tyler was helped back up by fans and Perry at the Toronto show, and both shows went on. Around the same time as these incidents, tension flared again between Perry and Tyler due to Tyler's plans to become a talent judge on American Idol. Perry criticized Tyler for not consulting the rest of the band, saying that he [...] "found out on the internet, {{like the rest of the}} world" [...] and that nobody else in the band knew anything about it.|$|R
2500|$|On December 22, 2009, Rolling Stone {{reported}} that Tyler had checked into rehab for pain management. In 2010, he embarked on the <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> Ready to Rock Tour with Aerosmith, which had them perform over 40 concerts in 18 countries. On September 16, 2010, {{it was reported}} he would have his first solo project. He wrote [...] "Love Lives", a theme song for the Japanese sci-fi movie Space Battleship Yamato. The song {{was based on the}} English translated script, as well as on some clips of the film itself. The single was released on November 24, a week before the movie was released. A preview of the single can be heard in the movie's trailers. On September 22, 2010, Fox confirmed that Tyler would replace Simon Cowell as a judge for the tenth season of American Idol alongside Randy Jackson and fellow new judge Jennifer Lopez (who replaced Kara DioGuardi and Ellen DeGeneres). In December 2010, Tyler performed at the Kennedy Center Honors, honoring Paul McCartney by performing several tracks from Abbey Road.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is entirely}} made in {{stainless}} steel (a first for semi-auto pistols), with polymer grips and high-capacity magazine. The Mamba works in semi-automatic, recoil-operated, locked-breech single/double action {{based on the}} Browning principle. Its only safety was a Browning-style frame mounted safety that locks the hammer and the slide. Like the M1911 and FN GP-35/Browning Hi-Power pistols, the hammer could be <b>locked</b> either in <b>cocked</b> or in lowered position, allowing the gun to be carried in [...] "cocked and locked" [...] state, with safety on. The Mamba doesn't have any decocking system, which is unusual for a SA/DA pistol. The similarities that this pistol bears with the Smith & Wesson series of full-size semi-automatic pistols are coincidental and superficial. The grip-mounted magazine release and the slide stop are placed only {{on the left side}} of the pistol, but the frame-mounted safety is placed ambidextrously.The standard magazine issued with the Mamba was a 15-round high capacity type with a single position feed. Also planned were 20, 25, 30, and 40-round high-capacity magazines, but none of these were actually produced.|$|R

5000|$|The wheel-lock enjoyed only a {{brief period}} of {{popularity}} before being superseded by a simpler, more robust design. The [...] "flintlock", like the wheel-lock, used a flashpan and a spark to ignite the powder. As the name implies, the flintlock used flint rather than iron pyrite. The flint was held in a spring-loaded arm, called the [...] "cock" [...] from the resemblance of its motion to a pecking chicken. The cock rotated through approximately a 90 degree arc, and was held in the tensioned, or [...] "cocked" [...] position by a trigger. Usually, flintlocks could <b>lock</b> the <b>cock</b> in two positions. The [...] "half-cock" [...] position held the cock halfway back, and used a deep notch, so that pulling the trigger would not release the cock. Half-cock was a safety position, used when loading, storing or carrying a loaded flintlock. The [...] "full-cock" [...] position held the cock all the way back, and was the position from which the gun was fired. The L-shaped [...] "frizzen" [...] was {{the other half of the}} flintlock's ignition system. It served as both a flashpan cover and a steel striking surface for the flint. The frizzen was hinged and spring-loaded so that it would lock in the open or closed position. When closed, the striking surface was positioned so that the flint would strike at the proper angle to generate a spark. The striking flint would also open the frizzen, exposing the flashpan to the spark. The flintlock mechanism was simpler and stronger than the wheel-lock, and the flint and steel provided a good, reliable source of ignition. The flintlock remained in military service for over 200 years, and flintlocks are still made today for historical re-enactments and muzzle-loading target competition, and for hunters who enjoy the additional challenge that the flintlock provides.|$|R
500|$|On February 15, 2010, it was {{announced}} that Aerosmith were to headline Download Festival at Donington Park, England in June 2010. Tyler was confirmed as the frontman for the show by festival promoter Andy Copping. It {{was announced}} that the band would precede the June 13 date with an appearance at the Sweden Rock Festival on June 10 in Sölvesborg. During the Donington show, Perry celebrated Tyler's position as frontman, dubbing him [...] "the best lead singer on the planet". On February 24, the band announced the first batch of dates for their upcoming <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> Ready to Rock Tour. The tour saw the band play seven dates in South and Central America in May, followed by eleven dates in Europe, in June and early July. The band performed in Colombia, Peru and Greece {{for the first time in}} their career on this tour. The band performed 24 concerts in North America in late July, August, and September. Many of the concerts were in locations the band canceled on in 2009. As part of the tour, the band played Fenway Park in Boston with fellow Bostonians the J. Geils Band.|$|R
50|$|After the Baker entered service, more {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the rifle and several different variations were produced. A lighter and shorter carbine version for the cavalry was introduced, and a number of volunteer associations procured their own models, including the Duke of Cumberland's Corps of Sharpshooters, which ordered models with a 33-inch barrel, in August 1803. A second pattern of Baker Rifle was fitted with a 'Newland' lock that had a flat-faced ring neck cock. In 1806, a third pattern was produced that included a 'pistol grip' style trigger guard and a smaller patchbox with a plain rounded front. The lock plate was smaller, flat, and had a steeped-down tail, a raised semi-waterproof pan, a flat ring neck cock, and a sliding safety bolt. With the introduction of a new pattern Short Land Pattern Flintlock Musket ('Brown Bess') in 1810, with its flat <b>lock</b> and ring-necked <b>cock,</b> the Baker's <b>lock</b> followed suit for what became the fourth pattern. It also featured a 'slit stock'—the stock had a slot cut in its underpart just over a quarter-inch wide. This was done after Ezekiel Baker had seen reports of the ramrod jamming in the stock after the build-up of residue in the ramrod channel, and when the wood warped after getting wet.|$|R
5000|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, a {{video game}} {{featuring}} the band's songs, was released in 2008. In 2009, while on tour with Aerosmith, Perry {{announced that he would}} be releasing a new Joe Perry Project album entitled Have Guitar, Will Travel, which was released on October 6, 2009. The first single from the album was [...] "We've Got a Long Way to Go." [...] This marks the first Joe Perry Project album since 1983's Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker, and the fifth Joe Perry solo album in total, counting the 2005 self-titled album. He toured Europe and the States in late 2009 and early 2010 in support of the album. After Tyler fell off a stage during an Aerosmith show in August 2009 in Sturgis, South Dakota during the band's Guitar Hero: Aerosmith Tour (causing the rest of the ill-fated tour to be canceled), tensions flared between Tyler and his bandmates, especially Perry, and {{it got to the point}} where the band members weren't speaking to each other. Media reports began to circulate that Tyler had left the band and that Perry and the other members of Aerosmith were seeking out a new singer to replace Tyler. On November 10, 2009, at a Joe Perry Project concert in New York City, Tyler made a surprise appearance, assuring the crowd he was not quitting Aerosmith and performed [...] "Walk This Way" [...] with the band. After Tyler completed drug rehabilitation in early 2010, he got back together with his bandmates and they announced a world tour called the <b>Cocked,</b> <b>Locked,</b> Ready to Rock Tour which took place in the spring and summer of 2010. While on tour, several on-stage incidents (including Tyler accidentally hitting Perry in the head with his mic stand and Perry bumping Tyler off the stage) as well as Tyler signing on to be a judge on American Idol without telling his bandmates caused tensions to again flare between Tyler and Perry, but cooled once again by the time the tour ended.|$|R
