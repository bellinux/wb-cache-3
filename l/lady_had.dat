5|$|The {{population}} of the Inner Court varied over different periods, but by all accounts it was large. Each queen consort had her own household of around 200 to 300 women. Her various ladies-in-waiting were usually recruited from noble families; others were minor princesses who would also have a retinue of servants. Each minor wife or consort (เจ้าจอม; Chao Chom) had a fairly large household; this would increase significantly if {{she gave birth to}} the king's child, as she would be elevated to the rank of consort mother (เจ้าจอมมารดา; Chao Chom Manda). Each royal <b>lady</b> <b>had</b> a separate establishment, the size of which was in proportion to her rank and status in accordance with palace law. Altogether the {{population of}} the Inner Court numbered nearly 3,000 inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|About 150 {{people were}} present. Jean-Baptiste Estrade (a tax inspector), Duffo (a court official), and the {{officers}} from the garrison were present. Soubirous said later that the <b>lady</b> <b>had</b> told her a secret, which was only for her alone; this secret was never revealed to anyone.|$|E
25|$|The {{auricles}} of {{her ears}} {{were found in}} much different condition. Part of the right auricle is missing, {{and can not be}} used to determine her appearance in life. Her left auricle is in a better condition, and two piercings were located in its earlobe. The <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> a double-pierced ear.|$|E

25|$|In {{his poem}} Ludovico Ariosto relates how Marphise, the woman warrior, knocks the knight Pinabello off his horse after his <b>lady</b> <b>had</b> mocked Marphise's companion, {{the old woman}} Gabrina. In Marphise by Eugène Delacroix, Pinabello lies on the ground, and his horse gallops off in the distance. The knight's lady, meanwhile, is forced to disrobe and give her fancy {{clothing}} to Gabrina. Marphise's horse, undisturbed by the drama, nonchalantly munches on the leaves overhead.|$|E
25|$|By 4 December of {{the same}} year, it was {{confirmed}} that the tip of the Blue Lady's bow had been cut; a ceremonial move done to most ships that end up in Alang just prior to the full-scale breaking of a ship. It was confirmed on 20 January that the Blue <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> commenced scrapping. Scrapping began on the forward part of the sun deck. The suites added during the 1990 refit were gone by March, briefly returning the ship to her pre-1990 profile.|$|E

25|$|In {{the brutal}} coastal weather, the figurehead {{gradually}} became weathered and eroded. Then, during Hurricane Barbara in 1953, it was significantly damaged and was removed to a city-owned building for safe-keeping. Subsequently, {{a few years}} later, city officials could not locate it, speculating {{that it had been}} stolen, or destroyed by accident. Figureheads had long-since been discontinued as a feature of most ships, but the Norwegian <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> become more than a mere ship's figurehead to the people of Virginia Beach; she was a memorial and a community icon.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{the image}} was taken to Piat, and {{enshrined}} on a side altar. It was not long when the people felt special manifestations of divine favors through Our Lady. Their love and devotion to Our <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> grown with the years, and attachment to her image bordered fantacism. This was clearly seen when Fr. Juan De Santa Ana sent the same image to Tuguegarao City in 1622 and ordered another one more beautiful from Manila to replace the image. The people promptly protested this, insisting that the original image be returned to them. Fr. de Santa Ana finally gave in, and {{the image was}} brought back amidst great rejoicing. There arose, however, a dispute between the peoples of Piat and Tuao as to where the image's sanctuary should be; both towns agreed to build the shrine midway between them.|$|E
25|$|In {{a famous}} example of {{hypothesis}} testing, {{known as the}} Lady tasting tea, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a female colleague of Fisher claimed {{to be able to}} tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (<nbsp&5%; 1 of 70 ≈nbsp&1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically significant result.|$|E

Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, [...] "she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little-known organizations..." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Myra Gutin, {{this was}} the first time in history that a First <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> ever directly reached out to historians to talk about her accomplishments. Attendants of the meeting said that Bush wanted to change the perception that she was a traditional First Lady in that she always stayed by her husband's side. Bush's chief of staff Anita McBride called this characterization of Bush [...] "unfair" [...] and though conceding that she was traditional, McBride noted Bush broke from tradition in addressing issues that were not customary.|$|E

Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that [...] "She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s." [...] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked [...] "Are you serious?"

[...] In 2000 Independent Counsel Robert Ray issued his final report on Filegate, stating that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that senior White House figures or the First <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone's hiring. [...] A separate lawsuit on the matter brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, lingered on for years and was dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.|$|E

500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of the Clinton Administration, {{often referred}} to as Filegate, arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. [...] The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top presidential advisors. [...] Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. [...] Allegations were made that senior White House figures, including First Lady Hillary Clinton, may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.|$|E
500|$|The third game, , {{serves as}} a prequel to the first game and {{features}} a cockier and younger Dante. In the story, Dante is drawn out by his brother Vergil, who is attempting to reopen the portal to the demon world {{in order to obtain}} the full power of Sparda, which remains on the other side contained within the sword Force Edge. Along the way, Dante encounters Lady, who is in pursuit of her father Arkham, who is working with Vergil, but has plans of his own. In the end, Dante claims ownership of the Force Edge, while Vergil chooses to remain in the demon world. Inspired by Lady's courage and commitment to her own family, Dante continues his business with a greater sense of purpose. They become friends, and he decides to call his shop [...] "Devil May Cry", after something <b>Lady</b> <b>had</b> said to comfort him.|$|E
