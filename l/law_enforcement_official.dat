All deputy sheriffs are certified, sworn law enforcement officials with full power of arrest. All sworn members of the sheriff's office are agents of the U.S. state of Maryland and thus have authority throughout the entire state, although direct jurisdiction {{is limited to the}} Seventh Judicial Circuit of Maryland, which includes Calvert County, Charles County, Prince George's County, and St. Mary's County.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>official</b> from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the most}} notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E
5|$|Salford was anciently {{part of the}} Manchester parish of the Salford Hundred, an area {{much larger}} than the present-day city of Salford, within the {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire. A stroke of a Norman baron's pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford, although it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester, but Manchester, with its humbler line of lords, that was separated from Salford. Salford received its town charter from Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, then Lord of the Manor, in 1230. From then until 1791, when police commissioners were appointed, it was governed by a reeve, a medieval administrator and <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>official.</b> It was not recognised as a borough in the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, but was granted borough status in 1844; the new Salford borough was made up of the township of Salford and part of Broughton. The remainder of Broughton, and a part of Pendlebury, were added in 1853.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{primarily}} {{designed for use}} by counterterrorism and <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> Terrorist Recognition Handbook is structured into six main sections of information and resources. Appendix resources include explanations of combustible materials, a reference to existing terrorist networks, {{and a list of}} works cited. Nance's main thesis throughout the work is that <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> must remain vigilant for potential terrorist activities. He compares and contrasts the field of counterterrorism to ordinary criminal prevention, noting that in both cases <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> should become experts on developing awareness of commons behavior patterns of suspects.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The {{free flow of information}} among federal, state, and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism. State and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> are key stakeholders in the United States' efforts to combat terrorism, and as such, they may require access to classified national security information to help prevent or respond to terrorist attacks. In order to gain access to such information, state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> generally need federal security clearances. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants security clearances and shares classified information with state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> Immediately following September 11, 2001, some state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining security clearances. Others expressed frustration with the length of time it took to obtain a security clearance. These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> stakeholders that the lack of security clearances could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to {{the state and local level}}, from the state and local level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> This report provides information on: (1) the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials,</b> (2) the extent to which the FBI has met its time frame goals for processing security clearance applications for state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> and factors that could affect the timely processing of security clearance applications, and (3) efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance its security clearance and information-sharing processes with state and local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Terrorist Recognition Handbook: A Practitioner's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism strategies, written by U.S. Navy retired {{cryptology}} analyst Malcolm Nance. The book {{is intended to}} help law enforcement and intelligence officials with the professional practice of behavior analysis and criminal psychology of anticipating potential terrorists before they commit criminal acts. Nance draws {{from the field of}} traditional criminal analysis to posit that detecting domestic criminals is similar to determining which individuals are likely to commit acts of terrorism. The book provides resources for the <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>official</b> including descriptions of devices used for possible bombs, a database of terrorist networks, and a list of references used. Nance gives the reader background on Al-Qaeda tactics, clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents, and terrorist communication methods.|$|E

Federal authorities told the Associated Press they did not believe Schlesselman and Cowart had the means to carry out their threat. Barack Obama did not have any campaign appearances planned for Tennessee. One federal <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>official</b> told the AP that [...] plans did not include Obama's schedule or a specific time and place for the assassination because, [...] "I don't think they had that level of detail." [...] Authorities said they made several mistakes during their planning, including drawing too much attention to themselves with their car markings. Authorities also felt their inability to carry out a home robbery together indicated they would be unable to carry out a sophisticated assassination plot.

500|$|When {{a person}} is arrested and taken into police custody, he has been seized (i.e., a {{reasonable}} person who is handcuffed {{and placed in the}} back of a police car would not think they were free to leave). A person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand, has been seized, but is not [...] "arrested" [...] because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal arrest. If {{a person is}} not under suspicion of illegal behavior, a <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>official</b> is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity, provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case. A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment, so long as the arresting officer has probable cause. In Maryland v. King (2013), the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes, along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, however, TreviÃ±o Morales's {{criminal}} organization {{entered a}} new internal strife after JesÃºs Enrique RejÃ³n Aguilar (alias El Mamito), one of their highest-ranking leaders, was arrested in July. Though he did not call out any names, he stated that someone within Los Zetas had betrayed him. Shortly thereafter, alleged organized crime members uploaded a narcocorrido music video on YouTube portraying TreviÃ±o Morales [...] "as the New Judas" [...] and accusing him of setting up the arrests and deaths of other commanders within the criminal organization and being disloyal to Lazcano Lazcano, his boss. In several articles published in August 2012, a U.S. <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>official</b> told the press that TreviÃ±o Morales had successfully taken {{the leadership of the}} cartel and displaced Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, the long-time leader. TreviÃ±o Morales began to take over the assets of Los Zetas and was working to remove Lazcano Lazcano as the head since early 2010. Amidst the Zetas civil war, many high-ranking members in Los Zetas began to fall. High-ranking Zetas leader IvÃ¡n VelÃ¡zquez Caballero (alias El TalibÃ¡n) was arrested in September 2012, presumably set up either by rival gang members or gangsters aligned with a group related to TreviÃ±o Morales. On 6 October 2012, drug lord Salvador Alfonso MartÃ­nez Escobedo (alias La Ardilla) was arrested in Nuevo Laredo by the Mexican Navy. After VelÃ¡zquez's fall, a split off group known as Los Legionarios (The Legionaries) was born in Nuevo Laredo and vowed to bring down TreviÃ±o Morales for allegedly betraying him. A second faction from Los Zetas, known as Sangre Zeta (Zetas Blood), also broke up from the organization to join forces against him.|$|E
