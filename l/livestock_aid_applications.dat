40|$|To {{help develop}} {{ultra-low}} power wireless hearing aid products, we investigate {{the integration of}} subband audio coding with hearing <b>aid</b> <b>applications.</b> Both the audio coding and the hearing <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> use subband processing, but their requirements for the filterbanks are totally different. The hearing <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> typically uses an oversampled filterbank to reduce the aliasing in each subband, whereas the audio codec needs a critically sampled filterbank for maximal coding efficiency. A joint filterbank structure is proposed in this paper to satisfy these contradictive filterbank requirements. With this structure, the two filterbanks are combined into a single stereo filterbank operation, which can be efficiently implemented on a filterbank coprocessor. This structure substantially reduces the computation complexity, power consumption and memory usage.

The motivation behind this assumption is that in most real-life situations, for instance, a conversation, the user is facing the desired sound source. In a free field, the two-microphone GSC can cancel out an interfering sound source without distorting the desired signal, which is a desirable feature in hearing aids. Thus, the GSC is well suited for hearing <b>aid</b> <b>applications,</b> and we study the impact of quantization errors on the GSC in this paper.|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} harvest <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is critical, and poses {{potential}} problems when mistimed. The consequences of premature harvest <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> {{could result in}} reduced profit to the grower through {{the need for additional}} applications, reduced lint yield, poor fiber quality, and/or delayed harvest. A delayed <b>application</b> of harvest <b>aid</b> materials may also reduce lint yield and fiber quality if late season inclement weather patterns are established. Currently, there are many methods utilized for determining <b>application</b> of harvest <b>aid</b> materials. One method utilizes accumulated heat units, or growing degree days (HU or DD 60 ??s), following plant physiological maturity. Physiological maturity (cutout) is identified as nodes above white flower equals 5 (NAWF= 5). This method triggers the <b>application</b> of harvest <b>aid</b> chemicals when 850 HU have been accumulated beyond cutout. Due to differing environmental and edaphic characteristics across the Cotton Belt, <b>application</b> of harvest <b>aid</b> chemicals at this time may be premature in terms of optimizing lint yield and fiber quality. A two-year study was established to determine the proper timing of harvest <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> for picker harvested cotton in south central Texas. The design utilized a split-plot with four replications. The main plots consisted of three nodal positions(NAWF= 3, 4, and 5), and the subplots were five HU accumulations (650, 750, 850, 950, and 1050) that corresponded to each of the nodal positions. In both years, lint yields increased with an increase in HU accumulation. Greater yields were achieved when HU accumulation was initiated after NAWF = 4. This two-year study indicates that harvest <b>aid</b> <b>applications</b> made at NAWF = 4 plus 1050 HU would optimize yield potential for picker harvested cotton in south central Texas...|$|R

These algorithms are configurable to fit the various hearing impairments of different users. They pose significant challenges to digital hearing aids, having strict area and power consumption constraints. First, a typical digital hearing <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> is proposed and implemented, comprising all critical parts of today’s products. Then a small area and ultra low-power 16 -bit processor is designed for the application domain.
