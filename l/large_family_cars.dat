2500|$|A class {{described}} as [...] "large family" [...] in Europe and [...] "mid-size" [...] in the USA, these cars {{have room for}} five adults and a large trunk (boot). Engines are more powerful than small family/compact cars and six-cylinder engines are more common than in smaller cars.

50|$|<b>Large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> {{were usually}} around 4.50 m in length {{by the early}} 1990s, but are now {{shifting}} to 4.80 m or more in length. Examples of <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> include the Ford Mondeo, Opel/Vauxhall Insignia, Peugeot 508, and Volkswagen Passat. <b>Large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> can also be flagships such as the Citroen C5, Honda Accord, Luxgen S5, Mazda6, Mitsubishi Galant and the Škoda Superb.|$|E

The third generation {{is expected to be}} released in 2018.|$|R
50|$|Production ceased in December 1996, and Fiat {{abandoned}} the <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> segment. Because the Bravo/Brava based Fiat Marea small <b>family</b> <b>car</b> débuted {{at the same}} time, it is sometimes said that the Marea replaced the Croma, but in fact Fiat never had a <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> after the Croma (until the resurrection in 2005), and Fiat eventually abandoned this segment of the worldwide market altogether.|$|R
50|$|MQB models may {{range from}} {{superminis}} to <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars,</b> replacing the current generations of models. The MQB architecture replaces the PQ25, PQ35 and PQ46 platforms.|$|E

5000|$|Fiat Powertrain Technologies (FPT) started {{production}} of [...] "TCT" [...] dual dry-clutch transmission (DDCT) in early 2010 at the Verrone plant.

5000|$|With 155,780 units sold {{during the}} ten month {{life of the}} P7a, the car was {{actually}} being produced at a significantly slower rate than the less ambitiously targeted Taunus P5. The company’s hard work in promoting the car, the simplified lines of the P7b, and a relatively benign economic backdrop accounted for an improved rate {{during the period of}} slightly above three years between August 1968 and December 1971 during which 567, 482 of the cars were produced. [...] The dominance in the sector enjoyed by the Opel Rekord was not challenged, however, and while neither Ford nor Opel will have been unduly alarmed by Volkswagen’s ventures into the production of <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> with their interesting but commercially unpersuasive 411/412 and K70 models, the arrival in 1968 of the Audi 100 suggested than the market place for <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> was not about to become any more comfortable for Ford.|$|E
50|$|The Rover 600 Series is a <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> {{range that}} was {{produced}} by the British manufacturer Rover from 1993 to 1999.|$|R
50|$|Launched in October 1931, the Monaquatre {{was similar}} in design to Renault Primaquatre <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> {{with which it}} shared its 2650 mm wheelbase.|$|R
5000|$|The GAZ-24 was the Eastern Bloc's <b>largest</b> <b>family</b> <b>car,</b> but proved {{difficult}} {{for families to}} actually obtain, with official purchases at first taking precedence.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was based}} on an unusual concept of a very large {{hatchback}} with a nearly vertical tailgate. Its dimensions place it between traditional <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> and executive cars. In most markets, it was also priced accordingly (more expensive than the Opel Vectra, but less than e.g. Audi A6). The Opel Signum was intended to capture a whole new market segment.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{or not the}} car {{genuinely}} made Ford's sales expectations, {{the shifting}} European car market {{at the end of}} the 1990s meant that it was not directly replaced. This was not unusual at the time, with the market trending towards either high spec <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> for executives or towards multi-purpose vehicles for families. Also, at that time Ford's owning Jaguar and Volvo made the Scorpio unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Specs and trim-levels vary a lot {{in these}} cars. The compact {{executive}} cars generally have a sporty drive and are very driver-orientated, while <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> or mid-size cars are geared towards every-day use for transporting people and other goods. As with E-segment cars, they can come in several body-types, coupés being common with the compact executive cars, and station wagons for practical family-use.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the launch}} of the smaller Ascona in September 1970, the Rekord was marketed as an {{executive}} car rather than a <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tatra 600, {{named the}} Tatraplan, was a rear-engined <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> (D-segment in Europe) {{produced}} from 1946 to 1952 by the Czech manufacturer Tatra.|$|R

50|$|The Compact {{platform}} (also {{known as}} C-Evo) {{was developed by}} engineers of the Fiat group {{for the construction of}} small family cars (compact cars) and <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> (mid-size cars) with front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The first incarnation of this platform was the Alfa Romeo Giulietta which was unveiled in 2010. Fiat has invested 100 million euros into the construction of the Compact Platform.|$|E
50|$|The P7, {{with its}} wider engine range {{was aimed at}} a {{significantly}} broader market segment than the Taunus P5. It is also noteworthy that the market segment for <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> represented {{a greater share of}} the total market in Germany than in most European markets. Germany’s top selling large family car, the Opel Rekord was for several years the second best selling car in Germany, beaten to the top spot only by the Volkswagen.|$|E
50|$|Some luxury {{vehicles}} are offered with long-wheelbase variants {{to increase the}} spaciousness and therefore the luxury of the vehicle. This practice can often be found on full-size cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but ultra-luxury vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom and even <b>large</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> like the Rover 75 came with 'limousine' versions. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair was given a long-wheelbase version of the Rover 75 for official use.|$|E
