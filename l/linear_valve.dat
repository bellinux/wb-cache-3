It used a similar layout of paired cylinders, in numbers from two to eight. It too was built for double- and triple-expansion. Like the Willans engine it used {{single-acting}} cylinders and also used the Willans air-cushion trunk guide. It differed in the design of its valves, as these were rotary. Each pair of cylinders had a shared rotary valve between them, driven by a half-speed bevel gear. Like the Paget locomotive, the valves were of cast-iron and ran in a phosphor bronze sleeve within the cylinder. As the valve and cylinders must operate in phase, the ports are duplicated. The advantage overall is a reduction in <b>linear</b> <b>valve</b> speed. Such rotary valves were often tried at this period, yet rarely successfully. Lubrication was difficult at this time and superheating was limited, if the valves were not to seize.|$|E

The approach was to model the non-Newtonian flow in a plasticating single-screw extruder. A finite-difference scheme was developed to model the flow through annular surfaces. The two flow equations were solved simultaneously and a parametric study was performed to determine the optimal valve geometry. The valve operability was evaluated for the extrusion of various mixtures of low-density polyethylene, sawdust, wood flour, and vacuum bottom.

40|$|A key {{enabling}} technology to effective on/off valve based control of hydraulic systems is the high speed on/off valve. High speed valves improve system efficiency for a given PWM fre-quency, offer faster control bandwidth, and produce smaller out-put pressure ripples. Current valves rely on the linear translation of a spool or poppet to meter flow. The valve spool must re-verse direction twice per PWM cycle. This constant acceleration and deceleration of the spool requires a power input proportional to the PWM frequency cubed. As a result, current <b>linear</b> <b>valves</b> are severely limited in their switching frequencies. In this paper, we present a novel fluid driven PWM on/off valve design {{that is based on}} a unidirectional rotary spool. The spool is rotated by capturing momentum from the fluid flow through the valve. The on/off functionality of our design is achieved via helical barri-ers that protrude from the surface of a cylindrical spool. As the spool rotates, the helical barriers selectively channel the flow to the application (on) or to tank (off). The duty ratio is controlled by altering the axial position of the spool. Since the spool no longer accelerates or decelerates during operation, the power in-put to drive the valve must only compensate for viscous friction, which is proportional to the PWM frequency squared. We predict that our current design, sized for a nominal flow rate of 40 l/m, can achieve a PWM frequency of 84 Hz. This paper presents our valve concept, design equations, and an analysis of predicted per-formance. A simulation of our design is also presented. ...|$|R

Performance testing at Hamilton Sundstrand on CAMRAS # 3, which incorporates a new valve and modified canister design, showed similar CO 2 and humidity removal performance as CAMRAS # 1 and # 2, demonstrating that the system form can be modified within certain bounds with little to no effect in system function or performance.

In front of a high reported sensitivity using transesophageal echocardiography, specificity is difficult to assess, due to possible underreporting of diagnostic errors. We describe a false positive diagnosis of sinus venosus atrial septal defect, in the setting of enlarged right chambers of the heart because of pressure overload. Modified anatomy of the heart, together with the presence of a prominent <b>linear</b> structure(probably Eustachian <b>Valve)</b> and an incomplete examination in this case made image interpretation very prone to misinterpretation. In this anatomical setting transesophageal longitudinal "bicaval" view may be sub-optimal for examining the atrial septum, potentially showing false images that need to be known for correct image interpretation. Nonetheless, a scan plane taken more accurately at the superior level would have demonstrated/excluded the pathognomonic feature of sinus venosus atrial septal defect in the high atrial septum, between the fatty limbus and the inferior aspect of the right pulmonary artery; moreover TEE allows morphological information about the posterior structures of the heart that need to be investigated in detail for a complete diagnosis. </p...|$|R
