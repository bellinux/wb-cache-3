5|$|Originally {{a bottle}} {{conditioned}} beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> content. Finally, the beer is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, <b>lactic</b> <b>acid,</b> salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
25|$|The enzymatic method {{allows for}} a {{quantitative}} measurement of both malic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids,</b> but requires the expense of reagent kits and a spectrophotometer that can measure absorbance values at 334, 340, or 365 nm.|$|R
40|$|Hyperglycemia in rats {{develops}} in acute period of severe craniocerebral trauma: glucose consumption in rats’ brain increases, lactic acidosis develops, {{and the content}} of ATP decreases. Piracetam (200 mg/kg) does not eliminate hyperglycaemia but normalizes the level of intermediates of energy metabolism. Corvitin (100 – 150 mg/kg) eliminates hyperglycemia, normalizes the pyruvic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids,</b> significantly increases the level of ATP. Lipoflavon (370 mg/kg) normalizes the blood level of glucose, increases the concentration of pyruvic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids,</b> but it is worse than corvitin in its influence on ATP. Antihyperglycemic effect of lipoflavon is weaker at a dose of 555 mg/kg. The results illustrate craniocerebral effect of quercetin preparations...|$|R
50|$|Due to <b>lactic</b> <b>acid's</b> {{keratolytic}} properties (to {{break down}} hard skin cells) and urea's hydrating properties, Calmurid is used {{primarily in the}} treatment of dry, scaly skin.

5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid,</b> which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E

50|$|A Gemella {{species was}} first {{described}} as Neisseria hemolysans in 1938. It was reclassified {{as a new}} genus in 1960 when strains {{were found to be}} distinct enough from Neisseria to require a new genus. The name was suggested based on the organism being a diplococcus and gemellus is the diminutive of geminus, which is Latin for twin. They are facultatively anaerobic and give negative reactions to both oxidase and catalase tests. They are obligately fermentative, producing either a mixture of acetic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids</b> or an equimolar molar mixture of acetic acid and CO2. For example, G. haemolysans ferments glucose forming a mixture of acetic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids</b> in the absence of oxygen, whereas when oxygen is present, it forms acetic acid and CO2.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{organic acids}} are weak acids {{and do not}} dissociate {{completely}} in water, whereas the strong mineral acids do. Lower molecular mass organic acids such as formic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids</b> are miscible in water, but higher molecular mass organic acids, such as benzoic acid, are insoluble in molecular (neutral) form.|$|R
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} bacterium Rhodopseudomonas capsulata {{can grow}} under anaerobic conditions with light as the energy source or, alternatively, in darkness with D-fructose or certain other sugars {{as the sole}} source of carbon and energy. Growth in the latter mode requires an "accessory oxidant" such as trimethylamine-N-oxide, and the resulting cells contain the photosynthetic pigments characteristic of R. capsulata (associated with intracytoplasmic membranes) and substantial deposits of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. In dark anaerobic batch cultures in fructose plus trimethylamine-N-oxide medium, trimethylamine formation parallels growth, and typical fermentation products accumulate, namely, CO 2 and formic, acetic, and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids.</b> These products are also found in dark anaerobic continuous cultures of R. capsulata; acetic acid and CO 2 predominate when fructose is limiting, whereas formic and <b>lactic</b> <b>acids</b> are observed at elevated concentrations when trimethylamine-N-oxide is the limiting nutrient. Evidence is presented to support the conclusions that ATP generation during anaerobic dark growth of R. capsulata on fructose plus trimethylamine-N-oxide occurs by substrate level phosphorylations associated with classical glycolysis and pyruvate dissimilation, and that the required accessory oxidant functions as an electron sink to permit the management of fermentative redox balance, {{rather than as a}} terminal electron acceptor necessary for electron transport-driven phosphorylation...|$|R
