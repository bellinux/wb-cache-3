The appeal was {{seconded}} by the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. In the 1991 municipal election, the Socialist <b>Left</b> <b>Party</b> {{was the only}} party which was opposed to the fixed link, and they received a large increase in votes, increasing for 7 to 21 percent in Stord.

5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to sit on the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to sit on the committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist <b>Left</b> <b>Party,</b> each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E

The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member.

5|$|The {{issue of}} {{advanced}} tolls was {{reviewed by the}} county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist <b>Left</b> <b>Party,</b> the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link, as {{there would not be}} sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK200 and 300 million, and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997. In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor of the Triangle Link. The Socialist Left Party's proposal to build neither received 11 votes.|$|E

This preference is shared by their partners, the Green Party, {{as well as the}} <b>Left</b> <b>Party.</b> The centre-right Moderate Party and the Liberal Party are the largest parties by current parliamentary representation in favor of NATO membership. The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea is credited with renewed public calls for NATO membership from notable politicians. The Centre Party was opposed to NATO membership until September 2015, when party leadership under Annie Lööf announced that they would motion to change the party policy in order to push for Sweden to join NATO at their next party conference. The Christian Democrats, also previously opposed, likewise voted to support NATO membership at their party meeting on 9 October 2015.|$|E

The broadcast was viewed by over 100 million viewers worldwide. He also made two appearances on Fox News, first on the TV special The Rescue Rumble and later on Your World, both shows were hosted by Neil Cavuto. He later appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central TV series The Colbert Report, a news satire show about modern American politics. According to Moore, the decision to have him on the show came from Stephen Colbert, the current host for the TV series. A spokeswoman from Comedy Central {{would not comment on}} the motives behind the selection. Moore also wrote several articles in The Nation, The New Republic and National Journal, and the newspapers The St. Petersburg Times, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. The {{question of whether or not}} Barack Obama was a socialist, led to an increased interest in Moore during the election. The <b>Left</b> <b>Party,</b> a Swedish democratic socialist political party, officially endorsed Moore for president during a televised debate in Sweden.|$|E

25|$|Höglund was a radical, revolutionary socialist and was {{the main}} leader of the Left Opposition in the Social Democratic Party, against the reformist {{politics}} of the party leader Hjalmar Branting. In 1917, Zeth Höglund and the left-wing were expelled from the party but they regrouped as the Swedish Social Democratic <b>Left</b> <b>Party,</b> which supported the Bolsheviks in Russia and worked for the aim of a communist revolution in Sweden. This new party would soon become the (original) Communist Party of Sweden (SKP) and still exists today as the <b>Left</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also {{a reason}} for today's {{struggle}} with the Left is that the SPD is currently itself in a national coalition with the conservative coalition. So the SPD is in a dual struggle. At first the struggle for not endangering the national coalition with Merkel and therefore endangering a national political crisis that maybe result in further losses for the SPD. And secondly the struggle for not forgetting the roots where the SPD came from, because the SPD itself is <b>left</b> <b>party,</b> whose political positions have been eaten by the <b>Left</b> <b>party.</b> So the SPD has to position itself again.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1983 {{municipal}} election, Odd Einar Dørum, {{the leader}} of the Liberal Party asked him to run as a candidate for the municipal council, and Ryan accepted since he did not disagree with anything on the program. He was however not elected. In 1989, the Socialist <b>Left</b> <b>Party</b> started a chapter in Namsskogan, and Ryan was nominated as top candidate. Following the 1991 election, the party won 26.2% of the popular vote. The party cooperated with the Centre Party, which involved the Socialist <b>Left</b> <b>Party</b> gaining the mayor for the four-year term in exchange for supporting the Centre Party's candidate in the next term. Ryan, who had never met in a single municipal council meeting, was thereby elected mayor. Nationally, the party captured only seven mayors in the election. In the same election, Ryan was also elected member of Nord-Trøndelag County Council. The following year, Ryan was appointed as board member of the county-owned power company Nord-Trøndelag Elektrisitetsverk, where he sat until 1999. He was also leader of the Namsskogan chapter of the Socialist <b>Left</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
