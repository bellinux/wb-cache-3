40|$|AbstractConcrete {{structures}} are often reinforced with steel. In {{order for the}} reinforcement to take over tensile forces, concrete has to crack. Through such cracks, water and compounds that are harmful to concrete can enter. This can cause durability issues like leakage, concrete degradation and reinforcement corrosion. In situ repair of cracks is often labour-intensive and inefficient. Preferentially, cracks are autonomously healed {{from the inside out}} in an early stage, preventing the ingress of water. This can be achieved by incorporating healing agent particles composed of nutrients and bacterial spores into the concrete matrix. The bacteria will germinate when water is available, plugging cracks with calcium carbonate. However, a coating is needed to protect the water-soluble healing agent from water during mixing. In order to allow the bacteria access to water for activation after the concrete has hardened, such a coating should break whenever a crack occurs in the concrete. Therefore, it should adhere well to the concrete matrix. It is possible to achieve this by protecting the particles with a brittle geopolymer coating. For this study, healing agent particles are coated with geopolymers following different mixture recipes. Metakaolin is used as an aluminosilicate source and sodium silicate as well as sodium aluminate are used as activator liquids. The particles are coated by granulation in a low-shear granulator. In order to improve the coating process, the operating window and the granulation mechanism are determined for all activator liquids used. Leaching and strength tests are performed and coated particles are incorporated in cement paste {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of application of the particles in concrete.

The purpose of this project was to evaluate a relatively new technology known as Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA) irrigation to obtain Saskatchewan specific performance data for this technology. Preliminary studies were conducted on small, research scale, linear and centre pivot systems. Afterwards, a two tower centre pivot irrigation system equipped with standard impact nozzles was modified by the addition of LESA equipment: drop tubes and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>nozzles</b> with static spray pads. This system was capable of operating either standard above lateral mounted impact sprinklers or LESA technology on the same piece of land. Later, seven field scale systems with various makes of nozzles and spray pads were added to the study to ensure that the data collected from the research systems was applicable to field conditions. For all of the systems tested the, coefficient of uniformity, application efficiency and specific energy consumption were determined and compared for a variety of wind speeds. Results showed that for the two tower research centre pivot the coefficient of uniformity was similar for impact and LESA technology with static spray pads. The application efficiency for the impact <b>nozzles</b> and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>nozzles</b> showed that, while they both had a trend in decreasing efficiency with increasing wind speeds, the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>nozzles</b> had a better efficiency at all wind speeds. The trends showed that the application efficiency for the impact nozzles ranged from approximately 69 % to 86 % and the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>nozzles</b> ranged from approximately 74 % to 98 % indicating an average efficiency gain of approximately 8 % greater for the LESA technology. The energy consumed by both the impact and LESA systems indicated that both systems had an increasing energy consumption with increasing wind speed.

One concept involved using the Coanda effect to turn a sheet of injected secondary air along a curved sidewall flap and, through entrainment, draw the primary jet {{in the same direction}} to produce yaw thrust vectoring.

Experiments show that the injection pressure and air/liquid ratio (ALR) are the major factors impacting the atomization stability, and the flow coefficient of the nozzle ranged in 0. 1 - 0. 15. The VOF simulation of the inner flow field of the nozzle reveals the general transformation process of the bubble, and the region near the exit orifice plays the dominant role during the atomization process where miniature bubbles are generated, expanded in size and accelerated and interacting with the local flow field. 0 Research background Gas-assisted atomization is widely used in the spray processing of liquid fuels.

Chevron count is the pertinent parameter for noise reduction at <b>low</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>pressure</b> ratios, whereas at high <b>nozzle</b> <b>pressure</b> ratios, chevron penetration is crucial. The results illustrate that by careful selection of chevron parameters substantial noise reduction can be achieved. The sound pressure level (SPL) can be calculated from that we determined the noise level at nozzle exit section. After assessing the chevron parameters we are going to modify the chevron shapes in order to get maximum noise reduction along with very negligible thrust loss. Modification of chevron is based on aspect of increasing the mixing of cold jet and the hot jet in order to decrease the noise emission. ANSYS-Fluent is a commercial CFD code which will be used for performing the simulation and the simulation configuration contains three different velocities (100, 150, 200) with two different nozzle model(plain & chevron nozzle). The simulation results are evaluated to find out nozzle noise level in the engine exhaust system...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} obtain nozzle performance data with relatively large-scale models at pressure ratios as high as 120. Conical convergent-divergent nozzles with divergence angles alpha of 15, 25, and 29 deg. were each tested at area ratios of approximately 10, 25, and 40. Heated air (1200 F) was supplied at the <b>nozzle</b> inlet at <b>pressures</b> up to 145 {{pounds per square inch}} absolute and was exhausted into quiescent air at <b>pressures</b> as <b>low</b> as 1. 2 pounds per square inch absolute. Thrust ratios for all nozzle configurations are presented over the range of pressure ratios attainable and were extrapolated when possible to design pressure ratio and beyond. Design thrust ratios decreased with increasing nozzle divergence angle according to the trend predicted by the (1 + cos alpha) / 2 parameter. Decreasing the nozzle divergence angle resulted in sizable increases in thrust ratio for a given surface-area ratio (nozzle weight), particularly at <b>low</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>pressure</b> ratios. Correlations of the <b>nozzle</b> static <b>pressure</b> at separation and of the average static pressure downstream of separation with various nozzle parameters permitted the calculation of thrust in the separated-flow region from unseparated static-pressure distributions.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of spray nozzle internal geometry on heat transfer performance and the resultant power requirements. An experimental apparatus was designed and built, which allowed for close control of the heat transfer from air to water and the required energy for droplet production. The apparatus allowed for simultaneous measurements of heat transfer rate from the gas to the spray droplets and the pumping power requirements for the sprayed liquid. A spray chamber was constructed {{in the form of}} a Perspex cylinder, 372 mm internal diameter and 372 mm height, mounted on its vertical axis. Thermocouples, humidity sensors, and pressure sensors were used to measure the temperature difference of the air and water, the humidity difference of the air, and the pressure drop across the nozzle. The spray nozzles have been installed at the centre of the upper cover plate directed along the cylinder axis. The heat and mass transfer process was carried out in a counter current flow. Two different nozzle designs were the subject of this investigation. The <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>nozzle</b> works on liquid pressure alone. Droplet formation and size is influenced by changes of the internal geometry and liquid pressure. An effervescent two fluid atomiser with internal mixing was tested. The influence of changes in gas bubble and exit orifice geometry on droplet size and formation was investigated. Analysis of the heat transfer process is based on the energy balance for the whole cylinder. This analysis allows for the determination of the nozzle with the best performance characteristics. From the required energy to produce the droplets and the rate of heat transfer, a new equation for the index of energy performance, was defined. A Laser Doppler Analyser was used to determine the droplet size and velocity for the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>nozzles</b> and this data was compared with the existing theory. The droplet distribution of the spray nozzles was determined for various configuration. The measured droplet size was below the calculated droplet size using the derived equations from the literature. Photographs of the spray angle at different liquid pressures were taken for digital analysis. The spray angle showed reasonable agreement with the literature. A three dimensional numerical model was designed to simulate the heat transfer process inside the spray chamber using PHOENICS, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The software modelled the heat and mass transfer inside the spray chamber. This model then allowed for the testing of different droplet distributions, formations, and their influence on the heat transfer process. In order to validate the results, the necessary variables such as the gas mass flow, liquid mass flow rate, droplet size, spray angle and scatter, hot air inlet temperature, were obtained from the experimental data. The result of the simulation is the air outlet temperature and humidity of the spray chamber. The internal 3 D flow field is solved with the Lagrangian and Eulerian equation including the disturbance, solved with the k-epsilon turbulence model, created by the spray droplets. Four different pressure swirl configurations were simulated. Every configuration had five different pressure points. Every pressure point was simulated individually in order to find out if the numerical simulation software was able to predict the correct result for different liquid mass flow rates without altering the boundary setting and parameters. The heat transfer process was found to depend on the droplet size and distribution produced by the spray nozzle. A comparison of the experimental data with the simulation results demonstrated the accuracy of the CFD model. The temperature accuracy was ± 5. 9 % and for the humidity ± 12 % on average for all simulations. It was found that the heat transfer of the effervescent atomiser depends on the mass ALR and that the highest heat transfer was measured when it was operating with an ALR of 0. 1. The tested effervescent atomiser was found to be strongly influenced by the atomising air, an effectiveness of 93 % achieved. The change of the internal geometries had no significant influence on the heat transfer rates. The change of the internal geometry, especially the exit orifice diameter, had a strong influence on the <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>nozzle</b> performance, which started at 85 % and reached a maximum of 95 %. It was found that the pressure requirement for the 4. 7 mm exit orifice was only 20 % of the pressure requirement of the 2. 5 mm exit orifice in order to achieve the same cooling performance. The pressure swirl needed for all flow rates approximately 20 times less energy to achieve the same cooling as the effervescent nozzle...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} thrust-vectored {{axisymmetric}} ejector nozzles were designed and experimentally tested for internal performance and pumping characteristics at the Langley research center. This {{study indicated that}} discontinuities in the performance occurred at <b>low</b> primary <b>nozzle</b> <b>pressure</b> ratios and that these discontinuities were mitigated by decreasing expansion area ratio. The addition of secondary flow increased {{the performance of the}} nozzles. The mid-to-high range of secondary flow provided the most overall improvements, and the greatest improvements were seen for the largest ejector area ratio. Thrust vectoring the ejector nozzles caused a reduction in performance and discharge coefficient. With or without secondary flow, the vectored ejector nozzles produced thrust vector angles that were equivalent to or greater than the geometric turning angle. With or without secondary flow, spacing ratio (ejector passage symmetry) had little effect on performance (gross thrust ratio), discharge coefficient, or thrust vector angle. For the unvectored ejectors, a small amount of secondary flow was sufficient to reduce the pressure levels on the shroud to provide cooling, but for the vectored ejector nozzles, a larger amount of secondary air was required to reduce the pressure levels to provide cooling...|$|R
