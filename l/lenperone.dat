50|$|<b>Lenperone</b> (Elanone-V) is {{a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} of the butyrophenone chemical class.|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of healthy}} dogs with the {{butyrophenone}} derivative, <b>lenperone</b> hydrochloride, at two different doses significantly decreased gastroesophageal sphincter pressure (GESP). No dose-related effect was identified. Individual {{variation in the}} response to <b>lenperone</b> hydrochloride was noted which was consistent on a day-to-day basis. <b>Lenperone</b> hydrochloride is unsuitable for chemical restraint of dogs undergoing esophageal manometry because it decreases GESP and because {{the magnitude of the}} decrease varies considerably between dogs...|$|E
40|$|Esophageal acid {{clearance}} {{in healthy}} dogs was evaluated {{by placing a}} pH probe in the distal esophagus and determining the number of swallows and time required for esophageal pH to reach 4. 0 after injection of a 10 mL bolus of 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid. The increase in pH occurred in a stepwise fashion and was associated with esophageal peristalsis as determined by esophageal manometry. The number of swallows required for acid clearance varied from four to 12 {{with a mean of}} 8 +/- 1. 8. The time required for acid clearance varied from 150 to 480 s with a mean of 285 +/- 75. No significant difference was noted after 0. 16 mg/kg of <b>lenperone</b> hydrochloride was given intramuscularly. The esophageal acid clearance test in dogs appears similar to that reported in humans...|$|E
