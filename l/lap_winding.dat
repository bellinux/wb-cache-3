50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole <b>lap</b> <b>winding,</b> and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|E
40|$|Compulsator is a {{specially}} designed generator capa¬ble of delivering high current pulses to a low-impedance load, such as the electromagnetic railgun. In order to increase the tip speed of the rotor, advanced composite materials {{have been used in}} the recent compulsator prototype, which is mentioned as air core instead of the traditional iron core. For typical air-core compulsators, there are no slots and steel teeth to place the armature windings due to the nonmachinability of composite materials. Therefore, concentric windings in racetrack style are often adopted instead of traditional <b>lap</b> <b>winding</b> in most cases, since it is more convenient to be fixed by composite materials. However, overlap occurs at the end winding part for multiphase compulsators, which are not easy to be formed during the manufacture process. In this paper, a fractional slot multiphase air-core compulsator with concentrated windings is proposed and analyzed. The main advantage of fractional slot configuration is that it can offer a concentrated winding structure under certain conditions, which means each coil only spans one “tooth,” and will not cause any intersection between each phase at the end winding. Two referenced fractional slot air-core compulsators with two phases, six poles, and four “slots” or eight “slots” (q = 1 / 3 and q = 2 / 3, q is the “slot” per pole per phase) are analyzed and compared with the performance of a traditional integral slot machine. The results indicated that the output voltage and self-excitation performance of a fractional slot compulsator can reach the same level with an integral slot one, and the discharging performance can reach an acceptable level. Thus, the fractional slot multiphase concept can be further used to improve the manufacture process of the winding in the future...|$|E
40|$|Purpose This {{paper is}} aimed at general {{investigation}} of winding topologies for flux-switching motors (FSM) with various segment-tooth combinations and different excitation methods. Design/methodology/approach For the ac winding of FSM, two winding topologies, namely the concentrated winding and the distributed winding, are compared {{in terms of the}} winding factor and efficiency. For the field winding of dc-excited FSM (DCEFSM), another two winding topologies, namely the <b>lap</b> <b>winding</b> and the toroidal winding, are compared in terms of effective coil area, end-winding length, and thermal conditions. Analytical derivation is used for the general winding factor calculation. The calculation results are validated using finite element analysis (FEA). Findings Winding factors can be used as an indication of winding efficiency for FSMs {{in the same manner as}} done for synchronous motors (SMs). For FSMs with concentrated windings, the winding factor increases when the rotor tooth number approaches a multiple of the stator segment number. For FSMs with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, the theoretical maximum winding factor can be achieved by implementing distributed windings. Furthermore, the toroidal winding can be an efficient winding topology for DCEFSMs with large stator diameter and small stack length. Research limitations/implications This work can be continued with investigating the variation of reluctance torque with respect to different segment-tooth combinations of FSM. Originality/value This paper proposes a general method to calculate the winding factor of flux-switching motors using only the phase number, the stator segment number, the rotor tooth number, and the skew angle. Using this method, a table of winding factors of FSMs with different segment-tooth combinations is provided. Principle of design of FSMs with high winding factors are hence concluded. This paper also proposed the implementation of distributed windings for FSM with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, by which means a theoretical maximum winding factor is achieved. In addition, different winding topologies for the field winding of DCEFSM are also investigated...|$|E

50|$|Race Summary: The final race of {{the season}} saw Dario Franchitti enter with a three-point lead over Scott Dixon in the {{championship}} chase. Tony Kanaan held third, the only other driver mathematically eligible for the title. Penske teammates Sam Hornish, Jr. and Hélio Castroneves dominated most of the race, leading a combined 146 laps. Tony Kanaan saw his championship hopes go away early in the race when a flat tire forced an unscheduled pit stop. He would eventually finish 6th in the race. Single-car crashes by Marco Andretti and later Vitor Meira were the only significant on track incidents of the day. Meira's crash on lap 136 caused damage to the SAFER barrier, and a long 15-lap caution ensued as track workers repaired the barrier. It set up a dramatic fuel strategy, as both Franchitti and Dixon decided to pit to top off their tanks, and thus gamble on stretching their fuel {{to the end of}} the race. With the <b>laps</b> <b>winding</b> down, most of the leaders ducked into the pits for a quick fuel stops. That left Dixon leading, Franchitti second, and Danica Patrick third. Patrick headed for the pits on lap 195, but spun at the entrance, bringing out the caution. Both Dixon and Franchitti attempted to conserve fuel under the yellow, and prepared for a two-lap sprint to decide the race winner, and ultimately the season championship. The green came out with two laps to go, and the two battled side-by-side. On the final lap, entering turn three, Dixon ran out of fuel. Franchitti slipped by to take the lead, win the race, and clinch the 2007 IndyCar Series Championship title. With Franchitti reportedly heading to NASCAR, along with possibly Sam Hornish Jr., it marked what could be the final IndyCar Series race for the 2006 and 2007 Indianapolis 500 and IndyCar Series champions, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Automatic belt systems {{also present}} several {{operational}} disadvantages. Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual lap belt, thus rendering redundant the automation {{of the shoulder}} belt. Those who do not fasten the <b>lap</b> belt <b>wind</b> up inadequately protected only by the shoulder belt; in a crash without a lap belt such a vehicle occupant is likely to [...] "submarine" [...] (be thrown forward under the shoulder belt) and be seriously injured. Motorized or door-affixed shoulder belts hinder access to the vehicle, {{making it difficult to}} enter and exit—particularly if the occupant is carrying items such as a box or a purse. Vehicle owners tend to disconnect the motorized or door-affixed shoulder belt to relieve the nuisance of entering and exiting the vehicle, leaving only a lap belt for crash protection. Also, many automatic seat belt systems are incompatible with child safety seats, or only compatible with special modifications.|$|R

Johnson passed Dillon to take second and cut Larson's lead to just around a second. But as the <b>laps</b> started to <b>wind</b> down, Larson increased the gap and had the race in check. The lead he built up evaporated when David Ragan suffered a right-front tire blowout and slammed the wall in Turn 2 with four laps to go, bringing out the 14th caution and set up an overtime finish. Ragan's wreck laid oil all down the backstretch and NASCAR had to apply speedy-dry to clean it up.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A {{nonlinear}} dynamic systems {{model has}} previously been proposed to explain pacing strategies employed during exercise. Purpose: This {{study was conducted to}} examine the pacing strategies used under varying conditions during the cycle phase of an Ironman triathlon. Methods: The bicycles of six well-trained male triathletes were equipped with SRM power meters set to record power output, cadence, speed, and heart rate. The flat, three-lap, out-and-back cycle course, coupled with relatively consistent wind conditions (17 - 30 km·h- 1), enabled comparisons to be made between three consecutive 60 -km <b>laps</b> and relative <b>wind</b> direction (headwind vs tailwind). Results: Participants finished the cycle phase (180 km) with consistently fast performance times (5 h, 11 ± 2 min; top 10 % of all finishers). Average power output (239 ± 25 to 203 ± 20 W), cadence (89 ± 6 to 82 ± 8 rpm), and speed (36. 5 ± 0. 8 to 33. 1 ± 0. 8 km·h- 1) all significantly decreased with increasing number of laps (P < 0. 05). These variables, however, were not significantly different between headwind and tailwind sections. The deviation (SD) in power output and cadence did not change with increasing number of laps; however, the deviations in torque (6. 8 ± 1. 6 and 5. 8 ± 1. 3 N·m) and speed (2. 1 ± 0. 5 and 1. 6 ± 0. 3 km·h- 1) were significantly greater under headwind compared with tailwind conditions, respectively. The median power frequency tended to be lower in headwind (0. 0480 ± 0. 0083) compared with tailwind (0. 0531 ± 0. 0101) sections. Conclusion: These data show evidence that a nonlinear dynamic pacing strategy is used by well-trained triathletes throughout various segments and conditions of the Ironman cycle phase. Moreover, an increased variation in torque and speed was found in the headwind versus the tailwind condition. <br /...|$|R
