It is widely used in clinical trials to establish the efficacy of a new treatment in comparison with a control treatment when the measurement {{is the time to}} event (such as the time from initial treatment to a heart attack). The test is sometimes called the Mantel-Cox test, named after Nathan Mantel and David Cox. The <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> can also be viewed as a time-stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.|$|E

40|$|For testing {{treatment}} {{effect with}} time to event data, combinations of several tests are often desired when the hazard {{functions of the}} two groups are nonproportional. Yang and Prentice [2005. Semiparametric analysis of short term and long term hazard ratios with two sample survival data. Biometrika 92, 1 - 17. ] defined a new two-sample semiparametric model that accommodates nonproportional hazard functions and contains the Cox model and the proportional odds model as two submodels. They also obtained a [chi] 2 test on the parameter that reduces to the [chi] 2 test based on weighted <b>log-rank</b> <b>tests</b> for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. In this paper, we consider a new [chi] 2 test using the empirical likelihood method.

A total of 110 human root segments were instrumented to size 80 under irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Half of the roots were irrigated with a 5-mL rinse of 17% EDTA to remove the smear layer. Roots were filled with gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer (AH), GP and Apexit sealer (AP), or RealSeal cones and sealer (RS). Following storage in humid conditions at 37 degrees C for 7 days, the specimens were mounted into a bacterial leakage test model for 135 days. Survival analyses were performed to calculate the median time of leakage and <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> was used for pairwise comparisons of groups. Selected specimens were longitudinally sectioned and inspected by scanning electron microscopy for the presence of bacteria at the interfaces. In the presence of the smear layer, RS and AP leaked significantly more slowly than in its absence. In the absence of the smear layer, AH leaked significantly more slowly than RS. It was concluded that removal of the smear layer did not impair bacterial penetration along root canal fillings. A comparison of the sealers revealed no difference except that AH performed better than RS {{in the absence of the}} smear layer.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} of this analysis {{was to develop a}} survival aggregate score (SAS), including objective and subjective patient-based parameters, and assess its prognostic role after major anatomic resection for non–small cell lung cancer. MethodsA total of 245 patients underwent major lung resections for non–small cell lung cancer with preoperative evaluation of quality of life (Short-Form 36 v 2 survey) and complete follow-up. The Cox multivariable regression and bootstrap analyses were used to identify prognostic factors of overall servival, which were weighted to construct the scoring system and summed to generate the SAS. ResultsCox regression analysis showed that the factors negatively associated with overall survival and used to construct the score were 36 -item short-form health survey physical component summary score less than 50 (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 7; P = . 008), aged older than 70 years (HR, 1. 9; P = . 002), and carbon monoxide lung diffusion capacity less than 70 % (HR, 1. 7; P = . 01). Patients were grouped into 4 risk classes according to their SAS.

40|$|Survival {{analysis}} {{concerns the}} characterization or comparison {{of one or}} more distributions of the time to a well defined event. The <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> is the most common method used to compare the survival distributions of two samples. When data within the two groups are stratified according to some risk factors, then a stratified <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> is employed. Stratified analysis is a procedure used to compare outcomes in different groups {{while at the same time}} correcting for the effects of confounders. It is one way to ensure that important prognostic factors are equally distributed among different treatments. The ordinary <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> is known to be conservative when treatments have been assigned by a stratified design. The stratified <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> is valid even when the sizes of strata differ. Schoenfeld and Tsiatis modified the <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> with a variance adjustment reflecting the dependence of survival on strata size. Their method is shown to be more efficient than the ordinary stratified log rank test when the number of strata is large, and it remains valid when the censoring distributions differ across treatment groups. In this thesis, we investigate these three log-rank tests for survival analysis. The effect of the stratum sizes on each type of analysis is evaluated using simulated data. Our results show that the modified log rank test is beneficial for stratified survival analysis in most cases especially when there are large numbers of strata and the strata sizes get small. The statistical power of the modified <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> is relatively stable even with very small strata sizes and high strata effects. The public health relevance of this thesis is that the modified <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> we investigated and implemented using the R programming language provides an alternative and more efficient way to accommodate higher amounts of stratification in analyzing survival data. More efficient statistical methods indirectly have public health impact as such methods lead to analyses which better identify treatments, interventions or factors that influence health outcomes.

40|$|Non-proportional hazards {{have been}} {{observed}} in clinical trials. The <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> loses power and the standard Cox model generally produces biased estimates under such conditions. Weighted log-rank tests have been utilized to increase the test power; however, it is not intuitive how to interpret the test result {{in terms of the}} clinical effect. We propose a Cox-model based time-varying treatment effect estimate to complement the weighted <b>log-rank</b> <b>test.</b> The score test from the proposed model is equivalent to the weighted <b>log-rank</b> <b>test,</b> and a time-profile of the treatment effect can be obtained by fitting a time-varying covariate Cox model. Simulation results show that the proposed model preserves type-I error and achieve higher power than log-rank tests under non-proportional hazards scenarios. Whereas the standard Cox model produces biased effect estimates, the proposed model produces unbiased estimates if the weight function is correctly specified. It also achieves a better model fit and an enhanced flexibility to accommodate non-proportional hazards compared to the standard Cox model. The proposed approach makes the assumptions of the weighted <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> explicit and the validity of assumptions can be assessed based on prior knowledge or model goodness-of-fit. It also helps to translate the weighted <b>log-rank</b> <b>test</b> results into quantitative estimates of the treatment effect with intuitive interpretation.
