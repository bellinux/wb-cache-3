40|$|The {{simulation}} of vehicle engine cooling validation in a Climatic chamber will benefit all vehicle manufacturers {{that are responsible}} for the design or the localization of parts used in a vehicle's engine cooling system. The ability to test the vehicle in-house allows testing at any time of the year; it provides repeatable and comparative data, and accelerates component level approval, which in itself reduces program timing and cost. For this dissertation <b>road</b> <b>level</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted in Upington using a TD 1200 Superflow towing dynamometer, while the in-house testing was performed on a ROTOTEST chassis dynamometer in a Climatic chamber. All tests were conducted according to GENERAL MOTORS SOUTH AFRICA global testing standards. Statistical analyses of the test data were used to determine the relationship between parameters measured and results obtained. The major contributors to the simulation process was identified and implemented to improve measurement quality and test results. The result was an accurate simulation between <b>road</b> and chamber <b>testing,</b> hence the possibility of moving away from <b>road</b> <b>testing</b> and conduct simulated chamber testing. The presented dissertation is useful for the understanding of basic vehicle cooling testing and the methodology of simulated testing in an environmentally controlled chambe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{variables that}} best predict a team's decision of driving ability in stroke patients from a predriving assessment. DESIGN: Retrospective {{study of a}} 2 -year predriving evaluation. SETTING: Belgian Institute for Road Safety. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred four patients with sequelae of first stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Predriving assessments and <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The suitability to resume driving based on a team decision and performance in the <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: Forty-one patients (39. 4 %) were judged suitable, 45 (43. 3 %) not immediately suitable, and 18 (17. 3 %) not suitable to drive. Correlation coefficients and comparisons between groups revealed that most variables had significant individual relationships with the team decision and performance on the <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> After logistic regression analysis, side of lesion, kinetic vision, visual scanning, and a <b>road</b> <b>test</b> led to the best model in predicting the team decision (R(2) =. 53). The <b>road</b> <b>test</b> {{was the most important}} determinant (R(2) =. 42). Multiple regression analysis showed that the combination of acuity of left and right eyes and the figure of Rey was the best subset to predict the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> (R(2) =. 28). CONCLUSION: The predictive accuracy of the team's decision is limited, and the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> is even lower. Inclusion of more real-road-related tests in the predriving assessment is necessary. status: publishe...|$|R

The opposite happened for Shirley: good challenge performances but horrible <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> Aaron admits that after the <b>road</b> <b>test,</b> he finally got everything and more out of rehab. Philippe and Peter believe Sly is Canada's Worst Driver due to his performance in the challenges, but Cam and Andrew believe that Shirley's performance in the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> makes her Canada's Worst Driver.

In this paper, {{subspace}} identification {{methods are}} proposed {{to estimate the}} linear tire cornering stiffness, which are only based on the <b>road</b> <b>tests</b> data without any prior knowledge. This kind of data-driven method has strong robustness. In order to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithms, a series of standard <b>road</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out. Comparing with different subspace algorithms used in <b>road</b> <b>tests,</b> {{it can be concluded}} that the front tire cornering stiffness can be estimated accurately by the N 4 SID and CCA methods when the double lane change test data are taken into analysis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite physical, perceptual and {{cognitive}} impairments, amongst others, which might affect driving after stroke, some patients {{have demonstrated the}} ability to resume safe driving. Such patients are identified following strictly administered predriving evaluations. The <b>road</b> <b>test</b> is generally acclaimed {{to be the most}} valid test of driving performance. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the reliability of the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> when performed by stroke patients in Belgium. Method: This was a prospective study of a predriving evaluation at the Belgian Road Safety Institute. Thirty subjects with sequelae of stroke were included. Subjects were accompanied and evaluated during the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> by one of two assessors (A or B) from the road safety institute in an automatic car fitted with a video camera for recording driving performance. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated by comparing results from (1) real-life performance and video recording and (2) between-video judgements.
