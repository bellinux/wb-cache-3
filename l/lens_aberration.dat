50|$|There are two {{widely used}} {{simulation}} techniques {{that exist in}} literature: the Bloch wave method, derived from Hans Bethe's original theoretical treatment of the Davisson-Germer experiment, and the multislice method. In this paper, we will primarily focus on the multislice method for simulation of diffraction patterns, including multiple elastic scattering effects. Most of the packages that exist implement the multislice algorithm along with Fourier analysis to incorporate electron <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> effects to determine electron microscope image and address aspects such as phase contrast and diffraction contrast. For electron microscope samples {{in the form of}} a thin crystalline slab in the transmission geometry, the aim of these software packages is to provide a map of the crystal potential, however this inversion process is greatly complicated by the presence of multiple elastic scattering.|$|E
40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} pushes feature dimensions {{beyond the}} sub-wavelength threshold, {{the effect of}} <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> in the imaging system becomes more relevant. Therefore, it becomes important that the optical engineer completely understands the effects <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> have on aerial image and resist profile. It {{is also important to}} have a tool and a process that can accurately describe and measure the aberrations in the exposure system. With full characterization of the lens systems and through use of a lithographic simulator, it becomes possible to predict the imaging effects and ultimately critical dimensions and pattern placement. In any exposure system there exists a unique set of aberrations, which will {{have an effect on the}} aerial image. These aberrations can cause focus shifts dependant on pattern orientation, asymmetric imaging, degradation of image contrast, edge slope, pattern fidelity, resolution, and additional imaging artifacts. This paper looks at the use of a phase shifting ring structure of it radians phase shift and a lithographic simulator (PROLITH) for examination of <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> in terms of Zernike coefficients Z 5 through Z 11 (astigmatism — trifoil), Strehl ratio and wavefront OPD for a 365 nm exposure system...|$|R
40|$|The {{resolution}} of available low-voltage SEM (LVSEM) models {{used in the}} characterization of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) is limited {{by a number of}} factors including energy spread in the electron source, beam brightness, scanning electron detector geometry, and various <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations.</b> This paper describes an improved model of LVSEM which offers an increased resolution at low voltage. The improvements include a cold cathode FE source which has an extremely low inherent energy spread and high brightness, a second condenser lens to converge the beam and maintain an optimum aperture half-angle, and a detector optimized for low-voltage scanning-electron collection. To reduce <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations,</b> the specimen is immersed in the objective lens field.

40|$|Aberration {{metrology}} {{and monitoring}} of lithography projection {{systems in the}} semiconductor industry are becoming more important as today’s ICs are printed at sub- 100 nm resolution. All lenses suffer from <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> {{and it is important}} that the lithographer knows which aberration and the magnitude of the aberration in order to understand its impact on the process window and resolution limitations. A technique and process to recognize and measure <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> in-situ has been developed using a phase wheel target at 157 nm and 193 nm lithography. This project will use the phase wheel target technique to extend aberration monitoring into i-line lithography using RIT’s Canon exposure tool. Test reticle design, layout and fabrication, as well as the exposure process optimization will be carried out for the technique to work at 365 nm. First order aberrations from the Canon exposure tool will be identified using this system...|$|R
50|$|Phase-contrast {{images are}} formed by {{removing}} the objective aperture entirely or by using a very large objective aperture. This ensures that not only the transmitted beam, but also the diffracted ones are allowed {{to contribute to the}} image. Instruments that are specifically designed for phase-contrast imaging are often called HRTEMs (high resolution transmission electron microscopes), and differ from analytical TEMs mainly {{in the design of the}} electron beam column. Whereas analytical TEMs employ additional detectors attached to the column for spectroscopic measurements, HRTEMs have little or no additional attachments so as to ensure a uniform electromagnetic environment all the way down the column for each beam leaving the sample (transmitted and diffracted). Because phase-contrast imaging relies on differences in phase between electrons leaving the sample, any additional phase shifts that occur between the sample and the viewing screen can make the image impossible to interpret. Thus, a very low degree of <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> is also a requirement for HRTEMs, and advances in spherical aberration (Cs) correction have enabled a new generation of HRTEMs to reach resolutions once thought impossible.|$|E
40|$|Electron <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> is {{the major}} barrier {{limiting}} the resolution of electron microscopy. Here we describe a novel form of electron microscopy to overcome electron <b>lens</b> <b>aberration.</b> By combining coherent electron diffraction with the oversampling phasing method, we show that the 3 D structure of a 2 x 2 x 2 unit cell nano-crystal (framework of LTA [Al 12 Si 12 O 48] 8) can be ab initio determined at the resolution of 1 Angstrom {{from a series of}} simulated noisy diffraction pattern projections with rotation angles ranging from - 70 degrees to + 70 degrees in 5 degrees increments along a single rotation axis. This form of microscopy (which we call 3 D electron diffraction microscopy) does not require any reference waves, and can image the 3 D structure of nanocrystals, as well as non-crystalline biological and materials science samples, with the resolution limited only by the quality of sample diffraction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of fringe analysis to the measurement of geometric <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> {{and the creation of}} a Fresnel zone plate based diffractive corrective for the removal of chromatic aberration. The objective of the work has been firstly to create a Fourier fringe analysis approach to analyse the minor geometric distortions found in conventional lenses. Having defined how such a system can be analysed a theoretical lens surface has been generated and the effect of the different aberrations present, analysed. A specific Fresnel zone plate corrective has then been designed and evaluated in order to minimise chromatic aberration. This has a particular application to low cost plastic optics, which cannot easily be chromatically corrected. The Fresnel zone plate shows how a diffractive corrective has been created and used to minimise the chromatic aberrations. The approach developed in this thesis demonstrates that it is now possible to remove 90 % of the chromatic aberration by the use of computed diffractive corrective optics. It also investigates how a further minor diffractive corrective could reduce the <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> until it performs close to the diffraction limit...|$|E

40|$|Aberration {{metrology}} {{is critical}} to the manufacture of quality lithography lenses in order to meet strict optical requirements. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to measure and monitor lens performance in an IC production environment on a regular basis. The lithographer needs to understand the influence of aberrations on imaging and any changes that may occur in the aberration performance of the lens between assembly and application, and over the course of using an exposure tool. This paper will present a new method for the detection of lens aberrations that may be employed during standard lithography operation. The approach allows for the detection of specific aberration types and trends, as well as levels of aberration, though visual inspection of high resolution images of resist patterns and fitting of the aberrated wavefront. The approach consists of a test target made up of a 180 -degree phase pattern array in a “phase wheel ” configuration. The circular phase regions in the phase wheel are arranged so that their response to <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> is interrelated and the regions respond uniquely to specific aberrations, depending on their location within the target. This test method offers an advantage because of the sensitivity to particular aberration types, the unique response of multiple zones of the test target to aberrations, and the ease with which aberrations can be distinguished. The method of <b>lens</b> <b>aberration</b> detection is based on the identification of the deviations that occur between the images printed with the phase wheel target and images that would be produced in the absence of aberration.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} carbon nanotubes as electron sources in electron microscopes is analyzed. The resolution and probe current {{that can be}} obtained from a carbon nanotube emitter in a low-voltage scanning electron microscope are calculated and compared to {{the state of the art}} using Schottky electron sources. Many analytical equations for probe-size versus probe-current relations in different parameter regimes are obtained. It is shown that for most carbon nanotube emitters, the gun <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> are larger than the emitters’ virtual source size and thus restrict the microscope’s performance. The result is that the advantages of the higher brightness of nanotube emitters are limited unless the angular emission current is increased over present day values or the gun <b>lens</b> <b>aberrations</b> are decreased. For some nanotubes with a closed cap, it is known that the emitted electron beam is coherent over the full emission cone. We argue that for such emitters the parameter “brightness” becomes meaningless.
