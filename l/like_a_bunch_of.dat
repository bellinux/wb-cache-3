5|$|Seattle Seahawks linebacker Mike Curtis {{blocked a}} field goal that would have sent the game into overtime, guaranteeing a Seahawk victory in what was billed as the “expansion bowl” meeting between two winless, first-year teams. The Buccaneers outgained the Seahawks, 285 yards to 253, but the {{officials}} outgained both, with 310 yards in penalties. The 35 penalties (accepted, 41 were thrown by the officials) were two short of the 25-year-old league record. Each team was penalized for holding eight times. Defensive tackle Pat Toomay complained that “the officials made us look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> idiots”. Dan Ryczek was the only Buccaneer lineman not to be called for holding. Tampa Bay running back Louis Carter, stuffed at the goal line, threw the ball to Morris Owens, who dived {{into the end zone}} for the first Buccaneer passing touchdown. A tackle by Seahawk punter Rick Engles prevented a touchdown return by Danny Reece that would have won the game for the Buccaneers. An earlier field goal try was blocked by Lyle Blackwood. The game ended with Dave Brown being helped from the field after being hit in the eye by the final penalty flag.|$|E

500|$|Under Dunn's experience, {{the band}} instituted some traditions that the {{university}} uses to the present. In 1925, Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school. Dunn, who found the Aggie War Hymn [...] "inappropriate" [...] for social functions and solemn occasions, wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled Spirit of Aggieland. In 1926, the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus. All the seniors in one single file was [...] "quite a site to behold", and one junior commented that they looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> old elephants wandering around {{trying to find some}} place to die.

Pictures in the {{newspapers}} highlighted the blood from a two-stitch cut the Swedish captain Lars-Erik Sjoberg had received on a cross-check from Vic Hadfield. Reports of the games led to criticism from back home in Canada, which incensed Sinden. The team cooled off {{the next day with}} a session in Sodertalje playing for the employees of a Volkswagen plant. The team played mock games against local teams of youngsters 12 and 13 years in age. The practice improved the mood of the players. The team drank beer on the bus, and started [...] "singing songs <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> kids." [...] Several of the players then went out drinking, impressing Sinden the next day with their best practice session to date. The time in Sweden helped bring Team Canada together as a team and focused them for the final four games.|$|E

She added that while Christian missionaries would understand Feri as a [...] "sex cult", [...] "we do not behave <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> slavering mad dogs in heat". Initiation into Feri was a sexual act, and according to Cora [...] "in initiation you literally marry the Goddess, her dual consort and the Gods, whether you are male or female". It involved a male priest giving the female initiate {{the names of the}} God and Goddess upon orgasm. If the female initiate was already betrothed to another, or did otherwise not wish to have intercourse with the priest, then a ritual known as the Intentions of the Heart took place. In this, her next sexual act with another person would be considered her initiation. When a female initiated a male, there was a similarly sexual component although according to Cora, [...] "there are some important differences".|$|E

500|$|Hail to the Thief has a {{score of}} 85 out of 100 on review {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called Hail to the Thief [...] "Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists {{at the height of}} their powers." [...] Chris Ott of Pitchfork wrote that Radiohead had [...] "largely succeeded in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be," [...] assigning it a [...] "Best New Music" [...] designation. Writing for New York, Ethan Brown said that Hail to the Thief [...] "isn't a protest album, and that's why it works so well. As with great Radiohead records past, such as Kid A, the music – restlessly, freakishly inventive – pushes politics far into the background." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that [...] "despite the fact that it seems more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> songs on a disc rather than a singular body, its impact is substantial", concluding that the band [...] "have entered a second decade of record-making with a surplus of momentum.

When he does show up—standouts include the hulking G-funk mutation “Hcapd” and the grungy, bass-addled “P”—both his beats and raps thrill: All of the twisted jokes, tough introspection, and rabble-rousing that fans have come to expect, {{with none of the}} unfortunate rape references his detractors rightly called him on." [...] Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer [...] "Oldie" [...] epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as [...] "hype warranted." [...] Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that [...] "it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler’s Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype’s BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G’s Ali and Domo’s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior."

The {{lack of a}} second guard next to West (and thus, the lack of speed and quickness) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft, he said: [...] "Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [...] size...but if I don't play him, we look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> trucks." [...] In addition, Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower, which made him difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West, he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor; regarding Baylor, he later explained: [...] "We were good friends, but... black culture... you never let the other guy one-up you." [...] The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff: pejoratively calling the new recruit [...] "The Load", he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as [...] "the dumbest and worst coach ever". Laker Keith Erickson observed that [...] "Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry...and {{that is not a}} good way to get on Wilt's side...that relationship was doomed from the start." ...|$|E

By this time it was dark, and the people lighted huge bonfires through the town, and the children remained up, and as many as could cling on it still sat upon the cannon, and ropes were got and fastened to it, and all the girls of St. Florent dragged Marie-Jeanne round the town, and at last she was dragged into the yard of the auberge, in front of which the fight had commenced, and there she was left for the night, under a strong guard.|$|R
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E
