PREFACE The present publication {{is the result of a}} study which lasted from the end of 1974 until the spring of 1980. The earliest ideas, however, occurred in the last part of my period as a student at the Technical University of Delft. At that time I was first confronted with the theory of S-transformations and criterion matrices as it was presented, during the courses, for use in planimetric networks. Then the question arose of how to apply these ideas in threedimensional pointfields. Professor Baarda of T. U. - Delft studied this problem in the beginning of the seventies, later on I was forced in that direction by difficulties I met when studying the precision and reliability of aerotriangulation blocks. When my research was progressing, Professor Baarda showed interest and was willing to act as my promotor on this subject. I am very much indebted to him for the many valuable discussions we had during the last six years. His criticisms and suggestions were very stimulating for my research. His assistant, Dr. v. Daalen, gave valuable suggestions for the part of the thesis concerning the choice of covariance functions for the criterion matrices. He was also very helpful in reading the thesis and checking some of the derivations. Furthermore, thanks are due to Miss Hunter who turned my English into real English, and to Mr Rogge for editing the text. Last but certainly not least I would like to thank Mrs <b>Lefers</b> who never lost her good humour during this difficult typing job. CONTENTS CHAPTER...|$|R
40|$|Literature Review: Despite Mixed {{findings}} previous {{reviews of}} the literature have highlighted a predictive relationship between pre-operative psychological variables and post-operative pain (Hinrichs-Rocker, Schulz, Jarvinen & <b>Lefering,</b> 2009). This review examined the research published between 2000 and 2013. Eleven studies were identified and discussed. The review noted evidence that psychological variables specific to aspects of pain, mediated the effect of other psychological variables, which indicate general mood states, on pain. Implications for research and clinical practice were also discussed. Research report: This paper detailed a feasibility study exploring the issues associated with a full scale project analyzing the link between lightness of anaesthesia and post-operative pain (Law, Sleigh, Barnard & MacColl, 2011). A prospective, longitudinal repeated measures design was employed. To control for pre-operative variables the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, state and trait versions (STAI-Y 1 and Y 2 respectively), The Magill Pain Questionnaire – Short Form (MPQ-SF), the Pain Locus of Control Questionnaire (PLOCQ) and a nonvalidated body image screening question were administered pre-operatively. Depth of anaesthesia was measured intra-operatively using a Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS). Follow up was conducted a 1 - 2 days, 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively. At follow up the MPQ-SF, STAI-Y 1 and body image screening question were administered. Twelve participants were recruited. A statistically significant effect of lightness of anaesthesia on post-operative pain was not detected due to small sample size. It was concluded that a large scale study would be feasible. Implications for the execution of future research projects are discussed, {{as well as for}} clinical practice. Critical Appraisal: The critical appraisal explored personal reflections on the research process. Areas covered included motivations to carry out the research project, the experience of the researcher at various stages of the process and discussion of lessons for future researchers in this area.

40|$|In this project, I {{illustrate}} the interdisciplinarity of international, intercultural creative writing and history through {{the construction of}} my short story, “The Lord of Pandemonium. ” I wrote it for my class in Writing Fiction, in which I developed my own writing process based on drafting, research and revision in a multidisciplinary approach. Although multidisciplinarity in storytelling offer refers to the use of multiple media resources (picture, video, audio) which complement the story, my approach explores the steps taken {{in order to create a}} story in an existing historical context, honing in from other subject areas in academia but maintaining a single dimension to storytelling in written words. My process includes research of the cultural and international context as well as the process of revision. The research I have done contributed to the composition of the reality in which the story takes place: the period of instability immediately preceding the Rwanda genocide. I went through academic articles and online research of news pieces, which offered accounts and analysis of the genocide. Together, these offered the basic structuring of the world I wrote in. I used the compiled data to construct not only a three-dimensional “map” or “scheme” of the world in which the story takes place, but also a historical context that explains why things were the way they were at a political, cultural and individual level. The second section of my process is based on revision, which prompted me to wonder how I could offer a different account of history. For revision I honed in on Diane <b>Lefer’s</b> essay “Breaking the ‘rules’ of story structure,” in which she argues in favor of the breaking of conventions in writing – how a story can be told in a new way. In other words, “how could I offer a different perspective to read this historical event?” Instead of weighing experiences against facts and trying to balance them out, I decided to expose facts through a narrative. Revision is about trying to get a fresh perspective on the story’s subject, so my story is about the people who do not show up in detail in history books or research. It is not factual in its character-driven plot, but every event that alters the character’s life and experiences is based on fact. Although I make use of history to bring life to the character, in my revision I honed in on individuality. How is an individual impacted by ethnic conflict, post-colonial society and which side does he take? How does that affect his perspective of the world and his personal relationships? As a person, how would this setting change the way a character sees the world? To me, that is a special kind of storytelling because I am focusing on the humanity behind history and on how people’s hands form and destroy their futures. That is what makes storytelling personal, relatable and even educational. Different perspectives, different opinions prompt learning and personal connections. My effort to try to reach for those who have not had their voices heard and trying to learn about an entirely different country is a form of creating and accepting dissent, new voices that contribute to political debate and reach people’s hearts. That public debate, which is essential for a functional democratic society, can be prompted by these revisions. I consider myself better for driving off the beaten path and deviating from our common historical knowledge. I think sharing this process can help other people learn, grow and see beyond the current, established and detached accounts of history and connect to the past in a more human wa...|$|R

30|$|Seed {{moisture}} content {{depends on the}} seed coat’s permeability to water and on the {{moisture content}} of the surrounding soil. <b>LeFer</b> and Parker (2005) conducted two experiments on 13 California chaparral species to test for effects of heating and moisture on seed germination. Little to no germination of chamise seeds (Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. & Arn.) occurred in moist soil at temperatures of 90 °C, 100 °C, and 110 °C, while germination of dry chamise seeds increased after exposure to temperatures of up to 90 °C. Species negatively impacted by burning under moist soil conditions typical of spring fires lacked dormancy induced by the seed coat and seeds readily imbibed water. Thus, seeds that are protected from imbibing water by hard seed coats, such as seeds of buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus [Hook.] Nutt.) (LaFer and Parker 2005) and hollyhock (Iliamna spp. Greene) (Brown and DeByle 1989) can have high tolerance to external heat.|$|E

40|$|AUTHORS ' SYNOPSIS In the rat {{adrenalectomy}} decreases cardiac output, stroke volume, {{and left}} ventricular stroke work when these are measured one, three, and seven days after operation. Arterial {{blood pressure is}} normal on {{the first and third}} days because of a compensatory increase in total peripheral resistance. On the seventh day when the animals were showing obvious adrenocortical insufficiency there was a marked fall in blood pressure. Substitution of 0. 9 % NaCl solution for the drinking water improves cardiac function after the first postoperative day. Cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke work are all greater than in the water maintained, adrenalectomized animals and approach normal levels. The blood pressure on the seventh postoperative day was normal. These animals were apparently healthy, ate well, and were growing. Adrenalectomy in the cat and in the dog is followed by reductions in blood pressure and cardiac output (Webb et al., 1965; Weiner et al., 1967; <b>Lefer</b> et al., 1968); in acute experiments the peripheral resistance is lowered, but it is raised in animals studied seven or more days after adrenalectomy. A brief note by Weiner et al. (1967) suggests that cardiac output and blood pressure are lowered in the adrenalectomized rat. Since the rat has been extensively used to study adrenocortical physiology, a more detailed study of the cardiovascular changes which follow adrenalectomy has been made in this species. The development of these changes during the seven days following adrenalectomy has been moni-tored since previous workers (see above) have not investigated animals within this period.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{potential}} for using AtHMA 4 to engineer enhanced efficiency of Zn translocation to shoots, and to increase the Zn concentration in aerial tissues of tomato. AtHMA 4, a P 1 B-ATPase, encodes a Zn export protein known {{to be involved in the}} control of Zn root-to-shoot translocation. In this work, 35 S::AtHMA 4 was expressed in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Beta). Wild-type and transgenic plants were tested for Zn and Cd tolerance; Zn, Fe and Cd accumulation patterns, and for the expression of endogenous Zn/Fe-homeostasis genes. At 10 ?M Zn exposure, a higher Zn concentration was observed in leaves of AtHMA 4 -expressing lines compared to wild-type, which is promising in terms of Zn biofortification. AtHMA 4 also transports Cd and at 0. 25 ?M Cd the transgenic plants showed similar levels of this element in leaves to wild-type but lower levels in roots, therefore indicating a reduction of Cd uptake due to AtHMA 4 expression. Expression of this transgene AtHMA 4 also resulted in distinct changes in Fe accumulation in Zn-exposed plants, and Fe/Zn-accumulation in Cd-exposed plants, even though Fe is not a substrate for AtHMA 4. Analysis of the transcript abundance of key Zn/Fe-homeostasis genes showed that the pattern was distinct for transgenic and wild-type plants. The reduction of Fe accumulation observed in AtHMA 4 -transformants was accompanied by up-regulation of Fe-deficiency marker genes (<b>LeFER,</b> LeFRO 1, LeIRT 1), whereas down-regulation was detected in plants with the status of Fe-sufficiency. Furthermore, results strongly suggest the importance of the up-regulation of LeCHLN in the roots of AtHMA 4 -expressing plants for efficient translocation of Zn to the shoots. Thus, the modifications of Zn/Fe/Cd translocation to aerial plant parts due to AtHMA 4 expression are closely related to the alteration of the endogenous Zn–Fe–Cd cross-homeostasis network of tomato...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{recently}} begun corpus-based research project which focuses on patterns in the translation of noun phrases with a nominal compound as head in the language pair German–Dutch. This research topic, which has rarely {{been the subject of}} investigation so far, not only reveals interesting divergences between two closely related languages in system and usage (Campe 2008), it also has implications for the debate over so-called translation universals (Van de Velde 2011). In {{the first part of the}} paper, we discuss the research questions that drive the project, beginning with asymmetries in the productivity of nominal composition in both languages. Although nominal composition is generally productive in Germanic (Gaeta & Schlücker, eds., 2012), it is more productive in German than in Dutch (Hüning & Schlücker 2010). That is why German compounds may be translated by means of alternative (e. g. adjectival or prepositional) constructions in Dutch translation, sometimes with accompanying differences in meaning (De Metsenaere & Van de Velde 2013). But what about the reverse direction: how are Dutch noun phrases translated into German? Why does the Dutch translation sometimes opt for a noun phrase with a nominal compound as head when there is no compound in the German source text? Are the differences in meaning the same in both directions? In the second part of our paper, we discuss the methodology of the project and some early results and implications. The empirical basis of the project is a recently compiled bidirectional parallel literary corpus of German and Dutch fictional texts. All German and Dutch noun phrases are extracted from the corpus and systematically compared to their respective translations. The original language texts are used as a comparable corpus, revealing tendencies that are specific to translated language in either direction. At a later stage of the project, non-fictional texts will be analysed and compared to the results of the present, early stage (cf. Becher 2011, <b>Lefer</b> 2012) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{increase}} the Zn level in shoots, AtHMA 4 was ectopically expressed in tomato under the constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter. However, the Zn {{concentration in the}} shoots of transgenic plants failed to increase at all tested Zn levels in the medium. Modification of Zn root/shoot distribution in tomato expressing 35 S::AtHMA 4 depended on the concentration of Zn in the medium, thus indicating involvement of unknown endogenous metal-homeostasis mechanisms. To determine these mechanisms, those metal-homeostasis genes that were expressed differently in transgenic and wild-type plants were identified by microarray and RT-qPCR analysis using laser-assisted microdissected RNA isolated from two root sectors: (epidermis[*]+[*]cortex and stele), and leaf sectors (upper epidermis[*]+[*]palisade parenchyma and lower epidermis[*]+[*]spongy parenchyma). RESULTS: Zn-supply-dependent modification of Zn root/shoot distribution in AtHMA 4 -tomato (increase at 5 μM Zn, no change at 0. 5 μM Zn) involved tissue-specific, distinct from that in the wild type, expression of tomato endogenous genes. First, {{it is suggested that}} an ethylene-dependent pathway underlies the detected changes in Zn root/shoot partitioning, as it was induced in transgenic plants in a distinct way depending on Zn exposure. Upon exposure to 5 or 0. 5 μM Zn, in the epidermis[*]+[*]cortex of the transgenics' roots the expression of the Strategy I Fe-uptake system (ethylene-dependent LeIRT 1 and <b>LeFER)</b> was respectively lower or higher than in the wild type and was accompanied by respectively lower or higher expression of the identified ethylene genes (LeNR, LeACO 4, LeACO 5) and of LeChln. Second, the contribution of LeNRAMP 2 expression in the stele is shown to be distinct for wild-type and transgenic plants at both Zn exposures. Ethylene was also suggested as an important factor in a pathway induced in the leaves of transgenic plants by high Zn in the apoplast, which results in the initiation of loading of the excess Zn into the mesophyll of "Zn accumulating cells". CONCLUSIONS: In transgenic tomato plants, the export activity of ectopically expressed AtHMA 4 changes the cellular Zn status, which induces coordinated tissue-specific responses of endogenous ethylene-related genes and metal transporters. These changes constitute an important mechanism involved in the generation of the metal-related phenotype of transgenic tomato expressing AtHMA 4...|$|E

40|$|Urban air {{pollution}} absorbs and scatters solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and thus has a potentially large effect on tropospheric photochemical rates. We present the first detailed comparison between actinic fluxes (AF) in the wavelength range 330 – 420 nm measured in highly polluted conditions and simulated with the Tropospheric UltravioletVisible (TUV) model. Measurements were {{made during the}} MILAGRO campaign near Mexico City in March 2006, at a ground-based station near Mexico City (the T 1 supersite) and from the NSF/NCAR C- 130 aircraft. At the surface, measured AF values are typically smaller than the model by up to 25 % in the morning, 10 % at noon, and 40 % in the afternoon, for pollution-free and cloud-free conditions. When measurements of PBL height, NO 2 concentration and aerosols optical properties {{are included in the}} model, the agreement improves to within ± 10 % in the morning and afternoon, and ± 3 % at noon. Based on daily averages, aerosols account for 68 % and NO 2 for 25 % of AF reductions observed at the surface. Several overpasses from the C- 130 aircraft provided the opportunity to examine the AF perturbations aloft, and also show better agreement with the model when aerosol and NO 2 effects are included above and below the flight altitude. TUV model simulations show that the vertical structure of the actinic flux is sensitive to the choice of the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) at UV wavelengths. Typically, aerosols enhance AF above the PBL and reduce AF near the surface. However, for highly scattering aerosols (SSA > 0. 95), enhancements can penetrate well into the PBL, while for strongly absorbing aerosols (SSA < 0. 6) reductions in AF are computed in the free troposphere {{as well as in the}} PBL. Additional measurements of the SSA at these wavelengths are needed to better constrain the effect of aerosols on the vertical structure of the AF. Fil: Palancar, Gustavo Gerardo.

40|$|Previous {{research}} within corpus-based {{translation studies}} {{has shown that}} written translations are more normalized or standardized compared to their source texts or comparable non-translated texts (Baker 1993). However, recent studies have repeatedly demonstrated that this standardization tendency depends on contextual parameters such as register, source language and target audience (e. g. Delaere & De Sutter 2013; Kruger & van Rooy 2012). In our study this vexed question is sent in a new, largely unexplored direction, viz. audiovisual translation (AVT). Although AVT is a widely investigated discipline within Translation Studies, research that focuses on linguistic variability in audiovisual translation is relatively scarce. Most of the attention went to {{the exploration of the}} general strategies that are used to cope with the information load in the original text (e. g. Barambones Zubiria 2012) and to specific linguistic features in audiovisual translation (e. g. Baños 2013). The present study measures linguistic norm-adherence in Belgian Dutch written and audiovisual translation. More particularly, it is investigated (i) whether subtitlers in (Dutch-speaking) Flanders prefer non-standard variants (frequently used in Flanders, but not accepted) rather than General Standard Dutch variants (used and accepted in both Flanders and the Netherlands) and (ii) to what extent their choices differ from those made by translators of written texts and by authors of original, non-translated texts. Furthermore, we explain the subtitlers’ linguistic behavior through the parameters program genre (news vs. entertainment), speaker type (voice-over vs. actor/interviewee) and source language (interlingual vs. intralingual). In order to achieve that goal, we gathered a set of 11 norm-related linguistic variables and extracted them from two corpora: (i) the SoNaR-corpus, a 500 -million word balanced reference corpus for contemporary (1954 -present) written Dutch (the SoNaR corpus; Hoste et al. 2010) and (ii) the Dutch Parallel Corpus (DPC; Macken et al. 2011), a bidirectional parallel corpus with (Belgian and Netherlandic) Dutch as a source language and as a target language. By means of a correspondence analysis (Plevoets, 2008), linguistic distances between the translation types (AVT, written translations, news, entertainment, …) and their interactions were measured and visualized in a two-dimensional plot. The results reveal significant differences between interlingual and intralingual subtitles, between subtitles and written translations, and between subtitles and original texts. More specifically, it is shown that subtitles hold a middle position between written translations and non-translations, as the subtitle data contained significantly more non-general Belgian Dutch variants compared to regular written translations but less than original Dutch texts. In-depth analyses pointed out that linguistic choices in subtitles are mainly determined by the source language and by the speaker type. Based on these results, we can conclude that Flemish subtitles tend to be normalized, but in a less extreme way than regular written translations, {{due to the fact that}} they are (heavily edited) translations on the one hand (stimulating norm-adherent behavior), and written reproductions of spoken language on the other hand (stimulating non-standardizing behavior).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a contrastive analysis of prefixation in English and French writing. More generally, it provides {{new insights into}} the under-researched area of contrastive lexical morphology through the use of corpus data and corpus linguistic tools and methods. The thesis has three major objectives: •	Descriptive objective: two contradictory statements are commonly reported in the largely introspection-based contrastive literature. First, it is claimed that derivation tends to be more productive in English than in French (e. g. Vinay & Darbelnet 1958 / 1995, Van Hoof 1989, Van Roey 1990). This major cross-linguistic difference, it is argued, results in translation difficulties to render English derivatives in French (e. g. use of multi-word units and paraphrases). Even though this claim seems at least partly intuitively valid (notably in view of the coexistence of two stocks of affixes in English, one Romance and the other Germanic), there is still no solid empirical evidence to confirm it. In addition, the claim is in contradiction with the observation made in some studies that Germanic languages tend to favour compounding (the combination of two base words) while Romance languages have a predilection for derivation (e. g. Bauer 1978, Chuquet & Paillard 1987). A pilot study devoted to English and French derived adjectives (<b>Lefer</b> 2004) has suggested that the first claim from the literature should be qualified, as it downplays the productivity of the French derivational system. As pointed out by Granger(1996 b: 40), “intuitions are rarely “wrong” but […] they often give only a partial – and hence often misleading – view of reality. ” This thesis aims to address the introspection-based claims made in the contrastive literature by providing a detailed contrastive analysis of prefixation in English and French, thereby filling a gap in morphological research, where prefixation is clearly neglected compared to suffixation and compounding (Schröder 2008 a). In addition, the approach to prefixation adopted here is innovative in that it takes into account prefixation as a whole (macro-approach) and focuses on its semantic aspects, which makes it possible to describe some of the interactions between lexical morphology and lexis or grammar. Word-formation studies, by contrast, traditionally focus on a particular affix (micro-approach) and tend to relegate semantic issues to the background. •	Theoretical objective: the theoretical objective of the thesis is threefold. o	First, the thesis addresses the theoretical issue of the tertium comparationis (TC) in contrastive lexical morphology. Issues in connection with the TC are often treated only marginally in cross-linguistic research, where the emphasis tends to fall on actual practice and applications (Fisiak 1980, Krzeszowski 1990), which seriously undermines the scientific rigour of contrastive studies. o	Second, the thesis examines the constructs of ‘prefix’ and ‘derivative’ from a contrastive perspective. Even though these terms are commonly used, they lack a clear definition that would enable researchers to study prefixation cross-linguistically. I thus aim to provide clear and consistent criteria for affixhood and derivativeness. o	Finally, the study assesses the impact of stylistic variation on the productivity and, to a lesser extent, frequency of English and French prefixes in writing, thereby establishing links between word-formation and stylistic variation. Corpus-based morphological studies (e. g. Baayen 1994, Plag et al. 1999) have shown that the use of derivational morphology greatly varies across registers and genres. This indicates that the claims from the contrastive literature, which presents languages as monolithic entities, could probably be qualified on the basis of variationist data. In this respect, {{it should be noted that}} variationist studies are scarce (especially in French word-formation) and have been mainly devoted to suffixes. In this thesis, prefixation is studied in three main genres (novels, newspaper editorials and research articles) and in three academic disciplines (economics, linguistics and medicine). •	Methodological objective: In order to test the contradictory claims made in the contrastive literature, a corpus linguistic approach to contrastive lexical morphology is adopted. The thesis discusses the strengths and shortcomings of comparable corpora and, to a lesser extent, translation corpora to test these claims. In order to achieve this objective, I aim to develop a corpus linguistic framework for the extraction and analysis of prefixed words across languages. The thesis is organised in seven chapters. Chapter 1 opens by reflecting on the position occupied by contrastive lexical morphology in the three major fields of which it partakes, viz. morphology, contrastive linguistics and lexicology. It shows that contrastive lexical morphology is the parent pauvre in each of these three fields. It then offers a review of studies in contrastive lexical morphology, covering a period of c. 50 years. Finally, it discusses the main claims on lexical morphology from the English-French contrastive literature and presents the findings of a number of corpus-based studies that cast doubt on their validity. Chapter 2 is dedicated to the establishment of a contrastive methodological framework for the analysis of lexical morphology across languages. Following the methodology advocated by the major reference works in contrastive linguistics (e. g. James 1980, Krzeszowski 1990), it describes the objects to be compared across languages, viz. ‘derivative’ and ‘prefix’, and establishes a semantic tertium comparationis to ensure that we are comparing like with like. Chapter 3 deals with the much-debated concept of derivational productivity. It offers a survey of the major definitions of the concept and presents the definition of productivity adopted in this thesis (realised productivity, i. e. the number of different words formed with an affix in a given corpus). It then proposes an overview of the methodologies available to study productivity and focuses on the pros and cons of the corpus-based approach. Chapter 4 is devoted to a detailed discussion of the corpora and semi-automatic methodology used in the thesis. The chapter presents the comparable corpus of novels, research articles and newspaper editorials in English and French. It also briefly introduces the bidirectional translation corpus used in the second stage of the analysis. The chapter then presents the semi-automatic methodology adopted, viz. automatic retrieval and manual editing, which is based on the criteria of analysability, existence of a derivational paradigm and semantic transparency. Chapters 5 and 6 are dedicated to the monolingual descriptions of prefixation in English and French writing, respectively. Broad monolithic trends are presented alongside variationist results (variation across genres and academic disciplines). Chapter 5 also examines the role played by Romance prefixation in English writing. Chapter 7 presents the results of the comparable corpus analysis and revisits the largely introspection-based claims made in the contrastive literature. The second part of the chapter deals with the issue of the translation of prefixed words in both translation directions: from English to French and French to English. Finally, the place of lexical morphology in English-French bilingual dictionaries is assessed. The thesis ends with a number of concluding remarks which summarise the major findings of the contrastive study and the implications and applications of the research for a number of fields, such as contrastive linguistics, morphology, vocabulary learning and teaching, lexicography and natural language processing.
