5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

25|$|The diaphaneity of {{a mineral}} {{describes}} {{the ability of}} light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through it.

Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> that are transparent. Jadeite and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property).

25|$|Mars {{lost most}} of its {{magnetic}} field about four billion years ago. As a result, solar wind and cosmic radiation interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere. This keeps the atmosphere thinner than it would otherwise be by solar wind action constantly stripping away atoms from the outer atmospheric layer. Most of the historical atmospheric loss on Mars {{can be traced back}} to this solar wind effect. Current theory posits a weakening solar wind and thus today's atmosphere stripping effects are much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> in the past when the solar wind was stronger.|$|E

25|$|Training in {{internal}} medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on medical education and physician for more details.

In general, resident work hours in medicine are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US.

25|$|The {{half-life}} of the radioisotopes {{produced by}} fusion {{tends to be}} <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste for another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material {{would have the same}} radiotoxicity as coal ash.|$|E
