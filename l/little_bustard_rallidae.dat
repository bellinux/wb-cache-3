During the breeding season, <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> shows preference for fallow land and pastures, feeding mainly of vegetable matter. The NDVI, extracted from satellite images, {{can be interpreted as}} an index of vegetation greenness and therefore with a high potential as a predictive variable of the distribution and abundance of the <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard.</b> The objective of this study aims to understand how climate influences the NDVI and how NDVI relates to the <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> abundance in the period coinciding with the start of the breeding season. Using AVHRR images within a time series of 25 years (1981 - 2006), it was analyzed at the scale of Alentejo the effect of accumulated rainfall and the land use in NDVI values.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> Tetrax tetrax {{is among}} many birds {{thought to be}} declining be cause of agricultural intensification in western Europe. In contrast with the situation elsewhere, bustard numbers have greatly increased during the last 50 years in the Crau, southern France, as agriculture has been developing. We wished to ascertain which features of agricultural development might have supported this population increase. 2. Using data on habitat-specific densities obtained by surveys of the Crau in 1998 and 1999, we assessed how breeding male <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> used habitats representing various levels of agricultural intensification. We also documented historical changes in bustard numbers and agricultural trends in the Crau, comparing them with present patterns of habitat use, to determine how changes in farmed landscapes may have driven population trends. 3. Male bustards used natural steppe and extensive agricultural habitats (fallow, grazed crops, legume crops), whereas more intensive agricultural habitats (hay-meadows, grain crops) were little used. Mean densities on extensive agricultural habitats were always high, but densities on steppe varied with landscape composition: densities were low where steppe was dominant in the landscape, but high where steppe and extensive agriculture were mixed. 4. Available literature showed that <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> settled in the Crau around 1950, after 40 % of the original steppe had been converted into arable land. We estimate a current population of 473 - 539 breeding males. Only 17 % of the original steppe remains, but extensive agricultural habitats still represent 30 % of arable land. 5. Both historical data and present habitat use suggest that <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> population trends in the Crau are driven {{by the development of}} extensive agriculture. Extensive agricultural habitats may provide <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> with resources unavailable or scarce in natural steppe. Severe declines in <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> numbers observed elsewhere could be reversed within a few decades by restoring extensive agricultural habitats. The potential impact of current European agricultural policies is discussed, with special reference to agri-environmental measures and set-aside policy. 6. This work provides an example of an avian species that benefits from cultivated landscapes, providing that they are extensive rather than intensive. We propose a simple conceptual model to illustrate how <b>little</b> <b>bustards,</b> and possibly grassland birds in general, might respond where natural habitats are modified along orthogonal axes representing cultivation and agricultural intensification...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> has {{undergone}} a steep reduction of its Western Palaearctic range over the last century. In the west of France, breeding populations declined by 96 % from 1978 to 2008 in cultivated areas where grasslands have been converted into intensively managed annual crops. <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> abundance and nest productivity have been monitored since 1995 in a 450 -km 2 site in western France. We assessed the proximate causes {{of the decline of}} <b>Little</b> <b>Bustards</b> in French farming landscapes and quantified the effectiveness of conservation measures that aimed to reverse the decline. The decline of <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard,</b> from about 65 males in 1995 to just six males in 2003, could be related to a near absence of recruitment over this period. Since 2004, the establishment of more than 1300 ha of specifically targeted agri-environment schemes (AES) in the study site has led to a sharp increase in female productivity, mainly associated with nesting in AES fields. By imposing constraints on mowing dates, AES have prevented nest destruction and female mortality during mowing and, by increasing plant species diversity, provided chicks with a higher abundance of grasshoppers. This has contributed to reversing the trend, and increasing the population to around 30 males in 2009. Conservation strategies involving specifically targeted AES based on the identification of limiting factors can help to reverse the decline of threatened species...|$|R
40|$|Changes in land use/land cover {{are a major}} {{driver of}} {{biodiversity}} change in the Mediterranean region. Understanding how animal populations respond to these landscape changes often requires using landscape mosaics as the unit of investigation, but few previous studies have measured both response and explanatory variables at the land mosaic level. Here, we used a "whole-landscape" approach to assess the influence of regional variation in the land cover composition of 81 farmland mosaics (mean area of 2900 ha) on the population density of a threatened bird, the <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> (Tetrax tetrax), in southern Portugal. Results showed that ca. 50 % of the regional variability in the density of <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> {{could be explained by}} three variables summarising the land cover composition and diversity in the studied mosaics. <b>Little</b> <b>bustard</b> breeding males attained higher population density in land mosaics with a low land cover diversity, with less forests, and dominated by grasslands. Land mosaic composition gradients showed that agricultural intensification was not reflected in a loss of land cover diversity, as in many other regions of Europe. On the contrary, it led to the introduction of new land cover types in homogenous farmland, which increased land cover diversity but reduced overall landscape suitability for the species. Based on these results, the impact of recent land cover changes in Europe on the <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> populations is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Foraging {{strategies}} and diet selection play {{an essential role}} in individual survival and reproductive success. The study of feeding ecology becomes crucial when it concerns endangered species such as the <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> (Tetrax tetrax), whose populations are suffering strong declines as a consequence of agricultural intensification. Despite the fact that several populations are overwintering in areas affected by agricultural transformation, nothing is known about how feeding behavior responds to these changes. We studied {{for the first time the}} winter diet composition of the <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> in Spain and compared it between areas with two different farming systems: dry and irrigated farmland. Diet was studied through the micro-histological analysis of 357 droppings collected in 16 locations across the wintering range of the <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> in Spain. Up to 62 plant species were identified. Most consumed species were cultivated legumes (46. 7 %) and dicotyledon weeds (45. 6 %), while monocotyledons were scarcely consumed (7. 7 %). Diet composition differed significantly between dry and irrigated farmland areas. In irrigated areas, diet was mainly composed of legumes, in particular alfalfa (Medicago sativa). In contrast, in dry farmland areas diet was more diverse, composed mainly of weeds (Compositae, Papaveraceae, and Cruciferae) and also cultivated legumes, particularly vetch (Vicia sativa). These results suggest that legume crops could be an effective measure to improve habitat quality in areas with scarce food resources. However, in the case of irrigated areas, the strong reliance on alfalfa could make the <b>Little</b> <b>Bustard</b> more vulnerable to changes in land use.

40|$|International audienceLeks have {{recently}} been defined as male display aggregations that females attend primarily {{for the purpose of}} mating. This is an extended version of previous definitions, as a clear-cut definition of leks is difficult to obtain. Four criteria should be verified to identify a lekking species: (i) there is no male parental investment beyond the sperm; (ii) males aggregate at specific sites for display; (iii) the only resource females find on the lek is the male, i. e. the male genes; (iv) females can select her mate(s), although the necessity of this latter condition for lekking species has been highly debated. We applied these criteria to the endangered <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> Tetrax tetrax, a species that is claimed to show an exploded lek mating system, but for which this has never been fully investigated. We monitored a population of <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> in western France during 2 years to investigate the two central criteria in the assessment of their mating system: male aggregation in arenas and lack of consistent resources in male territories. We analysed the spatial distribution of <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> male territories, the individual variation in size, and the land use characteristics of male territories, with particular attention to the habitats that may be considered as defensible resources. Displaying males showed an aggregated spatial distribution over the study area during the 2 years of survey. Male territories were rather large (19916 ha), but a large among-male variability in territory size was observed. Land use within the territories included mainly permanent and semi-permanent crops. The variability in land use among territories suggests also that resources found within male territories were selected according to male needs (food and display) rather than to female needs (permanent crops that are more appropriate for reproduction). The mating system of the <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> seems to match the general (and extended) definition of leks, at least in some populations. However, limits between resource defence polygyny and extreme exploded or resource-based leks are thin and unclear, and the <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> {{is a good example of}} how lek definitions may be difficult to apply in non clear-cut empirical situations...|$|R

Limited population reinforcement has thus appeared as a potential conservation strategy for this species in agricultural habitats, while agro-environmental actions have begun to have an effect on habitat quality at the landscape level. Different strategies for the reinforcement of fledglings, including the number and frequency of releases and the number of release localities in relation to four criteria for choosing the release points, were evaluated in terms of their effect in reducing the extinction risk of local populations and of the metapopulation. The reinforcement of 100 fledglings per year for 5 years and choosing the actual release points using the current abundance were found to be the optimal choices for reducing the estimated extinction risk of the remaining <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> population in south-west France...|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} several {{hypotheses}} proposed as to why males cluster into leks. The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as {{the driving force behind}} aggregation. The hotshot model hypothesizes that attractive males, known as hotshots, garner both female and male attention. Females go to the hotshots because they are attracted to these males. Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the <b>little</b> <b>bustard,</b> Tetrax tetrax, was done to test the various lek evolution models. The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys.

40|$|In Mediterranean dry grasslands, grazing by {{domestic}} animals {{is an important}} agricultural activity on dry grasslands. Several bird species occur in these grazed habitats and are now experiencing a near continuous decline. We investigated the impact of livestock grazing on the threatened <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> (Tetrax tetrax L.). The study was conducted at the NATURA 2000 Site/Important Bird Area of Cabrela, Portugal. Our main goals were to investigate responses of <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> territorial males and breeding females to different livestock management practices, namely pasture types, stocking rates and sward structure. Bird distribution was surveyed using car and foot surveys. Data on grazing was supplied by land managers every 10 days from February to June through field interviews. Generalised additive models and model averaging were used to compute predictive models. Results indicate that higher probabilities of occurrence were found in long-term pastures and under light-moderate grazing conditions (stocking rates around 0. 4 LU/ha). Conversely, lower probabilities of occurrence were found in ungrazed or heavy grazed fields. Males occurred mostly in large fields, but this variable seemed to be less important for females. On the other hand, green plant cover and the vegetation height were good predictors for the occurrence of females but not for males. Females used mostly pastures with vegetation height around 20 – 25 cm. Our results suggest that grazing management plans that aim to conserve <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> populations should consider (1) {{the maintenance of the}} larger long-term pastures and (2) the use of light-moderate stocking rates (0. 2 – 0. 6 LU/ha) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Little</b> <b>bustard</b> {{populations have}} {{suffered}} reduction and isolation {{as a consequence}} of landscape transformations resulting from changes in traditional agricultural systems. Consequently, the species survives within reduced and fragmentary habitats, like islands isolated in a modified matrix. In this paper, we analyze the spatial variations in male density and habitat quality in a fragmented population located at the limit of the species’ Iberian range, which is affected by agricultural intensification, using a regional modelling approach. Habitat quality (quantified according to the species perception) and bird density decreased along the intensification gradient. However, in the most intensive agricultural zone, the quality of habitats selected by <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> males increased, while density decreased, against the expected. In possible explanation, we suggest: (1) density is not necessarily a good indicator of habitat quality, (2) population could be under-saturated in this zone, (3) interannual variations in species distribution, or (4) other relevant variables related to the agricultural intensification process not included in this analysis, such as small-scale disturbances. Analysis of population distribution pattern showed a spatial configuration in which the most densely populated squares were located {{at the core of the}} biggest population patches, in contact with mid-density squares, and all surrounded by low-density squares. Fragmentation negatively affected habitat quality and male density. Largest population patches, containing higher density values, were located at the beginning of the intensification gradient.

The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65 % of pin-tailed sandgrouse flocks).
