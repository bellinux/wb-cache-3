According to the characteristics of shale gas in adsorption-desorption, diffusion, slippage and seepage during accumulation, migration and production, a mathematical model of unstable seepage in dual-porosity sealed shale-gas reservoir was developed while considering Knudsen diffusion, slip-flow <b>effect</b> and <b>Langmuir</b> desorption <b>effect.</b> By solving the model utilizing the Stehfest numerical inversion and computer programming in Laplace space, several typical curves of bottomhole pressure were obtained. In this paper, we discussed the effects of several parameters on the pressure dynamics, i. e. storativity ratio, Langmuir volume, Langmuir pressure, adsorption-desorption, tangential momentum accommodation coefficient, flow coefficient, boundary. The results show that the desorbed gas extends the time for fluid to flow from matrix system to fracture system; the changes of Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure associated with desorption and ad sorption effect are the internal causes of the storativity ratio change; when the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient decreases, the time for pressure wave to spread to the border reduces; interporosity flow coefficient determines the occurrence time of the transition stage; boundary range restricts the time for pressure wave to spread to the border. </p...|$|R

We investigate the transport of solar flare energetic electrons in the heliospheric plasma to understand the role of transport to the observed onset and spectral properties of the impulsive solar electron events. The propagation of energetic electrons in solar wind plasma is simulated from the acceleration region at the Sun to the Earth, taking into account self-consistent generation and absorption of electrostatic electron plasma (<b>Langmuir)</b> waves, <b>effects</b> of non-uniform plasma, collisions and Landau damping. The simulations suggest that the beam-driven plasma turbulence {{and the effects of}} solar wind density inhomogeneity play a crucial role and lead to the appearance of a) spectral break for a single power-law injected electron spectrum, with the spectrum flatter below the break, b) apparent early onset of low-energy electron injection, c) the apparent late maximum of low-energy electron injection. We show that the observed onsets, spectral flattening at low energies, and formation of a break energy at tens of keV is the direct manifestation of wave-particle interactions in non-uniform plasma of a single accelerated electron population with an initial power-law spectrum.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{extent to}} which the large-scale organised water motion in the surface waters of lakes and reservoirs, known as Langmuir circulation, affects the distribution and settling of suspended particles, especially the algae, is not known and has been ignored in the conventional modelling of water quality. Since the settling of these particles is an important process in determining water quality, the present study investigates the <b>Langmuir</b> circulation <b>effect</b> by means of a mathematical model, based on the two-dimensional advection-diffusion mass transport equation describing the temporal and spatial distribution of suspended particles in a typical Langmuir cell. The Langmuir circulation flow field and turbulent diffusion coefficients are empirically modelled by relating these variables to the environmental parameters. It has been shown that Langmuir circulation does affect particle distribution and settling. For particles with small sinking speeds, the circulation causes intense mixing, resulting in essentially uniform distribution of particles over the Langmuir cell. For particles with high sinking velocities, aggregation of particles can occur, giving rise to considerable reduction in sinking losses. Two preliminary laboratory experiments have been performed. The wind-wave tank experiment suggests that the Langmuir circulation scale of motion is dependent on the significant height of the surface waves, thus providing an empirical means of determining the size of Langmuir cells from environmental variables. The particle-settling tank experiment holds promise as a means of studying the effect of circulating flows on the distribution and settling of particles...|$|R

The isotherms obtained in the time-lag experimental device display a diffusion coefficient and permeability behavior {{similar to that of}} glassy polymers. We apply the dual model to semicrystalline polymers assuming that Henry’s sites are related to the amorphous phase, which decreases when the crystallinity percentage increases.

Their <b>effect</b> is to increase both, the tortuosity of diffusion trajectories and the chain immobilization. We now explain this effect using thermodynamic considerations.

In those terms, the diffusion coefficient does not follow the same crystalline percentage dependence than the solubility. According to the previous findings, the solubility changes in proportion to amorphous percentages. Instead, diffusion coefficient has exponential dependence.

40|$|Air-sea {{energy and}} {{momentum}} fluxes constrain the available energy for tropical cyclone intensification. The surface wave field modifies these fluxes in numerous ways. In {{this study we}} focus on two sea-state dependent processes. The first is the sea-state dependence of the wind stress over the ocean under tropical cyclone force winds. The second is the sea-state dependence of the upper-ocean turbulence due to Langmuir turbulence, which modifies the mixed-layer deepening and cooling of the ocean surface during {{the passage of a}} tropical cyclone. In this study we utilize the WAVEWATCH III (WW 3) surface wave model, the one-dimensional General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), and the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) to investigate these processes. ^ The impact of the surface wave field (sea-state) on the wind stress over the ocean is investigated with fetch-dependent seas under uniform wind and with complex seas under idealized tropical cyclone winds. Two different approaches are employed to calculate the wind stress and the mean wind profile. The near-peak frequency range of the surface wave field is simulated using the WAVEWATCH III model. The high frequency part of the surface wave field is empirically determined using a range of different tail levels. The results suggest that the drag coefficient magnitude is very sensitive to the spectral tail level but is not very sensitive to the drag coefficient calculation methods. The drag coefficients at 40 m/s vary from 0. 001 to 0. 004 depending on the saturation level. The misalignment angle between the wind stress vector and the wind vector is sensitive to the stress calculation method used. In particular, if the cross-wind swell is allowed to contribute to the wind stress, it tends to increase the misalignment angle. Our results predict similar amounts of sea state dependence of the drag coefficient regardless of the approaches taken. More sea-state dependence of the drag coefficient is predicted for tropical cyclones than for aligned growing wind conditions, this enhancement of the drag coefficient may be attributed to swell that is significantly misaligned with local wind. The amount of sea-state dependence of the drag coefficient is sensitive to the tail level and the translation speed of the tropical cyclone. ^ The upper-ocean turbulence is significantly modified by the Stokes drift of the surface waves because of the Craik-Leibovich vortex force (Langmuir turbulence). Under tropical cyclones the contribution of the surface waves varies significantly depending on complex wind and wave conditions. Therefore, turbulence closure models used in ocean models need to explicitly include the sea-state dependent impacts of the Langmuir turbulence. In this study the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) 1 st moment turbulence closure model is modified to include the <b>Langmuir</b> turbulence <b>effect,</b> and its performance is tested against concurrent Large Eddy Simulation (LES) experiments under tropical cyclone conditions. First, the KPP model is tuned to reproduce LES results in conditions of shear turbulence only (KPP-ST). Next, KPP is tuned to typical ocean conditions (with typical Langmuir turbulence) but includes no explicit sea-state dependent modifications (KPP-iLT). Next, the Eulerian currents are replaced by the Lagrangian currents in the KPP equations for calculating the bulk Richardson number and the vertical turbulent momentum flux (KPP-Lag). Finally, an enhancement to the turbulent mixing is introduced {{as a function of the}} non-dimensional turbulent Langmuir number (KPP-LT). KPP-LT, with the Lagrangian currents replacing the Eulerian currents and the turbulent mixing enhanced, significantly improves the prediction of the upper-ocean temperature and currents compared to the default (unmodified) KPP model under tropical cyclones. This modified KPP model also shows improvements over the default KPP at constant moderate winds (10 m/s). ^ We then examine differences between simulations with KPP-ST, KPP-iLT, and KPP-LT under tropical cyclones in POM. Both KPP-iLT and KPP-LT enhance sea surface cooling due to vertical mixing compared to KPP-ST, but KPP-iLT significantly underestimates the cooling particularly on the left hand side of propagating storms. KPP-LT significantly reduces and homogenizes currents inside the mixing-layer by enhanced vertical momentum mixing, but KPP-iLT has little impacts on currents. Therefore, KPP-iLT introduces further error in predicting horizontal advection of heat near the cold wake as well as sea surface cooling due to upwelling for stationary and slow moving storms. These results suggest that accurate predictions of the <b>Langmuir</b> turbulence <b>effects</b> on upper-ocean response to a tropical cyclone requires an explicit sea-state dependent Langmuir turbulence parameterization. ...|$|R

The temporally evolving spatially asymmetric wind and wave Stokes drift velocity imposed in the LES are generated by a spectral wave prediction model adapted to Hurricane Frances traveling at a speed of 5. 5 m s 21. The potency of Langmuir turbulence depends on the turbulent Langmuir number, the wind–Stokes drift alignment, and the depth scale of the Stokes profile Ds relative to the OBL depth h. At the time of maximum winds, large-scale vigorous coherent cells develop {{on the right-hand side}} of the storm under the inertially rotating winds; the Stokes drift velocity is well tuned to the surface winds. Much weaker cells develop on the left-hand side of the storm, partly because of reduced Stokes production.

40|$|In {{the present}} work three topics are {{outlined}} which are connected via biomineralisation. The {{investigation of the}} mechanical response of brachiopod shell material, the macroscopic calcite crystal growth, and the microscopic calcite crystal growth are discussed. Brachiopod shells have been investigated with nanoindentation and scanning electron microscopy to determine the material properties {{and the effects of}} the microstructure on the material properties. Brachiopod shells are highly optimised fibre composite materials. The material properties are adapted to the local material demands. The calcitic brachiopod Megerlia truncata exhibits a hard primary layer and a softer secondary layer with a tendency to higher hardness at the inner shell margin. At the hinge region the hardness is considerably higher and reflects the possibly high abrasive wear. The phosphatic brachiopod shells of Lingula anatina and Discradisca stella have laminated architecture with alternating hard and soft layers. They are harder in the center and have softer, more flexible regions at the margins. The macroscopic crystal growth of calcite was performed in gels. The obtained crystals were investigated with scanning electron microscopy. With inert pore solutions the { 104 } rhombohedron is the dominating habit. Succinic acid and aspartic acid inhibit the acute steps of the calcite { 104 } surface. In combination with Mg^ 2 + and Sr^ 2 + one side divergant forms are obtained. Pore solutions containing silicic acids produce catastrophic nucleation. Crystal aggregates from calcite, aragonite, and vaterite develop. The aggregates have morphological similarities with calcites from travertines. Mg^ 2 + and Sr^ 2 + counteract the effect of silicic acids. The microscopic crystal growth of the calcite { 104 } surface was investigated with the atomic force microscope in the presence of silicic acids. The two dimensional nucleation is enhanced. The form of the hillocks change from the additive free rhomb to lenses with increasing silicic acids concentrations. The step velocities increase from 0 ppm to 20 ppm silicic acids and decrease after 20 ppm. Therefore silicic acids possess a promoter and a inhibitor effect on calcite crystal growth. The inhibitory effect can be fitted by a <b>Langmuir</b> isotherm. Both <b>effects</b> can be fitted together with a polynom of rank three. For supersaturation β = 30 the step velocities are constant. This means that the process follows the step pinning model...|$|R
