5|$|Like many {{buildings}} in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

40|$|Since {{the early}} {{diagnosis}} of alpha chain disease (alphaCD)) {{is essential to}} successful treatment and to epidemiological studies, the available immunodiagnostic techniques were compared for their sensitivity, specificity and ease of performance on a panel of sixteen sera, comprising ten alphaCD sera and six control sera containing either IgA myeloma protein or high levels of polyclonal IgA. Immunoselection by immunoelectrophoresis into gel containing a specially developed anti-Fabalpha antiserum provided the most sensitive and specific detection system for alphaCD protein. The same technique using anti-light chain antiserum for immunoselection was also highly sensitive, but proved <b>less</b> specific, being <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> false positives with difficult IgA myeloma proteins. Somewhat less sensitive, but specific and simple to perform, was immunoelectrophoresis using an antiserum recognizing the conformational specificities of Fabalpha {{as well as those}} of the constant region of alpha chains.

5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being <b>less</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
5|$|Many lemurs {{that eat}} leaves {{tend to do}} so during times of fruit scarcity, {{sometimes}} suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86native plant families and 15alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from Ficus (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of vitamin C, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity {{have been shown to}} be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be <b>less</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> the disorder than other lemur species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases <b>less</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{studied the}} {{relative}} spatial positioning of nonrotameric side chains with atypical and strained dihedral angles in well-refined protein tertiary structures. The analysis {{was confined to}} buried protein cores, which are <b>less</b> error <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> side-chain positioning. More {{than half of the}} proteins with two or more nonrotameric residues displayed clusters of two or more (and up to five) nonrotameric residues. The clusters exhibited lower average crystallographic temperature factors compared with isolated nonrotameric residues. Nonrotameric clusters showed significantly tighter packing than corresponding rotameric clusters and had distinct residue compositions that did not correlate with amino acid characteristics such as size, hydrophobicity, turn preference, and the like. Such nonrotameric residue biases would suggest that spatially concentrated strain in protein folds would be minimized by lowered vibrational energy. Furthermore, nonrotameric residues avoided helices and strands and mostly preferred coil regions. If they were in the helical conformation, then they preferred to be within N-terminal segments.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to derive {{properties}} of an optimal compensation scheme for consumer cooperatives (Coops) in situations of strategic interaction with profit-maximizing firms (PMFs). Our model provides a reason why Coops are <b>less</b> <b>prone</b> than PMFs <b>to</b> pay variable bonuses to their managers. We show that this occurs under price competition when in equilibrium the Coop prefers to pay a straight salary to its manager whereas the profit-maximizing rival adopts a variable, high-powered incentive scheme. The main rationale is that, due to consumers’ preferences, a Coop is per se highly expansionary in term of output and, therefore, does not need to provide strong strategic incentives to their managers to expand output aggressively by undercutting its rival...|$|R
40|$|A blind {{adaptive}} {{color image}} watermarking {{scheme based on}} principal component analysis, singular value decomposition, and human visual system is proposed. The use of principal component analysis to decorrelate the three color channels of host image, improves the perceptual quality of watermarked image. Whereas, human visual system and fuzzy inference system helped to improve both imperceptibility and robustness by selecting adaptive scaling factor, so that, areas more <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> noise can be added with more information as compared <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>prone</b> areas. <b>To</b> achieve security, location of watermark embedding is kept secret and used as key {{at the time of}} watermark extraction, whereas, for capacity both singular values and vectors are involved in watermark embedding process. As a result, four contradictory requirements; imperceptibility, robustness, security and capacity are achieved as suggested by results. Both subjective and objective methods are acquired to examine the performance of proposed schemes. For subjective analysis the watermarked images and watermarks extracted from attacked watermarked images are shown. For objective analysis of proposed scheme in terms of imperceptibility, peak signal to noise ratio, structural similarity index, visual information fidelity and normalized color difference are used. Whereas, for objective analysis in terms of robustness, normalized correlation, bit error rate, normalized hamming distance and global authentication rate are used. Security is checked by using different keys to extract the watermark. The proposed schemes are compared with state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and found better performance as suggested by results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{research}} {{topic that}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular is that of on-board mobile communication, where users on a vehicle are connected to a local network that attaches to the Internet via a mobile router and a wireless link. However, wireless data transmission is <b>less</b> efficient, <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> error and unreliable in a mobile environment. There {{is a need to}} make use of multiple access links simultaneously (so-called multihoming), to improve the aggregate bandwidth and the overall service availability on a mobile network. In this paper, we introduce a novel on-board Multihoming Agent for supporting the future on-board multihomed mobile routers. The Multihoming Agent can intelligently stripe user traffics into multiple active WAN interfaces based on the policy in use and the real-time network status and automatically shift user traffics from unavailable links to available ones. We show that by properly deploying the policies defined in the Policy Database and continuously collecting network status, a user can run intelligent load distribution algorithms on top of the mobile router to improve network performance and reliability via our Multihoming Agent.

40|$|Rationale Clozapine and the “atypical” {{antipsychotics}} are <b>less</b> <b>prone</b> than neuroleptics <b>to</b> induce extrapyramidal motor effects, worsening of {{the negative}} symptoms of schizophrenia and dysphoria. This is paralleled by preclinical evidence showing reduced suppression of behaviours aimed at the pursuit of reward, with increased measures of reward efficacy. Serotonin 5 -HT 2 receptors seem {{to play a role}} in determining this profile. Objective We investigated the effects of clozapine on the microstructure of ingestive behaviour, which might reveal behavioural dimensions, such as reward evaluation and behavioural activation, which might be relevant in explaining its atypical profile. Moreover, we investigated the possibility that coadministration of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C receptor antagonist ritanserin might mimic clozapine effects. Materials and methods The effects of clozapine (0. 5, 1 and 5 mg/kg) and of the coadministration of haloperidol (0. 05 mg/kg) and ritanserin (0. 5 and 3 mg/kg) have been examined on the microstructure of licking for a 10...|$|R
