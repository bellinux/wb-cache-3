Feeling this, I stood a good while behind her, writing on the margin of her book. I could hardly quit my station or relinquish my occupation; something retained me bending there, my head very near hers, and my hand near hers too; but the margin of a copy-book is not an illimitable space--so, doubtless, the directress thought; and she took occasion to walk past in order to ascertain by what art I prolonged so disproportionately the period necessary for filling it.

According to Engbersen, {{multiculturalism}} does not work in an era of liquid mobility, where more and more residents are temporary or “floating populations”, with variable and precarious legal statuses.

40|$|The {{case study}} was {{conducted}} to examine the patterns of student classroom participation. The study was also conducted to find out the factors that affect students’ participation in the classroom. Using observation and interview, the data were collected from 24 first-year TESL students consisting of 18 females and 6 males. The findings revealed that the most common pattern of participation is <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> lecturer’s questions after being prompted. It was found that majority of the students would not take part in whole-class discussions unless asked or prompted by the lecturer. Other behaviours <b>like</b> volunteering <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> lecturer’s questions (without being prompted) and giving opinions, comments etc. without being asked were commonly found. In addition, it was also found that students who contributed actively in whole-class discussions sat in front whereas those who were least active preferred to sit {{at the back of the}} classroom. The study also revealed that factors which affect students’ participation in the classroom were interrelated.

We examine responses to inequity in several groups of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in a paradigm similar to that used previously in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella). We demonstrate that, like capuchin monkeys, chimpanzees show a response to inequity of rewards that is based upon the partner receiving the reward rather than the presence of the reward alone. However, we also found a great amount of variation between groups tested, indicating that chimpanzees, <b>like</b> people, <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> inequity in a variable manner, which we speculate could be caused by such variables as group size, the social closeness of the group (as reflected in length of time that the group has been together) and group-specific traditions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I wish to {{demonstrate}} how enthymemic argument pervades modern discourse. First, I will define the enthymeme in Aristotelian terms and compare its qualities to its sibling, the syllogism.

Finally, I will propose a way that composition instructors can harness the idea of the enthymeme to facilitate critical thinking in the classroom. The purpose of the paper is to provide evidence that a rebirth of this classical term is in order. Enthymemes are tricky, and they are often there without us ever knowing or suspecting them.
