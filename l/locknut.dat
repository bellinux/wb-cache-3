500|$|Some {{off-road}} models featured two {{designs of}} one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as [...] "Mission Control" [...] (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material. The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a [...] threaded steerer. MC2 used a <b>locknut</b> tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, {{and a special}} eight pointed wrench was required to remove it. The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust {{the height of the}} stem. MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.|$|E
2500|$|... 750 cc and 500 cc {{versions}} of the Revolution engine are used in Harley-Davidson's Street line of light cruisers. These motors, named the Revolution X, use a single overhead cam, screw and <b>locknut</b> valve adjustment, a single internal counterbalancer, and vertically split crankcases; all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and <b>locknut</b> can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "jam nut" [...] {{can also}} refer to any nut {{that is used}} in the same {{function}} (even a standard nut used for the jamming purpose). Jam nuts, other types of <b>locknuts,</b> lock washers, and thread-locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|R
5000|$|Elliptical offset nuts is a {{catch-all}} {{category that}} encompasses designs known as oval <b>locknuts</b> or non-slotted hex <b>locknuts,.</b> The salient feature {{is that the}} threadform has been deformed at one end so that the threads are no longer perfectly circular. The deformed end is usually shaped into an ellipse or [...] triangle. These are known as one-way nuts as the nut may be easily started on the male fastener from the bottom non-deformed portion, but are practically impossible to start from the deformed end. As the male fastener reaches the deformed section it stretches the threads of the nut elastically back into a circle. This action increases the friction between the nut and the fastener greatly and creates the locking action. Due to the elastic nature of the deformation the nuts can be reused indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, <b>locknuts,</b> jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{drove on}} the second pair of coupled wheels. The locomotives were fitted with the single slide-bar type piston crossheads, popular in Europe but prone to rapid wear under South African conditions. The valve spindle crossheads were screwed {{to the ends of}} the valve spindles and secured with <b>locknuts.</b> Although this made adjustment easier, it was not satisfactory in service and was later replaced by the usual taper fit with cotter pin. With these two exceptions, the mechanical parts of the Class 19 gave very little trouble.|$|R
50|$|However, the investigation, {{released}} in August 2012, {{found that the}} probable cause of the crash were reused single-use <b>locknuts</b> in the left elevator trim tab system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an attachment screw and allowed the trim tab to flutter. This flutter caused the trim tab link assembly to fail which led to loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right trim tab had been fixed in place. Had both trim tabs been operational, {{the loss of the}} left trim tab alone may not have caused loss of control. When the trim tab failed, Leeward was exposed to 17Gs which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.|$|R

50|$|An interfering thread nut {{is a type}} of <b>locknut</b> {{that has}} an {{undersized}} root diameter. This creates an interference between the nut and the fastener, plastically deforming the threads on the fastener.

50|$|The {{engine was}} of {{conventional}} construction with a one-piece crankcase and cylinder block in cast iron with the crankcase extending {{down to the}} lowest level of the main bearing caps; with a cylinder head, also usually in cast iron, and a sump made from pressed steel. Early engines used a three-bearing crankshaft, but later engines used five bearings. On all except the rare twin overhead camshaft variant, the camshaft — which was chain driven and mounted low in the block — operated the overhead valves via pushrods and rocker arms. The two inlet ports in the non-crossflow cylinder head were shared between cylinders 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 and the three exhaust ports between cylinder 1, 2 + 3 and 4. Valve clearance was adjustable by screws and <b>locknuts</b> on the rocker arms.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spoke wrench}} is {{used during the}} creation, maintenance, or repair of spoked wheels to adjust the tension of the spokes. The goal common to these {{activities}} is to bring the wheel (nearer) {{to a state of}} true [...] - [...] namely, a wheel in which the rim is 1) a perfect circle concentric with the axis of the axle in the hub, and 2) planar, such that the plane of the rim is centered laterally between the two extremes of the axle where it is supported in a frame. Additionally it is to make the spoke tension as close to the same on all spokes {{on the same side of}} the wheel, and to center the rim between the <b>locknuts</b> of the hub (known as dishing the wheel).|$|R

50|$|The {{stack height}} of a headset is the total {{assembled}} height of the headset components and, {{in the case of}} a threadless system, the stem, discounting the tangs which press into the head tube and (in the case of threaded headsets) the thickness of the top seal of the <b>locknut.</b> The stack {{height of a}} frame and fork is the difference between the steerer tube length and the head tube length. Stack height is critical because a headset with a greater stack height than the frame and fork will not fit; the <b>locknut</b> will not thread on sufficiently (threaded) or there will be no room for the stem (threadless). If the headset has a lower stack height than the frame and fork, spacers are added to make up the difference.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} of this nut is the tapered thread nut. It utilizes a [...] thread {{to achieve the}} interference.

5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand and Israel the TN-C-S {{system is}} in use; however, the wiring rules {{currently}} state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth via both a water pipe bond (if metallic water pipes enter the consumer's premises) and a dedicated earth electrode. In Australia and New Zealand {{this is called the}} Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (<b>locknuts</b> for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the earth conductor (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms. In older installations, {{it is not uncommon to}} find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional earth electrode must be installed if any upgrade work is done. The protective earth and neutral conductors are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) - beyond this point, the protective earth and neutral conductors are separate.|$|R

40|$|IN 1888 Winkler {{published}} his well-known method for {{the determination of}} oxygen dissolved in water. The principle of the method is as follows. A solution of man-ganous chloride {{is added to the}} water to be analysed, followed by a solution of sodium hydroxide containing potassium iodide. A precipitate of manganous hydroxide is first formed thus: zMnClj + 4 NaOH = 4 NaCl + 2 Mn(OH) j. Part of this manganous hydroxide is then converted into manganic hydroxide by the oxygen dissolved in the water sample: 2 Mn(OH) a + HaO + O = 2 Mn(OH) 3. The solution is then acidified and oxidation of the potassium iodide takes place, iodine being liberated: 2 Mn(0 H) 3 + 2 KI + 6 HC 1 = 2 MnCla + 2 KCI + 6 H 2 O + 12. It is clear from the equations that each atom of oxygen in solution finally liberates one molecule of iodine. The iodine is titrated against sodium thiosulphate solution using starch as indicator; 1 c. c. of normal sodium thiosulphate solution corre-sponds to 8 mg. of oxygen, or 5 - 6 c. c. of oxygen at N. T. P. A number of modifications of the original technique of Winkler has been described. The accuracy both of the original method and also of any of its modi-fications is necessarily limited by the accuracy of the sampling technique. This factor is especially important when dealing with water of low oxygen concentration, for in order to obtain accurate analyses it is necessary to keep the water sample out of contact with the air. Krogh (1935) described a syringe pipette which could be used in the estimation of the oxygen content of water; by the use of such a pipette contamination of the water sample with atmospheric air was completely avoided. Van Dam (1933, 1935) modified Krogh's syringe pipette, {{and in the course of}} our studies of the respiration of aquatic animals we have further modified the syringe pipette of van Dam by replacing the metal collar with two <b>locknuts.</b> By our method...|$|R
