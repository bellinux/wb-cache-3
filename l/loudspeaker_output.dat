Maskers were recordings of continuous streams of nonsense sentences spoken by two female talkers and mixed into each of two channels (two talker, and the same masker time reversed). Two masker spatial conditions were employed: “RF” with a 4 ms time lead to the loudspeaker 60 ° horizontally to the right, and “FR” with the time lead to the front (0 °) loudspeaker. The reference nonspatial “F” masker was presented from the front loudspeaker only. Target presentation was always from the front loudspeaker. In Experiment 1, target detection threshold for both natural and time-reversed spatial maskers was 17 – 20 dB lower than that for the nonspatial masker, suggesting that significant release from informational masking occurs with spatial speech maskers regardless of masker understandability.

Simple OTL amplifiers, for example Atma-Sphere M-60, employ 8 double triodes of 6AS7 type per channel; each continuously dissipates an average of 30 watts. Without feedback, this arrangement results in an output impedance of 6-8 ohms. It can be further lowered by applying global negative feedback or paralleling more output tubes. On the extreme end, Atma-Sphere MA-2 amplifier uses 20 6AS7 tubes per channel, with a continuous power consumption of 600 watts per channel (800 watts at maximum rated output of 220 watts, or a 27% maximum efficiency).|$|R

40|$|When fitting {{hearing aids}} with {{conventional}} earmoulds using real ear measurements (REM) {{it is recommended}} to use the modified pressure with concurrent equalization method whereby a reference microphone is used to monitor the REM <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>output</b> level. The {{review of the literature}} indicates good test-retest reliability for REM using conventional earmoulds. However, in REM using open-fit, another sound field equalization method (the modified pressure with stored equalization method) should be used to minimize any inaccurate measurements resulting from the amplified sound leakage when the open-fit hearing aid is used. In addition the sound is delivered via a generic ear tip rather than a custom made earmould. Therefore, the test-retest reliability for conventional occluded earmould REM cannot be generalized to the open-fit measures. Twenty otologically normal participants were tested to investigate short-term test-retest reliability for open-fit REM, and for conventional earmoulds at both 0 o and 45 o head-to-loudspeaker azimuths by performing repeated measurements at the same participant visit but after removing both the probe tube and the hearing aid and reinserting them. It was found that open-fit REM have good short-term test-retest reliability (mean 1. 57 dB, SD 1. 10 dB) at both azimuths and are in agreement with measured (mean 2. 12 dB, SD 1. 45 dB) and reported (SD ranged from 1 to 3. 2 dB) conventional earmould REM test-retest variability values in the 0. 25 to 4 kHz frequency range (Ringdahl A & Leijon A, 1984, The reliability of insertion gain measurements using probe microphones in the ear canal, Scandinavian Audiology, 13, 173 - 8).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of a {{collaborative}} project between Cardiff University and Harman/Becker Automotive Systems. It investigates the application of Artificial Neural Networks to loudspeaker fault detection and modelling of the loudspeaker transfer function. The aim was to utilise the ability of artificial neural networks to model high order nonlinear systems to generate a model of the loudspeaker transfer function which could be used in a linearisation scheme to reduce distortion in <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>output.</b> This thesis investigates a practical approach to transfer function modelling through the use of musical excitation signals. This would allow data to be collected during normal operation of the loudspeaker and, as the transfer function changes over time due to time dependent nonlinearities, would facilitate regular updating of the neural network model to incorporate these nonlinearities. It was determined that although very accurate models could be produced over long training periods, a significant compromise in ANN training set size and number of training epochs were required to reduce the ANN training duration to the required time period, which ultimately resulted in a decline in performance. The aim in the case of fault detection was to improve on current end of production line testing for loudspeaker distortion. Neural networks were trained with harmonic distortion data in order to emulate the end of line test result. Excellent classification accuracy was achieved when neural network classification results were compared to the end of line test results. An investigation was also conducted to determine if neural networks could be trained to recognise specific loudspeaker faults. In a development of the end of line test, a system of neural networks were trained to produce an output vector that described which of five frequency regions the loudspeaker distortion levels were above the limits, thus giving an indication of the possible fault.

40|$|Dental drills {{produce a}} {{characteristic}} noise that is uncomfortable for patients {{and is also}} known to be harmful to dentists under prolonged exposure. It is therefore desirable to protect the patient and dentist whilst allowing two-way communication. A solution {{is to use a}} combination of the three main noise cancellation methods, namely, Passive Noise Control, Adaptive Filtering and Active Noise Control. Dental drill noise occurs at very high frequency ranges in relation to conventional ANC, typically 2 kHz to 6 kHz and it has a narrow band characteristic due to the direct relation of the noise to the rotational speed of the bearing. This paper presents a design of an experimental rig where first applications of ANC on dental drill noise are executed using the standard filtered reference Least Mean Square (FXLMS) algorithm. The secondary path is kept as simple as possible, due to the high frequency range of interest, and hence is chosen as the space between headphone loudspeaker and error microphone placed in the ear (input of the headphone <b>loudspeaker</b> and the <b>output</b> of the error microphone).

40|$|The {{research}} {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the use}} of inverse filtering for the design and implementation of two-channel virtual acoustic imaging systems that utilise loudspeakers. The basic objective of such systems is to invert the electroacoustic plant between the input to the <b>loudspeakers</b> and the <b>output</b> at the listener’s ears and hence make it possible for a pair of binaural signals to be locally reproduced at the position of the listener’s ears. As a starting point for the research presented, a previously introduced type of inverse filtering design is considered in which the inverse is implemented with FIR filters. The basic formulation of this design is described and a number of innovative points regarding its implementation are made. An experimental procedure is then formulated for the evaluation of the effectiveness of this inverse filtering design that is based on objective measurements of the inversion process. Unlike previously employed methods that are based on computer simulations or subjective experiments, the introduced experimental procedure is shown to be very efficient in isolating and exactly quantifying the effect on the accuracy of the inversion of a number of errors and approximations typically present in the implementation. A detailed evaluation is thus presented of the inverse filtering design at hand in realistic conditions of implementation. Subsequently, a novel method for the off-line implementation of the inverse filtering is presented that utilises recursive filters of lower order. In this method, the responses of the inverse filters are decomposed into two parts, one realisable in forward time and one in backward time. The effectiveness of this new method for the implementation of the inverse is tested and compared with a small selection of the objective evaluation results described above. Finally, an algorithm for the on-line implementation of the forward-backward inverse filtering is proposed and its computational cost is compared with the currently available frequency-domain block-processing filtering algorithms.
