40|$|Abstract. Beta- 21 <b>S</b> {{titanium}} <b>alloy</b> {{is ranked}} {{among the most important}} advanced materials for a variety of technological applications, due to its combination of a high strength/weight ratio, good corrosion behavior and oxidation resistance. However, in many of these technological applications, this alloy is exposed to environments which can act as sources of hydrogen, and consequently, severe problems may arise. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the influence of high fugacity hydrogen on Beta- 21 <b>S</b> <b>alloy</b> in as-received (mill-annealed and hot-rolled) condition. Hydrogen effects on the microstructure are studied using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, while the absorption and desorption characteristics are determined respectively by means of a hydrogen determinator and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Preliminary results at room temperature revealed hydrogen-induced straining and expansion of the lattice parameters. However, neither second phases formation (hydrides), nor hydrogen-induced cracking, were observed after hydrogenation. The main characteristics of hydrogen absorption/desorption behavior, as well as hydrogen-induced microstructural changes in both microstructures are discussed in detail...|$|R

The ash concentration in chars ranged between 9. 04 to 12. 61 wt %, with alumina and silica as predominant ash components. The contact angles of these chars with liquid Fe- 2 % C- 0. 01 % <b>S</b> <b>alloy</b> showed lesser variations with time as compared to corresponding angles with electrolytic iron. While the initial contact angles ranged between 106 ° and 137 °, the contact angles for all coal-chars were quite similar after 60 minutes of contact (105 - 110 °). While no well defined correlations could be observed between the initial char structure (Lc values) and ash concentration / composition and contact angles {{in the initial stages}} of contact, the contact angles over extended periods were significantly affected by the presence of reaction products and impurity deposits in the interfacial region. With coal-chars generally showing a non-wetting behavior with liquid iron, these results are discussed in terms of the transfer of carbon and sulphur by mass transport across the interface, the formation of an enriched interfacial layer containing calcium, sulphur and alumina, reduction of reducible oxides such as silica and iron oxides, and possible transfer of these elements into the liquid iron...|$|R

The study is accomplished using the full-potential (FP) linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbital (LAPW+lo) self-consistent scheme of calculations. To incorporate the exchange correlation component in the total energy calculations of the crystal, Perdew-Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U are employed. Basically, for both alloys, to address their structural properties, we calculated their equilibrium lattice constants, bulk moduli as well as pressure derivatives. In general, from {{the analysis of the}} obtained electronic band structure of these alloys, the half-metallic nature of Zn 0. 75 V 0. 25 S and nearly half-metallic nature of the Cd 0. 75 V 0. 25 <b>S</b> <b>alloy</b> are demonstrated. The plotted density of states (DOS) curves project spin-exchange splitting energy x(d) and x(pd) as generated by V- 3 d states.

In order to describe the magnetic behavior of these alloys, the exchange constants N 0 α (valence band) and N 0 β (conduction band) as well as the magnetic moment values are estimated. The calculated results of the magnetic moment show that the main source in the reduction of the local magnetic moment of V in the alloys in comparison with its free value is a p-d orbital hybridization and partial transfer to nonmagnetic sites of (Zn, S) and (Cd, S) in Zn 0. 75 V 0. 25 S and Cd 0. 75 V 0. 25 <b>S</b> <b>alloys.</b> In addition, a study concerning optical properties, such as the refractive index, reflectivity and absorption coefficients is performed to determine their potential for optical and optoelectronic devices...|$|R
