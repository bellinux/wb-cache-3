5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of immigrants from Romania, followed by a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of walkers, who use a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of footpaths. The <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general {{framework for the}} formulation of generic uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, we introduce a basic generic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> that contains recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> by Andrews [2] and Hoadley [7 J as special cases. We also develop a truncation approach. {{that makes it possible}} to obtain uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the functions under consideration from uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for truncated versions of those functions. The point of the truncation approach is that uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the truncated versions are typically easier to obtain. By combining the basic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and the truncation approach we also derive generalizations of recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> introduced in Potscher and Prucha [13, l 5]. ...|$|R

5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the issue}} of the law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for fuzzy {{variables}} is considered. Since in credibility theory convergence in credibility implies convergence almost sure, the strong law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> is defined via convergence in credibility, while the weak law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> is defined through convergence almost sure. Based on the convergence results about the unform integrability of fuzzy variables, a sufficient condition of the strong law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for a class of fuzzy variables with unbounded supports is established...|$|R
