In August, Eisenhower nominated Smith as his successor as commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater, as ETOUSA was redesignated on 1 July 1945. Smith was passed over in favor of General Joseph McNarney. When Eisenhower took over as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, he summoned Smith to become his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Planning. However, soon after his arrival back in Washington he was asked by President Harry S. Truman and U.S Secretary of State James F. Byrnes to become the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

25|$|Although Military Road did not close, Congress passed {{legislation}} allowing {{traffic on the}} highway to be stopped. On January 31, 1936, Representative John D. Dingell, Sr. warned Washington-Hoover Airport that Military Road posed a serious flying hazard. On February 14, airport officials (faced with legal action from Arlington County for obstructing traffic), stopped attempting to close the road using traffic guards, chains, or lights, leading the Department of Commerce to announce it would close the airport if traffic were not stopped. Two days later, the United States Post Office Department declared it would suspend airmail operations at Washington-Hoover unless the road were closed, leading both houses of Congress to introduce legislation demanding closure and realignment of the road. A fight {{broke out in the}} United States Senate over payment for the road: Some Senators wanted Washington-Hoover's owners to pay $50,000 in exchange for a quitclaim deed from the War Department. The airport refused, calling this blackmail. Eventually, after several failed compromises, Congress passed and Roosevelt signed federal <b>legislation</b> <b>permitting</b> traffic to be temporarily stopped whenever planes took off or landed, and paying for guards to do the traffic stops.|$|E

It was also in 1912 that the Hudson's Bay Company put its Edmonton land holdings on the market, the first bridge across the North Saskatchewan River in the city's east end opened, and that Armstrong commissioned a master plan for the newly amalgamated city, from an American firm based out of Minneapolis named Morell and Nichols. Among the suggestions in the report was the recommendation for a civic square to be built, which was opened 53 years later as Sir Winston Churchill Square. In his final week as mayor, the retiring Armstrong delivered the city's annual report at an annual meeting, thanked the people of Edmonton for entrusting him as mayor, and advised his successor to be fiscally responsible; stating, [...] "If a reckless administration gets in next year, Edmonton will become a city like I was in recently, where they could not borrow enough money to clean their streets." [...] In the election held later that week, he would be succeeded by former mayor from 1901â€“04, William Short, whom he supported and campaigned for. Armstrong was later honoured with an informal gathering in the city council chamber where he was presented with a gift of silverware; with the city fire chief proclaiming that [...] "Mayor Armstrong is bound to become a historical character".|$|E
