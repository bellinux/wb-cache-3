40|$|Background: Distal {{osteotomy}} of {{the first}} metatarsal is indicated for the surgical treatment of mild-to-moderate hal-lux valgus deformity. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the results of a subcapital distal osteotomy {{of the first}} metatarsal with use of a percutaneous technique. Methods: From 1996 to 2001, 118 consecutive percutaneous distal osteotomies of the first metatarsal were per-formed for the treatment of painful mild-to-moderate hallux valgus in eighty-two patients. The patients were assessed with a clinical and radiographic protocol at a mean of 35. 9 months postoperatively. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux-metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale was used for the clinical assessment. Results: The patients were satisfied following 107 (91 %) of the 118 procedures. The mean score on the AOFAS scale was 88. 2 ± 12. 9 points. The postoperative radiographic assessments showed a significant change (p < 0. 05), compared with the preoperative values, in the mean hallux valgus angle, first intermetatarsal angle, distal metatarsal articular an-gle, and sesamoid position. The valgus deformity recurred after three procedures (2. 5 %), the first metatarsophalangeal joint was stiff but not painful after eight (6. 8 %), and a deep infection developed after one (0. 8 %). The infection resolved with antibiotic therapy. Conclusions: The percutaneous technique proved to be reliable for the correct execution of a distal <b>linear</b> <b>osteotomy</b> of the first metatarsal for the correction of a painful mild-to-moderate hallux valgus deformity. The clinical results ap...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{advantages}} of piezosurgery have been already proved. However, few investigations {{have focused on}} the dynamics of bone healing. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate, in adult rabbits, bone regeneration after cranial <b>linear</b> <b>osteotomies</b> with two piezoelectrical devices (Piezosurgery® Medical - PM and Piezosurgery® Plus - PP), comparing them with conventional rotary osteotomes (RO). PP was characterized by an output power three times higher than PM. Fifteen days after surgery, histomorphometric analyses showed that the osteotomy gap produced with PM and PP was about half the size of that produced by RO, and in a more advanced stage of recovery. Values of regenerated bone area with respect to the total osteotomy area were about double in PM and PP samples compared with RO ones, while the number of TRAP-positive (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive) osteoclasts per linear surface showed a significant increase, suggesting greater bone remodelling. Under scanning electron microscopy, regenerated bone displayed higher cell density and less mineralized matrix compared with pre-existent bone for all devices used. Nanoindentation tests showed no changes in elastic modulus. In conclusion, PM/PP osteotomies can be considered equivalent to each other, and result in more rapid healing compared with those using RO...|$|R
40|$|A split-calvaria osteoplastic {{rotational}} flap {{to repair}} the anterior fossa floor after tumor excision was devised and tested clinically. At surgery, the flap is outlined between the glabella and the vertex. After the pericranium between the glabella and the flap's anterior pole is elevated to form its pedicle, a full-thickness craniotomy is performed to expose the diploic aspect of the bone graft donor site (when the graft is relatively wide, bifrontal craniotomies may be advantageous). The diploic space is split in situ, taking care to protect the pedicle and its attachments to the osseous segment. <b>Linear</b> <b>osteotomies</b> in the outer table are created to mobilize the flap. With the flap rotated frontally, the craniotomy is completed. After tumor extirpation, {{the margins of the}} osseous segment of the flap are shaped to conform to the defect of the anterior fossa floor. Transverse osteotomies are performed so that the graft's convex curve conforms to that of the anterior fossa floor. The flap is then rotated into position. Follow-up evaluation in two patients at 22 and 30 months demonstrated bone integrity of the anterior fossa floor with graft preservation. Transient postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, which occurred in Case 1, was avoided in Case 2 by placing the osseous segment of the graft coplanar with the bone floor of the fossa. Neither patient had late meningitis or CSF rhinorrhea. The split-calvaria osteoplastic rotational flap may represent an advance toward the ideal reconstruction of the anterior cranial fossa floor...|$|R
30|$|The PLL was {{estimated}} by performing nonlinear FEA with the cortical bone {{as an ideal}} elastic–plastic material (Fig.  7). The osteotomy cut was opened until a horizontal tangent in the load–displacement diagram was reached i.e. an increasing deformation did no longer require increasing load; At this level the PLL was reached. The ELL is the load, which is achieved when the combined stress according to Eq. (8) at the reference point corresponds to the yield stress, which was determined in a <b>linear</b> FEA. The <b>osteotomy</b> cut is opened until the combined stress {{is equal to the}} yield stress.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Segmentation of vascularized bone flaps with piezoelectrical {{device is}} a {{valuable}} alternative to conventional cutting methods because it improves the intraoperative safety of the procedure. The time needed for completion of a single osteotomy with the piezoelectric device is longer than with the oscillating saw. However, the time normally needed to dissect and protect both the periosteum and the pedicle at each osteotomic site is greatly reduced. In 2015 a new piezoelectrical device suitable for highly mineralised bone and significantly efficient through all the cutting depth was engendered. Hardness and thickness of human fibula bone cortex may be fitting for this new piezoelectrical osteotome. AIM: We present and discuss the use {{a new generation of}} the piezoelectric bone-cutting device in microvascular free bone flap for the reconstruction of jawbone defects. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate on human fibula the time required for completion of each osteotomy comparing new piezoelectrical device and previous commercial device. A comprehensive study that evaluates and compares histomorphometry and histology of bone surfaces created with two piezosurgical devices is carried out. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In 2016 seven consecutive patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction of the jaws. One specimen from each fibular bone diaphysis was harvested with the piezoelectric device and histologically evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The new generation piezoelettrical device halves the time needed for <b>linear</b> and wedge <b>osteotomies</b> on human fibula flap compared to tradizional piezoelectrical device. No significant histological and histomorphometrical differences are detected between bone surfaces osteotomized with both devices...|$|R
