50|$|Chronic and {{repetitive}} scratching, picking, or rubbing of the nodules {{may result}} in permanent changes to the skin, including nodular <b>lichenification,</b> hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, and skin thickening. Unhealed, excoriated lesions are often scaly, crusted or scabbed. Many patients report a lack of wound healing even when medications relieve the itching and subsequent scratching.|$|E
50|$|EPP usually {{presents}} {{in childhood}} with the commonest mode of presentation as acute photosensitivity of the skin. It affects areas {{exposed to the}} sun and tends to be intractable. A few minutes {{of exposure to the}} sun induces pruritus, erythema, swelling and pain. Longer periods of exposure may induce second degree burns. After repetitive exposure, patients may present with <b>lichenification,</b> hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation and scarring of the skin.|$|E
50|$|AD {{commonly}} {{occurs on}} the eyelids where signs such as Dennie-Morgan infraorbital fold, infra-auricular fissure, periorbital pigmentation can be seen.

50|$|Fiddler’s neck usually {{involves}} highly localized <b>lichenification,</b> mild hyperpigmentation, and erythema where the chin rest or instrument body presses against {{the skin of}} the neck. Other signs and symptoms include scale buildup, cyst and scar formation, papules and pustules related to local infection, and focal edema. In Blum & Ritter’s study in West Germany (1990), they found that 27% of their population had only minor issues, 72% had a palpable mass at the site, and 23% reported pain and other signs of inflammation such as hyperthermia, pulsation, and cystic, pustular, or papular lesions. Size of masses were an average of 2 cm in diameter ranging up to 4 cm, some being associated with purulent drainage, continuous discharge, and crusting. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis has also been reported. Other serious sequelae include sialolithiasis of the submandibular gland and adenolymphoma of the parotid gland.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{symptoms}} of atopic dermatitis (AD), such as erythema, oedema/papulations and excoriations, respond quickly to topical corticosteroid treatment. Conversely, <b>lichenification</b> {{is regarded as}} a troublesome non-acute symptom of chronic AD which can take months of treatment before any improvement is seen. However, very little data actually support this opinion. Here, we analyse <b>lichenification</b> scores in 3 multicentre, short-term studies of nearly similar design. Two of these studies were active comparator dosage trials administered with either fluticasone propionate cream or ointment once or twice daily, the third study was a placebo control. In each of these 4 -weeks studies <b>lichenification</b> was measured weekly. For the evaluation of the <b>lichenification</b> score over time a random-coefficients regression model was used. In all active treatments <b>lichenification</b> significantly improved (p 80 % of patients scoring no, very mild or mild <b>lichenification</b> after 4 weeks. We developed a model in which the <b>lichenification</b> score drops off linearly with the square root of time. The resulting convexly-shaped downward time trend of <b>lichenification</b> was significant during all treatments. This effect was significantly stronger during active treatment than with placebo. Fluticasone propionate can improve moderate to severe <b>lichenification</b> in a relative short period of time...|$|E

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease with recurring episodes of itching and a chronic relapsing course. Keishibukuryogan (KBG) is a traditional herbal medicine, composed of five kinds of medical plants and has been administered to patients with blood stagnation in Japan. This study investigated the effect of KBG on the disease activity in AD (n = 45) patients. AD patients were administered KBG for 4 to 6 weeks {{in addition to their}} prescribed medications. The results showed that the SCORAD index and VAS score were significantly decreased after the administration of KBG (P < 0. 01). KBG also decreased the serum LDH level significantly (P < 0. 01). The global assessment of the clinical response in SCORAD index showed that 88. 5 % of the patients with moderate improvement to excellent response (n = 26) had a high <b>lichenification</b> score (<b>lichenification</b> score ≥ 2 in SCORAD). On the other hand, only 42. 1 % of the patients with no improvement to mild improvement (n = 19) had a high <b>lichenification</b> score. Furthermore, long-term administration of KBG for 9 – 67 weeks showed a marked improvement in patients with a high <b>lichenification</b> score. Therefore, KBG was found to be effective against AD, particularly in cases presenting with lichenified lesions. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of topical skin lipid complex (SLC) in canine atopic dermatitis (AD). Eight dogs with chronic AD and no improvement of main therapy in symptoms, erythema, <b>lichenification,</b> excoriation, and alopecia in the previous month were treated with SLC topically as adjunct therapy at lesion sites twice weekly for 12 weeks. A statistically significant reduction (26. 0 %, < 0. 05) in the third version of the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI- 03) modification from baseline was recorded 6 weeks after treatment, with marked reduction in the erythema subscore (36. 2 %, < 0. 005). A significant reduction in excoriation and alopecia subscores was observed 6 weeks after treatment (39. 9 %, < 0. 05 and 19. 9 %, < 0. 05, resp.). However, the <b>lichenification</b> subscore was not reduced significantly at 6 or 12 weeks. These findings suggest that topical SLC may have therapeutic and clinical benefits in dogs with AD...|$|E

40|$|Familial primary {{localized}} cutaneous amyloidosis (FPLCA) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder associated with chronic itching and skin <b>lichenification.</b> In lesional skin, there are apoptotic basal keratinocytes and deposits of amyloid material on degenerate keratin filaments {{in the upper}} dermis. The genetic basis of FPLCA involves mutations in the OSMR and IL 31 RA genes but the disease pathophysiology is not fully understood. In this study, we identified new pathogenic heterozygous missense mutations in the OSMR gene (p. Val 631 Leu and p. Asp 647 Tyr) in two Dutch FPLCA families. We then compared gene expression profiles between FPLCA lesional skin (n = 4) and site-matched control skin (n = 6). There was twofold or greater upregulation of 34 genes and downregulation of 43 genes. Most changes in gene expression (verified by quantitative RT-PCR) reflected alterations in epidermal differentiation and proliferation consistent with <b>lichenification,</b> but we also noted a reduction in several interfollicular keratinocyte stem cell markers in FPLCA skin. Differences in gene expression were also noted for proteins involved in apoptosis and nerve conduction. Collectively, this study expands the molecular basis of FPLCA and provides new insight into the skin pathology of this condition...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} with SCORAD {{system the}} contribution of the diagnostic hypoallergenic diet on the severity of atopic dermatitis and especially on the the intensity criteria and subjective parametersin patients over 14 years of age. Materials and Methods: The diagnostichypoallergenic diet was recommended for the period of 3 weeks. Severity of eczema was scored in agreement with SCORAD score, and especially the intensity criteria (erythema, edema, crusting, excoriations, lichenifications, dryness) and subjective parameters (pruritus, sleeplessness) were evaluated at the beginning {{and at the end of}} this diet. Results: One hundred and forty-eight patients suffering from atopic dermatitis were included in the study: 107 women and 41 men with the average age of 26. 03 (s. d. 9. 6 years), min. 14 max. 63 years. In the end of 3 weeks diagnostic hypoallergenic diet there was a statistically significant reduction in severity of sleepless and pruritus and in all of the intensity criteria except of <b>lichenification.</b> Conclusion: The diagnostic hypoallergenic diet can improve the intensity criteria and subjective parameters of atopic dermatitis evaluated in SCORAD, but not the <b>lichenification.</b> We recommend to introduce this diet before a challenge tests and as a temporary medical arrangement in patients suffering from moderate or severe form of atopic dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Hand eczema is {{a common}} {{distressing}} skin problem. It is an immune reaction to haptens. Thus, substances that inhibit Immune system can be effective {{in the treatment of}} hand eczema. In this study, topical fumaric acid 5 % cream is compared with topical steroid in the treatment of hand eczema. Patients with hand eczema were randomly divided into two groups. One group received fumaric acid 5 % in a cream base, and the other received triamcinolone 0. 1 % in the same cream base. Both groups used creams twice daily for one month. Patients were checked for erythema, excoriation, population and <b>lichenification,</b> EASI score, and pruritus before and after treatment. In both groups, the mean of all signs of the disease and EASI score decreased after one month of treatment. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two treatments in decreasing erythema, but excoriation, population, <b>lichenification,</b> EASI score and itching were all decreased more in triamcinolone 0. 1 % group. Although fumaric acid can inhibit the immune system; it was less effective for the treatment of all signs of hand eczema except erythema in comparison to triamcinolone. These results may be justified for two reasons: low penetration of topical fumaric acid through the skin or a low concentration used in this study...|$|E
