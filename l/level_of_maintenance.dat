2500|$|Despite {{design and}} {{assembly}} improvements, Fordsons still required a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance.</b> A farmer near Atlanta in 1921 listed {{the cost of}} his Fordson repairs for the year as $1,246. He recorded problems in his diary, noting difficulty starting the engine, a broken wheel, engine failure and the rear end bursting throughout January, totaling costs of $1,301 for 620 hours of work. A Colorado farmer telephoned his dealer {{three times a day}} to complain about his Fordson. The most dangerous feature would occur when a towed implement became immoveable: the stoppage of the implement would cause a reaction through the transmission that would flip the tractor over backwards, sometimes killing the driver. This condition was introduced when the worm drive was relocated below the main drive pinion, relieving the driver from the heat it generated but also causing a torque on the tractor that lightened the load on the front wheels. One Indiana farmer believed the Fordson to be so dangerous that it should have been banned by law. The Eastern Implement Dealer claimed that Fordsons killed 36 drivers in 1918. Pipp's Weekly further claimed that Fordsons had killed 136 men up to August 1922. Ford spokesmen maintained the accidents resulted from inexperienced drivers, saying any tractor could be dangerous if improperly handled. Satisfied customers praised the Fordson, saying it made farm work easier and performed ideally in orchards and truck farms. Judging from the Fordson's market share in the late teens and early 20s, the anecdotal horror stories, while extreme, must have been relative outliers (that is, the notion that [...] "all Fordsons flip over backwards and burst at the seams" [...] was an exaggeration). Nonetheless, it became imprinted in many minds and became a punch line. The [...] "Hoyt-Clagwell" [...] tractor on the 1960s TV sitcom Green Acres was a Fordson Model F. It was known to randomly 'explode' followed by {{one or both of the}} rear wheels falling off.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the determinants <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> spending and building conditions in Norwegian local governments. In the popular debate there is a concern that low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> spending leads to poor building conditions, {{and in the long}} run also to excessive costs because of fast deprecation of the buildings. We take advantage of three different data sources to assess the facility management: i) a comprehensive measure <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> spending that includes work conducted by local government employees, ii) survey data for general building conditions, and iii) survey data for school building conditions. The empirical analysis shows that these indicators of real estate management are affected by both economic and political factors. Low fiscal capacity, fiscal stress, and a high degree of party fragmentation are associated with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> and poor building conditions...|$|R
