5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort to address some of the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E
5|$|In November 1844, the {{anonymously}} published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, {{written by}} Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened {{public interest in}} the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped {{to pave the way for}} the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> in the fossil record. Inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom Hearts games contain {{elements}} of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. The games {{are driven by}} a <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> from one story event to the next, usually shown {{in the form of}} a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.|$|E

25|$|George Gaylord Simpson was {{responsible}} for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with paleontology in his 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution. Simpson's work was crucial because so many paleontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, {{with the idea that}} natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> (in for example the evolution of the horse) that earlier paleontologists had used as support for neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the fossil record was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.|$|E

25|$|In {{the main}} story mode, players {{assume the role}} of Ghat and {{progress}} through the world of Zenozoik, visiting various locations in a linear sequence. Gameplay is presented in first-person perspective, with occasional cutscenes in third-person perspective. When the player enters certain areas, it triggers a scripted sequence, initiating a battle in which the player must defeat all enemies to proceed. Ghat is proficient in martial arts, and can dodge or counter enemy attacks. While there is a strong focus on unarmed combat, Ghat can also obtain unconventional melee and ranged weapons by several means, such as disarming enemies. Intermittent segments of the game play similarly to a <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> shooter.|$|E
25|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for paleontologists. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear {{that the relationship between}} birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one <b>linear</b> <b>progression,</b> some scientists, most notably Gregory S. Paul, conclude that dinosaurs such as the dromaeosaurs may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers {{in a manner similar to}} the modern ostrich and other ratites.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Helen Singer Kaplan {{added the}} {{category}} of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness {{and the failure of}} communication can interfere with desire and orgasm. In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as <b>linear</b> <b>progression.</b> In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled {{by the rest of the}} orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggested that it is just one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.|$|E

These patterns are of three main varieties: first, strictly linear patterns; second, linear patterns with free surface variation; and third, patterns which develop linearly in two opposing directions, either simultaneously or in alternation. These patterns are applied to the musical parameters of phrase length, pitch, register, dynamics, density, and timbre (the piano timbre is gradually transformed through the use of live electronic processing). As these simple patterns combine, the surface texture becomes complex and unpredictable, yet the clarity of the individual <b>linear</b> <b>progressions</b> provides an underlying direction at all times...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, the American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, and the American entomologist Alpheus Packard. They considered Lamarckism to be more progressive and thus philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of natural selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. The idea of linear progress was an important part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Cope and Hyatt looked for, and thought they found, patterns of <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> in the fossil record. Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics. Packard also wrote a book about Lamarck and his writings.|$|E

500|$|The {{music was}} {{challenging}} due to drawing from multiple cultures, then being brought {{together into a}} cohesive score while keeping each region distinct from the other. To get the right feeling, the team did research into the historical musical instruments used {{in each of the}} game's regions. Rather than a <b>linear</b> <b>progression</b> of looping musical tracks, the norm for most games at the time, the score was broken up into stingers that were brought into the environment when needed. This cuing of themed musical pieces was coupled with a second system tied to environmental progression: musical pieces were arranged in the playlist, then could be cued in depending on the circumstances and environment on-screen. For vocal tracks, the lyrics were written in Ancient Greek: the main vocal piece, [...] "When Gods Fall", was infused into the other vocal tracks and acted as a [...] "cornerstone" [...] for the score. The vocals were provided by Taunia Soderquist.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{influenced}} by popular conspiracy theories, spy stories, and science fiction. The original writer for Deus Ex, Sheldon Pacotti, returned to write the game's script with newcomer Sarah Paetsch. A major difference from the first game was the player's freedom to change factions throughout the game, something not available in the first game. A core part of the experience was the branching narrative, giving the player multiple options of progress despite missions having a <b>linear</b> <b>progression.</b> Paetsch estimated that the game contained over 30,000 lines of voiced dialogue. The game's subtitle referred to the unseen battle that took place both around people and within them. The suggestion that all endings of Deus Ex {{should be part of}} the canon series of events was suggested by a staff member who worked on the original game's Hong Kong storyline. The locations were chosen for their distinct feel and—in some cases—iconic landmarks. They also chose locations associated at the time with the organizations featured in-game, such as Seattle and the WTO. The Antarctica setting {{was influenced by}} the John Carpenter's film The Thing. Rather than use JC as the main protagonist due to his actions in Deus Ex making him a grand figure in world history, the team created newcomer Alex, someone who would share JC's roots and begin [...] "at the bottom of the pyramid". One of the themes included in the game was the nature of terrorism, and how people could be classified as terrorists or freedom fighters depending on circumstance.|$|E

IGN's Jay Boor insisted the game's graphics were [...] "light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point. Computer and Video Gamess Alex C praised the dramatic story and well-developed characters.
