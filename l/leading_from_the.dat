5|$|After {{scores of}} 6 and 12 in the Fourth Test, {{he missed the}} final Test due to injury, ending an {{unproductive}} Test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23.25. The series was noted for Morris' difficulties against the spin duo of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin, who bowled left-arm orthodox and leg spin respectively. The pair was responsible for five of his eight dismissals on the tour. Morris did not play a match after the new year and ended the season with 698 runs at 53.69. He topped his state's Shield batting averages, <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front as New South Wales regained the title.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front. He {{was at the}} forefront of providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass.

He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E

5|$|NY474 {{begins at}} the Pennsylvania state line {{in the town of}} French Creek as a {{continuation}} of PA474, which in turn begins a short distance west of the state line in Wattsburg, Pennsylvania. NY474 heads east through rural southwest Chautauqua County, briefly paralleling French Creek to the hamlet of Marvin before intersecting and briefly overlapping with NY426 through the small hamlet of Cutting. NY474 exits Cutting and continues on an easterly track into the town of Clymer and the hamlet of the same name, where it meets County Route15 (CR15), a local road <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania state line (where the road continues south to Corry) north to Sherman {{in the center of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front {{and his ability to}} inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was located in an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outer courtyard to the inner rooms of the keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is perhaps because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E

5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways around the top. A stone gatehouse was built {{on the west side of}} the wall, <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|After 1805, the {{exploits}} of 40,000French, Russian, and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination. General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor, the gate <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish lithographer created {{an image of the}} battle, which was later expanded by English lithographer John Outhwaite. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla (see Infobox image) on a moonlit night. In fact, the moon was in its last quarter phase 48hours later, and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image.|$|E
5|$|After Bradford City won the Division Two {{championship}} in 1907–08, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme {{of the ground}} {{to prepare for the}} club's first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock—a standing area in front of the 5,300-seater main stand which was built in 1908—and build a Spion Kop at {{the north side of the}} ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rooms underneath the Kop along the main stand side of the ground. The total project cost £9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the 1908–09 season. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000fans saw City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club's FA Cup winning run. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain unclear, no {{attempt was made}} to spike other allied guns while they were in French possession. In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack. After {{numerous}} costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent. Their casualties cannot easily be estimated. Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses. Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed – testament to their courage and their habit of <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front. Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the Grenadiers à Cheval numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period. Overall Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47% of its strength.|$|E
5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E
