25|$|The {{president}} of the Real Audiencia authorized that classes should start while they were awaiting the authorization to build the new school for the students; {{at the time they}} only had one classroom in the Dominican convent where, in theory, they gave the Arts, Theology and Religion classes. After several decades, discussions and petitions, king Carlos II on 31 January 1676, granted a license to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala to found a University. This would be third royal university in the Spanish Empire in America, and the second in New Spain, after the one in Mexico. After the disputatious process of organization, and five years after the royal decree, the university started officially its lectures of five of the nine classes, on 7 January 1681, with <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> sixty registered students and with its first president, Dr. José de Baños y Soto Mayor, {{who was in charge of}} the Cathedral, Preacher of the King of Spain and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university started under the protection of San Carlos Borromeo, with its first directive written by Francisco Saraza y Arce, who copied from those of the University of México which, in turn, were adapted from the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.|$|E

The movement was probably already a pastorale in the secular model, and suits the image of the Good Shepherd and his flock. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, believes that the music was actually danced to in the secular version heard in Köthen.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces." [...] One reviewer from The New York Times criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as [...] "bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty." ...|$|E

She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E

500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just means we have a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a challenge of making jokes that {{are a little more}} evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} the operation, Pine Coffin and his staff began {{to plan for the}} mission. The twentynine Dakotas that were to {{transport}} the battalion would take off from Maison Blanche and follow the coast until they reached the harbour at Bône. The leading Dakota would then turn southeast and fly low over the airfield to ascertain its status. If it was unoccupied the paratroopers would be dropped onto the airfield, but if the Fallschirmjaeger were present then the Dakotas would drop the companies a mile away; there they would form up and launch an attack on the airfield. The planning was completed by 16:30, and at 20:00 the American pilots were briefed on the operation, which was briefly interrupted when a German aircraft flew over the area and dropped a stick of bombs. The aircraft took off at 08:30 the next day and experienced an uneventful flight to the airfield, although two aircraft experienced mechanical problems and ditched into the ocean, causing three casualties. The lead Dakota flew over the airfield, and after observing the airfield to be unoccupied, dropped its paratroopers, followed in succession by the remaining transport aircraft. The drop was reasonably accurate, with a few containers and paratroopers being dropped three miles from the airfield. Thirteen men were injured during the drop, primarily when they landed, and one was killed when he accidentally shot himself with his Sten gun. One officer was knocked unconscious during landing and remained so for the next four days, on occasion being heard to murmur [...] "I'll have a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the turbot, waiter!". Unknown to the British force, their drop had been observed by a flight of German Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, carrying the battalion of Fallschirmjaegers; having seen that the airfield was already occupied, the aircraft turned back towards Tunis. When it had secured the airfield, the battalion came under attack from Stuka divebombers, and was initially defenceless. However, once No.6 Commando had secured Bône a number of Oerlikon antiaircraft guns were salvaged from sunken vessels in the port's harbour and these, in combination with a squadron of Spitfires that arrived on the evening of 11 November, were used to fend off future attacks. [...] The battalion held the airfield in conjunction with No.6 Commando until 15 November, when it withdrew and linked up with 'A' Company and the rest of 1st Parachute Brigade at Maison Blanche.|$|E

2500|$|... "Elia" [...] was {{the best-known}} pen name of Charles Lamb (1775–1834), an English essayist, critic, antiquarian, and poet. Having been close friends with Lamb {{for almost two}} decades, Hazlitt had written warmly of his {{frequent}} attendance at Charles and Mary Lamb's [...] "at home" [...] gatherings, he and Charles had had endless literary discussions and had sometimes written on the same topics, and Hazlitt had dedicated his book Characters of Shakespear's Plays to Lamb, all of which provided Hazlitt with a wealth of personal impressions to draw upon. Thus, to a far greater extent than with Irving—of whom he notes <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a personal nature than that he was [...] "agreeable"—Hazlitt to a considerable degree interweaves personal elements into his account of Lamb.|$|E

[...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out at least a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what we are all about." ...|$|E
