5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each <b>light</b> <b>path.</b> This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E
5|$|Katarn {{retrieves}} the Valley's {{location and}} travels with Rebel Alliance agent and close friend Jan Ors to Ruusan, the planet {{on which the}} Valley is located. Jerec captures Ors and offers Katarn the choice to execute her or die. The decision Katarn makes here depends on the player's actions within the game up to this point. If Katarn has remained true to the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> he spares Ors, but if he has fallen {{to the dark side}} he kills her. With both paths, Katarn has a final confrontation with Jerec in the Valley of the Jedi's core. If the player chose the light side, the game concludes with Katarn being reunited with Ors and carving a monument to Rahn and his dead father; if the player chose the dark path, the game ends with Katarn becoming the new Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) {{system was}} {{designed}} to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> with one ground to correct the aberration. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, {{one of the other}} instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics. COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.|$|E
40|$|Setting up {{high-speed}} network connections - <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> - {{is still a}} manual effort taking two to three weeks. The network engineers need {{a clear picture of}} the network topology in order to plan and configure <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> The Network Markup Language (NML) standardizes network topology and state information. The University of Amsterdam and SARA Computing & Networking Services in the Netherlands are contributing to this effort, with the ultimate goal being to automatically set up and manage <b>light</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R

25|$|In particular, some {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to reduce these losses. The reflection losses, which can account for up to 10% of the total incident energy, can be dramatically decreased using a technique called texturization, a light trapping method that modifies the average <b>light</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the <b>light</b> <b>path,</b> separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|E
25|$|In a {{homogeneous}} specimen, {{there is no}} difference between the two beams, and no contrast is being generated. However, near a refractive boundary (say a nucleus within the cytoplasm), the difference between the ordinary and the extraordinary beam will generate a relief in the image. Differential interference contrast requires a polarized light source to function; two polarizing filters have to be fitted in the <b>light</b> <b>path,</b> one below the condenser (the polarizer), and the other above the objective (the analyzer).|$|E

30|$|As {{opposed to}} {{conventional}} VR methods, CR solves the multi-dimensional and non-continuous rendering equation [24] {{to integrate the}} light scattered from all possible directions along a ray. Thus, path tracing used in CT integrates {{a huge number of}} light rays, each with different paths to form each pixel of the rendered image. Since the number of <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> which can be traced is in theory infinite, and tracing of <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> is computationally expensive, Monte-Carlo simulations are used to generate a randomized subset of <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> with an adequate distribution. The final image is obtained iteratively by progressively averaging numerous Monte Carlo samples representing radiance at random positions with light scattered in random directions.|$|R
25|$|Ray {{transfer}} matrix analysis (also known as ABCD matrix analysis) {{is a type}} of ray tracing technique used in the design of some optical systems, particularly lasers. It involves the construction of a ray {{transfer matrix}} which describes the optical system; tracing of a <b>light</b> <b>path</b> through the system can then be performed by multiplying this matrix with a vector representing the light ray. The same analysis is also used in accelerator physics to track particles through the magnet installations of a particle accelerator, see Beam optics.|$|E
25|$|Michelson sought another measurement, {{but this}} time in an {{evacuated}} tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects. In 1930, he began a collaboration with Francis G. Pease and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California. In multiple reflections the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> was increased to 10 miles. For {{the first time in}} history the speed of light was measured in an almost perfect vacuum of 0.5mm of mercury. Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774Â±11km/s, consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values, was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Glare-free {{high beam}} is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} high beam pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{networks}} are fast and reliable networks that enable, amongst others, dedicated <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> {{to be established}} for elephant IP flows. Elephant IP flows are characterized by being small in number, but long in time and high in traffic volume. Moving these flows from the general IP network to dedicated <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> can be beneficial for both the elephant flows {{as well as the}} general IP network. Elephant flows over <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> would benefit from receiving better Quality of Service (at the optical level there is no jitter and far more bandwidth) and, at the same time, IP networks would be off-loaded and therefore offer better Quality of Service to the remaining, smaller IP flows. Identifying elephant flows in large scale IP networks is therefore an important task in order to effectively manage the network. In practice such flows are generally characterized using 5 -tuple flow definition (source/destination address/port and protocol), which may be too restrictive for the purpose of establishing optical <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> In this paper we evaluate different flow definitions at different levels of granularity. Using measurements at a large national research network, we compare our alternative flow definitions to the traditional 5 -tuple definition. We show that the discovery of elephant flows eligible to be transferred over <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> can better be reached using less restrictive flow definitions...|$|R

In the paper, {{based on the}} CCD angle measurement technology, the self-collimation optical sys-tem is redesigned, focal length of the optical system is calculated, and the appropriate parameters are chosen. Optical con-jugate design of the three <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> of <b>light</b> source module, visual module, and CCD receiving module is adopted to syn-chronize the transmission beams of the three <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> The simulation and optimum design of <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> in the optical system are achieved by using the ZEMAX software.

25|$|Optical {{cavities}} {{can also}} be used as multipass optical delay lines, folding a light beam so that a long path-length may be achieved in a small space. A plane-parallel cavity with flat mirrors produces a flat zigzag <b>light</b> <b>path,</b> but as discussed above, these designs are very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and walk-off. When curved mirrors are used in a nearly confocal configuration, the beam travels on a circular zigzag path. The latter is called a Herriott-type delay line. A fixed insertion mirror is placed off-axis near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup mirror is similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup mirror is used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type delay line.|$|E
500|$|The {{sample holder}} {{held up to}} 4 cells. Cells could be moved into the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> via an {{external}} control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment. As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a blank, or standard, [...] "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent." [...] The standard could be a cell filled with a solvent such as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration. At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, transmittance, to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to absorbance which {{is proportional to the}} solute concentration according to Beer's law. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.|$|E

6000|$|Still as a {{mountain}} with dark pines and sun He stood between the armies, and his shout Rolled from the empyrean above the host: [...] "Bid any little flea ye have come forth, And wince at death upon my finger-nail!"

The meagre pupil of his shameless eye Moved like a cormorant over a glassy sea. He stretched his limbs, and laughed into the air, To feel the groaning sinews of his breast, And the long gush of his swollen arteries pause: And, nodding, wheeled, towering in all his height. Then, like a wind that hushes, gazed and saw Down, down, far down upon the untroubled green A shepherd-boy that swung a little sling. Goliath shut his lids to drive that mote, Which vexed the eastern azure of his eye, Out of his vision; and stared down again. Yet stood the youth there, ruddy in the flare Of his vast shield, nor spake, nor quailed, gazed up, As one might scan {{a mountain}} to be scaled. Then, as it were, a voice unearthly still Cried in the cavern of his bristling ear, [...] "His name is Death!" ... And, like the flush That dyes Sahara to its lifeless verge, His brows' bright brass flamed into sudden crimson; And his great spear leapt upward, lightning-like, Shaking a dreadful thunder in the air; Spun betwixt earth and sky, bright as a berg That hoards the sunlight in a myriad spires, Crashed: and struck echo through an army's heart. Then paused Goliath, and stared down again. And fleet-foot Fear from rolling orbs perceived Steadfast, unharmed, a stooping shepherd-boy Frowning upon the target of his face. And wrath tossed suddenly up once more his hand; And a deep groan grieved all his strength in him. He breathed; and, lost in dazzling darkness, prayed-- Besought his reins, his gloating gods, his youth: And turned to smite what he no more could see. Then sped the singing pebble-messenger, The chosen of the Lord from Israel's brooks, Fleet to its mark, and hollowed a <b>light</b> <b>path</b> Down to the appalling Babel of his brain.

40|$|Introduction: The elderly {{population}} is {{at high risk}} of functional decline, which will induce significant costs due to long-term care. Dependency could be delayed by preventing one of its major determinants: falls. <b>Light</b> <b>paths</b> coupled with personal emergency response systems could prevent the functional decline through fall prevention. Methods: This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> coupled with personal emergency response systems on the functional decline in an {{elderly population}} living at home. It is a secondary analysis on data from a previous cohort. In all, 190 older adults (aged 65 [*]years or more) living at home participated. Participants in the exposed group were equipped with home-based technologies: <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> coupled with personal emergency response systems. The participantsâ functional status was assessed using the Functional Autonomy Measurement System scale at baseline (T 0) and at the end of the study (T 12 -month). Baseline characteristics were evaluated by a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Results: After 1 [*]year, 43 % of the unexposed group had functional decline versus 16 % of the exposed group. <b>Light</b> <b>paths</b> coupled with personal emergency response systems were significantly associated with a decrease in the functional decline (Î Functional Autonomy Measurement System[*]â©¾[*] 5) at home (odds ratio[*]=[*] 0. 24, 95 % confidence interval (0. 11 â 0. 54), p[*]=[*] 0. 002). Discussion: This study suggests that <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> coupled with personal emergency response systems prevent the functional decline over 12 [*]months. This result may encourage the prescription and use of home-based technologies to postpone dependency and institutionalization, but they need a larger cost-effectiveness study to demonstrate the efficiency of these technologies...|$|R
