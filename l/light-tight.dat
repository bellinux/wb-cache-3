25|$|Scintillation {{detectors}} use crystals that emit {{light when}} gamma rays {{interact with the}} atoms in the crystals. The intensity of the light produced is usually proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal by the gamma ray; a well known situation where this relationship fails is the absorption of <200keV radiation by intrinsic and doped sodium iodide detectors. The mechanism {{is similar to that}} of a thermoluminescent dosimeter. The detectors are joined to photomultipliers; a photocathode converts the light into electrons; and then by using dynodes to generate electron cascades through delta ray production, the signal is amplified. Common scintillators include thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl))—often simplified to sodium iodide (NaI) detectors—and bismuth germanate (BGO). Because photomultipliers are also sensitive to ambient light, scintillators are encased in <b>light-tight</b> coverings.|$|E
25|$|In film-screen radiography, an X-ray tube {{generates a}} beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are {{filtered}} through a device called an grid or X-ray filter, to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a <b>light-tight</b> cassette. The film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film. Film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography (DR) and the EOS imaging. In the two latest systems, the X-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information, which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen. In digital radiography the sensors shape a plate, but in the EOS system, which is a slot-scanning system, a linear sensor vertically scans the patient.|$|E
2500|$|Perfumes {{are best}} {{preserved}} when kept in <b>light-tight</b> aluminium bottles {{or in their}} original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between 3–7°C (37–45°F). Although {{it is difficult to}} completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and [...] "open" [...] bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.|$|E
50|$|A film can is the <b>light-tight</b> {{container}} used {{to enclose}} film stock. They are typically a circular box pressed from thin sheet metal, but plastic examples are also used. Film cans {{are used to}} hold unexposed film, exposed film ready for developing and also for the distribution of completed film prints. The last of these {{does not require the}} can to be <b>light-tight,</b> but environmental protection and exclusion of dust makes a similar container just as useful.|$|E
50|$|The {{image is}} focused by {{changing}} {{the distance between the}} lens and the film, achieved by adjusting the length of a <b>light-tight</b> bellows with a geared rack and pinion mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The {{plate was}} then {{carried to the}} camera in a <b>light-tight</b> plate holder. Withdrawing a {{protective}} dark slide or opening a pair of doors in the holder exposed the sensitized surface within the dark camera and removing a cap from the camera lens began the exposure, creating an invisible latent image on the plate. Depending on the sensitization chemistry used, {{the brightness of the}} lighting, and the light-concentrating power of the lens, the required exposure time ranged from a few seconds to many minutes. After the exposure was judged to be complete, the lens was capped and the holder was again made <b>light-tight</b> and removed from the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The loader {{transfers}} {{motion picture}} film from the manufacturer's <b>light-tight</b> canisters {{to the camera}} magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places {{it back into the}} <b>light-tight</b> cans for transport to the laboratory. It {{is the responsibility of the}} loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.|$|E
50|$|Dating in the Dark (Daten in het Donker) is {{a reality}} show created in the Netherlands where 3 single men and 3 single women move into a <b>light-tight</b> house {{getting to know each}} other and form bonds in total darkness.|$|E
50|$|In the {{photographic}} industry, flocking is one method {{used to reduce}} the reflectivity of surfaces, including the insides of some bellows and lens hoods. It {{is also used to}} produce <b>light-tight</b> passages for film such as in 135 film cartridges.|$|E
50|$|Pinhole cameras can be {{handmade}} by {{the photographer}} {{for a particular}} purpose. In its simplest form, the photographic pinhole camera can consist of a <b>light-tight</b> box with a pinhole in one end, {{and a piece of}} film or photographic paper wedged or taped into the other end.A flap of cardboard with a tape hinge {{can be used as a}} shutter.The pinhole may be punched or drilled using a sewing needle or small diameter bit through a piece of tinfoil or thin aluminum or brass sheet.This piece is then taped to the inside of the <b>light-tight</b> box behind a hole cut through the box. A cylindrical oatmeal container may be made into a pinhole camera.|$|E
50|$|The {{enlargement}} is made {{by first}} focusing the image with the lamp on, the lens at maximum aperture and the easel empty, usually {{with the aid of}} a focus finder. The lamp is turned off, or in some cases, shuttered by a <b>light-tight</b> mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Compact {{digital cameras}} are fitted with fixed lenses, {{which makes it}} harder for dust to get into the image area. Similar film cameras are often only <b>light-tight</b> and not {{environmentally}} sealed. Some modern DSLRs, like the Olympus E-3, incorporate extensive dust and weather seals to avoid this problem.|$|E
5000|$|The stage has a {{width of}} 40 m, and 4 m understage. Also renovated was the {{cantilevered}} grandstand with the underlying scene dock. A <b>light-tight,</b> rain tarp to dampen {{the noise and}} protect the stage was also added. This roof can be opened. The theater holds 1412 seats and 25 standing places.|$|E
50|$|Part B is a {{saturated}} solution of dichromate salt. Use {{only one of}} the three kinds of dichromate crystals. Mix the dichromate crystals with the 80mL of warm water until dissolved. Then add enough distilled water to make 100mL of solution. Store finished solution in a <b>light-tight</b> bottle. Keep away from food, children, pets, etc.|$|E
50|$|On a ship, the {{function}} of a porthole, when open, is to permit light and fresh air to enter the dark and often damp below-deck quarters of the vessel. It also affords below-deck occupants a limited, but often much needed view to the outside world. When closed, the porthole provides a strong water-tight, weather-tight and sometimes <b>light-tight</b> barrier.|$|E
50|$|The enlarger's lamp or shutter {{mechanism}} is controlled either by an electronic timer, {{or by the}} operator - who marks time with a clock, metronome or simply by counting seconds - shuttering or turning off the lamp when the exposure is complete. The exposed paper can be processed immediately or placed in a <b>light-tight</b> container for later processing.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} there were {{problems}} with the plants that were under the <b>light-tight</b> dome. In October 2005, the southern front along the [...] "South Sea" [...] bathing area had a special UV-transparent film made of ETFE installed. This 20,000 square metre [...] "window" [...] allows daylight. The palms, trees and bushes have grown well since.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "bellows" [...] {{is used by}} {{extension}} for a flexible bag whose volume can be changed by compression or expansion, but not used to deliver air. For example, the <b>light-tight</b> (but not airtight) bag allowing {{the distance between the}} lens and film of a folding photographic camera to be varied is called a bellows.|$|E
50|$|A camera {{magazine}} is a <b>light-tight</b> chamber or pair of chambers {{designed to hold}} film and move motion picture film stock before and {{after it has been}} exposed in the camera. In most movie cameras, the {{magazine is}} a removable piece of equipment.Many still photo cameras also have removable camera magazines. A film cartridge serves the same function, but is usually not reusable.|$|E
50|$|The camera {{magazine}} {{tends to}} be held mostly in the charge of the clapper loader on set, {{who is in charge}} of loading and unloading the magazine, labelling it properly, securing it as <b>light-tight,</b> and delivering and receiving magazines from the focus puller, who attaches and detaches them from the camera and handles the threading of the film in the camera (certain magazines require no camera threading).|$|E
50|$|A film {{cassette}} {{is similar to}} a film can in that it is a <b>light-tight</b> enclosure containing a spool of film. However a cassette also has a light trap, usually a set of lips covered with velvet, that allow film through without allowing light into the can. This allows a cassette to be loaded into a camera in daylight, then the camera back closed and light-sealed before use.|$|E
50|$|The chamber {{itself is}} a round {{building}} built of stone, wood, and turf with a single door to admit the viewer. It is <b>light-tight</b> when its door is closed, except for one small, round opening in its roof which allows the building {{to act as a}} camera obscura. Images of the sun, clouds, and trees are projected onto the smooth white walls of the interior of the chamber.|$|E
50|$|The Modular Neutron Array {{consists}} of 144 individual detector modules. Each module {{is based on}} a plastic scintillator measuring 10 cm by 10 cm by 200 cm. This scintillator bar is fitted with light guides on each end that direct the light into one photo-multiplier tube on each end. Each detector module is wrapped in a <b>light-tight</b> material, allowing the detector array to be arranged in different configurations.|$|E
5000|$|A lensboard—a flat board, {{typically}} {{square in}} shape and made of metal or wood, that locks securely into the front standard of a particular view camera, with a central hole of the right size to insert a lens and shutter assembly, usually secured and made <b>light-tight</b> by screwing a ring onto a thread on {{the rear of the}} lens assembly. Lensboards, complete with lenses, can be removed and fitted quickly.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of camera}} was first {{developed}} {{in the era of}} the daguerreotype (1840s-1850s) and still in use today, though with many refinements. It comprises a flexible bellows that forms a <b>light-tight</b> seal between two adjustable standards, one of which holds a lens, and the other a viewfinder or a photographic film holder. There are three general types, the monorail camera, the field camera, and press or technical cameras.|$|E
5000|$|After selling Dr. August Nagel - Fabrik fuer Feinmechanik Werk in Stuttgart-Wangen to Kodak AG in December 1931, the new {{firm was}} {{designated}} [...] "Kodak AG - Dr. Nagel Werk". Nagel continued to innovate including developing the Retina folding cameras around the new Kodak 135 preloaded 35mm cartridge. Prior to this, most 35mm film was loaded {{by the user}} into proprietary cartridges in a darkroom or <b>light-tight</b> bag.|$|E
50|$|Monorail {{cameras are}} among the {{simplest}} cameras possible according to their operating principles, consisting of the front standard (holding the lens) and rear standard (holding the ground glass viewing and focussing screen, then replaced by the film) sliding on a single rail, with a <b>light-tight</b> bellows stretched between. They are built to a high standard of precision and smoothness of operation, and sell in low volume, which makes prices higher than most smaller cameras.|$|E
5000|$|A folding {{camera is}} a camera type. Folding cameras fold into a compact and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are {{attached}} to a lens-board which {{is connected to the}} body of the camera by a <b>light-tight</b> folding bellows. When the camera is fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of folding cameras is their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the camera is folded for storage.|$|E
5000|$|A light leak is a hole or gap in {{the body}} of a camera, or other optical instrument, where light is able to [...] "leak" [...] into the {{normally}} <b>light-tight</b> chamber, exposing the film or sensor with extra light. This light is diffuse, although parts within the camera may cast shadows or reflect it in a particular way. For most purposes this is considered a problem. Within the lomography movement it is seen as a positive effect, giving photos character.|$|E
50|$|Magazines are {{designed}} to be <b>light-tight</b> in and of themselves. However, usually this is buffered by additional precautions made to maintain light-tightness, against both fault of equipment and humans. The latches used to open the magazine usually lock when closed and require non-casual fiddling to trip their locks. They are then furthermore protected by being taped up when loaded. Sometimes the entire edge of the magazine door is taped as an extra measure of light-tightness, although for newer properly maintained magazines this is not strictly necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{paper stock}} {{is usually a}} {{continuous}} roll which cut after developing according to the size requirements of the customer. Different image widths are handled using different roll widths, and each width is usually done as a batch process of images all the same size. The light-sensitive paper stock can be contained within <b>light-tight</b> packaging so that the minilab operator only needs to remove the old empty paper container and insert a full one, without needing to darken the room to prevent paper exposure.|$|E
5000|$|Individual {{rolls of}} 135 film are {{enclosed}} in single-spool, <b>light-tight,</b> metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight. The film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a slot lined with flocking. The {{end of the}} film is cut on one side to form a leader. It has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie print film (also called [...] "long pitch", KS-1870, whereas 35mm professional motion picture camera films are always [...] "short pitch", BH-1866).|$|E
50|$|A {{developing}} tank is a <b>light-tight</b> container used for developing film. A {{developing tank}} allows photographic film {{to be developed}} in a daylight environment. This is necessary because most film is panchromatic and therefore can not be exposed to any light during processing. Depending upon the size and type, a developing tank can hold one to many roll or sheet films.Famous brands include Paterson, Jobo and Nikor.A film reel holds roll films in a spiral shape. The film is held evenly spaced so that the chemicals in the developing tank reach all of the film.|$|E
50|$|Six {{photographer}} artists, Jerry Burchfield, Mark Chamberlain, Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, Douglas McCulloh, and Clayton Spada plus approximately 400 assistants {{built the}} world's largest pinhole camera in building #115 at El Toro using 24000 sq ft six mil black visqueen, 1300 gal L of foam gap filler, 1.5 mi of 2 in wide black Gorilla Tape and 40 gal of black spray paint {{to make the}} hangar <b>light-tight.</b> The camera measured 160 ft (48.76 m) wide x 45 ft (13.71 m) high x 80 ft (24.38 m) deep.|$|E
5000|$|HAWC {{consists}} of large metal tanks, 7.3 m wide by 5 m high, containing a <b>light-tight</b> bladder holding 188,000 liters of water. Inside are four photomultiplier tubes (3-8" [...] and 1-10" [...] high QE). High-energy particles striking the water result in Cherenkov light that is detected by the photomultiplier tubes. HAWC uses {{the difference in}} arrival times of the light at different tanks to measure {{the direction of the}} primary particle. The pattern of light allows for discrimination between primary (hadrons) and gamma-rays. From this, scientists can map the sky using gamma-rays.|$|E
5000|$|Perfumes {{are best}} {{preserved}} when kept in <b>light-tight</b> aluminium bottles {{or in their}} original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between 3-7 °C (37-45 °F). Although {{it is difficult to}} completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and [...] "open" [...] bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.|$|E
