40|$|AbstractThe MetroCable in Medellín, {{the second}} largest city in Colombia, is {{perhaps one of the}} most {{prominent}} recent expansions of public transport infrastructure in urban Latin America. This article explores the question how and in what ways the MetroCable affects accessibility of the residents in two municipalities - Santa Cruz and Popular - where it operates since 2004. The presentation combines an analysis of the influence of the MetroCable on accessibility in general with a specific inquiry on female residents and the role of security. The paper adopts a differentiated conceptualization and indicators of accessibility. The analysis draws on statistical quantitative data from the Origin-Destination surveys for Medellín of 2005 and 2011 / 2 and about 30 in-depth semi structured interviews with female residents conducted in 2012. The paper concludes with a discussion on the possible <b>lessons</b> for <b>planning</b> <b>interventions</b> for improving accessibility of residents in low-income neighborhoods and a discussion on methodological implications...|$|R

The GPLMS intervention consists primarily of instructional coaching which has to mediate <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> to teachers. This research specifically looks at the teacher-coach relations, the nature of coaching support and monitoring and its impact on teachers. Research data were collected through interviews of teachers in one FP school and one Intersen school in the Johannesburg South district as well as from two coaches and their supervisors. A Peer Learning Group (PLG) meeting in one school and a School-Based Workshop (SBW) in the other school were observed.

The data analysis reveals that instructional coaching combined with high quality <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> are promising <b>interventions</b> with potential to improve teachers’ instructional practices.

The present {{study was conducted to}} survey the academic staff’s views about <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in 2001. Moreover, considering the finding of the study there was an attempt to seek the experts’ views on how to perform <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> practically through forming a focus group. Methods: This is a descriptive study indicating the attitudes of 152 academic staff about <b>lesson</b> <b>plan.</b> The data were collected using a questionnaire. The findings of the first stage was followed by forming a focus group in the second stage. Ten authorities and experts in the field were selected. They were interviewed on how to perform <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> in Shiraz university of Medical Sciences in three sessions. It was concluded that the main barrier for designing and performing the <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> is the academic staff’s lack of awareness about its advantages. Results: Of the population under the study, 30 % were females and 70 % males. The majority of the academic staff (126 individuals, 85. 1 %) believes that they need a <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> in their field and that the implementation of <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> contributes to the improvement of education. 70. 9 % (1. 5) of them believe that <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> does not limit the educational process.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} challenges for instructors is creating <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> on a regular basis that truly facilitate learning for students. One common model of <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> is to find a template and stick to it. The problem is that <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> tend to become an inhibiting framework and work to the detriment of course goals if viewed uncritically. One possible solution is to evaluate other <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> models, even those at first counterintuitive to the instructor, which may help to establish a number of creative plans to suit a range of teaching contexts. Periodically reevaluating which ingredients should go into a class is a process of reflection acting as a mirror to foster self-development as a teacher. This paper introduces such an experimental process by discussing a variety of <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> models, all of which have been considered appropriate and effective by teachers at particular times and in particular places.
