25|$|Since {{officers}} {{have to be}} on call-out most of the day, they may be assigned to regular patrol duties. To decrease response times to situations that require a SWAT team, it is now a common practice to place SWAT equipment and weaponry in secured lockers in the trunks of specialized police cruisers. Departments that often use this style of organization are county sheriffs, due to the different sizes of counties, and the predominance of back-roads. In places <b>like</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> where traffic may be heavy, the LAPD use cruisers such as this to respond with their officers so {{they do not have to}} return to a police station to armor up. However, heavier duty equipment may be needed depending on the situation that arises.|$|E
25|$|An ASC {{is made up}} of all the {{participating}} NA Groups in a given Area. The Group Service Representatives (GSRs) and alternate GSRs from each Group in an Area meet regularly together for a business meeting where issue are raised and discussed in order to better {{meet the needs of the}} groups in the Area. Each ASC elects its own officers: the chairperson, vice chairperson, secretary, treasurer, and regional committee members (RCMs). Frequently an ASC will have various subcommittees (such as a but not limitied to Hospitals and Institutions (H), Public Information (PI), Activities, Website, Outreach, Policy, Literature, Literature Review, Newsletter, Recovery By Mail and Convention) which are led by subcommittee leaders that are elected by the entire ASC. In some regions, several ASCs will be grouped into a Metropolitan Service Committee at the sub-regional level; this is typical in especially large cities, <b>like</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> that contain multiple ASCs.|$|E

25|$|Before the war, 87 {{physicians}} and surgeons, 137 nurses, 105 dentists, 132 pharmacists, 35 optometrists, and 92 lab technicians provided healthcare to the Japanese American population, with most practicing in urban centers <b>like</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> San Francisco and Seattle. As the eviction from the West Coast was carried out, the Wartime Civilian Control Administration {{worked with the}} United States Public Health Service {{and many of these}} professionals to establish infirmaries within the temporary assembly centers. An Issei doctor was appointed to manage each facility, and additional healthcare staff worked under his supervision, although the USPHS recommendation of one physician for every 1,000 inmates and one nurse to 200 inmates was not met. Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions forced assembly center infirmaries to prioritize inoculations over general care, obstetrics and surgeries; at Manzanar, for example, hospital staff performed over 40,000 immunizations against typhoid and smallpox. Food poisoning was common and also demanded significant attention. Those who were interned in Topaz, Minidoka, and Jerome experienced outbreaks of dysentery.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{a fourth}} season of Plaza Sésamo was produced. [...] It {{featured}} a larger cast of children, more original music, {{and a new}} set designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. [...] The season focused on a more innovative curriculum, developed by a board of Latin American educators and UNICEF, and included topics such as health, hygiene, safety issues, cooperation, counting, and the alphabet. [...] The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families, {{for the purpose of}} promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children's first teachers. [...] The fourth season aired in the U.S. because of the large population of Spanish-speakers in the country; {{it was the first time}} an original co-production was shown in the U.S. [...] As Gary Knell, an executive at the CTW stated, [...] "Our mission is to educate all kids. [...] And the fact is, in the U.S., especially in cities <b>like</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> there's an enormous number of Spanish-speaking households".|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} ISC was profitable, {{but most of}} their races {{were still in the}} South and in mostly rural areas, with many of the country's major cities <b>like</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> Detroit, Miami and Chicago lacking a nearby track. ISC began looking for ways to change this in the late 1990s. Homestead-Miami Speedway was built in 1995 by Ralph Sanchez and Wayne Huizenga and in 1997 ISC and Penske Motorsports (owned by {{motorsports}} magnate Roger Penske) partnered with the track's owners. In 1999, the company continued its push into the country's urban centers when it merged with Penske, who at the time owned four speedways: Nazareth Speedway, North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina, Michigan International Speedway and the newly constructed Auto Club Speedway (which opened as California Speedway). Chairman Bill France, Jr. cited the company's [...] "attractive markets" [...] as one of the major reasons for going ahead with the deal. The new company retained the ISC name, with Penske's son Gregory Penske joining the board of directors. Not all of the new tracks from the Penske merger fit into the company's plans however, as Nazareth was soon closed down and Rockingham was sold. The merger also gave ISC a 90% stake in Homestead-Miami Speedway and the company soon bought out the final 10% to acquire complete control over the track.|$|E

In 1912, UC acquired a private oceanography laboratory in San Diego, {{which had been}} founded nine years earlier by local business promoters working with a Berkeley professor. In 1944, UC acquired Santa Barbara State College from the California State Colleges, {{the descendants of the}} State Normal Schools. [...] After losing a second campus to UC, the state colleges' supporters arranged for the state constitution to be amended in 1946 to stop that from ever happening again. [...] Starting in 1958, the Regents began to promote each of these locations (along with San Francisco) to the rank of general campus and grant each the right to have their own chancellors, creating, respectively, UCSB (1958), UC Davis (1959), UC Riverside (1959), UCSD (1960), and UCSF (1964).|$|E
