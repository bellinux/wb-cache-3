40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if stability and proprioception scores improved on college-aged students using a slack <b>line</b> <b>device.</b> Methods: One group of 20 participants aged 18 - 23 from a Midwestern university performed a pre-test/post-test on a computerized posturography plate to determine Center of Pressure (CoP) and Limit of Stability (LoS) scores.   Participants performed three 20 - 30 minute sessions per week of balance and proprioceptive training using a Balance Bow for a period of four weeks. Data were analyzed (SPSS 21. 0) using a dependent t-test to determine if any changes occurred between pre- and post-test scores after four weeks.   Results: The analyses found no significance difference in Center of Pressure (CoP), normal stability eyes open (NSEO), normal stability eyes closed (NSEC), perturbed stability eyes open (PSEO), perturbed stability eyes closed (PSEC), or LoS forward (F), backward (B), or right (R) scores in college-aged participants. A significant difference was found in LoS left (L) and a notable trend towards significance was found in LoS R results.

The displacement measurements were compared with those obtained by a laser 3 D vibrometer, whose physical principle is completely different.

40|$|A {{variety of}} novel on-chip {{terahertz}} {{systems have been}} developed {{with the aim of}} advancing current on-chip spectroscopic techniques. A novel methodology for the fabrication and positioning of isolated regions of photoconductive LT-GaAs thin film has been developed, allowing generation and detection of THz signals in-plane with a microstrip transmission <b>line</b> <b>device.</b> Devices with bandwidths in excess of 1. 2 THz have been demonstrated. The introduction of novel, THz frequency passive resonator elements, in the form of quarter-wave band stop filters, into a transmission <b>line</b> <b>device</b> allowed measurements of the properties of overlaid dielectric films by monitoring of the resonant shift. Cascading multiple resonators along a single interconnect allowed simultaneous measurements to be performed at isolated frequencies at discrete locations on a single device. The first full characterisation of the resonant shift as a function of load thickness for a THz filter is performed, with measurements obtained in excellent agreement with subsequent free space studies, whilst requiring a 10 ' reduction in sample volume. Design modifications provided ultrahigh spectroscopic resolution in the terahertz range of < 2 GHz, allowing the measurement of overlaid films of DNA in single and double stranded form down to quantities of 0. 211 femtomoles, almost double the sensitivity, in terms of average relative resonant shift per base pair, when compared to literature values. The active region of the devices designed for this work is N 123 times less than existing topologies and therefore represents an increase in resonant shift per unit active area of two orders of magnitude. ...|$|E

An exemplary device can comprise several thin-film layers including thin-film transducer layers, thin-film delay layers, and stacks of additional thin-film materials providing acoustic reflectors and matching networks.

For example, the transducer layers and delay layers can comprise piezoelectric and amorphous forms of the same material. The layers can be deposited on a carrier substrate using standard techniques. The device can be configured so that mechanical waves propagate solely within the thin films, providing a substrate-independent device.
