5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a {{restaurant}} in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom. Berry claimed {{that he had the}} camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Though his guilt was never proved in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. (One of the biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that, with 59 women, it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.). His <b>lawyers</b> <b>said</b> he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth. During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women, one of whom being apparently a minor. Also found in the raid were 62grams of marijuana. Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. As the child-abuse charges were dropped, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.|$|E

500|$|Bamber's <b>lawyers</b> <b>said</b> the 26 September 1985 {{letter to}} Mugford from John Walker, {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions, raised the possibility {{that she had been}} persuaded to testify in the hope that charges against her would not be pursued. In the letter Walker suggested to the Chief Constable of Essex Police, [...] "with considerable hesitation", that Mugford not be prosecuted for drug offences, burglary and cheque fraud, offences to which she had confessed during her police interviews regarding Bamber. The defence team also highlights that, as soon as the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{was still}} the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he {{returned}} to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his <b>lawyers</b> <b>said</b> was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a New York Times article as a possible political move to counter [...] "soft on crime" [...] accusations.|$|E
