Turn signals were now mounted along the fork tubes, below the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>headlight.</b> 1982 was the last model year for the CX500. In 1983 it was bumped up to 673 cc and became the CX650. The CX650's styling was different, and the engine was painted black instead of silver.|$|R
50|$|As of 2012, the {{fee for the}} NCT is €55 for a full test, and €28 for a re-test that {{requires}} testing equipment (e.g. emission <b>levels,</b> aiming <b>of</b> <b>headlights,</b> etc.) Re-tests {{that do not require}} the use of test equipment such as e.g. obscured registration plate, faulty windscreen wiper) are free of charge. However, if a confirmed appointment is cancelled with less than five working days' notice (Mon. - Fri., not including the day of the test or the day you contact NCTS) or failure to show up for the test, a €22.00 surcharge will be applied when the car is next brought in for testing. A similar surcharge of €11.50 will apply {{in the case of a}} re-test.|$|R
50|$|License plate capture is {{typically}} performed by specialized cameras {{designed specifically for}} the task, although new software techniques are being implemented that support any I.P.-based surveillance camera and increase the utility of ANPR for perimeter security applications. Factors which pose difficulty for license plate imaging cameras include {{the speed of the}} vehicles being recorded, varying <b>level</b> <b>of</b> ambient light, <b>headlight</b> glare and harsh environmental conditions. Most dedicated license plate capture cameras will incorporate infrared illumination in order to solve the problems of lighting and plate reflectivity.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} use high power {{headlights}} on heavy duty vehicles, an automatic mechanism for adjusting the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>headlights</b> must be used. This {{is in order}} to avoid glare while still maintaining good visibility. For headlights exceeding 2000 lumen, this control must be done automatically. The main reason for a change in the headlight level is when the truck is being loaded, and the suspension is compressed causing the headlights to point slightly up or down. Due to inherent limitations of the Scania trucks, the most commonly used approach of estimating the vehicle pitch angle is not possible to implement. Thus, a set of pitch estimation methods largely using sensors detecting acceleration are investigated and presented. Further, three methods are chosen for further study and evaluation. One method using previously recorded data about road slope as well as an on board acceleration sensor is shown to produce a high quality vehicle pitch estimate...|$|R

A {{few of the}} major brands that produce these [...] "kits" [...] include 3M, Turtle Wax, Sylvania, Headlight Wizard, Meguiar's, Mothers, and Rain-X. Most of these kits require multiple stages of wet sanding to remove the oxidation <b>of</b> the <b>headlight</b> lens, usually with descending <b>level</b> <b>of</b> grit (coarse to fine). Some kits include a UV sealant which is said to protect the lens <b>of</b> the <b>headlight</b> longer. Kits with the UV sealant include some of the 3M, Sylvania, and Headlight Wizard. It {{should be noted that}} typically the DIY sealant requires regular periodic reapplication and is not equivalent to the original OEM hardcoat applied during manufacturing. Another common option to delay the aging process <b>of</b> <b>headlight</b> lenses, is the use of press and snap-on headlight covers, or laminates with adhesives that can be applied over the headlight lenses, such as Paint Protection Film sold by 3M.|$|R

First, the pixels <b>of</b> the <b>headlights</b> are segmented in nighttime traffic images, {{through the use of}} the thresholding method. Then the pixels <b>of</b> the <b>headlights</b> are grouped and labeled, to analyze the characteristics of related components, such as area, location and size.

Vehicles with only one headlight or those with three or four headlights are also detected. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is robust and effective in detecting vehicles in nighttime traffic...|$|R
