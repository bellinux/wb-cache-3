60|$|It {{is proper}} {{in this place}} to mention a short philosophic piece which Diderot wrote in 1751, his <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Dumb for the Use of those who Hear and Talk. This is not, like <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Blind, the {{examination}} of {{a case of the}} Intellect deprived of {{one or more of the}} senses. It is substantially a fragment, and a very important fragment, on Æsthetics, and as such there will be something to say about it in another chapter. But there are, perhaps, one or two points at which <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Dumb touches the line of thought of <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Blind.|$|R

5|$|The Duchess of Lorraine's {{love for}} her husband was strong and possessive. The letters she sent to him shortly before their {{marriage}} expressed her eagerness to see him; his <b>letters,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, were stereotyped and formal. She was very jealous {{of her husband and}} his infidelity was the greatest problem of their marriage, with Maria Wilhelmina, Princess of Auersperg, as his best-known mistress.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E

5|$|Potter's tale pays {{homage to}} the leisurely summers her father and his companions passed sport fishing at rented country estates in Scotland. Following the tale's publication, a child fan wrote Potter {{suggesting}} Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded {{with a series of}} miniature <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters. Jeremy and his friends were released as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise.|$|E
5|$|It {{stands on}} a granite {{pedestal}} also designed by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn, Cornwall. Bas-relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born, the archer who fatally shot him in 1199, {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the pedestal in 1866–67. As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public – the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park – the west-side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible from the street. According to Marochetti, the two bas-reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti's doors at the Florence Baptistry. Bronze <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the pedestal bear the inscription RICHARD I CŒUR DE LION / 1189–1199.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> model of Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E

5|$|Another {{historically}} notable {{replica of}} Szczerbiec was produced probably in Dresden, Saxony, {{at the time}} when the original was in Prussian hands. It is modest and inexact; the handle is carved in bovine bone and the niello is imitated with black paint. Designs on the handle are patterned on those of the genuine Szczerbiec, except that the crosses and <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pommel were replaced with the coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The blade was initially shorter than that of the original, actually typical for a stiletto. It was purchased in Dresden by art historian Edward Rastawiecki, who in 1869 donated it to the archeological collection of the Jagiellonian University of Kraków. The university lost it during the German occupation in World War II. After the war, the replica found itself in the hands of Tadeusz Janowski who smuggled it to the United States in 1947. At around that time, the short stiletto blade was replaced with a long blade of a 16th-century German sword. To imitate Szczerbiec, a slit was cut in the blade and small heraldic shields were attached to it on both sides. During the communist rule in Poland, the Polish American community of Chicago treated the replica as a symbol of Poland's independence. In 1968, it was demonstrated to U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy while he was meeting with Polish Americans during his presidential campaign. Janowski returned the sword to the Jagiellonian University in 2003.|$|E
