40|$|OBJECTIVE: This in situ/ex vivo study {{assessed}} the erosive {{potential of a}} <b>light</b> <b>cola</b> drink when compared to a regular one. METHODS: During 2 experimental 14 -days crossover phases, eight volunteers wore palatal devices with 2 human enamel blocks. The groups under study were: group light, erosive challenge with <b>light</b> <b>cola</b> drink and group regular, erosive challenge with regular cola drink. During 14 days, erosive challenges were performed extraorally 3 X/day. In each challenge, the device was immersed in 150 ml of <b>light</b> <b>cola</b> (group light) or regular cola (group regular) for 5 min. Erosion was analysed by surface profilometry (microm) and surface microhardness change (%SMH). The data were statistically analyzed using paired t test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Group light (0. 6 +/- 0. 2 microm) showed significantly lesser wear than group regular (3. 1 +/- 1. 0 microm). There {{was no significant difference}} between the groups for the %SMH (group light - 63. 9 +/- 13. 9 and group regular - 78. 5 +/- 12. 7). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the <b>light</b> <b>cola</b> drink is less erosive than the regular one...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the type of}} cola drink (regular or diet) could influence the wear of enamel subjected to erosion followed by brushing abrasion, Method and !Materials: Ten volunteers wore intraoral devices that each had eight bovine enamel blocks divided into four groups; ER, erosion with regular cola; EAR, erosion with regular cola plus abrasion; EL, erosion with light cola; and EAL, erosion with <b>light</b> <b>cola</b> plus abrasion, Each day for 1 week, half of each device was immersed in regular cola for 5 minutes, Then, two blocks were brushed using a fluoridated toothpaste and electric toothbrush for 30 seconds four times daily, Immediately after, {{the other half of}} the device was subjected to the same procedure using a <b>light</b> <b>cola,</b> The pH, calcium, phosphorus, and fluoride concentrations of the colas were analyzed using standard procedures, Enamel alterations were measured by profilometry. Data were tested using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test (P. 05) between erosion and erosion plus abrasion for <b>light</b> <b>cola,</b> However, for regular cola, erosion plus abrasion resulted in higher enamel loss than erosion alone,. nclusion: The data suggest that <b>light</b> <b>cola</b> promoted less enamel wear even when erosion was followed by brushing abrasion, (Quintessence Int 2011; 42 :xxx-xx) () FAPESP[2006 / 03874 - 8]FAPESP[2007 / 07296 - 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} effects of {{long-term}} cola beverage drinking on glucose homeostasis, endocrine pancreas function and morphology in rats. Wistar rats drank: water (group W), regular cola beverage (group C, sucrose sweetened) or "light" cola beverage (group L, artificially sweetened). After 6 months, 50 % of the animals in each group were euthanized and the remaining animals consumed water for the next 6 months when euthanasia was performed. Biochemical assays, insulinemia determination, estimation of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), morphometry and immunohistochemistry evaluations were performed in pancreas. Hyperglycemia (16 %, p< 0. 05), CoQ 10 (coenzyme-Q 10) decrease (- 52 %,p< 0. 01), strong hypertriglyceridemia (2. 8 -fold, p< 0. 01), hyperinsulinemia (2. 4 fold, p< 0. 005) and HOMA-IR increase (2. 7 fold, p< 0. 01) were observed in C. Group C showed a decrease in number of α cells (- 42 %, p< 0. 01) and β cells (- 58 %, p< 0. 001) and a moderate increase in α cells' size after wash-out (+ 14 %, p< 0. 001). Group L showed reduction in β cells' size (- 9 %, p< 0. 001) and only after wash-out (L 12) a 19 % increase in size (p< 0. 0001) with 35 % decrease in number of α cells (p< 0. 01). Groups C and L showed increase in α/β-cell ratio which was irreversible only in C (α/β = + 38 % in C 6,+ 30 % in C 12, p< 0. 001 vs. W 6). Regular cola induced a striking increase in the cytoplasmic expression of Trx 1 (Thioredoxin- 1) (2. 25 -fold in C 6 vs. W 6; 2. 7 -fold in C 12 vs. W 12, p< 0. 0001) and Prx 2 (Peroxiredoxin- 2) (3 -fold in C 6 vs. W 6; 2 -fold in C 12 vs. W 12, p< 0. 0001). <b>Light</b> <b>cola</b> induced increase in Trx 1 (3 -fold) and Prx 2 (2 -fold) after wash-out (p< 0. 0001, L 12 vs. W 12). Glucotoxicity {{may contribute to the}} loss of β cell function with depletion of insulin content. Oxidative stress, suggested by increased expression of thioredoxins and low circulating levels of CoQ 10, may follow sustained hyperglycemia. A likely similar panorama may result from {{the effects of}} artificially sweetened cola though via other downstream routes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Fructose-based diets are {{apparently}} {{related to the}} occurrence of several metabolic dysfunctions, but {{the effects of the}} consumption of high amounts of fructose on body tissues have not been well described. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the general characteristics and the lipid content of different tissues of rats after chronic ingestion of a fructose rich soft drink. Methods Forty-five Wistar rats were used. The rats were divided into three groups (n = 15) and allowed to consume water (C), <b>light</b> Coca <b>Cola</b> ® (L) or regular Coca Cola ® (R) as the sole source of liquids for eight weeks. Results The R group presented significantly higher daily liquid intake and significantly lower food intake than the C and L groups. Moreover, relative to the C and L groups, the R group showed higher triglyceride concentrations in the serum and liver. However, the L group animals presented lower values of serum triglycerides and cholesterol than controls. Conclusions Based on the results, it can be concluded that daily ingestion of a large amount of fructose- rich soft drink resulted in unfavorable alterations to the lipid profile of the rats. </p...|$|R
40|$|We thank C. M. Benedetti {{for digital}} art and editing. Management of {{invasive}} aspergillosis in high-risk patients remains challenging. There {{is an increasing}} demand for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing or restoring antifungal immunity in immunocompromised patients. In this regard, modulation of specific innate immune functions and vaccination are promising immunotherapeutic strategies. Recent findings have also provided a compelling rationale for assessment of {{the contribution of the}} individual genetic profile to the immunotherapy outcome. Altogether, integration of immunological and genetic data may contribute to the optimization of therapeutic strategies exerting control over immune pathways, ultimately improving the management of fungal infections in high-risk settings.

40|$|Fungal {{infections and}} {{diseases}} predominantly affect patients with deregulated immunity. Compelling experimental and clinical evidence indicate that severe fungal diseases {{belong to the}} spectrum of fungus-related inflammatory diseases. Some degree of inflammation is required for protection during the transitional response occurring temporally between the rapid innate and slower adaptive response. However, progressive inflammation worsens disease and ultimately prevents pathogen eradication. The challenge now is to elucidate cellular and molecular pathways distinguishing protective vs. pathogenic inflammation to fungi. In addition to fungal ligands of pattern recognition receptors (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs), several host-encoded proteins, the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are released during tissue injury and activate innate recognition receptors. DAMPs {{have been shown to}} regulate inflammation in fungal diseases. The DAMP/receptor for advanced glycation end-products axis integrated with the PAMP/Toll-like receptors axis in the generation of the inflammatory response in experimental and clinical fungal pneumonia. These emerging themes better accommodate fungal pathogenesis in the face of high-level inflammation seen in several clinical settings and point to DAMP targeting as a novel immunomodulatory strategy in fungal diseases.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the loss of}} enamel and dentine after exposure to different non-alcoholic drinks with a simple new method using bovine teeth. 100 enamel and 100 dentine specimens from freshly extracted bovine incisors were randomly attributed to 10 groups (n= 10 for enamel and dentine each). Prior {{to the start of}} the experiment all specimens were weighed using a precision balance. The mean initial masses (SD) were 35. 8 mg (7. 2) for enamel and 24. 7 mg (7. 0) for dentine. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for initial masses (p> 0. 05, ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). Thereafter, all specimens of one group were simultaneously placed in 200 ml of the following fluids: Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola light, Sprite, apple juice, Red Bull, orange juice, Bonaqua Fruits (Mango-Acai), tap water, chlorinated swimming pool water, and lemon juice. Fluids were continuously ventilated at 37 ° C for 7 days. Thereafter the specimens were weighed again and the mean mass loss was calculated. The values were (enamel/dentine) : Coca-Cola 7. 5 mg/ 6. 6 mg; Coca-Cola light 5. 2 mg/ 3. 5 mg, Sprite 26. 1 mg/ 17. 7 mg, apple juice 27. 1 mg/ 15. 2 mg, Red Bull 16. 6 mg/ 17. 0 mg, orange juice 24. 3 mg/ 20. 2 mg, Bonaqua Fruits (Mango-Acai) 17. 8 mg/ 16. 2 mg, tap water - 0. 2 mg/- 0. 3 mg, swimming pool water - 0. 3 mg/- 0. 2 mg, and lemon juice 32. 0 mg/ 28. 3 mg. From all drinks, <b>Cola</b> and <b>Cola</b> <b>light</b> showed the least erosivity (p< 0. 001, ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test) whereas lemon juice showed statistically significant higher erosivity than all other drinks except Sprite and apple juice (p< 0. 01, ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). In conclusion, erosivity of common non-alcoholic drinks varies widely. For example, Sprite, apple juice, and orange juice are about five times more erosive than Coca-Cola light. The findings from the present study should be taken into account in choosing a diet that provides satisfactory nutrition while minimizing tooth erosion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThough the {{architectural}} production during the Cola period (c. 850 - 1279) was both impressive and numerous, {{only a few}} temples were patronized directly by the Cola kings and queens. Among those, four are very important and can be labelled " State temples ". These are located at Tanjavur, Gangaikondacolapuram, Darasuram and Tribhuvanam. They share specific features: height of the shrine-tower, association {{of the name of}} the ruler with the divinity, relative unity of the conception, short number of secondary buildings around the main shrine, and, finally, a relative short story, since they were usually disregarded by the successors of the Cola (except the Nayaks). But the temple at Gangaikondacolapuram was completed {{by the middle of the}} 11 th century (Rajendra I died in 1044) and the one at Darasuram was started only a century later (by Rajaraja II, 1146 - 1172). What happened in the meantime? A lot of temples were built during that span of time but what was the role of the royal patrons in the process? As a matter of fact, and in spite of a dynastic change at the end of the 11 th century, the Cola kings of the 12 th century (Kulottunga I, Vikramacola, Kulottunga II, Rajaraja II, Kulottunga III) were powerful rulers. It is then surprising that such an important king as Kulottunga I (1070 - 1122) was did not built his own " State temple ", but patronized the one at Chidambaram. His son, Vikrama, followed his father's work but had also new temples created. The one at Tukkacci, near Kumbakonam, is one of the most impressive. It has been published only once, by S. R. Balasubrahmanyam in his extant survey of Cola architecture. Though it is sometimes considered as the prototype for the Darasuram temple (L'Hernault 1987 : 6 - 7), it is generally neglected by the historians. The aim of this paper, based on recent pictures of the building, is to reconsider this temple in the <b>light</b> of royal <b>Cola</b> architecture. The question is to know whether Tukkacci is the link between Gangaikondacolapuram and Darasuram, and, if so, what novelty it brought. In particular, two aspects will be examined: the chariot-mandapa and the appearance of the image of Sarabha, Siva in the shape of a mythical beast putting and and to Narasimha's wrath...|$|R
