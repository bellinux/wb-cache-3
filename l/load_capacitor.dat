It presents a design paradigm which in ideal case {{may lead to a}} circuit capable of performing logic operations with no switching losses. In traditional integrated circuit design, the energy is stored in the output <b>load</b> <b>capacitor</b> through a pull-up path (corresponding to storing a logic 1). When the output changes its logic value, this stored energy is dissipated through the pull down path to the ground. In order to reduce this switching energy dissipation each time the <b>load</b> <b>capacitor</b> is discharged, we store its energy in the magnetic field of the inductor in the proposed SLC architecture. Whenever the output load needs to be charged again, we transfer the energy back from the inductor to the <b>load</b> <b>capacitor.</b> This significantly reduces the switching energy.
