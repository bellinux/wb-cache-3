25|$|The Helmy Aerogypt was a British four-seat cabin {{monoplane}} {{designed and}} built by Egyptian S Helmy at Heston Aerodrome in 1938. The Aerogypt I was a low-wing cantilever monoplane initially powered by three 22hp (16kW) Douglas Sprite engines. The aircraft had an upward hinged roof that acted as a <b>landing</b> <b>flap.</b> Registered G-AFFG, it first flew in 1939. It later had the hinged roof removed, and was re-designated the Aerogypt II. Another modification added end plates to the horizontal tail surfaces, and was re-designated the Aerogypt III, and last flown in that configuration in September 1940.|$|E
500|$|The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} monoplane with folding {{wings to}} allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped [...] canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a [...] fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with intermeshing [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of [...] fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by [...] of armor.|$|E
2500|$|The H.III {{series was}} an {{incremental}} {{development of the}} Horten H.II with reduced sweepback of 23°, span increased to 20 m (65ft 7 in) and modified lateral controls. [...] The wing trailing edges had three movable surfaces; the innermost was a <b>landing</b> <b>flap,</b> but the outer pair were geared differential elevons with the outer elevon having a large upward deflection and only slight downward movement, conversely, the inner elevon had large downward movement and slight upward movement.|$|E

50|$|Bremen is {{the second}} {{development}} centre of the region, after Hamburg. It forms part of the production network of Airbus SAS {{and this is where}} equipping of the wing units for all widebody Airbus aircraft and the manufacture of small sheet metal parts takes place. Structural assembly, including that of metal <b>landing</b> <b>flaps,</b> is another focal point. Within the framework of Airbus A380 production, assembly of the <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> (high lift systems) is carried out here. The pre-final assembly of the fuselage section (excluding the cockpit) of the A400M military transport aircraft takes place before delivery on to Spain.|$|R

50|$|The canard {{foreplane}} may {{be fixed}} {{as on the}} IAI Kfir, have <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> as on the Saab Viggen, or be moveable and also act as a control-canard during normal flight as on the Dassault Rafale.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{conventional}} rudder the Habicht had drag rudders. [...] These were leading edge flaps placed near the tips and formed by mounting the leading edge surfaces on a hinge so they could open upwards and downwards (those of the Horten H.I had extended downwards only). [...] Their differential operational controlled yaw and they served as conventional airbrakes when opened together. The whole trailing edge was occupied by control surfaces; the outer panels had elevons outboard and <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> inboard and there were further <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> on the centre section. Rear control surfaces were assisted by Flettner servo tabs and were ply covered.|$|R

50|$|The Tu-114 {{used the}} basic wing, empennage, landing gear, and powerplants of the Tu-95 bomber, mated to {{a totally new}} {{pressurized}} fuselage of much larger diameter. To cope with the increased weight, increased <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> surface area was required, and the flap chord was increased compared to the bomber's flaps. The wing was mounted low on the fuselage, giving the Tu-114 a much higher stance on its landing gear than the bomber. As a result, a new nose landing gear strut was required, although the main landing gear remained unchanged.|$|E

50|$|Dipl. Ing E. Kösel, {{who also}} {{worked on the}} Fw 189 {{reconnaissance}} plane, {{was supposed to have}} led the design team for the Fw 191. Overall, the Fw 191 was a clean, all-metal aircraft that featured a shoulder-mounted wing. Two 24-cylinder Jumo 222 engines (which showed more promise than the DB 604 engines) were mounted in nacelles on the wings. An interesting feature was the inclusion of the Multhopp-Klappe, an ingenious form of combined <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> and dive brake, which was developed by Hans Multhopp. The entire fuel supply was carried in five tanks located above the internal bomb bay, and in two tanks in the wing between the engine nacelles and fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The MP2 Baladin was {{designed}} and constructed by Maurice Paumier. The two-seat side-by-side design was advanced for its day amongst amateur constructors, as it featured such refinements as a variable-pitch airscrew, <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> and a retractable tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|No Warning: The {{primary cause}} of CFIT occurrences with no GPWS warning is landing short. When the landing gear is down and <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> are deployed, the GPWS expects the {{airplane}} to land and therefore, issues no warning.|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{the use of}} <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> on {{the main}} wing causes a large trim change. The Saab Viggen has flaps on the canard surface which were {{deployed}} simultaneously to cancel out the change in trim. The Beech Starship uses variable-sweep foreplanes to trim {{the position of the}} lift force.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Airmaster, the C-34, {{evolved into}} more advanced {{versions of the}} Airmaster. The C-37 had a wider cabin, improved landing gear and electric flaps. The C-38 had a taller vertical tail, curved main gear legs and a <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> under the fuselage. [...] Changes common to both the C-37 and C-38 included wider fuselages and landing gear along with rubber engine mounts to hold the [...] Warner Super Scarab engine. The final revisions of the C-34 were the C-145 and the C-165, of which 80 were built. On these models, the belly flaps added on the C-38 were removed and the overall length of the fuselage was increased. The only difference between the C-145 and C-165 was the engine horsepower, with the latter having an upgraded [...] Warner engine.|$|E
50|$|A later {{concession}} {{would bring}} difficulties {{in that the}} demarcation line between airbrake/landing flaps and performance enhancing flaps is vague. The reluctance within the IGC to allow the later in the Standard Class led to an unsuccessful attempt to codify what constitutes a <b>landing</b> <b>flap.</b> After the LS2 and the PIK-20 exploited this loophole to win the 1974 and 1976 World Championships in the Standard Class, the IGC banned all camber-changing devices from the class and created a parallel 15 metre Class to accommodate them. This decision was polemic {{as it was the}} second rule change in a few years and it orphaned several glider types that did not fit well within either class definition (especially the PIK-20 and the Libelle that had been built in large numbers). Notwithstanding, the decision was vindicated by the great success subsequently enjoyed by both the Standard and 15 metre classes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1943, the US Navy invited {{proposals}} {{for a new}} multi-purpose bomber and selected four designs in September: the Curtiss XBTC, Douglas XBT2D Skyraider, Kaiser-Fleetwings BTK and the Martin XBTM. Martin was tasked to provide a backup to the Curtiss design which had been selected as a replacement to the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. Due to the US Navy's concern that the Curtiss design was overly complex and that the company's record was particularly poor during the Helldiver's development, Martin was instructed to create an [...] "unexperimental" [...] design {{that would be a}} reliable platform for the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engine that powered both aircraft. Two prototypes were ordered from Martin on 31 May 1944 with the internal designation of Model 210. The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, all-metal monoplane with folding wings to allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a 150 gal fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on the trailing edge of the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with intermeshing [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role.

A pair of 180 gal fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by 297 lb of armor.|$|E
50|$|From 1933 Yakovlev and {{his design}} team {{developed}} a 2-seat low-wing monoplane sport aircraft with open cockpits, wooden wings, welded steel tube fuselage, {{powered by a}} Shvetsov M-11 engine.

40|$|Analyses of McDonnell Douglas DC- 8, DC- 9, and DC- 10 jet {{transports}} {{were conducted}} to investigate the applicability of two segment approach noise abatement procedures to these airplanes. All models had the required glide slope capability at the certified <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> settings. The DC- 8 models would probably be limited to an upper segment glide slope of 5. 5 degrees and would probably not be suitable for the two segment procedure in icing conditions. The DC- 8 would not be compatible with this procedure at a reduced <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> setting. The feasibility of installing a two segment approach system in the Douglas-built fleet of commercial jet transports from a hardware viewpoint is discussed. The candidate system consists of a two segment computer plus the necessary peripheral equipment interfaced with the existing autopilot and associated avionics. The required modifications and additions to existing equipment are described and the attendant costs estimated. Potential problems which may be encountered are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonic speeds of a 1 / 9 -scale model of a variable-sweep supersonic cruise aircraft. The model configurations investigated were the basic unflapped arrangement, a take-off flap arrangement, and a <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> arrangement with several strake leading-edge flow control devices. The tests {{were conducted}} at angles of attack from about - 5 to 36 deg, sideslip angles from - 5 to 10 deg...|$|E
40|$|Takeoff {{and landing}} {{performance}} characteristics and field length requirements were determined analytically for a jet STOL transport configuration with full-span, externally blown, tripleslotted flaps. The configuration {{had a high}} wing, high T-tail, and four pod-mounted high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines located under and forward of the wing. One takeoff and three approach and <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> settings were evaluated. The effects of wing loading, thrust-to-weight ratio, weight, ambient temperature, altitude on takeoff and landing field length requirements are discussed...|$|E
2500|$|Shrapnel {{from the}} {{exploding}} engine punctured {{part of the}} wing and damaged the fuel system causing leaks and a fuel tank fire, disabled one hydraulic system and the anti-lock braking system, caused No.1 and No.4 engines {{to go into a}} [...] "degraded" [...] mode, damaged <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> and the controls for the outer left No.1 engine.|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by the de Havilland DH.88 Comet racer {{which had}} won the MacRobertson Air Race in 1934, the Grigorovich OKB began work on a similar aircraft. Like the DH.88, the Russian [...] "Kometa" [...] was a highly {{streamlined}} conventional low-wing monoplane with twin engines forward of retractable main undercarriage in nacelles under each wing. Built of wood, it also featured an enclosed cockpit and <b>landing</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Sea Vampire {{has several}} key {{differences}} from their land-based counterparts. It {{could be easily}} distinguished be {{the presence of a}} V-shaped arrestor hook that retracted to a high-mounted position above the jet pipe. The Sea Vampire was fitted with enlarged air brakes and <b>landing</b> <b>flaps</b> for superior low speed control during landing approaches, along with construction to higher load factors to account for the greater stresses involved in carrier landings.|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{investigations}} of the acoustic characteristics of the externally blown jet flap (EBF) and augmentor wing STOL concepts are dicussed. The large-scale EBF model was equipped with a triple-slotted blown by four JT 15 D turbofan engines with circular, coannular exhaust nozzles. The large-scale augmentor wing model was equipped with an unlined augmentor blown by a slot primary nozzle. The effects of airspeed and angle of attack on the acoustics of the EBF were small. At a forward speed of 60 knots, the impingement noise of the <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> was approximately 2 db lower than in the static tests. Angle of attack increased the impingement noise approximately 0. 1 decibels per degree. Flap deflection had a greater effect on the acoustics of the augmentor wing than did airspeed. For a nozzle pressure ratio of 1. 9, the peak perceived noise level of the <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> was 3 to 5 PNdb {{higher than that of}} the takeoff flap. The total sound power was also significantly higher for landing indicating that turning in the augmentor generated acoustic energy. Airspeed produced a small aft shift in acoustic directivity with no significant change in the peak perceived noise levels or sound power levels...|$|E

These tests were performed {{in support of the}} Energy Efficient Transport (EET) program which is one element of the Aircraft Energy Efficiency (ACEE) project. Static longitudinal forces and moments and chordwise pressure distributions at three spanwise stations were measured for cruise, climb, two take-off flap, and two <b>landing</b> <b>flap</b> wing configurations.

50|$|Flaps are {{a type of}} {{high-lift}} device used {{to increase}} the lift of an aircraft wing at a given airspeed. Flaps are usually mounted on the wing trailing edges of a fixed-wing aircraft. Flaps are used to lower the minimum speed at which the aircraft can be safely flown, and to increase the angle of descent for <b>landing.</b> <b>Flaps</b> also cause an increase in drag, so they are retracted when not needed.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Committee of Aircraft Accident Investigation {{stated that}} at the time of the {{accident}} the plane was configured for <b>landing</b> (<b>flaps</b> set and <b>landing</b> gear lowered). It also stated there was no explosion mid-air and all damage was a result of the crash. The plane was landing in harsh, Winter weather conditions, with dense near-ground fog, 6/8 overcast, fractostratus clouds at 250 meters, 7-km visibility and temperature of 5 degrees below 0.|$|R
50|$|The de Havilland DH.88 Comet racer of 1934 {{was one of}} {{the first}} designs to {{incorporate}} all the features of the modern fast monoplane, including; stressed-skin construction, a thin, clean, low-drag cantilever wing, retractable undercarriage, <b>landing</b> <b>flaps,</b> variable-pitch propeller and enclosed cockpit. Unusually for such a highly stressed wing at that time it was still made of wood, with the thin stressed-skin design made possible by the appearance of new high-strength synthetic resin adhesives.|$|R
