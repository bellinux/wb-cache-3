Noting the obvious advantage of such a QKD scheme in allowing for single as well as double photon contributions, we derive relevant lower-bounds on the corresponding gains in a practical decoy state implementation using two intensities for decoy states. We work with two different approaches in this vein and compare these with an ideal infinite decoy state case {{as well as the}} simulation of the original.

40|$|We {{investigate}} string or branelike {{solutions for}} four-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations {{in the presence}} of cosmological constant. For the case of negative cosmological constant, the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black string is the only warped stringlike solution. The general solutions for nonwarped branelike configurations are found and they are characterized by the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass density and two tensions. Interestingly, the sum of these tensions is equal to the minus of the mass density. Other than the well-known black string and soliton spacetimes, all the static solutions possess naked singularities. The time-dependent solutions can be regarded as the anti-de Sitter extension of the well-known Kasner solutions. The speciality of those static regular solutions and the implication of singular solutions are also discussed in the context of cylindrical matter collapse. For the case of positive cosmological constant, the Kasner-de Sitter spacetime appears as time-dependent solutions and all static solutions are found to be naked singular.

40|$|Three {{representation}} {{methods are}} empirically investigated for Chinese information retrieval: 1 -gram (single character), bigram (two contiguous overlapping characters), and short-word indexing {{based on a}} simple segmentation of the text. The retrieval collection is the approximately 170 MB TREC- 5 Chinese corpus of news articles, and 28 queries that are long and rich <b>in</b> <b>wordings.</b> Evaluation shows that 1 -gram indexing is good but not sufficiently competitive, while bigram indexing works surprisingly well. Bigram indexing leads to a large index term space, three times that of short-word indexing, but {{is as good as}} short-word indexing in precision, and about 5 % better in relevants retrieved. The best average non-interpolated precision is about 0. 45, 17 % better than 1 -gram indexing and quite high for a mainly statistical approach. 1.

Items were adopted from previous scales: Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) by Horwitz et al.

Some minor changes <b>in</b> <b>wordings</b> of adopted items were made to a preliminary PSCAS and were validated. The preliminary PSCAS yielded an internal consistency of. 84 using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient when administered to 76 participants and was factor-analyzed to establish the construct and the final version.

She is curious to know whether male and female Manadonese <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado and those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya have things in common or not in refusing other friends? invitations/offers/requests. Furthermore, she also wants to know what kind of refusal that mostly used by the male and female Manadonese friends <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado and those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya. She uses combining theories of refusal by Kartomihardjo and Beebe and Takahashi. In conducting her research, the thesis writer sets same role play consisting of five different situations each to male and female Manadonese friends <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Manado and those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Surabaya. The role plays are designed to be {{as close as possible to}} the real life situations.
