25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{tall and}} robust figure {{combined}} with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near {{a window in}} Samuel Richardson's house, [...] "shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner", Hogarth thought Johnson an [...] "ideot, whom his relations had put {{under the care of}} Mr. Richardson". Hogarth was quite surprised when [...] "this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument... such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired". Beyond appearance, Adam Smith claimed that [...] "Johnson knew more books than any man alive", while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he [...] "certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there". Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his [...] "refutation" [...] of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, [...] "I refute it thus!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Milly dies {{following}} the premature {{birth of her}} baby (who also dies) and Barton is plunged into sadness at the loss. Barton's parishioners, who were so unsympathetic to him as their minister, support {{him and his family}} in their grief: [...] "There were men and women standing in that churchyard who had bandied vulgar jests about their pastor, and who had lightly charged him with sin, but now, when they saw him {{following the}} coffin, pale and haggard, he was consecrated anew by his great sorrow, and they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> respectful pity". Just as Barton is beginning {{to come to terms with}} Milly's death, he gets more bad news: the vicar, Mr. Carpe, will be taking over at Shepperton church. Barton is given six-months notice to leave. He has no choice but to comply, but is disheartened, having at last won the sympathies of the parishioners. Barton believes that the request was unfair, knowing that the vicar's brother-in-law is in search of a new parish in which to work. However, he resigns himself to the move and at length obtains a living in a distant manufacturing town.|$|E
