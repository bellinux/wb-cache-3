5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through {{the first six months}} is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

Introduction: Growth faltering in Indonesian infant {{started when}} they are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> old and {{continued}} untill they grow up. Child care including feeding pattern may as aa caused this problem.  The main factors related with growth faltering are unbalanced food consumption (macro and micro nutrient) and infectious disease. Objectives: The study was aimed to assess the contribution of infant care to infant growth faltering before they reach age of nine month old. The study was designed as cohort prospective Fifty-nine babies were followed from birth until nine months old, in Sukaraja Subdistrict, Bogor Regency. Child care aspects being monitored were feeding pattern, nutrition comsumption and health care. Infant growth measured by weight and length gain, based on CDC-NCHS 2000 growth curve. Repeated measured analysis were used to evaluate when growth faltering begins. Multiple linier regressions were {{used to evaluate the}} impact of child care on infant growth. Result: The result of the study showed that child care significantly contribute infant weight gain and lenght gain when birth weight, birth length, frequency of infection, sex, age of mother, education of mother, nutrition and health knowledge of mother and ratio food to total expenditure were controlled. Growth faltering in weight due to child care starts when they reach two mothers old, and continue until nine months old. Growth faltering in length due to child care starts when they reach five months old, and continue until they the age reach nine months. Conclusions: Infant care especially during the first month of life is an important period to prevent infant from early growth faltering.

Materials and Methods: The files of patients treated with 100 U of onabotulinumtoxinA injected at 20 sites with sparing of the trigone were retrospectively analysed. Nearly all patients completed voiding-incontinence diaries and the King’s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) pre- and post-operatively. Cystometric and pressure-flow studies were done in the majority of patients. Success was defined as the patient’s and clinician’s joint choice for re-treatment with the same dose of onabotulinumtoxinA after a period of at least <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of clinical satisfaction. Results: Twenty-six women were treated. On average, the improvement in most voiding diary parameters and in most KHQ categories lasted <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> and three <b>months,</b> respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Approximately {{one-fifth of}} women who develop early breast cancer have HER 2 -positive tumours, which if untreated, have a worse {{prognosis}} than HER 2 -negative tumours. Trastuzumab is a selective treatment targeting the HER 2 pathway. Although the results on efficacy seem to support its use, there are potential cardiac toxicities which need to be considered, especially for women at lower risk of recurrence, or those at increased cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence on the efficacy and safety of therapy with trastuzumab, overall and in relation to its duration, concurrent or sequential administration with the standard chemotherapy regimen in patients with HER 2 -positive early breast cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCGs) Specialised Trials Register, and used the search strategy developed by the CBCG to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, TOXNET, and the WHO ICTRP search portal (up to February 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, or no treatment, or standard chemotherapy alone, in women with HER 2 -positive early breast cancer including women with locally advanced breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We collected data from published and unpublished trials. We used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and risk ratio (RRs) for binary outcomes. Subgroup analyses included duration (<b>less</b> or greater <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months)</b> and concurrent or sequential trastuzumab administration.

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} indicates that mentalisation-based treatment (MBT) is an effective therapeutic programme for difficulties associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The {{aim of this study}} was to explore service user experiences of the therapy. Design/methodology/approach: Seven adults (five female and two male), recruited via three NHS Trusts, were interviewed. Participants were attending intensive out-patient MBT for BPD for between three and 14 months. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings: Participants experienced the group component of MBT as challenging and unpredictable. They highlighted developing trust as key to benefitting from MBT. This was much more difficult to achieve in group sessions than in individual therapy, particularly for those attending MBT for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> five or <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> The structure of MBT generally worked well for participants but they identified individual therapy as the core component in achieving change. All participants learned to view the world more positively due to MBT. Research limitations/implications: Practical implications: Enhanced mentalisation capacity may help address specific challenges associated with BPD, namely impulsivity and interpersonal difficulties. MBT therapists are confronted with the ongoing task of creating a balance between sufficient safety and adequate challenge during MBT. Potential benefits and drawbacks of differing structural arrangements of MBT programmes within the UK are considered. Social implications: Originality/value: Learning about service user perspectives has facilitated an enhanced understanding of experiences of change during MBT in addition to specific factors that may impact mentalisation capacity throughout the programme. These factors, in addition to implications for MBT and suggestions for future research, are discussed...|$|R
