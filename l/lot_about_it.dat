5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E
25|$|According {{to later}} reports, between 1901 and 1903 Scriabin envisioned writing an opera. He talked a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and expounded its {{ideas in the}} course of normal conversation. The work would center around a nameless hero, a philosopher-musician-poet. Among other things, he would declare: I am the apotheosis of world creation. I am the aim of aims, the end of ends. The Poem Op. 32 No. 2 and the Poème Tragique Op. 34 were {{originally}} conceived as arias in the opera.|$|E

Francis later expanded on {{the significance of}} the lyrics in an interview to Alternative Press, saying [...] "It's a reference from what I understand to be Hebrew numerology, and I don't know a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or any of it really. I just remember someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the success}} of Let's Dance, Bowie {{requested}} Vaughan as the featured instrumentalist for the upcoming Serious Moonlight Tour, realizing {{that he was an}} essential aspect of the album's groundbreaking success. In late April, Vaughan began rehearsals for the tour in Las Colinas, Texas. When contract renegotiations for his performance fee failed, Vaughan abandoned the tour days before its opening date, and he was replaced by Earl Slick. Vaughan commented: [...] "I couldn't gear everything on something I didn't really care a whole <b>lot</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> was kind of risky, but I really didn't need all the headaches." [...] Although contributing factors were widely disputed, Vaughan soon gained major publicity for quitting the tour.|$|E
2500|$|After {{questioning}} two detectives {{about the}} 25-hour {{search for evidence}} in Littlejohn's residence, concluding {{that none of the}} more than 50 items confiscated was linked to St. Guillen, and DNA testing had failed to yield a match, the defense rested its case. Prosecutors had [...] "presented proof that Littlejohn's blood, tissue and DNA were found on the plastic ties that were used to bind St. Guillen's hands." [...] The six men / six women jury took less than seven hours to convict Littlejohn of murdering Imette St. Guillen and found him guilty of first degree murder. One juror, Marian Mallero, said: [...] "The DNA said a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They gave us evidence and it was obvious"; and, [...] "He's guilty, that's all I'm going to say." [...] Another juror said, [...] "All the evidence pointed to the defendant," [...] despite the defense case that Littlejohn was railroaded.|$|E
2500|$|Spain under Zapatero {{turned its}} focus to Europe from the United States, {{pursuing}} a middle road {{in dealing with}} tensions between Western powers and Islamic populations. In a May 2007 interview with El País, Daniel Fried, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, commenting on the overall relationship between Spain and the United States, stated: [...] "We work together very well on some issues. I think the Spanish–American relationship can develop more. I think some Spanish officials are knowledgeable and very skilled professionals and we work with them very well. I {{would like to see}} Spain active in the world, working through NATO, active in Afghanistan. You're doing a lot in the Middle East because Moratinos knows a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But Spain is a big country and your economy is huge. I think Spain can be a force for security and peace and freedom in the world. I believe that Spain has that potential, and that's how I would like to see Spanish–American relations developing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brown is a Christian. He says, I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I {{believe in}} the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me.

You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that. Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he [...] "could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance" [...] adding that he's now [...] "searching for a new belief system." ...|$|E
