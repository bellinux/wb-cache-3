40|$|AbstractUnlike {{conventional}} airplane, a WIG craft experiences {{righting moment}} and adverse yaw moment in banked turning in ground effect. Numerical simulations {{are carried out}} to study the aerodynamics of banked wing in ground effect. Configurations of rectangular wing and delta wing are considered, and performance of endplates and ailerons during banking are also studied. The study shows that righting moment increase nonlinearly with heeling angle, and endplates enhance the righting. The asymmetric aerodynamic distribution along span of wing with heeling angle introduces adverse yaw moment. Heeling in ground effect with small ground clearance increases the vertical aerodynamic force and makes WIG craft climb. Deflections of ailerons introduce <b>lift</b> <b>decrease</b> and a light pitching motion. Delta wing shows advantage in banked turning for smaller righting moment and adverse yaw moment during banking...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a low speed wind tunnel test of 0. 046 scale model target thrust reversers {{installed}} on a 727 - 200 model airplane are presented. The full airplane model was mounted on a force balance, except for the nacelles and thrust reversers, which were independently mounted and isolated from it. The installation had the capability of simulating the inlet airflows and of supplying the correct proportions of primary and secondary air to the nozzles. The objectives of the test were to assess the compatibility of the thrust reversers target door design with the engine and airplane. The following measurements were made: hot gas ingestion at the nacelle inlets; model lift, drag, and pitching moment; hot gas impingement on the airplane structure; and qualitative assessment of the rudder effectiveness. The major parameters controlling hot gas ingestion {{were found to be}} thrust reverser orientation, engine power setting, and the lip height of the bottom thrust reverser doors on the side nacelles. The thrust reversers tended to increase the model <b>lift,</b> <b>decrease</b> the drag, and decrease the pitching moment...|$|E

50|$|For {{the case}} of flutter analysis, lift history for the motion {{obtained}} from the Wagner analysis (Herbert A. Wagner) with varying frequency of oscillation shows that magnitude of <b>lift</b> <b>decreases</b> and a phase lag develops between the aircraft motion and the unsteady aerodynamic forces.

When a fixed-wing aircraft exceeds its critical angle of attack the entire aircraft loses lift and enters a condition called a stall. The usual results of a fixed-wing stall are {{a sharp drop in}} aircraft altitude and a dive. Stalls in fixed-wing aircraft are virtually always a recoverable event.|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{actuators}} gained popularity {{during the}} change of the millennium {{for their ability to}} induce airflow and reattach stalled flow. Since then, investigations have been conducted to characterize their performance and extend their applications. Plasma actuators can be used to increase <b>lift,</b> <b>decrease</b> drag, and increase the efficiency of wind turbines. Phase locked ensemble averaging particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to determine the induced velocity field and characterize actuator behavior and performance. However, very few studies account for particle charging from dusty plasma theory. Particle charging theories for high pressure plasmas predict a mostly linear trend between charge and particle size, with smaller particles charging less. In this work, PIV experiments were conducted with monodisperse nanoparticles for sizes ranging between 300 nm and 1250 nm. Results showed that smaller particles follow the flow more closely. PIV uncertainty quantification was performed for ensemble averaging processing. A weighted linear fit was applied to each vector and extrapolated to the 0 nm particle speed, which is taken as the true air speed. Stokes drag force fields were calculated using the known velocity difference, and using a force balance calculation the electrostatic force acting on the particles was calculated. The electrostatic force near the actuator electrode was always acting upstream, implying that particles can attain either negative or positive charge, depending on the phase...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an overview {{on the results}} obtained during the spoiler noise wind tunnel test conducted in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. The scope of this test was to identify and rank order the effectiveness of different techniques for spoiler noise reduction such as e. g. spoiler side edge fences or fractal spoilers. Noise tests were conducted on a scaled high lift system with one spoiler deployed. The results presented in this report indicate that the most effective device in terms of noise reduction is a splitter plate that retains the original fixed wing trailing edge and therefore shields the spoiler generated noise with respect to noise radiation towards the ground. The noise reduction potential of spoiler side edge fences {{was determined to be}} in the order of 2 dB while fractal spoilers provide a noise reduction potential of about 1 dB. From the aerodynamic point of view all tested spoiler configurations without splitter plate provide a lift degradation of about 0. 5 *CL and a drag increase of about 0. 10 to 0. 12 *CD. By application of a splitter plate the <b>lift</b> <b>decrease</b> is reduced to about 0. 4 *CL while the drag increase remains in the order of 0. 10 *CD.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} performed {{as part of}} the NASA Lewis support of a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aircraft accident investigation. The study was focused on the performance degradation associated with ice contamination on the wing of a commercial turbo-prop-powered aircraft. Based upon the results of an earlier numerical study conducted by the authors, a prominent ridged-ice formation on the subject aircraft wing was selected for detailed flow analysis using 2 -dimensional (2 -D), as well as, 3 -dimensional (3 -D) Navier-Stokes computations. This configuration was selected because it caused the largest <b>lift</b> <b>decrease</b> and drag increase among all the ice shapes investigated in the earlier study. A grid sensitivity test was performed to find out the influence of grid spacing on the lift, drag, and associated angle-of-attack for the maximum lift (C(sub lmax)). This study showed that grid resolution is important and a sensitivity analysis is an essential element of the process in order to assure that the final solution is independent of the grid. The 2 -D results suggested that a severe stability and control difficulty could have occurred at a slightly higher angle-of-attack (AOA) than the one recorded by the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). This stability and control problem was thought to have resulted from a decreased differential lift on the wings with respect to the normal loading for the configuration. The analysis also indicated that this stability and control problem could have occurred whether or not natural ice shedding took place. Numerical results using an assumed 3 -D ice shape showed an increase of the angle at which this phenomena occurred of about 4 degrees. As it occurred with the 2 -D case, the trailing edge separation was observed but started only when the AOA was very close to the angle at which the maximum lift occurred...|$|E

40|$|DLR’s {{contribution}} to the ﬁrst AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop (HiLiftPW- 1) covers computations of all three scheduled test cases for the NASA trapezoidal wing in high lift conﬁguration. The DLR ﬁnite volume code TAU has been employed as the ﬂow solver. In a standard set-up the one-equation turbulence model of Spalart and Allmaras in the original formulation is used to model eﬀects of turbulence. For selected grids and ﬂow conditions, the k-ω SST model of Menter and a diﬀerential Reynolds stress model (SSG/LLR-ω) developed by DLR have been considered. DLR contributed with two hybrid unstructured grid families to the workshop. The grids have been generated with the grid generation packages Centaur and Solar. A grid family with three Solar grids has been generated and provided to the workshop featuring grids of 12 · 10 ^ 6, 37 · 10 ^ 6, and 111 · 10 ^ 6 points for test case 1. In addition, a Solar grid of 37 · 10 ^ 6 points has been provided for test case 2, and a grid of 40 · 10 ^ 6 for the conﬁguration including the slat and ﬂap brackets (test case 3). DLR didn’t succeed in generating a ﬁne-grid with the Centaur package. In order to complete a Centaur grid family with three grid levels an extra-coarse grid has been provided. Thus, the three levels of the Centaur grid family are realized by grids of 13 · 10 ^ 6, 16 · 10 ^ 6, and 32 · 10 ^ 6 points. In general a go o d agreement between the experimental evidence and the polar computations on the Solar and Centaur grids is found in terms of forces, moments and wing pressure distributions. The wing tip area with the rearward part of the main wing and the ﬂap represents the most challenging part of the conﬁguration, especially at angles of attack around maximum lift. The deviations between the TAU solutions and the experimental data {{in this area are}} only weakly inﬂuenced by the different grid topologies or turbulence models used. The inﬂuence of the grid resolution of both grid families is comparable, taking into account the different absolute resolution levels of both grid families. Including the slat and ﬂap brackets leads to the expected <b>lift</b> <b>decrease.</b> Concerning the convergence properties, a strong dependence on the numerical start-up procedure has been detected in many of the computations at higher angles of attack...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of this {{research}} was to reduce the flow separation and therefore the pressure drag generated by a wing section, through the adding of surface modifications. The modifications consisted of roughening the surface of polystyrene airfoils using a sand blasting technique, which resulted in a dimpled surface. This idea originated from the design of a golf ball, as the dimples are known to delay flow separation which allows the ball to travel further. In relation to wing design, there has been very little research available that either proved or dismissed the theory of using a roughened airfoil surface to reduce the pressure drag created by flow separation. Therefore three types of airfoils were tested, the NACA 0006, 0024 and 4424 profiles. Different levels of surface roughness, created by the dimples, were applied to various portions and sides of the airfoils. These were in turn tested on the three airfoil types, including a series of tests with a split flap configuration and the use of end-plates to reduce the induced drag component. The wind tunnel testing was conducted up to a flow velocity of 23 m/s, which led to a maximum Re of 321, 227 and 588, 141 for the single and split flap airfoil testing respectively. The overall research was split into two phases, where in each phase a force measurement system was designed in conjunction with a series of experimental tests. Therefore, during Phase 2 of the research, a new external strain gauge balance (System 2) was developed specifically for the DCU wind tunnel and with the nature of the testing in mind. This followed on from the previous design (System 1) which had certain measurement errors and design inadequacies. Aside from the improved mechanical design of System 2, strain gauge amplifier circuits and a data acquisition system were also developed. The resulting set-up was very sensitive and stable, which was necessary for the low drag and lift forces involved, with a sensitivity of 0. 71 N/V corresponding to a minimum load response of approximately 0. 0007 N, with respect to the slightly more sensitive drag measurement. Therefore, the design of the force measurement system was the main aim of this research. As a result, it was necessary to validate the design with extensive experimental testing, which formed the secondary aim of the research. The resulting dimples patterns tested promoted less flow separation in particular tests, however these dimples were also found to {{have a negative effect on}} lift generation. An important finding also was that in some of the tests the dimple patterns created an increase in the lift force. In addition, large aerodynamic instabilities were observed in tests where dimples were applied to the frontal sections (< 0. 33 c point) of the airfoils, on their low pressure side. By adding a high level of surface roughness (high Ra) via the dimples, to the middle and last 1 / 3 rd sections on the low pressure (flow separation) side of a NACA 0024 airfoil, from 10 ° angle of attack onwards the drag force generated compared to the baseline (unmodified smooth airfoil) decreased. However, the lift force also decreased from approximately 8 ° onwards and at 20 ° there was a drag decrease of 11. 15 % and a <b>lift</b> <b>decrease</b> of 8. 46 %. This therefore led to an overall marginal increase in the aerodynamic efficiency of 3. 13 %. Overall, the effects varied depending on the airfoil test configuration, the surface modification and the angle of attack.

Methods: Barefoot quasi-static stance pressure measurements were taken during double limb stance (n= 22). Four forefoot lift (i. e. metatarsal head (MTH) and corresponding phalanges) conditions at three heights (4, 8, 12 mm) elevated the forefoot. A barefoot condition with no forefoot lift served as the control. Maximum mean pressure was measured for each test condition. All findings are compared to the no forefoot lift condition. Findings: The 1 st MTH forefoot lift increased pressure at the 1 st MTH while the 3 rd- 5 th MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> <b>decreased</b> pressure at the 1 st MTH. The 1 st- 2 nd MTH forefoot lift resulted in no change in pressure at the 1 st MTH, but the 2 nd MTH forefoot lift increased pressure at the 2 nd MTH. The 1 st MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> <b>decreased</b> pressure at 3 rd- 5 th MTHs and the 3 rd- 5 th MTH forefoot lift increased pressure at the 3 rd- 5 th MTHs. Interpretation: Orthotic forefoot lifts can be used to redistribute plantar pressures in the foot during double limb stance. The results of this study will be helpful in predicting lift height and position necessary to offload particular areas. Clinical Relevance: This research provides evidence-based practices in orthotic forefoot lifts. Clinicians can use the included table to predict plantar pressure reductions to certain areas of the foot. By using the table a percent decrease in pressure can be calculated based on a 25 subject population. Géza F. Kogle...|$|R

To ensure that the flow is 2 -D, PIV measurements were performed. A strong suction effect on the lower surface at an angle of attack of 0 ^o at the smallest ground clearance caused laminar separation well ahead of the trailing edge.

In Chapter 1, we introduce basic graph theory concepts and preliminary definitions. In Chapters 2 and 3, we investigate the graph modification of edge removal. In Chapter 2, we characterize graphs for which the removal of any arbitrary edge increases the total domination number. We also begin the investigation of graphs for which the removal of any arbitrary edge {{has no effect on}} the total domination number. In Chapter 3, we continue this investigation and determine the minimum number of edges required for these graphs. The contents of Chapters 2 and 3 have been published in Discrete Applied Mathematics [15] and [16]. In Chapter 4, we investigate the graph modification of edge addition. In particular, we focus our attention on graphs for which adding an edge between any pair of nonadjacent vertices has no effect on the total domination number. We characterize these graphs, determine a sharp upper bound on their total domination number and determine which combinations of order and total domination number are attainable. 10 11 We also study claw-free graphs which have this property. The contents of this chapter were published in Discrete Mathematics [20]. In Chapter 5, we investigate the graph modification of vertex removal. We characterize graphs for which the removal of any vertex changes the total domination number and find sharp upper and lower bounds on the total domination number of these graphs. We also characterize graphs for which the removal of an arbitrary vertex has no effect on the total domination number and we further show that they have no forbidden subgraphs. The contents of this chapter were published in Discrete Applied Mathematics [14]. In Chapters 6 and 7, we investigate the graph modification of edge lifting. In Chapter 6, we show that there are no trees for which every possible edge <b>lift</b> <b>decreases</b> the domination number, and we characterize trees for which every possible edge lift increases the domination number. The contents of Chapter 6 were published in the journal Quaestiones Mathematicae [17]. In Chapter 7, we show that there are no trees for which every possible edge <b>lift</b> <b>decreases</b> the total domination number and that there are no trees for which every possible edge lift leaves the total domination number unchanged. We characterize trees for which every possible edge lift increases the total domination number. At the time of the writing of this thesis, the contents of Chapter 7 have been published online in the Journal of Combinatorial Optimization [18] and will appear in print in a future issue...|$|R
