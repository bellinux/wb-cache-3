40|$|Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is {{secreted}} {{from the}} parathyroid glands {{in response to}} low plasma calcium levels. Besides its classical actions on bone and kidney, PTH may have other important effects, including metabolic effects, as suggested for instance by increased prevalence of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, secondary hyperparathyroidism {{may contribute to the}} metabolic derangements that characterize states of vitamin D deficiency. PTH has been shown to induce adipose tissue lipolysis, but the details of the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of PTH have not been described. Here we used primary mouse adipocytes to show that intact PTH (1 - 84) as well as the N-terminal fragment (1 - 37) acutely stimulated lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the C-terminal fragment (38 - 84) was without lipolytic effect. The <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of PTH was paralleled by phosphorylation of known protein kinase A (PKA) substrates, i. e. hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin. The phosphorylation of HSL in response to PTH occurred at the known PKA sites S 563 and S 660, but not at the non-PKA site S 565. PTH-induced lipolysis, as well as phosphorylation of HSL at S 563 and S 660, was blocked by both the PKA-inhibitor H 89 and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL- 12330 A, whereas inhibitors of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (PKB), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Ca(2 +) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) had little or no effect. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) strongly potentiated the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of PTH, whereas inhibition of PDE 3 had no effect. Our results show that the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of PTH is mediated by the PKA signaling pathway with no or minor contribution of other signaling pathways and, furthermore, that the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of PTH is limited by simultaneous activation of PDE 4. Knowledge of the signaling pathways involved in the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of PTH is important for our understanding of how metabolic derangements develop in states of hyperparathyroidism, including vitamin D deficiency...|$|E

40|$|Zingerone is a {{non-volatile}} pungent compound mostly {{found in}} ginger {{which is a}} herbal medicine used for various purposes. The anti-obesity actions of ginger and zingerone have also been documented. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of zingerone on adipocyte lipolysis in adipocytes isolated from Normal Pellet Diet (NPD) -fed rats and High Fat Diet (HFD) -fed rats. Adipocyte suspensions were prepared from the epididymal fat pads of male Wistar rats by using the collagenase digestion method. The concentrations of Free Fatty Acid (FFA) in the incubation media were used as an index of adipocyte lipolysis. Zingerone at the concentration of 1, 000 M significantly increased both basal lipolysis and isoprenaline (0. l M) -induced lipolysis in adipocytes derived from the NPD-fed rats with the FFA concentrations of 682. 9237. 00 M mL - 1 Packed Cell Volume (PCV) / h and 1, 361. 5162. 90 M mL - 1 PCV/ h, respectively (p - 1 PCV/ h (p< 0. 05; n = 4) in adipocytes derived from the HFD-fed rats.

40|$|Surfactant {{synthesis}} {{is critically}} {{dependent on the}} availabil-ity of fatty acids. One fatty acid source may be circulating triglycerides that are transported in VLDL, and hydrolyzed to free fatty acids by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). To evaluate this hypothesis, we incubated immortalized or primary rat alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells with VLDL. The cells were observed to surface bind, internalize, and degrade VLDL, a process that was induced by exogenous LPL. LPL induction of lipoprotein uptake significantly increased the rates of choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PC) and di-saturated PC, and these effects were associated with a three-fold increase in {{the activity of the}} rate-regulatory enzyme for PC synthesis, cytidylyltransferase. Compared with native LPL, a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase with the catalytically inactive carboxy-terminal domain of LPL did not activate CT despite inducing VLDL uptake. A variant of the fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase with the cat-alytically inactive carboxy-terminal domain of LPL that par-tially blocked LPL-induced catabolism of VLDL via LDL receptors also partially blocked the induction of surfactant synthesis by VLDL. Taken together, these observations sug-gest that both the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of LPL and LPL-induced VLDL catabolism via lipoprotein receptors might play an integral role in providing the fatty acid substrates used in surfactant phospholipid synthesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Secretin, a {{classical}} gastrointestinal hormone released from S cells {{in response to}} acid and dietary lipid, regulates pleiotropic physiological functions, such as exocrine pancreatic secretion and gastric motility. Subsequent to recently proposed revisit on secretin's metabolic effects, we have confirmed <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of secretin during starvation and discovered a hormone-sensitive lipase-mediated mechanistic pathway behind. In this study, a 12 wk high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to secretin receptor-knockout (SCTR(-/-)) mice and their wild-type (SCTR(+/+)) littermates revealed that, despite similar food intake, SCTR(-/-) mice gained significantly less weight (SCTR(+/+) : 49. 6 +/- 0. 9 g; SCTR(-/-) : 44. 7 +/- 1. 4 g; P< 0. 05) and exhibited lower body fat content. These SCTR(-/-) mice have corresponding alleviated HFD-associated hyperleptinemia and improved glucose/insulin tolerance. Further analyses indicate that SCTR(-/-) have impaired intestinal fatty acid absorption while having similar energy expenditure and locomotor activity. Reduced fat absorption in the intestine is further supported by lowered postprandial triglyceride concentrations in circulation in SCTR(-/-) mice. In jejunal cells, transcript and protein levels of a key fat absorption regulator, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD 36), was reduced in knockout mice, while transcript of Cd 36 and fatty-acid uptake in isolated enterocytes was stimulated by secretin.

40|$|Lys-γ 3 -MSH is a melanocortin peptide {{derived from}} the C-terminal of the 16  kDa {{fragment}} of POMC. The physiological role of Lys-γ 3 -MSH is unclear, although it has previously been shown that, although not directly steroidogenic, it can act to potentiate the steroidogenic response of adrenal cortical cells to ACTH. This synergistic effect appears to be correlated with an ability to increase the activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and therefore the rate of cholesterol ester hydrolysis. Ligand binding {{studies have suggested that}} high-affinity binding sites for Lys-γ 3 -MSH exist in the adrenal gland {{and a number of other}} rat tissues that express HSL, including adipose, skeletal muscle and testes. To investigate the hypothesis that Lys-γ 3 -MSH may play a wider role in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, we tested the effect of Lys-γ 3 -MSH on lipolysis, an HSL-mediated process, in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. In comparison with other melanocortin peptides, Lys-γ 3 -MSH was found to be a potent stimulator of lipolysis.

40|$|It {{has never}} been clearly shown that {{endogenous}} corticotrophin (ACTH) affects the release of storage fat. Desbals, Desbals & Agid (1970) observed significant mobilization of lipid {{within a few hours}} of ablation of the adrenal glands in the rabbit; this response was pre-vented by hypophysectomy and could be restored by administration of ACTH. A possible extra-adrenal action of endogenous ACTH on adipose tissue was postulated from these results, but the experimental conditions were very different from those found in normal animals. This study was undertaken to investigate the physiological role of ACTH in the mobilization of fat in the rabbit. The rabbit was selected because of the extreme sensitivity of its adipose tissue to the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of ACTH and its very slight responsiveness towards the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of catecholamines in vivo (Desbals et al. 1970; Kumon, Hara & Takahashi, 1976) and in vitro (Muhlbachova, Misekova, Wenkeova & Wenke, 1973; Lafontan & Agid, 1976).

Twelve subjects were heterozygous for the 164 Ile variant. The fat cells of Ile carriers displayed a 6 fold increase (P= 0. 02) in the lipolytic EC 50 of terbutaline (a selective β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist), but {{no change in the}} <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of dobutamine (a selective β 1 -adrenoceptor agonist), compared with the Thr carriers. Maximum adrenoceptor agonist stimulated lipolysis did not differ between Thr and Ile carriers. The influence of two other polymorphisms (Arg 16 Gly and Gln 27 Glu) in the β 2 -adrenoceptor gene was considered. Six 164 Ile carriers also carried the 16 Gly and 27 Glu alleles. The latter combination occurred among 105 of the 164 Thr carriers. For the 16 Gly 27 Glu subgroup, the EC 50 of terbutaline was about 10 fold higher in 164 Ile as than in 164 Thr carriers (P= 0. 02) but {{there was no difference between}} genotypes in maximum terbutaline action. There was no difference between groups in dobutamine action. In conclusion, the 164 Ile variant of the β 2 -adrenoceptor is associated with a decreased native adipocyte receptor function, as evidenced by a marked increase in the half maximal effective concentration of the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of a selective β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist. This suggests that genetic variance in the β 2 -adrenoceptor gene might be important for catecholamine function in humans, at least as far as adipocyte lipolysis is concerned...|$|E

40|$|Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the {{predominant}} lipase effector of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. HSL-dependent lipolysis {{in response to}} catecholamines is mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) -dependent phosphorylation of perilipin A (Peri A), an essential lipid droplet (LD) -associated protein. It is believed that perilipin phosphorylation {{is essential for the}} translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the LD, a key event in stimulated lipolysis. Using adipocytes retrovirally engineered from murine embryonic fibroblasts of perilipin null mice (Peri–/– MEF), we demonstrate by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy that up to 50 % of cellular HSL is LD-associated in the basal state and that PKA-stimulated HSL translocation is fully supported by adenoviral expression of a mutant perilipin lacking all six PKA sites (Peri A 1 – 6). PKA-stimulated HSL translocation was confirmed in differentiated brown adipocytes from perilipin null mice expressing an adipose-specific Peri A 1 – 6 transgene. Thus, PKA-induced HSL translocation was independent of perilipin phosphorylation. However, Peri A 1 – 6 failed to enhance PKA-stimulated lipolysis in either MEF adipocytes or differentiated brown adipocytes. Thus, the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action(s)</b> of HSL at the LD surface requires PKA-dependent perilipin phosphorylation. In Peri–/– MEF adipocytes, PKA activation significantly enhanced the amount of HSL that could be cross-linked to and co-immunoprecipitated with ectopic Peri A. Notably, this enhanced cross-linking was blunted in Peri–/– MEF adipocytes expressing Peri A 1 – 6. This suggests that PKA-dependent perilipin phosphorylation facilitates (either direct or indirect) perilipin interaction with LD-associated HSL. These results redefine and expand our understanding of how perilipin regulates HSL-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes...|$|R

In obese patients, versus normal subjects, a trend towards lower values was found in GLUT 4 protein or mRNA, although the differences were not statistically significant; insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was higher and cells {{did not respond to}} GLP- 1, while both exendins (10 - 10 and 10 - 9 M) exerted an inhibitory action; basal lipolysis was higher and so was the effect of GLP- 1 and glucagon, whereas insulin abolished the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of all peptides; both basal lipogenesis and the response to insulin were higher while GLP- 1 and exendin- 4 were ineffective.

Retroviral transfection of 3 T 3 -F 442 A preadipocytes was used to increase expression of Stra 13, Stat 3, and Stat 5 a. Only Stat 5 a transfection increased the expression of adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha, and adipose protein 2 /fatty acid-binding protein in response to GH, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Transfection with constitutively active Stat 3 and Stat 5 a revealed that constitutively active Stat 5 a but not Stat 3 was able to replace the GH requirement for adipogenesis. Constitutively active Stat 5 a but not Stat 3 was able to increase the formation of lipid droplets and expression of alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase toward levels seen in mature adipocytes. Constitutively active Stat 5 a was also able to increase the expression of transcripts for C/EBPalpha to similar levels as GH, and of C/EBPbeta, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and adipose protein 2 /fatty acid-binding protein transcripts to a lesser extent.

The subjects were categorized as having either high or low isoprenaline sensitivity. The former group had a 50 % reduced in vivo lipolytic response to exercise and mental stress, despite a 50 % increased plasma noradrenaline response (P < 0. 01) and a 350 % increased plasma adrenaline response (P < 0. 02). In fat cells the lipolytic ED 50 values for noradrenaline and terbutaline (BAR 2 agonist) were 10 times lower (P < 0. 001) in low-sensitive subjects, but the maximum <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of these agents (and of isoprenaline) were similar in both groups. The action on lipolysis of dobutamine (BAR 1 agonist), forskolin (stimulating adenylate cyclase), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (activating protein kinase), clonidine (alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist), or phenyl isopropyladenosine (adenosine receptor agonist) were almost identical in high- and low-sensitivity subjects. ED 50 for isoprenaline correlated with ED 50 for terbutaline (r = 0. 75), but not with ED 50 for dobutamine.

Catecholamine concentrations were similarly elevated in women and men during each infusion: Epi, 182 – 197 pg/ml and NE, 417 – 507 pg/ml. There was a significant sex difference in glycerol rate of appearance and rate of disappearance with the catecholamine infusions (P < 0. 0001), mainly due to a significantly greater glycerol turnover during the first 30 min of each infusion: glycerol rate of appearance during Epi was only 268 ± 18 vs. 206 ± 21 μmol/min in women and men, respectively; during NE, only 173 ± 13 vs. 153 ± 17 μmol/min, and during Epi+NE, 303 ± 24 vs. 257 ± 21 μmol/min. No sex differences were observed in glucose kinetics under any condition. In conclusion, these data suggest that women are more sensitive to the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of catecholamines, but have no difference in their glucoregulatory response. Thus the lower catcholamine levels observed in women vs. men during exercise and other metabolic perturbations may allow women to maintain a similar or greater level of lipid mobilization while minimizing changes in glucose turnover...|$|E
40|$|Attempts to isolate, free of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the peptide(s) {{responsible}} for the lipolytic activity of a fraction of acetone-dried human pituitary powder are described. It was not found possible to separate the lipolytic and TSH activities, even by isoelectric focusing which gave fractions consisting predominantly of single protein components. In the four lipolytic fractions isolated by electrofocusing, the two activities paralleled one another. It is therefore concluded that the TSH present is {{responsible for}} the lipolytic activity of this human pituitary fraction, though some evidence suggests that luteinizing hormone (LH), which is a minor contaminant, might also be lipolytic. The minimum effective lipolytic concentration of the most potent fraction isolated was in the range 0 =. - 1 =. =m/ml. This is far in excess of plasma con-centrations of TSH or LH encountered physiologically. Hence the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of these molecules is unlikely to be of physiological significance...|$|E
40|$|Adipose tissue stores {{energy in}} the form of triglycerides. The ability to {{regulate}} triglyceride synthesis and breakdown based on nutrient status (e. g., fed versus fasted) is critical for physiological homeostasis and dysregulation of this process can contribute to metabolic disease. Whereas much is known about hormonal control of this cycle, transcriptional regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF 15) is critical for the control of adipocyte lipid turnover. Mice lacking Klf 15 in adipose tissue (AK 15 KO) display decreased adiposity and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Mechanistic studies suggest that adipose KLF 15 regulates key genes of triglyceride synthesis and inhibits <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action,</b> thereby promoting lipid storage in an insulin-dependent manner. Finally, AK 15 KO mice demonstrate accelerated lipolysis and altered systemic energetics (e. g., locomotion, ketogenesis) during fasting conditions. Our study identifies adipose KLF 15 as an essential regulator of adipocyte lipid metabolism and systemic energy balance...|$|E

The porcine-type strains were more proteolytic on casein and gelatin than were human strains, which were primarily of biotype II. Porcine strains were also elastolytic. Using supernatant fluids of broth cultures, the biotype II strains, but not the type III strains, were <b>lipolytic</b> in <b>action</b> on triolein. Both types of staphylococci were similar in enzymatic activities on Tween 80, egg yolk, and tributyrin. Elastase activity was not found in broth supernatant fluid of these bacteria. The porcine strains were retarded or inhibited from growing in media at pH 5. 5.

40|$|Exercise is {{a potent}} {{physiological}} stimulus for growth hormone (GH) secretion with circulating GH concentrations peaking approximately 30 min after the onset of exercise and remaining elevated for up to 2 h after exercise cessation. Growth hormone concentrations, both at rest {{and in response to}} exercise, decline with ageing. The significarice of this decline {{and the role of the}} GH response to exercise have not been fully elucidated and this thesis aimed to further understanding in this area. Firstly, this thesis focused on the reproducibility of the GH response to resistance exercise with the aim of determining the appropriateness of this exercise model as a GH stimulus to be used throughout the thesis. GH responses were smaller than previously reported to resistance exercise and a iarge systematic bias in peak GH response was observed for trial order (- 4. 3 (2. 4) Jlg. r 1), highlighting the need for familiarisation. The second study involved determining whether the decrease in GH response to exercise seen with ageing was of the same magnitude across several different exercise stimuli and which of these stimuli resulted in the largest GH response. In men aged 1825 and 40 - 50 years old, endurance exercise elicited a greater GH response than sprint or resistance exercise (young: 842 (616) lIS. 531 (346) lIS. 268 (371); Early middle aged: 177 (137), lIS. 8 ~ (53), lIS. 75 (127) ug. r 1. 120 min- 1 responses to endurance, sprint, resistance respectively). The GH response to both sprint and endurance exercise was smaller in the older age group compared to the younger group, with no differences, reported between groups in response to resistance exercise. An analysis of the overall hormone response to the 3 different exercise bouts in the young participants was also. undertaken, revealing a coordinated hormone response to the varying demands of the different exercise modes investigated. The final studies used pegvisomant to block GH action in order to investigate the effects on metabolism before, during, and post-exercise. Surprisingly, considering the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of GH at rest, an increase in fat oxidation was observed during exercise when GH action was limited (CON lIS.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the variability of}} in vitro adipocyte culture for different applications in basic research and developments towards clinical application. Conventional 2 -D monolayer culture is useful for the investigation of mechanism on the cellular and molecular level. Thereby, {{the choice of the}} cell source is essential. The 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocyte cell line is a well established culture system, but its use is limited, particularly in clinical applications. ADSCs are an alternative cell culture model to further approach human conditions. In this thesis, a standardized isolation and culture procedure of ADSCs was established leading to a highly differentiated adipocyte culture. By utilizing the established culture systems with 3 T 3 -L 1 and ADSCs, it was clarified that the fat reducing effect after injection of Lipostabil® are caused by cell-lysing and not receptor-mediated <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions.</b> Adipocyte cell culture is particularly used in basic research. In the last decades, many 2 -D in vitro studies contributed to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of adipogenesis. However, the influence of the surrounding tissue architecture on adipocyte development is not well characterized. In this thesis, a complex interplay of collagens and adipogenesis was shown. Particularly collagen XVI was downregulated during in vitro adipogenesis and it is supposed to play a functional role in this process. Moreover, this thesis showed the importance of a 3 -D adipocyte culture system when investigating the surrounding architecture. The appropriate collagen organization appeared to be more relevant in a 3 -D tissue-like context for adipocyte development. 3 -D adipocyte culture systems are not only essential for basic research purposes, but also for clinical approaches. The improvement of adipose tissue engineering for use in reconstructive surgery requires suitable scaffold biomaterials. A new PEG-based hydrogel developed by our group was suggested to be an appropriate scaffold for adipose engineering. The gel provided a suitable environment that directed adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, functionalization of the gel with degradation sites promoted the development of coherent adipose tissue-like structures. Once placed at the application site, it is assumed that the gel is degraded by cell-secreted proteases. Thereby, the degradation rate is spatially and temporarily synchronized with the deposition of ECM. Although future in vivo experiments have to be carried out, the developed gel system is proposed as a promising scaffold for a variety of applications in regenerative medicine. In conclusion, adipocyte cell culture is an adequate tool for basic research and the development of clinical applications. Whereas 2 -D culture is an easily accessible and widely used model system, 3 -D cell systems open up new possibilities for future research, especially when a tissue-like context is of importance. ...|$|R
40|$|Lipolysis in {{isolated}} fat cells was increased by dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) and adrenaline {{but not by}} cyclic AMP. aH-DBcAMP and 'H-cyclic AMP were incorporated into fat cells to the same extent. Therefore, lack of <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> (free fatty acid release) of cyclic AMP was not due to an inability to {{be incorporated into the}} cells. Adipose tissue was found to contain enough lipase [EC 3. 1. 1. 3] (ediol hydrolyzing activity) to elicit lipolysis {{even in the absence of}} lipolytic agents, such as adrenaline and DBcAMP. The amount of lipase did not increase, even in the presence of these lipolytic substances. Fat cells were disrupted in a hypotonic medium and lipid micelles were collected by centrifugation. These lipid micelles contained lipase and triglyceride. Incubation of these lipid micelles with adrenaline or DBcAMP resulted in marked lipolysis, but only negligible lipolysis was observed in the absence of these agents. Adrenaline and DBcAMP did not stimulate lipolysis in homogenates of lipid micelles...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine deaminase (1 unit/ml) potentiated the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of {{noradrenaline}} in adipocytes {{isolated from}} brown adipose tissue of 1 - and 6 -week-old rats by decreasing the EC 50 (concn. giving 50 % of maximal effect) for noradrenaline by 3 - 4 -fold. With cells from neonatal rabbit tissue, adenosine deaminase {{only had a}} small, non-significant, effect on the EC 50 for noradrenaline. Lipolysis in rat brown adipocytes was inhibited by low concentrations of N 6 -phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA). Rabbit cells were far less sensitive to PIA. PIA, prostaglandin E 1 and nicotinate all inhibited noradrenaline-stimulated respiration in rat brown adipocytes. Hypothyroidism diminished the maximum response of respiration and lipolysis to noradrenaline in rat cells and increased the EC 50 for noradrenaline. Responsiveness of lipolysis to noradrenaline was particularly decreased in hypothyroidism and was partially restored by addition of adenosine deaminase. Lipolysis in cells from hypothyroid rats was {{more sensitive to the}} anti-lipolytic action of PIA. Bordetella pertussis toxin increased lipolysis in the presence of PIA, suggesting an involvement of the Ni guanine-nucleotide-binding protein in the control of brown-adipocyte metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The anti-lipolytic {{effect of}} the {{adenosine}} analogue N 6 -L-phenylisopropyladenosine was studied with rat adipocytes incubated with {{a high concentration of}} adenosine deaminase (0. 5 unit/ml, approx. 2. 5 micrograms/ml) and concentrations of noradrenaline that were equieffective in different physiological states. These studies were performed to compare the fed and starved (24 h) states and to compare a hypothyroid state (induced by feeding propylthiouracil + a low-iodine diet) with the euthyroid state. Starvation increased sensitivity of the cells to the <b>lipolytic</b> <b>action</b> of noradrenaline, while decreasing sensitivity to the antilipolytic action of phenylisopropyladenosine. Hypothyroidism resulted in decreased sensitivity to noradrenaline and increased sensitivity to phenylisopropyladenosine. Studies of the binding of [3 H]phenylisopropyladenosine to adipocyte plasma membranes indicated heterogeneity of binding sites or negative co-operativity in the binding. Starvation did not change [3 H]phenylisopropyladenosine binding to membranes, whereas hypothyroidism caused an unexpected decrease in both the number and affinity of the binding sites. These observations are discussed in terms of the dual regulation of adipose-tissue lipolysis by lipolytic and anti-lipolytic agents...|$|E
40|$|Genistein and {{daidzein}} are soybean derived isoflavones which exert various biological effects. The {{roles of}} these isoflavones in adipocyte metabolism {{have also been}} demonstrated. Our experiments aimed to explore the <b>lipolytic</b> regulating <b>actions</b> of both isoflavones in adipocytes derived from normal pellet diet (NPD) -fed rats and high fat diet (HFD) -fed rats. Adipocyte suspensions were prepared from epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley rats using the collagenase digestion method. Isolated adipocytes were incubated with genistein or daidzein at concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 mM for an hour at 37 °C. In the NPD-group, genistein (0. 1 and 1 mM) and daidzein (only at 1 mM) significantly increased basal lipolysis. Similar lipolytic-stimulating actions of genistein and daidzein were found in adipocytes derived from HFD-fed rats. Isoprenaline-induced lipolysis in the NPD-group was augmented by genistein (1 mM) and daidzein (0. 1 and 1 mM). However, in the HFD-group only 0. 1 mM genistein significantly increased isoprenaline-induced lipolysis whilst daidzein did not affect isoprenaline-induced lipolysis {{at any of the}} concentrations tested. In summary, daidzein and genistein induced a significant increase in basal lipolysis with similar actions in both the NPD-group and HFD-group. However, the isoprenaline-induced lipolytic responses to the isoflavones between these two groups were different. Generally, isoprenaline-treated adipocytes derived from HFD-fed rats were likely to be less responsive to the isoflavones. Further experiments should be performed to explore this difference...|$|R
40|$|Secretin, {{the first}} hormone commencing {{the field of}} endocrinology, has been studied for its {{pleiotropic}} role in the body inclusive of its neuroactive and body water homeostatic and gastrointestinal functions. Yet, the metabolic effect of secretin remains elusive and is being proposed recently for a revisit. Recent discovery from our lab showed an anorectic response for secretin, while its role in lipid homeostasis remains largely unexplored. Exerting functions such as exocrine pancreatic secretion and gastric motility inhibition, intestinal fatty acid induced release of secretin was recently shown to be mediated by CD 36. Fasting related increase in plasma secretin concentration has been proposed {{to be involved in}} lipolysis but evidences regarding <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of secretin remain contradictory. Recent report has suggested that secretin stimulates both lipolysis and lipogenesis in adipose cells. Thus, we hypothesize that secretin modulates lipid homeostasis, which was examined under two opposite, energy deficient and energy excess, conditions. Under energy deficient/starved state, secretin level in circulation and secretin receptor level in epididymal adipose tissue were found to be upregulated. Using secretin receptor knockout (SCTR-/-) and secretin knockout (SCT-/-) mice as controls, it was found that secretin stimulated a dose- and time-dependent lipolysis in vitro and acute lipolysis in vivo. H- 89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, attenuated the lipolytic effects of secretin in vitro, while secretin induced an increase in cAMP dependent PKA activity in vivo. Using western blot analysis, secretin was found to phosphorylate hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) at serine residue 660. Additionally, immunofluorescent studies revealed that secretin stimulated translocation of HSL from cytosol to surface of lipid droplet subsequently leading to lipolysis. Under excess energy condition, when SCTR-/- mice and its littermates SCTR+/+ mice were subjected to high fat diet (HFD) feeding for 3 months, it was found that SCTR-/- mice gained lesser weight. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging revealed that SCTR-/- mice exhibited lower body fat content. Additionally, HFD-associated hyperleptinaemia was alleviated in SCTR-/- mice along with metabolic syndrome as they performed better in insulin and glucose tolerance tests. Continuous monitoring by indirect calorimetry revealed similar food intake, energy expenditure and locomotor activity between SCTR-/- and SCTR+/+ mice. Interestingly, intestinal fatty acid absorption, measured by a noninvasive method, was impaired in HFD-fed SCTR-/- mice. While postprandial triglyceride release was reduced in SCTR-/- mice, it also had a significant reduction in transcript and protein levels of CD 36 and its downstream mediator MTTP. Secretin, when incubated with isolated enterocytes, upregulated the expression of CD 36. In summary, during starvation, secretin stimulates lipolysis through a HSL and PKA mediated pathway. When fed a HFD, SCTR-/- mice is resistant to diet induced obesity due to impaired intestinal lipid absorption. A novel short positive feedback pathway between CD 36 and secretin, functioning to maximize lipid absorption, is also being proposed. Thus for the first time, two independent role of secretin in lipolysis and in intestinal lipid absorption were discovered along with their mechanistic insights. This study paves way for developing new therapeutic strategies against metabolic disorders associated with lipid metabolism. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between and}} within organ {{systems such as}} {{skeletal}} muscle (SkM) and adipose tissue (AT), via immune cell signaling factors (cytokines), may regulate the development of obesity. The increased expression and concentration {{of one of these}} cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 15, has resulted in significant decreases in AT mass in animals, through the existence of an endocrine-like (SkM-blood-AT) axis. Studies further indicate that these IL- 15 -mediated decreases in AT mass can occur through reduced lipid uptake or by increased triglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) and release of degradation products from fat cells. While it is speculated that a similar endocrine axis exists in humans, most studies investigating these IL- 15 and AT interactions are in animal and cell models: the impact of IL- 15 on human AT remains unknown. Therefore, the global aim of this dissertation was to determine if local SkM and subcutaneous (SC) AT IL- 15 sources contribute to circulating IL- 15, and to examine if IL- 15 induces SCAT lipolysis in humans. A secondary aim was to determine if these sources and <b>lipolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of IL- 15 differ between lean (LN) and obese (OB) humans. Healthy LN (n= 10, BMI = 23. 1 ± 1. 9 kg·m⁻², age: 24. 0 ± 3. 7 yr) and OB (n= 10, BMI = 34. 7 ± 3. 5 kg·m⁻², age: 27. 3 ± 9. 1) men and women participated in the two studies presented in this dissertation. In the first study, using microdialysis probes (CMA/ 20 : 100 kDa cutoff dialysis membrane) inserted in SkM and SCAT to sample interstitial IL- 15, and an I. V. catheter to sample plasma IL- 15, we examined local and systemic IL- 15 concentrations and their correlation with SCAT lipolysis. In order to clarify how these correlations might change during exercise, subjects cycled for 1 -hr at 60 % of their heart rate reserve. In the second study using SCAT microdialysis probes, we perfused SCAT with IL- 15 to assess direct IL- 15 lipolytic effects, and to assess if this lipolytic response was different between LN and OB humans. We found that SkM interstitial IL- 15 was not different between LN and OB, but that SCAT interstitial IL- 15 was higher in OB than in LN subjects. Interestingly, SCAT interstitial IL- 15 was positively correlated with SCAT lipolysis. Exercise increased plasma IL- 15 in both LN and OB, and this increase was higher in OB than in LN subjects. Despite the expected exercise-induced increase in SCAT lipolysis, this increase was not different between LN and OB, nor correlated with IL- 15 changes in plasma or SCAT IL- 15. In the second study, we found that IL- 15 resulted in increased lipolysis in LN individuals and suppressed lipolysis in OB individuals. Importantly, both of these responses occurred at concentrations likely to occur in vivo in AT, and occurred without any marked changes in blood flow. Our findings do not support the existence of an IL- 15 endocrine axis in humans, but rather support the possible existence of an uninvestigated IL- 15 autocrine/paracrine axis in human AT. In this paradigm, IL- 15 may be produced in, and act on the same subcutaneous adipose tissue depot. Although we have found apparent differential regulation of SCAT lipolysis by IL- 15 in lean and obese individuals, the extent to which this local axis regulates human body composition remains to be determined.
