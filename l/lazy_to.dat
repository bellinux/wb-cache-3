They think about getting the crew soup but are too <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

They decided that Russians {{would be too}} <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> march along the Danube and cross {{it away from the}} delta, and would prefer the short way along the Black Sea coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river Danube, Vidin. It was garrisoned only because the troops, led by Osman Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{after the}} turnips, {{the earth was}} grown with rice plants. The first rice plants were without husk and kernels. The sweet and honey-like rice flourished seeds abundantly. The people {{consumed}} them {{for a very long}} time. But there are people who became greedy and lazy. They took more rice than they needed for one day's meals. They began to take two, four, eight, and sixteen days' of rice reserves as they were too <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> take rice everyday. Owing to this, many other creatures began to store and hoard the rice. The generation time for rice plants became slower and slower. Usually, it took only one night for the plant to grow and be ready to be consumed, but by the karmic power the plant began to grow more and more slowly. Also the rice grew in kernels and husks, scattered, which the creatures must work, nurse, maintain, harvest, and cook in order to obtain the white rice.|$|E

[...] In 2010, Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J's Foods. According to J's Foods, a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made, but it was declined by Comedy Central. Using it as a prop in a later episode, Stewart referred to Baconnaise as [...] "capitalism's greatest triumph".|$|E

[...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> move forward".|$|E
500|$|The episode explores Leonard's {{background}} {{and that he}} is [...] "essentially a deadbeat dad".

The review spurred an idea for an episode where Leonard would be responsible for dealing with a kid. Powell called the episode's mythology [...] "very bizarre and surreal", but said that they tried to keep the core themes relatable, such as Leonard's relationship with his estranged son. The same day as the episode's original broadcast, a deleted scene from [...] "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] was made available on the official Ugly Americans website. In the half-minute clip, Grimes is shown settling into living his life as a bear.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E

500|$|... “Grunge...became an anti-consumerist {{movement}} {{where the}} less you spent on clothes, the more ‘coolness’ you had.” The style did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R.

[...] The flannel and [...] "...cracked leatherette coats" [...] in the grunge scene were part [...] "...of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. [...] Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the “manufactured image”, often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned.

500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

500|$|After the {{recording}} of [...] "Crazy for You", the soundtrack single for the 1985 coming of age drama Vision Quest, Madonna approached John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to produce another of her self-written songs called [...] "Gambler". Subsequently, the song {{was added to the}} soundtrack of the film, as music producer Phil Ramone felt that it would be appropriate for using in the beginning shots of the film. Madonna explained that the track [...] "is really the girl's point of view, because she's, like, an unstoppable person... She doesn't really need this guy". As the song was recorded on the Geffen label, a commercial issue of the single, in the United States was suppressed, at the request of Madonna's Sire Records management. They feared that commercial availability of another Madonna single would have been detrimental to the other singles from the Like a Virgin album, and the already available, Geffen-distributed, [...] "Crazy for You". Hence [...] "Gambler" [...] was never released, or sent for airplay in the United States. The UK 12" [...] single, contained the Extended Dance Mix, Instrumental Remix, and the song [...] "Nature of the Beach" [...] by Black 'n Blue. [...] The 7" [...] single had the original version, and [...] "Nature of the Beach". The video for [...] "Gambler" [...] is similar to [...] "Crazy for You", with Madonna singing the song along with clips culled from Vision Quest. Madonna filmed her performance on November 22, 1983, at the Big Foot Tavern in Spokane, Washington.

But, according to Victor Lederer, for [...] "shock value, neither [...] tops the Tristan project of 1907 [...] According to Léon Vallas, one of Debussy's early biographers, its 'episodic character... would have been related to the tales of chivalry, and diametrically opposed to the Germanic conception of Wagner.' That Debussy entertained, if only for a few weeks, the idea of writing an opera based on the Tristan legend is quite incredible. He knew Wagner's colossal Tristan und Isolde as well as anyone, and his confidence must have been great indeed if he felt up to treating the subject." [...] However, nothing came of any of these schemes, partly because the rectal cancer which afflicted Debussy from 1909 meant that he found it increasingly hard to concentrate on sustained creative work. Pelléas would remain a unique opera.|$|E
