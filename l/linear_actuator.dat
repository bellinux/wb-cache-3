50|$|There {{are many}} types of motors {{that can be used}} in a <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> system. These include dc brush, dc brushless, stepper, or in some cases, even {{induction}} motors. It all depends on the application requirements and the loads the actuator is designed to move. For example, a <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> using an integral horsepower AC induction motor driving a lead screw can be used to operate a large valve in a refinery. In this case, accuracy and high movement resolution aren't needed, but high force and speed are. For electromechanical linear actuators used in laboratory instrumentation robotics, optical and laser equipment, or X-Y tables, fine resolution in the micron range and high accuracy may require the use of a fractional horsepower stepper motor <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> with a fine pitch lead screw. There are many variations in the electromechanical <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> system. It is critical to understand the design requirements and application constraints to know which one would be best.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The linear {{displacement}} of a mechanical load {{can be carried}} out with several processes by either indirect or direct <b>linear</b> <b>actuators.</b> For long (and possibly unlimited) courses, the direct drives perform better, with the linear induction machines and the synchronous machines being better adapted. For small strokes, electromagnets and voice-coil actuators prove to be the most suitable. This paper focuses primarily on synchronous linear drives. After recalling the main selection criteria for <b>linear</b> <b>actuators,</b> we briefly present the various possible topologies of synchronous actuators. Several examples of linear electrical structures to be developed, especially those at the LESiR facility, as well as their performances are then provided. In particular, we will describe two original structures and their respective performances: a low-cost actuator called "flux-switching", and multi-air gap structures which allow attaining a high specific thrust. Many applications require some <b>linear</b> <b>actuators.</b> Constraints in their design can be of th...|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic actuators, or {{pneumatic}} cylinders, {{are similar}} to hydraulic actuators except they use compressed gas to generate force instead of a liquid. They work similarly to a piston in which air is pumped inside a chamber and pushed out {{of the other side}} of the chamber. Air actuators are not necessarily used for heavy duty machinery and instances where large amounts of weight are present. One of the reasons pneumatic <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> are preferred to other types is the fact that the power source is simply an air compressor. Because air is the input source, pneumatic actuators are able to be used in many places of mechanical activity. The downside is, most air compressors are large, bulky, and loud. They are hard to transport to other areas once installed. Pneumatic <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> are likely to leak and this makes them less efficient than mechanical <b>linear</b> <b>actuators.</b>|$|R
