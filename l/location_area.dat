40|$|Location {{management}} {{deals with}} how to track mobile users within the cellular network. It consists of two basic operations: location update and paging. The total cost of location management {{is the sum of}} the location update cost and the paging cost. There are many location management schemes, <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> and Reporting Centers are two classical and popular location management schemes. To the best of our knowledge, no performance comparison between Reporting Centers and <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> has been reported in the literature. The paper compares the performance of the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme and the Reporting Centers scheme. The motivation for the study is that the <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> can be derived from a given set of reporting centers such that the location update cost difference between the Reporting Centers scheme and the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme is small whereas the paging cost in the Reporting Centers scheme is larger than that in the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme. Given a set of reporting centers, this paper shows how to derive the <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> from the reporting centers, and compares the performance of <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> and Reporting Centers schemes under various mobility models and incoming call arrival rates. Simulation results show that the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme greatly outperforms the Reporting Centers scheme in most cases although the Reporting Centers scheme performs a little bit better than the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme in some extreme cases...|$|R

A combination of a genetic algorithm and the Hopfield neural network is used to find the optimal configuration of <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> in a mobile network. Toward this end, the <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> configuration of the network is modeled so that the general condition of all the chromosomes of each population improves rapidly by the help of a Hopfield neural network. The Hopfield neural network is incorporated into the genetic algorithm optimization process, to expedite its convergence, since the generic genetic algorithm is not fast enough. Simulation results are very promising and they lead to network configurations that are unexpected but ver...|$|R
40|$|The main {{interest}} {{of this work}} is the optimization of the <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> planning in mobile networks. We propose a detailed model for this problem based on a very realistic speciﬁcation. It is recognized {{that the quality of}} service in mobile networks depends on many parameters, among them an op timal <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> planning. Furthermore, for the already deployed networks, it is interesting to provide a logical net works organization. The <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> planning problem is planar graph partitioning with constraints. That’s why, we propose greedy algorithms and genetic algorithms to solve it. The latter algorithms use new operators designed speciﬁcally for the planar graph partitioning problems. Finally, we in vestigate the effectiveness of these algorithms...|$|R

Wehave covered the classic methods, also considering the paging delay as a constraint, for which case,focus is set mainly on the Simplex method and the Lagrange multiplier method to analyze practical cases,providing useful conclusions {{on the design of}} <b>location</b> <b>areas.</b> In particular, making use of the Simplexmethod for the study of deployments of <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> paged sequentially, the first <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> to bepaged should be assigned superior probabilities in order to minimize paging costs, call delivery delaysand even computational costs at the time of applying the Simplex method. Regarding the application ofLagrange multipliers, values around 0. 1 prove to work efficiently for the typical paging costsoptimisation problems and the results obtained show that sequential paging in decreasing order ofprobability brings large savings in the paging costs with affordable delays: for instance, reduction of 50 % in the costs, for a maximum delay of 3 paging steps...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of supporting rapidly {{growing numbers of}} mobile subscribers, while constrained by limited radio spectrum, is being faced by cellular network operators worldwide. The standard technique for cellular networks is to decrease radio cell size, thereby maintaining a supportable subscriber density. However, smaller cell sizes result in increased signalling for location management procedures, which reduces the bandwidth available for user traffic. Location management is an essential function in cellular networks that allows the network to maintain the position of subscribers, in terms of <b>location</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Location</b> <b>areas</b> in current systems, such as GSM, consist of static and arbitrarily-defined collections of cells, which do {{not take into account}} individual subscriber mobility patterns, either in space or time.
