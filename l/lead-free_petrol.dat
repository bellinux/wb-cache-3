50|$|In 1981 Russell-Jones became Medical and Scientific Advisor to CLEAR, The Campaign for Lead-Free Air. In 1982 he {{organized}} {{an international conference}} on the biological effects of low level lead exposure, and the subsequent proceedings, Lead versus Health, were edited with Michael Rutter FRS, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry. In 1983 Russell-Jones gave evidence to the Royal Commission on Environmental pollution whose Ninth report, Lead in the Environment, persuaded the UK Government to introduce <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, by 1979, in {{the face}} of growing {{evidence}} of the harmful effects of lead on children’s behaviour, neuro-cognitive development and IQ, the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) commissioned a report under the Chairmanship of Professor Lawther. The subsequent report, Lead and Health recommended that the lead content of petrol should be reduced from 0.4 to 0.15g/L, but there was no recommendation to introduce <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol.</b> Nor was there any recommendation to lower the lead level deemed safe from 35 microgrammes per decilitre of blood.|$|E

40|$|In this {{experiment}} {{the effects of}} lead and <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol</b> applied at the following doses of: 0, 2, 4 and 6 cm 3 • kg' 1 of soil on growth and development of triticale and biochemical properties of the soil were studied. For detoxication of petrol organic amendment with barley straw was applied. The experiment was performed in two experimental series with and without triticale cover. It was found that soil contamination by petrol adversely affected growth and development of tested crops. Barley straw appeared to be ineffective in detoxication of the contaminated soil. Lead and <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol</b> (irrespective of plant cover and application of straw) adversely affected activity of soil dehydrogenases and urease. Straw application and growing of triticale positively affected biochemical properties of the soil. These positive effects were diminished by petrol, irrespective of the lead addition. Biochemical index of soil fertility calculated {{on the basis of}} enzymatic activity and carbon content was negatively correlated with the level of soil contamination by petrol and positively with triticale yield...|$|E
40|$|Lead (Pb) {{poisoning}} {{of cattle}} {{has been relatively}} common in Australia and sump oil {{has been identified as}} an important cause of Pb toxicity for cattle because they seem to have a tendency to drink it. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>petrol</b> has been available in Australia since 1975, so the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the current risk to cattle from drinking used automotive oils. Sump or gear box oil was collected from 56 vehicles being serviced. The low levels of Pb found suggest that the removal of leaded petrol from the Australian market as a public health measure has benefited cattle by eliminating the risk of acute poisoning from used engine oil...|$|E
40|$|Rape {{methyl ester}} (RME) is a {{suitable}} substitute for mineral diesel in existing compression-ignition engines. Its {{use as an}} alternative transport fuel will result in decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants (particularly SO 2, hydrocarbons and smoke) from this source. However, to encourage such a trend in the UK, the Government needs to adopt the European Union's recommendation of a reduction of excise duties on biofuels to 10 % of the rate applied to <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol</b> to ensure its economic short-term competitiveness in the UK market. Such a subsidy will not be required by the year 2004. The available resource base for rape-seed oil in the UK limits the production of RME, so it could satisfy only up to 4 % of demand on fuel by road vehicles powered by diesel engines in the UK. This suggests {{that it should be}} used preferentially in urban areas and waterways where its environmental benefits would be maximised. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 42 samples of road dust were {{collected}} along ring road, city centre, city side, and freeway in Urumqi, China. Total concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Mn, Be, Co, Zn, and U {{were determined by}} using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry {{in order to assess}} and to compare road dust contamination levels of metals among the four roads. The results show that, among the four categories of roads, mean concentrations of Co and U vary little. City centre locations show strong enrichments of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Be. Along the ring road, the highest mean concentrations were found for Cr, Ni, Mn, and Co. However, the highest concentrations of Zn and U were found along the freeway. The cluster analysis shows that three main groups can be distinguished. Every group may be associated with different main sources and concentrations of the metals. The results of contamination assessment reveal that, among all of the potential toxic metals, Cd, Cu, and Zn pollution were obviously heavier with moderate or high contamination indices for most road dust samples, while Cr, Ni, and Pb contamination were lower along the four categories of roads. Compared with the city side, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn contamination were heavier along the ring road, the city centre, and the freeway with high traffic density. Low Pb contamination or no contamination in all the road dust samples {{may be related to the}} increasing usage of <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol...</b>|$|E
40|$|The European {{legislation}} {{concerning the}} abolition of polluting substances made it necessary for Italy {{to be compliant with}} other Countries standards. These other Countries have been much more organized and have had all the instruments and plans required to eliminate polluting substances created by man work. The analysis for a vapour recovery unit (VRU) is a clear example of how oil companies always try to have an economical feed back even when forced by the law to act in a certain way. Italy started facing the issue of recovering vapours only after the introduction, on the market, of <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol.</b> This kind of petrol contains a wide variety of additives and aromatic substances among which is benzene, that coul all be potentially dangerous for human health. The issues of benzene and industrial pollution have been faced in a confusing and approssimate way. At first the approach was to impose very strict regulation and to apply it in a very short time, later on the approach changed. The law was meant to help different subjects to be compliant with the requirements and to tolerate possible delays. The Italian legislation should have followed the European guidelines in the subject, but never specified the approach that had to be taken and the deadlines that had to be respected. In this case we can talk both of a legislative confusion and of a general misunderstanding on the production level. The Italian oil industry has two very different and important aspects to it. On one hand there are small-medium sized producers that still aren’t compliant with the laws. Most of the times this producers are not really interested in respecting the directives or they try to postpone the expences necessary for being compliant. On the other hand, the big companies have earned experience {{with the same kind of}} plants located abroad. Relying on this experience big companies have provided with getting technically advanced and idoneous plants. This companies try to balance the costs with earnings, in order to cover up, even if partially, the expences for the investment...|$|E
40|$|The Danish air {{pollution}} abatement is based {{by and large}} on emission control. Since the ratification of the international sulfur protocol of 1985, {{there has been a}} continuous tightening of the permissible sulfur content in fuels and of the maximum emissions from power plants. As a consequence, the total annual emission of sulfur dioxide (S 02) has been reduced from 450, 000 tons in the seventies to 180, 000 tons in 1990. This has had a pronounced effect on the S 02 levels in Danish urban areas. Thus, in Copenhagen, the yearly averages have fallen to about 25 %. For nitrogen oxides emitted from the power plants, similar regulations are in force. With this legislation, the most important and crucial source of {{air pollution}} in Danish urban areas is road traffic. The contribution of nitrogen oxides from national traffic accounts for nearly half the total Danish emission and is increasing steadily; this is consistent with an observed increase of nitrogen oxides in ambient air. The permissible levels of lead in petrol has been reduced drastically. After an introduction of reduced tax on <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol,</b> it now accounts for {{more than two-thirds of the}} total consumption. As a result, the concentration of lead in urban ambient air has been reduced to less than one-sixth. The introduction of 3 -way catalytic converters from October 1990 will result in reductions in the emission of a series of pollutants, e. g., lead, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. In 1980, a Danish air quality monitoring program was established as a cooperative effort between the authorities, the Government, the counties, the municipalities, and the Greater Copenhagen Council. Subsequently, the program has been revised with greater emphasis on air,pollution from traffic. The network now includes monitoring of gasses and particulates, generally at curb side. The effects of planned traffic regulations and measures taken are evaluated by use of air quality models. Only a few studies of the relations between air pollution and health have been carried out i...|$|E
40|$|Lead in petrol {{has been}} {{identified}} as a health hazard and attempts are being made to create a lead-free atmosphere. Through an intensive study a review is made of the various options available to the automobile and petroleum industry. The economic and atmospheric penalties coupled with automobile fuel consumption trends are calculated and presented in both graphical and tabulated form. Experimental measurements of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions are also presented for certain selected fuels. Reduction in CO and HC's with the employment of a three-way catalyst is also discussed. All tests were carried out on a Fiat 127 A engine at wide open throttle and standard timing setting. A Froude dynamometer was used to vary engine speed. With the introduction of <b>lead-free</b> <b>petrol,</b> interest in combustion chamber deposits in spark ignition engines has ben renewed. These deposits cause octane requirement increase or rise in engine knock and decreased volumetric efficiency. The detrimental effect of the deposits has been attributed to the physical volume of the deposit and to changes in heat transfer. This study attempts to assess why leaded deposits, though often greater in mass and volume, yield relatively lower ORI when compared to lead-free deposits under identical operating conditions. This has been carried out by identifying the differences in the physical nature of the deposit and then through measurement of the thermal conductivity and permeability of the deposits. The measured thermal conductivity results are later used in a mathematical model to determine heat transfer rates and temperature variation across the engine wall and deposit. For the model, the walls of the combustion cylinder and top are assumed to be free of engine deposit, the major deposit being on the piston head. Seven different heat transfer equations are formulated describing heat flow at each part of the four stroke cycle, and the variation of cylinder wall area exposed to gas mixture is accounted for. The heat transfer equations are solved using numerical methods and temperature variations across the wall identified. Though the calculations have been carried out for one particular moment in the cycle, similar calculations are possible for every degree of the crank angle, and thus further information regarding location of maximum temperatures at every degree of the crank angle may also be determined. In conclusion, thermal conductivity values of leaded and lead-free deposits have been found. The fundamental concepts of a mathematical model with great potential have been formulated and it is hoped that with future work it may be used in a simulation for different engine construction materials and motor fuels, leading to better design of future prototype engines...|$|E
