Four different grid resolutions {{with and without}} coordinate transformation were used for evaluating the grid independence on computational results of the LES approach. Time-averaged velocities, temperatures and pollutant concentrations along the centreline of the vehicular exhaust plume have been calculated for both high and <b>low</b> <b>idling</b> conditions.

Furthermore, the computational work has been extended to investigate the effect of ambient wind conditions (i. e., wind speed and direction) on the flow dynamics and pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a light-duty diesel vehicle for high idling condition. For the low ambient wind speed case, the vehicular exhaust jet plume dominates the flow structures and the pollutant dispersion patterns. On the other hand, for the higher ambient wind speed case, the vortices and turbulence mixing induced by the interaction between the vehicular exhaust jet and the ambient wind dilute the pollutant concentration, while the oblique ambient wind may alter the spreading direction of the vehicular exhaust jet plume.

L., 2006. Large eddy simulation of flow structures and pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a light-duty diesel vehicle. Atmospheric Environment 40, 1104 - 1116] for different rear slant angles (i. e., α= 25 ° and 60 °), stationary (i. e., <b>low</b> and high <b>idling</b> modes) and moving (i. e., vehicle speed modes) vehicle conditions, vehicular exhaust jet exit conditions, and ambient wind conditions (i. e., wind speed and direction) within the urban road microenvironment was investigated comprehensively. Time-averaged flow and pollutant concentration fields behind the studied ground vehicle are calculated. The vehicular exhaust jet plume condition behind the studied ground vehicle dominates the flow pattern and pollutant dispersion at lower vehicle speed and <b>low</b> <b>idling</b> conditions. The vortices and turbulent mixing induced by {{the interaction between the}} vehicular exhaust jet plume, and the ambient wind flow condition behind the studied ground vehicle {{plays an important role in}} dispersing the pollutant concentration at higher vehicle speed and high idling conditions. The increasing of the studied ground vehicle speed restrains the development of the vehicular exhaust jet plume along the downstream direction and quickens the diluting rate of the pollutant concentration behind the studied ground vehicle. The oblique ambient wind flow condition enhances the dilution of pollutant concentration behind the studied ground vehicle along its vehicular exhaust jet plume in the downstream direction. However, a more evident effect of oblique ambient wind flow on dispersing the pollutant concentration behind the studied ground vehicle is found for the lower vehicle speed and <b>low</b> <b>idling</b> cases.

Several techniques have been developed to improve the energy consumption of network devices. As their utilization highly varies over time, the two main techniques for saving energy, namely sleeping and rate adaptation, exploits the lower work-load periods to either put to sleep some hardware elements or adapt the network rate to the actual traffic level. In this paper, we compare two emblematic approaches of these energy-efficient techniques: <b>Low</b> Power <b>Idle</b> and Adaptive Link Rate. Our simulation-based study quantifies the reachable energy savings of these two approaches depending on the traffic characteristics. We show that, with little impact on the Quality of Service and consequent energy savings, <b>Low</b> Power <b>Idle</b> has a clear advantage. On the contrary, ALR is almost always consuming more than LPI and can reach unacceptable QoS levels.

40|$|Abstract — Many {{sensor network}} {{applications}} feature bursty traffic patterns: after {{long periods of}} idle time with almost no network traffic, large amounts of data have to be transmitted reliably and in a timely manner. One example is volcano monitoring [5], where precious high-volume data is generated by rare volcanic eruptions. Unfortunately, existing MAC protocols do not sufficiently support such applications with bursty traffic patterns. CSMA protocols such as WiseMAC or SCP-MAP have very low overhead in idle situations, but have high overhead and low throughput under high load due to collisions. In contrast, TDMA protocols such as LMAC can handle high loads without collision, but have low throughput and significant overhead in idle mode [2].
