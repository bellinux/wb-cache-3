Paper waste sludges with low and high ash content (8. 5 and 46. 7 wt. %) were converted under optimised conditions for temperature and pellet size to maximise both product yields and energy content. Comparison of the gross energy conversions, as {{a combination of the}} bio-oil/tarry phase and char (ECsum), revealed that the fast pyrolysis performance was between 18. 5 % and 20. 1 % higher for the low ash PWS, and 18. 4 % and 36. 5 % higher for high ash PWS, when compared to the slow and vacuum pyrolysis processes respectively.

Mineral matter composition of the coal ash for the four coal seams were similar with SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 jointly accounting {{to a total of}} 92  %– 94  % of ash mass. The coal ash composition in terms of major components, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, CaO, TiO 2, K 2 O and Fe 2 O 3 however varied considerably between the seam M 43 and other three seams, M 2, M 12 and M 24. AFTs of coal ashes of all the four coal seams were very high with IDT greater than 1500  °C. Therefore, it indicates that coal of the four seams of Tentulai Block, Talcher coalfield is good for combustion with very little possibility of ash fusibility. Heat treatment studies of coal samples at different temperatures indicate that the mineral matter present in coal samples get transformed to different phases at different temperatures. New phases like hematite, rutile, mullite and AlPO 4 were formed at 1000  °C. Finally, FactSage thermodynamic modeling studies were carried to corroborate the findings of heat treatment experiments.

Therefore, investigation of chemical and degree of ordered structure present in Turkish lignites is desirable. We report structural information of two coals from the Manisa Soma region, two from the Mugla Yatagan region and one from Kutahya Seyitomer region. FTIR spectra of coal samples contained peaks due to-OH and C=O functional groups, aliphatic-CH,-CH 2,-CH 3 and aromatic C=C and aromatic-CH structures. Coals with higher fixed carbon were oxidized more after oxidation experiments, as evidenced by the higher intensity of the C=O band. Coals that contained higher amounts of nonpolar alkyl and aromatic C-C, C-H groups were affected more by the oxidation reactions, which formed high-intensity C=O band.

40|$|Aim: To study {{physical}} and chemical structures and properties including <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of human adipose tissue in different anatomical location in autopsy-assigned clinical trial. Methods: A pilot {{physical and}} chemical descriptive randomized autopsy-assigned trial. Adipose tissue 252 sampled from 36 individuals at autopsy who between 36 and 63  years old died from road accidents. Interventions: Chemical functional groups and <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> were studied using infrared and atomic adsorptive spectrometries, elemental chemical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Adipose tissue was sampled from the 7 various anatomical locations. Results: The {{highest levels of the}} analysed chemical substancies were found in dense atherosclerotic plaque. Dense atherosclerotic plaque contains the most of metabolic products, organic and inorganic elements. Dense atherosclerotic plaque has the most of <b>calorific</b> <b>value.</b> The <b>lowest</b> <b>calorific</b> capacity has a pararenal fat. Conclusions: Human body lipids serve as a harbor for various organic substances, they may absorb different metabolic products, and they have different calorific capacity depending on their location and forms. Atherosclerotic plaque contains the most of organic and inorganic elements, and brings the highest energy potential...|$|R
40|$|Relatively cheap, poor quality, {{unprepared}} biomass {{materials can}} be difficult to burn efficiently on a large commercial scale because of their variable composition, relatively <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and high moisture contents. Consequently it is often necessary to co-fire these materials with a hydrocarbon support fuel to ensure stable and efficient combustion. Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) is a promising method for burning mixtures of fuels with widely differing individual characteristics although {{there is a need for}} further information on the “optimum” conditions for efficient operation as well as on the proportions of support fuel which should be used in particular applications. This paper is therefore concerned with co-firing of coal with pressed sugar beet pulp, (a solid biomass with an average moisture content of 71 %), in a lab scale (< 25 kW net thermal input) fluidised bed combustor. The project was undertaken in collaboration with British Sugar plc. who operate a large coal-fired fluidised bed, with a nominal thermal rating of 40 MW, to generate hot combustion gases for use in subsequent drying applications. The combustion characteristics of different coal and pressed pulp mixtures were investigated over a wide range of operating conditions. For stable combustion the maximum proportion of pulp by mass in the blended fuel was limited to 50 %. However under these co-firing conditions a fixed bed temperature can be achieved with 20 % lower fluidising air (when compared with coal alone) since evaporation of the moisture in the pressed pulp provides additional cooling of the bed. This reduction in excess air will be beneficial for the output of the full scale plant at British Sugar since at present the flow rate of the fluidising air and hence the amount of coal which can be burnt is limited by high pressure drops in the bed air distributor system. The pressed pulp has relatively low nitrogen levels and hence a further benefit of co-firing is that NOx emissions are reduced by about 25 %. Agglomeration of the bed can be a problem when co-firing biomass because of the formation of “sticky” low melting point alkali metal silicate eutectics which result in subsequent adhesion of the ash and sand particles. Consequently, longer term co-firing tests were undertaken with a 50 / 50 blended fuel by mass. Problems of bed agglomeration were not observed over the duration of these tests and moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies indicated that the levels of alkali metals in the ash were relatively low. British Sugar and the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA...|$|R
