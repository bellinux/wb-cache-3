During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> From this he deduced {{that the number of}} stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, {{in the direction of the}} Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move {{into and out of}} the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E

40|$|We analyse the {{covariance}} of the one-dimensional mass {{power spectrum}} along <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> The covariance reveals {{the correlation between}} different modes of fluctuations in the cosmic density field and gives the sample variance error for measurements of the mass power spectrum. For Gaussian random fields, the covariance matrix is diagonal. As expected, the variance of the measured one-dimensional mass power spectrum is inversely proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> that are sampled from each random field. The correlation between <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> in a single field may alter the covariance.

Using N-body simulations, we find that the covariance matrix of the one-dimensional mass power spectrum is not diagonal for the cosmic density field due to the non-Gaussianity and that the variance is much higher than that of Gaussian random fields. From the covariance, one will be able to determine the cosmic variance in the measured one-dimensional mass power spectrum as well as to estimate how many <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> are needed to achieve a target precision.

With distances of 590 +/- 160 pc and 580 +/- 100 pc, respectively, these two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> are currently among the longest Galactic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with measured D/H. With the addition of these measurements, we see a significant tendency for longer Galactic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> to yield low D/H values, consistent with previous inferences about the deuterium abundance from D/O and D/N measurements. Short <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with H I column densities of log N(H I) 500 pc and log N(H I) > 20. 5, suggest a significantly lower value for the true local-disk gas-phase D/H value, (D/H) _LDg=(0. 85 +/- 0. 09) e- 5. One interpretation of these results is that D is preferentially depleted onto dust grains relative to H and that longer <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> that extend beyond the Local Bubble sample more depleted material.
