Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own <b>local</b> <b>circulation.</b> The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E

40|$|Conceptually, it {{is useful}} to {{partition}} the three-dimensional tropical circulation into meridional and zonal components, namely, the Hadley and Walker circulations. The averaging involved in their definitions can introduce ambiguities. These problems can be circumvented by first partitioning the total vertical mass flux into components associated with overturning in the meridional and zonal directions, respectively, called here the local Hadley and <b>local</b> Walker <b>circulations.</b> Defining the <b>local</b> Hadley and <b>local</b> Walker <b>circulations</b> this way ensures the pair of two-dimensional overturning circulations can be added to give the original three-dimensional circulation, even when the averages are taken over limited domains. The method is applied to the vertical motion from the ERA-Interim reanalysis for the period 1979 to 2009. One important result is that the <b>local</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> responds much more strongly to ENSO than the <b>local</b> Walker <b>circulation,</b> even though the <b>local</b> Walker <b>circulation</b> in the central Pacific weakens during El Niño years and strengthens and widens during La Niña years...|$|R

And the presence of cities cannot change the general state of the sea-land breeze (SLB) circulation and mountain-valley breeze (MVB) circulation but acted to modify these <b>local</b> <b>circulations</b> slightly. Meanwhile, the development of the urban heat island (UHI) circulation was also strongly influenced by the nearby SLB circulation and MVB circulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{detailed}} {{air flow}} characteristics in an urban areas were analyzed using GIS data and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. For this, a building construction algorithm optimized for Geographic Information System (GIS) data with a vector format (Los Angeles region imagery acquisition consortium 2 geographic information system, LARIAC 2 GIS) was used. In the LARIAC 2 GIS data, building vertices were expressed as latitude and longitude. Using the model buildings constructed by the algorithm as the surface boundary data in the CFD model, we performed numerical simulations for two building-congested areas in Los Angeles using inflow information provided by California Air Resources Board. Comparing with the inflow, there was a marked difference in wind speed and direction within the target areas, which was mainly caused by the secondarily induced <b>local</b> <b>circulations</b> such as street-canyon vortices, horse-shoe vortices, and recirculation zones. In street canyons parallel to the inflow direction, wind speed increased due to a channeling effect and, in street canyons perpendicular to the inflow direction, vertically well developed vortices were induced. In front of a building, a horse-shoe vortex was developed near the surface and, behind a building, a recirculation zone was developed. Near the surface in the areas where the secondarily induced <b>local</b> <b>circulations,</b> wind speed remarkably increased. Overall, wind direction little (largely) changed at the areas where wind speed largely increased (decreased) ...|$|R

In this view, any span-wise change in lift is equivalent to a span-wise change of circulation. According to the Helmholtz theorems, a vortex filament cannot begin or terminate in the air.

40|$|Formation {{processes}} of negative (positive) sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the subtropical North and South Pacific {{associated with the}} ENSO warm (cold) events are examined using reanalysis and in-situ observational datasets. During the premature stage of the ENSO warm events, negative SSTAs appear over the subtropical North Pacific in the February–March period and over the subtropical South Pacific after April, and vice versa in the ENSO cold events. One month prior {{to the formation of}} these subtropical negative SSTAs, the negative air humidity anomaly and anomalous downward motion appear at the same location in either the Northern or Southern hemisphere. Associated with these atmospheric anomalies, the strengthened descending branch of <b>local</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> is observed during the January–February period in the Northern hemisphere and after March in the Southern hemisphere, which coincides with the seasonal transition of the climatological <b>local</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> from the Northern to Southern hemisphere. Our linear decomposition analysis of surface heat flux anomalies indicates that the negative air humidity anomaly, as well as anomalies in wind speed, contrib-utes to the formation of the subtropical negative SSTAs through the enhanced latent heat flux induced by the anomalous air–sea humidity di¤erence. These results suggest that the anomalous downward motion associated with the changes in <b>local</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> can induce the subtropical negative SSTAs through the surface hu-midity variability. A possible mechanism for the subtropical air–sea interaction associated with the <b>local</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> is discussed. 1...|$|R
