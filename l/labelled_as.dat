If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E

5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E

5|$|Kosher salt, though refined, {{contains}} no iodine {{and has a}} much larger grain size than most refined salts.

Equation (7) means that, in a T-segment, if {{the total}} {{energy of the}} TF units <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> the first source is {{stronger}} {{than that of the}} TF units <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> the second source, all the TF units in the T-segment are <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> the first source; otherwise, they are <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> the second source. Although this labeling scheme works for nonoverlapped T-segments, it cannot be extended to overlapped T-segments because the labeling of TF units in an overlapped T-segment is not reliable.|$|R

5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns to give them a 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E

5|$|Five large stelae {{were raised}} in 741, {{although}} {{the name of the}} king responsible is illegible on all of them and he has been <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> Ruler Y. Calakmul's presence in the wider Maya area continued to wane, with two of the city's major allies suffering defeats at the hands of Tikal.

5|$|In 2005, a {{campaign}} began {{to register the}} Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This {{would have resulted in}} only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously been extended to Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was not passed into law.|$|E

5|$|Opening to mixed reviews, Manhunter fared poorly at the {{box office}} {{at the time of its}} release, making only $8.6 million in the United States. However, it has been reappraised in more recent reviews and now enjoys a more {{favorable}} reception, as both the acting and the stylized visuals have been appreciated better in later years. Its resurgent popularity, which may be due to later adaptations of Harris' books and Petersen's success in , has seen it <b>labelled</b> <b>as</b> a cult film.|$|E
