5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they had <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself.

There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E

5|$|Pinguinus alfrednewtoni was a larger, {{and also}} flightless, {{member of the}} genus Pinguinus that lived during the Early Pliocene.

5|$|Regardless of {{the impact}} of the {{propaganda}} campaigns, the Catholic immigrants helped to strengthen Diem's support base. Before the partition, most of Vietnam's Catholic population <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. After the borders were sealed, the majority were now under Diem's rule. The Catholics implicitly trusted Diem due to their common faith and were a source of loyal political support. One of Diem's main objections to the Geneva Accords—which the State of Vietnam refused to sign—was that it deprived him of the Catholic regions of North Vietnam, and he had unsuccessfully called for Bui Chu and Phat Diem to be omitted from the communist zone. With entire Catholic provinces moving south en masse, in 1956 the Diocese of Saigon had more Catholics than Paris and Rome. Of Vietnam's 1.45million Catholics, over a million <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south, 55% of whom were northern refugees. Prior to this, only 520,000 Catholics <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dioceses of Saigon and Huế combined.|$|E
