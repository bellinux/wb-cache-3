40|$|This paper {{provides}} an historical review of homarid lobster fisheries, {{the development and}} usage of lobster hatcheries, {{and much of the}} research influenced by hatchery-initiated studies on natural history, physiology, and morphological development of the <b>lobster,</b> <b>Homarus</b> <b>spp.</b> Few commercial <b>lobster</b> hatcheries exist in the world today, yet their potential usage in restocking efforts in various countries is constantly being reexamined, particularly when natural stocks are considered “overfished. ” Furthermore, many individual researchers working on homarid lobsters use smallscale hatchery operations to provide the animals necessary for their work as well as animals reared and provided by various governmental agencies interested in specific projects on larvae, postlarvae, or juveniles. Such researchers can benefi t from the information in this review and can avoid many pitfalls previously documented. The development of hatcheries and the experimental studies that were generated from their activities have had a direct impact on much of the research on lobsters. The past work arising from hatchery operations—descriptions of life stages, behavior, physiology, etc. —has generally been confirmed rather than refuted and has stimulated further research important for an understanding of the life history of homarid lobsters. The connections between homarid fisheries and hatchery operations (i. e. culturing of the lobsters), whether small- or large-scale for field and laboratory research, are important to understand so that better tools for fishery management can be developed. This review tries to provide such connections. However, the rearing techniques in use in today’s hatcheries—most of which are relics from the past—are clearly not effi cient enough for large-scale commercial aquaculture of lobsters or even for current restocking efforts practiced by several countries today. If hatcheries are to be used to supplement homarid stocks, to restock areas that were overfished, or to reintroduce species into their historical ranges, there is a clear need to further develop culture techniques. This review should help in assessments of culturing techniques for <b>Homarus</b> <b>spp.</b> and provide a reference source for researchers or governmental agencies wishing to avoid repeating previous mistakes...|$|R

50|$|The American <b>lobster,</b> <b>Homarus</b> americanus, is {{a species}} of lobster found on the Atlantic coast of North America, chiefly from Labrador to New Jersey. It {{is also known as}} Atlantic lobster, Canadian lobster, true lobster, {{northern}} lobster, Canadian Reds, or Maine lobster. It can reach a body length of 64 cm, and a mass of over 20 kg, making it not only the heaviest crustacean in the world, but also the heaviest of all living arthropod species. Its closest relative is the European <b>lobster</b> <b>Homarus</b> gammarus, which can be distinguished by its coloration and the lack of spines {{on the underside of the}} rostrum.

40|$|Gaffkaemia, {{caused by}} Aerococcus viridans var. homari, causes fatal infections in <b>Homarus</b> <b>spp.</b> (clawed <b>lobsters).</b> Despite its high {{economic}} {{significance to the}} lobster fisheries in the USA and northern Europe, data on its prevalence in captured and wild populations, particularly in Europe, is scarce. Following an outbreak of gaffkaemia in a European lobster holding facility in South Wales (UK), a base-line survey was conducted for gaffkaemia in wild populations of European <b>lobster</b> <b>Homarus</b> gammarus around the coast of England and Wales. In addition, isolates recovered from the original outbreak and the survey were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with previously characterised isolates from the USA, UK and Canada. Locally caught H. gammarus were sampled at 30 sites from around the coast of England and Wales between March 2006 and October 2008. Results confirmed that the prevalence of gaffkaemia in populations of H. gammarus was low, with only 9 positive isolates recovered from 952 samples examined. PFGE analysis showed that the isolates from the outbreak investigation shared the same pulsotype as A. viridans var. homari isolates from the USA, Norway and Canada, {{as well as an}} isolate (NCIMB 1119) reportedly recovered from an outbreak of European lobsters in England in the 1960 s.

40|$|Abstract [...] The <b>lobster,</b> <b>Homarus</b> americanus, relies {{upon its}} lateral anten-nules to make initial {{directional}} choices in a turbulent odor plume. To deter-mine whether chemical signals provide cues for source direction and distance during orientation, we studied the search {{patterns of the}} lobster orienting within a turbulent odor plume. In an odor plume, animals walked signifi-cantly more slowly and most often up {{the middle of the}} tank; control animals (no odor present) walked rapidly in straight lines, frequently along a wall. Search patterns were not stereotyped ither for the population of experimental animals or for individuals. Three different phases of orientation were evident: an initial stage during which the animals increased their walking speeds and decreased their heading angles; an intermediate stage where both the walking speed and headings were constant; and the final stage close to the source, where heading angles increased while walking speed decreased. During this last stage the animals appear to be switching from a distance orientation (mediated by the antennules) to a local food search (mediated by the walking legs) as evidenced by a great increase in leg-raking behavior.

40|$|Contrary to {{previous}} reports, oxygen consumption is maintained {{over a wide}} range of external oxygen tensions in the <b>lobster</b> <b>Homarus</b> americanus. In animals acclimated to the experimental conditions this response is mediated by increased branchial pumping, increased effectiveness of oxygen uptake by the gills and an increased contribution by the respiratory pigment to the oxygen delivered to the tissues. Circulatory blood oxygen levels are generally high in lobsters resting in well-aerated water. Mechanisms for detection of hypoxia and possible control mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
