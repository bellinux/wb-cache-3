The swamp-loving <b>lycopod</b> trees of the Carboniferous, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced seed ferns and early conifers.

25|$|Immediately {{above the}} Permian-Triassic {{boundary}} the glossopteris flora was suddenly largely displaced by an Australia-wide coniferous flora containing few species with a <b>lycopod</b> herbaceous under story. Conifers also became common in Eurasia. These groups of conifers arose from endemic species {{because of the}} ocean barriers that prevented seed from crossing for over one hundred million years. For instance, Podocarpis was located south and pines, junipers, and sequoias were located north. The dividing line ran through the Amazon Valley, across the Sahara, and north of Arabia, India, Thailand, and Australia. It {{has been suggested that}} there was a climate barrier for the conifers. although water barriers are more plausible. If so, something that could cross at least minor water barriers must have been involved in producing the coal hiatus. Hot climate could have been an important auxiliary factor across Antarctica or the Bering Strait, however. There was a spike of fern and <b>lycopod</b> spores immediately after the close of the Permian. There was also a spike of fungal spores immediately after the Permian-Triassic boundary. This spike may have lasted 50,000 years in Italy and 200,000 years in China and must have contributed to the climate warmth.|$|E
25|$|The Permian {{began with}} the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About {{the middle of the}} Permian there was a major {{transition}} in vegetation. The swamp-loving <b>lycopod</b> trees of the Carboniferous, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, were replaced by the more advanced conifers, which were better adapted to the changing climatic conditions. Lycopods and swamp forests still dominated the South China continent because it was an isolated continent and it sat near or at the equator. The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. The ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The gigantopterids thrived during this time; some of these may {{have been part of the}} ancestral flowering plant lineage, though flowers evolved only considerably later.|$|E
5000|$|Asteroxylon and Baragwanathia {{are widely}} {{regarded}} as primitive <b>lycopods.</b> The <b>lycopods</b> are still [...] today, familiar as the quillwort Isoetes and the club mosses. <b>Lycopods</b> bear distinctive microphylls - leaves with a single vascular trace. Microphylls could grow to some size - the Lepidodendrales boasted microphylls over a meter in length - but almost all just bear the one vascular bundle. An exception is the rare branching in some Selaginella species.|$|R

50|$|Subsequently Chase and Reveal {{considered}} both <b>lycopods</b> and ferns as subclasses {{of a class}} Equisetopsida (Embryophyta) encompassing all land plants. This {{is referred}} to as Equisetopsida sensu lato to distinguish it from the narrower use to refer to horsetails alone, Equisetopsida sensu stricto. They placed the <b>lycopods</b> into subclass Lycopodiidae and the ferns, keeping the term monilophytes, into five subclasses, Equisetidae, Ophioglossidae, Psilotidae, Marattiidae and Polypodiidae, by dividing Smith's Psilotopsida into its two orders and elevating them to subclass (Ophioglossidae and Psilotidae). Christenhusz et al. (2011) followed this use of subclasses but recombined Smith's Psilotopsida as Ophioglossidae, giving four subclasses of ferns again.|$|R
50|$|Widespread coal swamp {{deposits}} across North America and Europe {{during the}} Carboniferous Period contain {{a wealth of}} fossils containing arborescent <b>lycopods</b> up to 30 meters tall, abundant seed plants, such as conifers and seed ferns, and countless smaller, herbaceous plants.|$|R
50|$|Fossil {{leaves are}} abundant, {{especially}} in the shales and sandstones associated with coal. Dicot angiosperms dominate, with lesser amounts of ferns, palms, and herbaceous <b>lycopods.</b> Interestingly, conifers are rare.

25|$|The Equisetales {{included}} the common giant form Calamites, with a trunk diameter of 30 to 60cm and {{a height of}} up to 20 meters. Sphenophyllum was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the <b>lycopods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of plants {{has resulted in}} increasing levels of complexity, from the earliest algal mats, through bryophytes, <b>lycopods,</b> ferns to the complex gymnosperms and angiosperms of today.

5000|$|Christenhusz and Chase (2014) {{developed}} a new classification of ferns and <b>lycopods.</b> They used the term Polypodiophyta for the ferns, subdivided like Smith et al. into four groups (shown with equivalents in the Smith system), with 21 families, approximately 212 genera and 10,535 species; ...|$|R

50|$|Contrary {{to earlier}} and popular beliefs, Arthropleura {{was not a}} {{predator}} but a herbivorous arthropod. Because none of the known fossils have the mouth preserved, scientists suppose that Arthropleura did not have strongly sclerotized and powerful mouth parts, because such would have been preserved {{at least in some}} of the fossils. Some fossils have been found with <b>lycopod</b> fragments and pteridophyte spores in the gut and in associated coprolites.|$|E
50|$|After obtaining his Ph.D., he held {{a two-year}} {{postdoctoral}} fellowship at Redpath Museum at McGill University in Montréal, {{and then at the}} Natural History Museum in London. During this time he studied tetrapod remains from the Pennsylvanian <b>lycopod</b> “tree stumps” at Joggins, Nova Scotia (a variety of temnospondyls, microsaurs, and basal amniotes). Most of this material was collected and first studied by Sir William Dawson, the first Principal of McGill University, in the nineteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|These Archaeopteris forests {{were soon}} {{supplemented}} by <b>lycopods,</b> {{in the form}} of lepidodendrales, which topped 50m in height and 2m across at the base. These <b>lycopods</b> rose to dominate Late Devonian and Carboniferous coal deposits. Lepidodendrales differ from modern trees in exhibiting determinate growth: after building up a reserve of nutrients at a lower height, the plants would [...] "bolt" [...] to a genetically determined height, branch at that level, spread their spores and die. They consisted of [...] "cheap" [...] wood to allow their rapid growth, with at least half of their stems comprising a pith-filled cavity. Their wood was also generated by a unifacial vascular cambium - it did not produce new phloem, meaning that the trunks could not grow wider over time.|$|R
50|$|The Equisetales {{included}} the common giant form Calamites, with a trunk diameter of 30 to 60 cm and {{a height of}} up to 20 m. Sphenophyllum was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the <b>lycopods.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are 16 species, and {{numerous}} natural hybrids in the genus; {{many of the}} hybrids are fertile, allowing their occurrence to become frequent, sometimes {{more so than the}} parent species. The basal chromosome count for this genus is n=23, which is distinctively different from other <b>lycopods.</b>|$|R
