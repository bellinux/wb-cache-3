40|$|We analyse {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} within host galaxies and chemical {{properties of the}} progenitors of <b>Long</b> <b>Gamma</b> Ray Bursts {{as a function of}} redshift. By using hydrodynamical cosmological simulations which include star formation, Supernova feedback and chemical enrichment and based on the hypothesis of the collapsar model with low metallicity, we investigate the progenitors in the range 0 < z < 3. Our results suggest that the sites of these phenomena tend to be located in the central regions of the hosts at high redshifts but move outwards for lower ones.
