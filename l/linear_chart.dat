40|$|Abstract — We {{propose the}} concept of {{teaching}} (and learning) unfamiliar visualizations by analogy, that is, demonstrating an unfamiliar visualization method by linking it to another more familiar one, where the in-betweens are designed {{to bridge the gap}} of these two visualizations and explain the difference in a gradual manner. As opposed to a textual description, our morphing explains an unfamiliar visualization through purely visual means. We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples – data table vs. parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix vs. hyperbox, <b>linear</b> <b>chart</b> vs. spiral chart, and pie chart vs. tree map. The analogy is commutative – any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A study we conducted suggests that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. We found that for all of the four pairs we studied users could understand the unfamiliar visualization method either fully or at least signifcantly better after they observed or interacted with a series of transitions from the familiar counterpart. Our examples provide good insight how effective visualization pairings can be identified, and we hope that they will inspire other visualizations transformation pairs and associated transition strategies to be identified...|$|E

In order to determine the value of this method following renal transplantation, serial studies have been obtained on the transplanted kidney and correlated with con ventional studies. METhOD Four hundred and eighty-four serial renograms were performed on 39 pa tients at one, three and five days following transplantation and then at weekly intervals. Ten microcuries of 1311 labeled iodohippurate (Hippuran, Abbott) was injected intravenously for each study. Renograms were performed with a single thaffium activated 2 x 1. 5 inch crystal probe connected to a ratemeter, pulse height analyzer and high voltage source. The crystal was shielded with a 1. 5 inch thick, 360 flat field collimator and was recessed 8 cm from the collimator face. Renogram tracings were recorded on a <b>linear</b> <b>chart</b> recorder run at 12 inches per hour for twenty minutes. A time constant of ten seconds and a count rate of 10 K were used.

40|$|Abstract. A visual {{representation}} {{of an object}} must meet at least three basic requirements. First, it must allow identication of the object {{in the presence of}} slight but unpredictable changes in its visual appearance. Sec-ond, it must account for larger changes in appearance due to variations in the object's fundamental degrees of freedom, such as, e. g., changes in pose. And last, any object representation must be derivable from visual input alone, i. e., it must be learnable. We here construct such a representation by deriving transformations between the dierent views of a given object, {{so that they can be}} pa-rameterized in terms of the object's physical degrees of freedom. Our method allows to automatically derive the appearance representations of an object in conjunction with their linear deformation model from example images. These are subsequently used to provide <b>linear</b> <b>charts</b> to the entire appearance manifold of a three-dimensional object. In contrast to approaches aiming at mere dimensionality reduction the local <b>linear</b> <b>charts</b> to the object's appearance manifold are estimated on a strictly local basis avoiding any reference to a metric embedding space to all views. A real understanding of the object's appearance in terms of its physical degrees of freedom is this way learned from single views alone...|$|R

3000|$|The {{compressibility}} factor (z-factor) of gases is a thermodynamic property used {{to account for}} the deviation of real gas behavior from that of an ideal gas. Correlations based on the equation of state are often implicit, because they require iteration and are computationally expensive. A number of explicit correlations have been derived to enhance simplicity; however, no single explicit correlation has been developed for the full range of pseudo-reduced temperatures ([...] 1.05 < T_pr< 3) and pseudo-reduced pressures ([...] 0.2 < P_pr< 15), which represents a significant research gap. This work presents a new z-factor correlation that can be expressed in linear form. On the basis of Hall and Yarborough’s implicit correlation, we developed the new correlation from 5346 experimental data points extracted from 5940 data points published in the SPE natural gas reservoir engineering textbook and created a <b>linear</b> z-factor <b>chart</b> for a full range of pseudo-reduced temperatures (1.15 < T_pr< 3) and pseudo-reduced pressures (0.2 < P_pr< 15).|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Regarding {{development}} of several thermal indices {{and limitations of}} each, in this research applicability and validity of temperature- humidity index (Humidex) were examined against the standard heat index, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature -WBGT, as well as tympanic temperature of subjects. Material and Method:  This cross-sectional study was done on 163 subjects at spring and summer (2013) in outdoor jobs of arid and semi-arid climates of Iran. Environmental parameters as well as tympanic temperature of subjects were measured simultaneously and then heat indices were determined. Data were analyzed using <b>linear</b> correlation <b>charts</b> and Kappa coefficient of agreement by means of SPSS software version 20. Results: A strong correlation was obtained between WBGT and Humidex in both arid and semi-arid regions (r> 0. 98), while the correlation between Humidex and tympanic temperature was moderate (r= 0. 5 - 0. 8). Based on the obtained Kappa value, the agreement coefficient between Humidex and WBGT was 0. 878. This value was obtained equal to 0. 226 for the Humidex and tympanic temperature. Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} showed that Humidex can be applied as an appropriate substitute for the WBGT index. However, if evaluation of environmental condition with low air temperature or very hot situation is considered, relying only on the Humidex results will not provide a realistic estimation of thermal strain imposed to individuals...|$|R
40|$|Foveal {{vision in}} strabismic {{amblyopia}} can show {{increased levels of}} crowding, akin to typical peripheral vision. Target–flanker similarity and visual-acuity test configuration may cause the magnitude of crowding to vary in strabismic amblyopia. We used custom-designed visual acuity tests to investigate crowding in observers with strabismic amblyopia. LogMAR was measured monocularly in both eyes of 11 adults with strabismic or mixed strabismic/anisometropic amblyopia using custom-designed letter tests. The tests used single-letter and linear formats with either bar or letter flankers to introduce crowding. Tests were presented monocularly on a high-resolution display at a test distance of 4 m, using standardized instructions. For each condition, five letters of each size were shown; testing continued until three letters of a given size were named incorrectly. Uncrowded logMAR was subtracted from logMAR {{in each of the}} crowded tests to highlight the crowding effect. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that letter flankers and linear presentation individually resulted in poorer performance in the amblyopic eyes (respectively, mean normalized logMAR = 0. 29, SE = 0. 07, mean normalized logMAR = 0. 27, SE = 0. 07; p 0. 05). Both linear presentation and letter rather than bar flankers increase crowding in the amblyopic eyes of people with strabismic amblyopia. These results suggest the influence of more than one mechanism contributing to crowding in <b>linear</b> visual-acuity <b>charts</b> with letter flankers...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of mosaic diagrams to the visualisation of set relations. Venn and Euler diagrams are the best known visual representations of sets and their relationships (intersections, containment or subsets, exclusion or disjointness). In recent years, alternative forms of visualisation have been proposed. Among them, linear diagrams {{have been shown to}} compare favourably to Venn and Euler diagrams, in supporting non-interactive assessment of set relationships. Recent studies that compared several variants of linear diagrams have demonstrated that users perform best at tasks involving identification of intersections, disjointness and subsets when using a horizontally drawn linear diagram with thin lines representing sets, and employing vertical lines as guide lines. The essential visual task the user needs to perform in order to interpret this kind of diagram is vertical alignment of parallel lines and detection of overlaps. Space-filling mosaic diagrams which support this same visual task have been used in other applications, such as the visualization of schedules of activities, where they {{have been shown to be}} superior to <b>linear</b> Gantt <b>charts.</b> In this paper, we present {{an application of}} mosaic diagrams for visualization of set relationships, and compare it to linear diagrams in terms of accuracy, time-to-answer, and subjective ratings of perceived task difficulty. The study participants exhibited similar performance on both visualisations, suggesting that mosaic diagrams are a good alternative to Venn and Euler diagrams, and that the choice between linear diagrams and mosaics may be solely guided by visual design considerations...|$|R
40|$|The {{interdependence}} between {{air transport}} {{and the economic}} sector can be examined from two directions. Several theoretical and regional studies were published on {{the economic impact of}} aviation, which is the fastest growing but the most environmentally harmful among all of the transport subsections. However, out of the many factors that influence the development level / performance of aviation, only the thematization and examination of the relationship with the GDP per capita was carried out for a narrower group of countries. Compared to the past, the author methodologically exceeded previous studies in many respects, since the correlation calculations were carried out on 168 countries on 8 hypothetical acting factors and other specific indicators instead of one factor. Furthermore (breaking with the earlier practice), the indicator of passenger traffic per inhabitant was produced not from the data of official statistics (such as ICAO and IATA), which is only related to airlines registered in the given country, but from the complete national airport traffic data that was painstakingly generated by the author. In addition to the global scale, the evaluation of correlation coefficients from a geographical point of view was done according to quantitative categories of hypothetical acting factors {{and at the same time}} for every country in the dataset. To illustrate the vast differences among the aviation (infrastructure / traffic) specific indicators, <b>linear</b> scale <b>charts</b> and graphs were made, while the correlation of indicators aggregated by continents was visualized with a logarithmic scaling...|$|R

It is important to provide information for the patient’s family and to explain the objectives of intensive care. Objective To evaluate whether the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dys- function (PELOD) scoring system {{can be used to}} determine the prog- nosis of patients treated in PICU. Methods A longitudinal-observational study on patients treated in the PICU of Hasan Sadikin General Hospital was conducted in No- vember 2004 -December 2004. The PELOD scoring system was applied to all subjects within the first 24 hours of PICU admission. The scoring system consists of physical and laboratory variables of 6 organs, namely neurological, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, hematological, and hepatic systems. The sum of scores were ana- lyzed by logistic regression method to calculate the probability of death. The subjects were monitored until they passed away or were discharged from PICU. Results There were 32 subjects who met the inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) of PELOD scores in survivors was 13. 5 (8. 5) and in non survivors was 22. 2 (10. 1) (Z M-W =- 2. 507;P= 0. 012), while the mean of PELOD scores in survivors of PELOD scores validation study was 31. 0, and in non survivors was 9. 4. The increase of PELOD scores correlated with the increase in the probability of death (P= 0. 038), and a <b>linear</b> regression <b>chart</b> showed a positive correla- tion (R 2 = 0. 93).

Levels of preoperative anxiety in patients are important, because anxiety can influence cognitive performance and participation, hence altering {{the outcome of the}} procedure. In this study we analyzed the prevalence and potential clinical predictors of anxiety in the pre-operative phase of an awake brain tumor surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive candidates for an awake brain tumor surgery were included. All patients received a neuropsychological pre-operative work-up. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administrated to investigate symptoms of anxiety. Demographic and medical data were extracted from patients' <b>charts.</b> <b>Linear</b> regression analyses, multiple regression analyses, t-tests for parametric and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-parametric data were used to analyze the relation between demographic and medical variables and pre-operative anxiety.

Several industrial statistical techniques such as control <b>charting,</b> <b>linear</b> regression, analysis of variance and designed experimentation are also heavily employed. Many factors were studied as candidate drivers of variability. Three criteria are used to discriminate among them: statistical significance, magnitude of effect on variability and controllability. The results show {{that one of the}} largest but least controllable factors is plate density, i. e., the number of colonies on a plate. Instead of attempting to control individual confounding factors in plate preparation, this thesis presents an alternative strategy for overcoming the plate density variability: introduction of a novel spotting process that allows for plate variability but still yields higher efficiency. by Julia L.

40|$|The optimalizing {{control system}} is {{designed}} to search out automatically the optimum state of operation of the controlled system and to confine the operation to a region near this optimum state. The performance {{of the system is}} affected by the dynamics of the controlled system and by the noise interference. The dynamic effects of the controlled system on the performance of a peak-holding optimalizing control is analyzed under the assumption that the controlled system dynamics may be represented by a first order input linear group and a first order output <b>linear</b> group. Design <b>charts</b> are constructed for determining the required input drive speed and consequent hunting loss with specified time constants of the input and output linear groups, the hunting period, and the critical indicated difference for input drive reversal. The noise interference effects on the control system performance led to a new type of optimalizing control system which is a modification of the peak-holding optimalizing controller. Performance of the modified optimalizing controller is analyzed and several possible procedures are discussed for detecting and eliminating the incorrect operation modes. A statistical analysis is made to demonstrate the efficiency of a typical detection procedure, namely, the method of filtering through cross-correlation. The modified optimalizing controller can utilize any periodically varying input. An example of this, a sinusoidal input controller, is analyzed to show the dynamic effects of the controlled system and to demonstrate the effect of noise interference on the performance of the modified optimalizing controller...|$|R
40|$|Spreadsheets {{are among}} the most {{commonly}} used applications for data management and analysis. Perhaps they are even among the most widely used computer applications of all kinds. They combine in a natural and intuitive way data processing with very diverse supplementary features: statistical functions, visualization tools, pivot tables, pivot <b>charts,</b> <b>linear</b> programming solvers, Web queries periodically downloading data from external sources, etc. However, the spreadsheet paradigm of computation still lacks sufficient analysis. In this article we demonstrate that a spreadsheet can implement all data transformations definable in SQL, without any use of macros or built-in programming languages, merely by utilizing spreadsheet formulas. We provide a query compiler, which translates any given SQL query into a worksheet of the same semantics, including NULL values. Thereby database operations become available to the users who do not want to migrate to a database. They can define their queries using a high-level language and then get their execution plans in a plain vanilla spreadsheet. No sophisticated database system, no spreadsheet plugins or macros are needed. The functions available in spreadsheets impose severe limitations on the algorithms one can implement. In this paper we offer O(n^ 2 n) sorting spreadsheet, but using a non-constant number of rows, improving on the previously known O(n^ 2) ones. It is therefore surprising, that a spreadsheet can implement, as we demonstrate, Depth-First-Search and Breadth-First-Search on graphs, thereby reaching beyond queries definable in SQL- 92...|$|R
40|$|This {{regional}} pooled fund {{project was}} conducted to investigate the performance of Superpave asphalt mixtures incorporating RAP. This study was closely coordinated with a national study on the same topic (NCHRP 9 - 12, Incorporation of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement in the Superpave System). Specifically, this regional project looked at typical materials from the North Central United States {{to determine if the}} findings of NCHRP 9 - 12 were valid for Midwestern materials and to expand the NCHRP findings to include higher RAP contents. Three RAP materials from Indiana, Michigan and Missouri were evaluated. Mixtures were designed and tested in the laboratory with each RAP, virgin binder and virgin aggregate at RAP contents up to 50 %. The laboratory mixtures were compared to plant produced mixtures with the same materials at the medium RAP content of 15 - 25 %. Binder and mixture tests were performed. Briefly, the results showed that mixtures with up to 50 % RAP could be designed under Superpave, provided the RAP gradation and aggregate quality were sufficient. In some cases, the RAP aggregates limited the amount of RAP that could be included in a new mix design to meet the Superpave volumetric and compaction requirements. <b>Linear</b> binder blending <b>charts</b> were found to be appropriate in most cases. In general, increasing the RAP content of a mixture increased its stiffness and decreased its shear strain, indicating increased resistance to rutting. It is important to consider the RAP aggregate gradation and quality in the mix design, since a poor aggregate structure could reduce mixture stiffness and ultimately performance. Provided the RAP properties are properly accounted for in the material selection and mix design process, Superpave mixtures with RAP can perform very well...|$|R
