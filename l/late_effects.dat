40|$|Background: LEDGINs are novel {{allosteric}} HIV integrase (IN) inhibitors {{that target}} the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) /p 75 binding pocket of IN. They block HIV- 1 integration by abrogating {{the interaction between}} LEDGF/p 75 and IN {{as well as by}} allosterically inhibiting the catalytic activity of IN. Results: Here we demonstrate that LEDGINs reduce the replication capacity of HIV particles produced in their presence. We systematically studied the molecular basis of this <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> of LEDGINs and demonstrate that HIV virions produced in their presence display a severe replication defect. Both the <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> and the previously described, early effect on integration contribute to LEDGIN antiviral activity as shown by time-of-addition, qPCR and infectivity assays. The <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> phenotype requires binding of LEDGINs to integrase without influencing proteolytic cleavage or production of viral particles. LEDGINs augment IN multimerization during virion assembly or in the released viral particles and severely hamper the infectivity of progeny virions. About 70 % of the particles produced in LEDGIN-treated cells do not form a core or display aberrant empty cores with a mislocalized electron-dense ribonucleoprotein. The LEDGIN-treated virus displays defective reverse transcription and nuclear import steps in the target cells. The LEDGIN effect is possibly exerted {{at the level of the}} Pol precursor polyprotein. Conclusion: Our results suggest that LEDGINs modulate IN multimerization in progeny virions and impair the formation of regular cores during the maturation step, resulting in a decreased infectivity of the viral particles in the target cells. LEDGINs thus profile as unique antivirals with combined early (integration) and <b>late</b> (IN assembly) <b>effects</b> on the HIV replication cycle...|$|R
