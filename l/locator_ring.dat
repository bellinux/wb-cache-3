40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{works is}} focused on design and fabrication of an automatic injection moulding tool for production of CAM BUSH which is used in electrical engines as a connector. An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, Ejector plate and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core pins and six ejector pins are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core pins, ejector pins, <b>locator</b> <b>ring</b> and the sprue bush and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled. Submarine gate and Baffle circular hole cooling system has been provided in the moulding tool to increase the productivity and good surface finish. The required Nylon- 66 Cam bush component is produced with this moulding tool by properly controlling the various parameters of injection moulding machine...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli {{glycogen}} synthase (EcGS, EC 2. 4. 1. 21) is a retaining glycosyltransferase (GT) that transfers glucose from adenosine diphosphate glucose to a glucan chain acceptor with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. EcGS {{belongs to the}} GT-B structural superfamily. Here we report several EcGS x-ray structures that together shed considerable light on the structure and function of these enzymes. The structure of the wild-type enzyme bound to ADP and glucose revealed a 15. 2 ° overall domain-domain closure and provided {{for the first time}} the structure of the catalytically active, closed conformation of a {{glycogen synthase}}. The main chain carbonyl group of His- 161, Arg- 300, and Lys- 305 are suggested by the structure to act as critical catalytic residues in the transglycosylation. Glu- 377, previously thought to be catalytic is found on the α-face of the glucose and plays an electrostatic role in the active site and as a glucose <b>ring</b> <b>locator.</b> This is also consistent with the structure of the EcGS(E 377 A) -ADP-HEPPSO complex where the glucose moiety is either absent or disordered in the active site...|$|R
