Kenneth Patty, Assistant Attorney General, ended up drafting the revised bill for the governor. After four days of work, Patty finished his draft of the funding cut-off legislation on August 13.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{principles}} of Chinese <b>legislative</b> <b>drafting</b> include generality and flexibility.

500|$|Garran and {{his fellow}} staff aimed for a simple style of <b>legislative</b> <b>drafting,</b> a goal enabled {{by the fact that}} there was no {{pre-existing}} federal legislation on which their work would have to be based. In Garran's opinion the approach, which was put into practice many years before the similarly principled plain English movement became popular in government in the 1970s, was intended [...] "to set an example of clear, straightforward language, free from technical jargon." [...] Subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that Garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style, and that it was not until the early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re-emerged.|$|E

2500|$|In a United States {{court case}} in 2017, , an appellate court was {{required}} to interpret a statute under which the [...] "canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution" [...] of certain goods were activities exempted from the general requirement of overtime pay; the question was whether this list included distribution of the goods, or only packing of the goods for distribution. The omission of the serial comma suggested one meaning, while the omission of the conjunction or before [...] "packing" [...] {{and the fact that}} the Maine <b>Legislative</b> <b>Drafting</b> Manual advised against use of the serial comma suggested another. The lower court held that [...] "distribution" [...] was itself an exempt activity. On appeal, however, the Circuit Court decided that the sentence was ambiguous and [...] "because, under Maine law, ambiguities in the state's wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose", adopted the drivers' narrower reading of the exemption and ruled that those who distributed the goods were entitled to overtime. Thus, in this instance, it is implied that the fault lies in the absence of a serial comma. U.S. appeals judge David J. Barron wrote, [...] "For want of a comma, we have this case." ...|$|E

50|$|The Landtag has {{the right}} to legislate for provincial and {{constitutional}} laws; state competencies are determined by the Federal Constitutional Law. <b>Legislative</b> <b>drafts</b> can be introduced as government bills, by means of initiative motions (supported by at least five regional deputies) or by referendums to the Landtag. Like the other state parliaments in Austria, the Viennese state parliament is hardly active intensively, since the provincial legislature has only a few competences. The existence and size of the state parliaments have therefore led to controversial discussions for several years. The controversy has little interest in the Viennese parliament, however. since its deputies are mostly active as municipal councilors.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} automated codification of regulations that is being developed at the University of Amsterdam. The method {{is based on the}} distinction between normative knowledge and world knowledge (cf. (Breuker & den Haan 1991)). The world knowledge is used to generate all possible situations, which are in turn divided over a subset of legal situations and illegal situations. This bipartite set is called a qualification model (cf. (den Haan & Winkels 1994)). The situations are transformed into normative rules by using inductive logic programming techniques (cf. (Michalski & Kodratoff 1990)). The algorithms can be tailored to generate <b>legislative</b> <b>drafts</b> that satisfy desired properties through four parameters (cf. (Winkels & den Haan 1995)) : the normative default (prescriptive/prohibitive), deontic default (strictly O,F, or P, or indifferent), the level of abstraction (scaling from high to low using largely general rules, or specific rules), and the viewpoint of the regulation [...] ...|$|R
