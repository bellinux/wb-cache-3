[...] The local fleet is mainly composed of small traditional vessels (less than 5 GRT), comprising, in 2004, 87% of the total <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> and accounting for 8% of the total tonnage. These vessels are usually equipped to use more than one fishing method, such as hooks, gill nets and traps, and constitute the so-called polyvalent segment of the fleet.|$|R

The relative importance fish stocks and harvest areas are described for the period 2000 - 2006. We combine the information retrieved in the previous sections and try to say something about the <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet’s</b> ability to cope with change. The trawlers and the large conventional vessels specialize in targeting the large fish stocks, such as cod saithe and haddock, and as the stocks are expected to gain from higher ocean temperatures and expand their area of distribution, the ocean going vessels will also benefit from this. The inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> also target the same fish stocks, but are more limited in their ability to take advantage of expansions off shore. However, the coastal <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> is a very diverse group, harvesting a number of alternative species living in different coastal areas and can be expected to take advantage of new species entering the ecosystem following a warmer climate...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{application of}} systems engineering principles and trade-off analysis of sustainability in the <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet.</b> Sustainability in the <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> may {{be characterized by}} seven attributes measured by performance indicators. Evaluations show that the energy consumption is higher for the Norwegian ocean going fleet than the coastal fleet, whereas the opposite {{is the case for}} the number of fatalities. An important part of the systems engineering process is analysis and optimization of system alternatives. Thus, the main objective of the article is to investigate ranking of the sustainability attributes, which implies use of multi-attribute decision-making methods. The analytic hierarchy process was used to interview stakeholders to the <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> about their preferences. The article concludes that if "accident risk" is weighted as the most important attribute, the smallest fishing vessels are not as sustainable as often claimed.

40|$|Overcapacity in the <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> is {{considered}} {{as the most}} serious threat to sustainable fisheries. More effective fishing vessels and catching gear contribute to increased catch capacity. Increased catch capacity causes environmental problems such as overexploitation and calls for larger quotas. The problem of overcapacity indicates {{the need for a}} stronger integration of technological aspects into fisheries management. This article assesses the differences in sustainability between the Norwegian ocean and coastal <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> in the cod fisheries, by using systems engineering methods. Attributes of sustainability in the Norwegian cod <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> are investigated, as well as acceptance criteria and performance indicators. The results show that there are huge differences in the performance between the vessel groups, and that the results of an evaluation of sustainability in the <b>fishing</b> <b>fleets</b> are dependent on which attributes are explored. Thus, the discussion may contribute to a better decision basis and improved sustainability in fisheries management. Sustainable fisheries management Performance indicators Systems engineering...|$|R
