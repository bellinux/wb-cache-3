These procedures comprised testing of mechanical and thermal behaviour {{as well as of}} kinematics under single and combined loading conditions. The objec-tives to be met were (1) verification of temperature distribution within the metallic rudder structure and the interface to the cold fin, (2) kinematical per-formance under thermal loading, (3) strength and stiffness under quasi-static mechanical and transient thermal load, and (4) functioning of sealing of clos-ing edge plates. The DLR THERMEX-A test facility was chosen for its adaptability to larger specimens and complex test procedures. Pure thermal and pure mechanical as well as combined thermo-mechanical tests may be carried out on larger components within a <b>loading</b> <b>rack</b> of 2 m x 4 m for modular assembly. In the first place, a basic set-up was designed par-ticularly for mechanical tests.

The thermal load was simulated by infrared lamps. To test kinematical behaviour of the rudder under thermo-mechanical load a sophisticated modifica-tion of the basic set-up was designed.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Industrial Physiology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. BACKGROUND: The liver {{serves as}} a first pass filter and is an {{important}} metabolising organ for VOC's. Thus the concentration that the liver is exposed to is {{higher than that of}} other organs. The substances have different effects on the liver. These effects vary from adaptive responses to toxic effects. This can influence the liver's capacity to function normally. If the liver's biotransformation capacity is affected, it can increase the possibility/probability of the manifestation of a toxic response. Therefore {{it is very important that}} the liver's functions are regularly tested. The purpose of this study is to: 1) Identify, quantify and evaluate the VOC's the workers at the rail and road loading racks are exposed to. 2) Investigate the possibility of additional exposure through the gloves of the workers. 3) See if there are any occupational health effects manifestations present, because of VOC exposure. 4) See how optimal protection can be provided for the workers. 5) See if meteorological conditions can affect exposure to VOC's. METHOD: The study population consist of four process controllers and a general worker at the rail loading racks, as well as five process controllers at the road loading racks at a petrochemical industry. They were monitored for a week. G. A. R. B. I. E. badges monitored exposure to VOC's. One of the process controllers at the rail loading racks was also exposed to phenol and cresol. A Xad 7 -tube and personal pump were used to monitor his exposure to phenol and cresol. Permea-Tec stickers monitored skin exposure to VOC's. The liver enzymes, alanine aminotrasferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotrasferase (AST), were measured six months before and six months after the study. These values were also used. The amount and type of products that were loaded, personal information, as well as working procedures and behaviour were observed and noted. The meteorological data were gathered during the study period. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: he workers at the rail loading racks were exposed to 14 VOC's and the workers at the road loading racks to 15 VOC's. All the exposure levels were below the OEL (occupational exposure limits) from the Hazardous Chemical Substances Regulations (1995) in the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993) (OSHAct). Benzene exposure was above the OEL of the ACGIH (0. 1 ppm [part per million]) almost every time. A large percentage of the exposures were below 1 ppm, while a very small percentage was above 10 ppm. This was the case at both the rail and road loading racks. The average of the rail <b>loading</b> <b>rack</b> workers' liver enzymes values six months before the study (September 2000) were AST 31 mmol/L and ALT 40 mmol/L and six months after the study (September 2001) was AST 28 mmol/L and ALT 47 mmol/L. There were five values. Both the AST and ALT values were normal. The average of the road <b>loading</b> <b>rack</b> workers' liver enzymes six months before the study (September 2000) was AST 34 mmoVL and ALT 37 mmol/L and six months after the study (September 2001) was AST 47 mmol/L and ALT 68 mmol/L. (The available data were used.) CONCLUSION: he liver enzyme values seem to be rising, although not much each year. This is not the case with all the workers. The medical surveillance programme was only implemented two years before the study. A conclusion can only be made after another year or two. Some of the VOC's that the workers were exposed to during this study can affect the liver's function ability, like chloroform. The following questions were answered in this study: 1) Although exposures comply with the Hazardous Chemical Substances Regulations (1995) in the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993), low-level long-term exposure is not safe. Synergism and potensiation can turn the "safe exposure limit" that the OSHAct sets into an "unsafe exposure limit". 2) Skin exposure through the gloves might be a possibility. The stickers were not efficient enough to make a definite conclusion. 3) Exposures to these VOC's do cause health effects, for example elevated liver enzymes, as well as the gradual rising in these levels. (It's more noticeable in the older workers.) Before any definite conclusion can be made, it is necessary that more liver enzymes values be obtained. The effects of long-term low-level exposure of VOC's should be studied further. 4) Although the current personal protective equipment is efficient, it should be monitored. 5) The meteorological conditions may possibly influence the exposure of the workers. Exposure was some days higher, even though less product were being loaded. If the meteorological conditions are taken in to consideration, this can be explained to some extent. RECOMMENDATION: he workers should be re-educated about the negative effects of exposure to VOC's, the proper working procedures and storing of their personal protection equipment. This personal protection equipment should also be constantly re-evaluated to make sure the workers are receiving the best protection. Engineering changes can also be installed at the VOC's pumps on the rail racks and the resting areas on the catwalks. The workers can also be better supervised. Master...|$|E

40|$|Deployment of {{high density}} IT {{equipment}} into data center infrastructure {{is now a}} common occurrence. Many data centers are not adequately equipped to handle the additional high density cooling requirements. This results in non-desirable conditions such as recirculation or mixing of hot and cool air, poorly controlled humidity and costly over-provisioning. Heat containment systems provide a simple and cost effective solution to these problems by physically separating cold supply and hot return air. This creates a stable thermal environment for the IT equipment while improving {{the performance of the}} cooling infrastructure.

He concluded that, cooling amortization and server amortization monthly payments have been computed using 5 % per annum cost and server hardware costs are the largest. But power infrastructure cost will rise and server hardware cost may fall, resulting in the domination of power cost over all other data center expenses in not so distant future. Generally, a typical data center comprises 100 fully <b>loaded</b> <b>racks</b> with the current generation 1 U servers needing $ 1.2 million for power and an additional $ 1.2 million for cooling infrastructure per annum. Moreover, $ 1.8 million annual cost is incurred due to maintenance, amortization of power and cooling equipment.

5000|$|A beaverslide {{will raise}} hay to a height {{that allows a}} haystack to be built as much as 30 feet high. A large hay crew is required, {{with a minimum of}} six people to operate all components. A load of hay is {{delivered}} {{to the base of the}} beaverslide, often pushed by a buckrake drawn by a team of horses or a tractor. The hay is <b>loaded</b> onto the <b>rack,</b> which when full is drawn up the inclined ramp by cables powered either by a second team of horses or a motorized vehicle such as a pickup or a tractor. At the top of the incline, the hay falls onto the stack and the rack is lowered for another load. The term [...] "butt" [...] describes the hay stacked by the beaverslide and has two meanings. A [...] "butt" [...] can be the amount of hay on a fully <b>loaded</b> <b>rack,</b> but the term also refers to the amount of hay that can be stacked by the beaverslide without moving it, roughly 24 tons of hay. The hay at the top of each haystack is stomped and piled higher towards the middle to allow rain to run off. Depending on the size of the field and the amount of hay produced per acre, once a beaverslide has created a stack, it can be moved a few feet to make a long, continuous haystack, or moved a longer distance to create multiple stacks within a field. Many are built on skids to facilitate being moved from field to field. If the hay is stacked properly, and remains uneaten, the hay in a beaverslide-constructed stack remains good at least two to three years, with some ranchers claiming it could last up to five or six years. In contrast, baled hay stored outdoors can begin to go bad after only one year.|$|R

The two data centers were designated as the west data center (DC No. 18) and the east data center (DC No. 19). The study found that 56 % of the overall electric power was consumed by sixth floor critical loads in both data centers, 33 % of the power was consumed by HVAC systems, 3 % of the power was consumed by UPS units, 3 % of the power was for generator losses, and the remaining 5 % was used by lighting and miscellaneous loads in the building. The power density of installed computer <b>loads</b> (<b>rack</b> <b>load)</b> in the two data centers was 20 W/ft{sup 2 } and 56 W/ft{sup 2 }, respectively. The power density was relatively lower in DC No. 18 compared to other data centers previously studied. In addition, HVAC to IT power demand ratio was 0. 6 in DC No. 18 in this study, and was 0. 4 in DC No. 19. Two out of three chillers were running at a low partial load, making the operation very energy inefficient. The operation and control of the chillers and air-handling units should be optimized while providing sufficient cooling to the data centers.

The density of installed computer <b>loads</b> (<b>rack</b> <b>load)</b> in the data center was 61 W/ft{sup 2 }. Power consumption density for all data center allocated load (including cooling and lighting) was 88 W/ft{sup 2 }, approximately eight times the average overall power density in rest of the building (non-data center portion).

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring <b>loaded</b> <b>rack</b> and pinion. This spring loading arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The spring loading arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the spring loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R
