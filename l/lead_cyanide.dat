The RGP is for the discharge of water from a basement sump system, which has become contaminated with volatile organic compounds, dissolved <b>lead</b> and <b>cyanide,</b> to a municipal storm water catch basin. Basement sump system has been operating at the Site for the past 15 to 20 years or so. In 2006 the sump system was converted to a Pump & Treat (P&T) system in order to mitigate an Imminent Hazard (IH) condition and to implement Immediate Response Actions (IRAs) that have been reported to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) and is being addressed under the Release Tracking Number (RTN) 3 - 23300.

25|$|The mineral {{industry}} in Peru has exerted several adverse {{impacts on the}} environment, including reduced {{quality and quantity of}} water supplies and changes in habitat for plants and animals. According to an article in the Journal of Latin American Geography, these effects have significantly compromised the livelihoods of rural populations living in nearby communities. Mining corporations often draw water from nearby streams, canals, aquifers, and lakes, thereby reducing the quantity of water available for subsistence agriculture, farming, and personal consumption. Runoff from mining operations often contaminates local water supplies with substances such as copper, iron, zinc, manganese, mercury, arsenic, <b>lead,</b> cadmium, <b>cyanide,</b> and selenium, further threatening rural populations' main sources of sustenance. Beyond modifying water supplies, the {{mineral industry}} in Peru has also compromised natural habitat. Mining operations often produce substantial soil erosion, thus degrading the grazing lands that local populations rely on for herding and livestock activities. In addition, mining activities require considerable physical space for infrastructure, road construction, drilling, and other operations. This reduces the quantity of land available for the pastoral activities of rural communities.|$|R
40|$|A human study {{conducted}} by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) enables more differentiated risk assessment of cyanide exposure following the consumption of bitter apricot kernels, persipan, linseed or manioc (cassava). The study results have now been published in the scientific journal “Archives of Toxicology” (DOI 10. 1007 /s 00204 - 015 - 1479 - 8, open access). Bitter apricot kernels, linseeds and manioc contain, as natural plant substances, cyanogenic glycosides in relatively high concentrations. Through the enzyme ß-glucosidase which is also contained in the plants, cyanide is released during consumption. Cyanides are salts of hydrocyanic acid. Ingestion of a sufficiently high dose can lead to acute poisoning by blocking energy generation. The BfR study shows that in terms of risk assessment of foods with cyanogenic glycosides it is very important, over and above the dose of bound cyanide, whether and to what extent the plant enzyme ß-glucosidase is active. For only fast enzymatic release <b>leads</b> to high <b>cyanide</b> blood levels in the body which determine toxicity. The known health risks resulting from the consumption of bitter apricot kernels and unprocessed manioc are confirmed by the human {{study conducted}} by the BfR. Compared to these foods, the consumption of linseed, with the same dose of bound <b>cyanide,</b> <b>leads</b> to much lower maximum levels (peak levels) in the blood.

40|$|The cyanide-ammonia {{system is}} known as an {{alternative}} system {{for the treatment of}} complex copper-gold ores. Thermodynamic research on the AuCu(Cu 2 O, Cu 2 S) CN−NH 4 +O 2 OH−H 2 O systems resulted in producing log(mol) -mol diagrams and δG values for relevant reactions. In log(mol) -mol diagrams the thermodynamic possibility of the existence of both the Au(CN) 2 − and CuCN ions was found. Copper cyanidation is faster than gold cyanidation which <b>leads</b> to <b>cyanide</b> depletion and retards gold leaching. Ammonia involved in the system produces the CuNH 3 species with a thermodynamic priority over CuCN species and also allows better stability of Cu(I) cyanide ions, shown in log(mol) -mol diagrams. These Cu(I) cyanide ions are responsible for gold leaching in the absence of free cyanide. Copper precipitation occurs as a parallel process, leaving sufficient Cu(I) cyanide for gold leaching. The critical value of oxygen concentration in the system was established which separates the areas of thermodynamic stability of CuCN and CuO/ Cu(OH) 2. The reactions with negative δG values explain the production of Cu(OH) 2. The results of kinetic research showed that this component of precipitate is stable under optimal ammonia addition beyond the critical oxygen concentration. The presence of Cu-sulphides enhances gold leaching while Cu-oxides allow better copper precipitation.

30|$|It was {{proposed}} to use polythionate organic bases as efficient gold eluting agents from an anion exchanger, after leaching with a thiosulfate (Fleming et al. 2002; Matthew 2007). Thiosulfate leaching of gold represents a potentially attractive {{alternative to a}} respective cyanation process at least for three types of auriferous ores. Firstly, in auriferous ores containing an organic carbon material, the recovery of gold by thiosulfate leaching is generally significantly higher due to the insensibility of the thiosulfate complex of gold to the preg-robbing or, in other words, to the re-sorption or solution depletion. In the second place, Au, Cu-containing ores often are not convenient for the cyanation process due to high cyanide consumption by copper in the ore, which leads to an unacceptably high cost. Thiosulfate does not easily react with copper minerals, and the lower reagent cost and the lower sulfate consumption compared to <b>cyanides</b> <b>lead</b> to a lower cost in such a situation. Finally, there are some layers of auriferous ore that cannot be treated by cyanation for being located in a delicate environment. The thiosulfate leaching reduces the load onto environment since the chemical reagents used in this process are already used in agriculture.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{addressed}} {{the hypothesis that}} the vestibular or lethal toxicities of allylnitrile depend on CYP 2 E 1 -mediated bioactivation. Wild-type (129 S 1) and CYP 2 E 1 -null male mice were exposed to allylnitrile at doses of 0, 0. 5, 0. 75, or 1. 0 mmol/kg (po), following exposure to drinking water with 0 or 1 % acetone, which induces CYP 2 E 1 expression. Induction of CYP 2 E 1 activity by acetone in 129 S 1 mice and lack of activity in null mice was confirmed in liver microsomes. Vestibular toxicity was assessed using a behavioral test battery and illustrated by scanning electron microscopy observation of the sensory epithelia. In parallel groups, concentrations of allylnitrile and cyanide were assessed in blood after exposure to 0. 75 mmol/kg of allylnitrile. Following allylnitrile exposure, mortality was lower in CYP 2 E 1 -null than in 129 S 1 mice, and increased after acetone pretreatment only in 129 S 1 mice. This increase was associated with higher blood concentrations of cyanide. In contrast, no consistent differences were recorded in vestibular toxicity between 129 S 1 and CYP 2 E 1 -null mice, and between animals pretreated with acetone or not. Additional experiments evaluated the effect on the toxicity of 1. 0 mmol/kg allylnitrile of the nonselective P 450 inhibitor, 1 -aminobenzotriazole, the CYP 2 E 1 -inhibitor, diallylsulfide, and the CYP 2 A 5 inhibitor, methoxsalen. In 129 S 1 mice, aminobenzotriazole decreased both mortality and vestibular toxicity, whereas diallylsulfide decreased mortality only.

We conclude that CYP 2 E 1 -mediated metabolism of allylnitrile <b>leads</b> to <b>cyanide</b> release and acute mortality, probably through alpha-carbon hydroxylation, and hypothesize that epoxidation of the beta-gamma double bond by CYP 2 A 5 mediates vestibular toxicity...|$|R
50|$|Experiments {{have been}} done about the {{stability}} of ferric ferrocyanide in the soil around manufactured gas plant sites. Ferric ferrocyanide is, on its own, of fairly low toxicity. In fact, {{there is evidence that}} being complexed with iron retards the mobility of the cyanide ion, which is the problematic species of this compound. This means that the mobility of cyanide is entirely dependent on the stability of iron-cyanide complexes. Below pH 4 and above pH 6, ferric ferrocyanide begins to dissociate in water under this reaction:Fe4Fe(CN)63(s) + 12 H2O ↔ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 3Fe(CN)6−3(aq) + 3e− + 12H+ This dissolved ferrocyanide can then go through a first-order photochemical dissociation pathway if exposed to sunlight, dissociating to iron ions and ferrocyanide between the rates of 2.2% per hour to 40% per hour depending on the flow of the body of water. The following reactions show the dissocation of ferrocyanide, then the future of the iron ion:Fe(CN)63− → 6CN− + Fe3+Fe3+ + 3OH− → Fe(OH)3This <b>leads</b> to free <b>cyanide</b> ions, which are not retarded in mobility.

40|$|The deportment and {{speciation}} of {{trace elements}} during mining and minerals processing {{is becoming an}} area of increasing concern with regards to potential health and environment risks within the immediate vicinity and surrounding area of mining and minerals processing operations. This concern also extends to the transport of concentrates and other products from site to other facilities for further processing. In many cases the hazards associated with trace elements in the ore are exacerbated through their concentration in the processing plant. In Australia, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI, 2010) lists antimony, arsenic, beryllium cadmium, chromium (III&VI), cobalt, copper, <b>cyanide,</b> <b>lead,</b> manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium and zinc as monitoring targets. From NPI data, the main trace metal emissions to the environment from metal processing operations are generally lead, arsenic, antimony and cadmium. Other trace elements of possible concern are mercury, bismuth, selenium and tellurium. However, {{little is known about}} the deportment and speciation of these trace elements in gold processing solutions, and how they vary in the leaching, carbon adsorption and tailings disposal facilities. The use of chemical equilibrium studies can enhance our basic understanding of the deportment and speciation of trace metals under conditions present in gold processing solutions, and assist in laboratory and field investigations. This paper presents some initial results from an initial two-year study into the deportment and speciation of trace metals in gold processing solutions. Although equilibrium models can be very useful in determining the deportment and fate of trace metals in process solutions, it must be remembered that these models have a number of limitations. The accuracy and precision of the modelling is very dependent on the thermodynamic database of from which the models are generated, and the range of conditions for which the data is available. In addition, models based on thermodynamic data may in some instances be unrealistic for processing solutions which often have a short residence time, and for which the speciation of metals may be governed more by kinetic than thermodynamic factors. For these reasons, care must be used in the interpretation of the information generated by the models and should, where possible, be confirmed by plant data or by laboratory tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Olifants River Water Resource Development Project (ORWRDP) is a {{multipurpose}} project incorporating {{both economic}} and social development objectives to cater for the water demands of commercial and social users. Phase 2 of the project encompassed the construction of the De Hoop Dam within the Steelpoort River basin and bulk water transfer pipelines. During this study, various water quality assessment techniques were conducted {{along the length of the}} Steelpoort River from a site situated just downstream of the De Hoop Dam to a site near the town of Steelpoort in order to determine spatial trends and relate these trends to changes imposed by the construction of the De Hoop Dam and the bulk water transfer pipeline. A total of four sites were selected within the Steelpoort River to assess the impacts on water quality as a result of the construction activities. Chemical water analyses and Physico-chemical Assessment Index (PAI) techniques were employed to assess the water quality status and to determine the present ecological state of the Steelpoort River. The water quality results with respect to the different water constituents did not illustrate a distinct change in water quality over the study period. From the results obtained during this study, it was detected that concentrations of nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate and nitrite were generally low and similar to the concentrations recorded prior to construction in the baseline study for the ORWRDP. Mats of filamentous algae were observed to increase with distance increase downstream of the dam and they may be responsible for the uptake and removal of nutrients within the river. The highest concentrations of nitrate were recorded at Site 3 (Dwars River), a tributary of the Steelpoort River. Agricultural return flows and pollution such as dumping of used nappies were identified as the main sources of nutrient inputs within the Steelpoort River. The concentration of toxic constituents such as <b>lead,</b> cadmium, <b>cyanide,</b> mercury, manganese, zinc and arsenic were recorded below detection limit at all sites with occasional spikes observed. The most noticeable impact observed during this study occurred due to the alteration in the flow regime as a consequence of construction activities. Alteration of flow has resulted in the erosion of stream banks along the Steelpoort River. Pipeline construction activities have resulted in the removal of riparian vegetation, stream diversions which encourage erosion and were observed to contribute significantly to the sediment loads entering the river through water discharges. This may have resulted in high turbidity levels and siltation observed downstream at Site 4. The eco-classification scores using PAI indicated that the Steelpoort River is a moderately impaired watercourse in terms of water quality. The main driver components contributing to such a score were excessive sedimentation and changes in trophic status with distance downstream. Site 3 (Dwars River) a tributary to the Steelpoort River was still largely natural. The findings of this study indicated that the Steelpoort River is in the similar ecological class in terms of water quality as prior to construction of the De Hoop Dam and the bulk water transfer pipeline. The water quality within the Steelpoort River however deteriorated during construction mainly due to the addition of sediment loads. It was therefore recommended that further studies be carried out within the Steelpoort River on macro-invertebrate response and the habitat integrity to increase the level of confidence of results obtained in this study.
