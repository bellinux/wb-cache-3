He <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> refreshing <b>quality</b> of romanticism - as Abdul Karim Khan did to his Kirana gharana and Faiyaz Khan did to his Agra gharana. And thereby, he evolved a style which was marked not only by the discipline and purity of Alladiya Khan's music but also the subtlety and fecundity of his own imagination. Mohan Nadkarni ...|$|R

5000|$|The stadium {{was known}} as El Sadar, after a river near the stadium, [...] from 1967 to 2005 and again since 2011. From 2005 to 2011 the stadium was called Reyno de Navarra by its sponsor, the Government of Navarre, using the medieval Spanish {{spelling}} reyno instead of the modern reino ("kingdom", derived from rey, [...] "king") which <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> somehow archaic touch.|$|R
60|$|The words set me in {{the very}} best of humours, and to that it may be due that presently, as I warmed to my narrative, I <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> vigour that drew His Majesty out of his wonted apathy and listlessness.

60|$|Low as {{the words}} had been spoken, Elfride had heard them, and awaited Stephen's reply in breathless silence, if that could be called silence where Elfride's dress, at each throb of her heart, shook and {{indicated}} <b>it</b> like <b>a</b> pulse-glass, rustling also against the wall in reply to the same throbbing.

5000|$|Since {{none of the}} Pythons spoke German sufficiently, Woitkewitsch {{needed to}} provide them with phonetic transcriptions of the skits, which they then needed to learn by heart. Terry Jones recalls that this posed a {{considerable}} challenge to the troupe; he also mentions that because of the rigorous repetition required in production, he is still able to recite the German version of The Lumberjack Song. Despite the coaching and re-iterative translation efforts, the Pythons' accents remained rather strong, and according to Woitkewitsch the overall pacing was off. While these language issues {{may have contributed to the}} first show's weak critical reception, Woitkewitsch suggests that they also <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "secret charm".|$|R

50|$|The barbican {{church was}} built of stone: unheated, single-storeyed, single-domed. Beneath {{it were the}} holy gates with two bays, one large and one small. At first, it was {{intended}} to sanctify two seats within the church: one in the name of St Nicholas, and the other for Alexius. The ground floor had no external decorations and was subsumed in the wall surrounding the convent. The upper level was occupied by the church. <b>Its</b> four windows <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> residential appearance. The facade of the upper level was richly decorated with half-columns and architraves with Russian baroque gables, typically {{in the style of the}} early 18th century. The church's dome was made in the classical style.|$|R
50|$|The festival was {{originated}} by a {{small group}} of talented musical, visual and theatrical artists who settled in McCall in the mid-1970s. Drawn to the area because of its sheer natural beauty and, at that time, cheap rent. With the efforts of this unique blend of Raggle-Taggle-Hippies who loved music and family-type gatherings, the free-form nature of this event <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> special charm that persists to this day. Calling themselves “The Music Circus”. Original members flaunted colorful names such as “Mr. Crow”, “Jazmo”, “Pretty Peggy”, “Beeboo”, “TP Nancy”, “Sweet Sue” and “Big Bear” to name a few. This unique congregation was the nucleus of a cultural movement at that time. A movement that was maybe in contrast to, but generally accepted by the numerous loggers and long time ranchers already established in Long Valley.|$|R

5000|$|... "For Julius Streicher the Jews {{hatred for}} Christianity was {{concealed}} only for one reason: Business." [...] Jewish businessmen were often portrayed as doing almost anything to obtain financial wealth which included, in his words, [...] "become a usurer, a traitor, a murderer". In {{the summer of}} 1931, Streicher focused much of the papers attention on a Jewish owned butchery. One philanthropic merchant operated a soup kitchen; Der Stürmer ran articles accusing the business of poisoning the food served. Der Stürmer criticized and twisted every single price increase and decrease in Jewish shops, {{as well as their}} charitable donations as a further form of financial greed. This attack on Jewish benevolence received the most public criticism out of all of Der Stürmers antisemitic propaganda. Its [...] "Letter Box" [...] encouraged the reporting of Jewish illegal acts; the unofficial style helped prevent suspicion of propaganda, and <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> air of authenticity.|$|R
60|$|Even in {{the middle}} of the last century the grist mill, a couple of miles from Lewes, {{although}} it was at most but fifty or sixty years old, had all a look of weather-beaten age, for the cypress shingles, of which it was built, ripen in a few years of wind and weather to a silvery, hoary gray, and the white powdering of flour <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> look as though the dust of ages had settled upon it, making the shadows within dim, soft, mysterious. A dozen willow trees shaded with dappling, shivering ripples of shadow the road before the mill door, and the mill itself, and the long, narrow, shingle-built, one-storied, hip-roofed dwelling house. At the time of the story the mill had descended in a direct line of succession to Hiram White, the grandson of old Ephraim White, who had built it, it was said, in 1701.|$|R
60|$|The {{beginning}} of the quarrel was trivial enough. But by the end they got to generalities. Lewisham had begun the day in a bad temper and under the cloud of an overnight passage of arms--and a little incident {{that had nothing to}} do with their ostensible difference <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> warmth of emotion quite beyond its merits. As he emerged through the folding doors he saw a letter lying among the sketchily laid breakfast things, and Ethel's attitude suggested the recoil of a quick movement; the letter suddenly dropped. Her eyes met his and she flushed. He sat down and took the letter--a trifle awkwardly perhaps. It was from Miss Heydinger. He hesitated with it halfway to his pocket, then decided to open <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> displayed <b>an</b> ample amount of reading, and he read. On the whole he thought <b>it</b> rather <b>a</b> dull sort of letter, but he did not allow this to appear. When it was read he put it carefully in his pocket.|$|R
60|$|He led {{me where}} the ravine opened wide. I felt, rather than saw, a steep slope beneath. Far down was a great patch of fire. <b>It</b> was like <b>a</b> crazy quilt, here dark, there light, with streaks and stars and streams of fire shining out of the blackness. Masses of slow-moving smoke {{overhung}} the brighter areas. The night robbed the forest fire of its fierceness and <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> kind of glory. The fire had ceased to move; it had spent its force, run its race, and was now dying. But I could not forget what it had been, what it had done. Thousands of acres of magnificent pines had perished. The shade and color and beauty of {{that part of the}} forest had gone. The heart of the great trees was now slowly rolling away in those dark, weird clouds of smoke. I was sad for the loss and sick with fear for Dick and Hiram.|$|R

50|$|Elements {{within the}} party also {{expressed}} support for Nazism, and a paramilitary arm, Spearhead, {{was set up by}} Tyndall. Spearhead had initially been set up as group aimed at establishing the BNP outside London although its very youthful membership soon <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> more violent character. Colin Jordan, who would later become a fierce critic of Tyndall would later suggest that Spearhead was set up as much to get Tyndall {{out of the way as}} anything else. The party also hosted a summer camp on Fountaine's land and this grew into an international event, beginning in 1961 when delegates attended from the National States' Rights Party and the Nordic Reich Party amongst others. In early 1962 Oswald Mosley had approached both Jordan and Bean and had offered them positions as national organisers within his group, which would subsume the BNP. However the plan was rejected as neither man had faith in Mosley whilst the two were increasingly on a collision course within the BNP itself.|$|R
60|$|This {{resolution}} prevailed so far, that no {{time was}} let slip {{to get everything}} in readiness {{to go with the}} first ship. As to his money, he always kept that locked up by him, unless he sometimes <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> to <b>a</b> friend without interest, for he had a mortal hatred to all sorts of usury or extortion. His books, of which he had a considerable quantity, and some of them very good ones, together with his other equipage, he got packed up, that nothing might be wanting against the first opportunity.|$|R
50|$|Sydney Dobell {{was also}} famous {{as an early}} breeder of deerhounds. One was {{given to him by}} Mr Ronald McDonald of Skye.

Later generations of his deerhounds were painted by Sydney Dobell's brother-in-law, Briton Rivière, notably in The empty chair, which was first exhibited at the Dudley Gallery, London, in 1869. It was bought for a geat deal of money by Howard Dobell, his uncle. It was owned in 1924 by Ralph Dobell, Brooklands, Cheltenham who <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> to <b>an</b> exhibition at Cheltenham Art Gallery & Museum.|$|R

40|$|What {{is to be}} done? The {{sense of}} urgency {{provoked}} by this question, its apparent injunction to act, its utterance at times of political upheaval and crises have <b>lent</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> privileged political status. What is to be done? {{is a question that}} marks the moment when thought appears to be over and action must proceed. This article considers how the grammar of this question produces relationships between subjects, action and the future, drawing a relationship between the constituent grammar of the question and Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s notion of the collective assemblage of enunciation. For Deleuze and Guattari, the collective assemblage of enunciation denotes amongst other things an immanent relationship between language and action: a relationship in which politics and language are bound together in a relationship of forces. This approach aims to rethink the urgency and force that is associated with the question through examining and re-proposing the connection between the linguistic organisation of the question and the different forms of political organisation that the question might produce. In so doing, Deleuze and Guattari provide a conceptual and linguistic apparatus for rethinking the plane of political action and organisation...|$|R
