500|$|Paine's book {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} early eighteenth-century British deism. These deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in The Age of Reason. The most important position that united the early deists was their call for [...] "free rational inquiry" [...] into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on freedom of conscience, they demanded religious toleration and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a Newtonian worldview, and they believed all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature. [...] Without a concept of natural law, the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of miracles. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the first cause or prime mover, had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to (miraculously) intervene in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious Truth or [...] "one true faith"; religion could only be [...] "simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal" [...] if it was to be the <b>logical</b> <b>product</b> of a benevolent God. They therefore distinguished between [...] "revealed religions" [...] (which they rejected), such as Christianity, and [...] "natural religion", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (they were, thus, not atheists).|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years, {{tremendous}} {{progress has been}} achieved {{in the development of}} methods for a posteriori error control and grid adaptation related to numerical methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It turned out that sophisticated adaptivity techniques are a key ingredient for fast and reliable numerical simulations. Hereby, the emphasis has been put on methods utilising selective refinement of grid cells (h-adaptivity) according to estimated error distributions. However, this leads to highly unstructured grids which decrease the numerical efficiency of an FEM code as these grids require many unaligned and costly memory accesses during the program run. Because of this, {{only a small fraction of}} the theoretically available CPU-power can be used in practical computations. Our FEM library FEAST [1, 2] potentially overcomes this difficulty by using grids consisting of multiple <b>logical</b> tensor <b>product</b> grids. <b>Logical</b> tensor <b>product</b> grids are grids which are topologically equivalent to a tensor product mesh, i. e. every inner node has exactly four neighbouring mesh nodes (cf. Figure 1). These meshes unfortunately prevent applying standard h-adaptivity techniques. As a remedy, we apply patchwise h-adaptivity techniques and, more important, grid deformation methods (r-adaptivity) which relocate the grid points preserving the <b>logical</b> tensor <b>product</b> structure of the underlying mesh [3, 4]. In this article, we give an overview over the adaptivity and error control techniques applied in FEAST and compare them regarding the quality of the simulation. This is done by considering several prototypical test examples...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to examine superior operations strategy, {{through the lens}} of resource procurement, as a dynamic compound of the industrial organisation (IO) and resource-based view (RBV) applications in close alignment with a firm’s underlying organisational conditions. The concept of operations strategy has led to different competing paradigms. Reconciliation of IO and the RBV, and re-examination of context-content links in the field are necessary. This research has been conducted through a longitudinal case study. A critical event separates it from earlier related triangulation research. The findings suggest that the combined application of IO and the RBV, supported by several embedded dynamic and unique organisational conditions subject to organisational internal and external effects, would compound the characteristics of an operations strategy that would affect the performance of resource procurement. The operations strategy generates competitive advantages which are often idiosyncratic, and influences timely procurement of long-term strategic supplies and the organisational competitiveness position, which are not necessarily the <b>logical</b> <b>products</b> of a pertaining competition context. A firm’s capability or knowledge assets in managing the interfaces of the organisational internal and external effects is crucial to explain the performance of the operations strategy. This paper suggests that the reconciliation of the RBV and IO can even sustain a firm’s performance during downturns. This can contribute to an area of operations management that has not yet received enough attention...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{development}} into an independent university-based programme, interior design has {{drawn from the}} arts and engineering disciplines {{in the formulation of}} its pedagogical approach. This paper discusses interior design studio pedagogy at a private university in Indonesia, in which design methodologies in interior design studios have over the years employed the common sequential steps in design developed from architecture studios, interior design text books and professional experiences. While this linear programmatic approach has yielded <b>logical</b> <b>products</b> that could be applied to pragmatic spaces like residences and offices, they are insufficient in accommodating ambiguous and complex ideas essential in cultural spaces. This is due to their conventional forms that are results of direct extrusion from 2 -d layout plans, general use of materials and appearances of being a mere “site of containments” inside the architectural frame. The paper further elaborates on the use of an alternative design method via 3 -d experiments that was trialed to overcome the inhibition of creative-intuitive processes caused by the former approach. Through observation of the design process and final products of several students, it is concluded that the new method has supported a holistic mind-mapping approach in design, essential in three-dimensional disciplines like interior design, supporting creativity in terms of the novelty of forms and innovative use of materials as well as the sensitivity in connecting the interior to the architectural structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to elicit the {{requirements}} for an environment that supports the specification of system families. The prototype of the environment is to be developed and validated. Systems that cover the same application domain share a set of common capabilities and entities. Instead of separately developing systems within the domain, the commonalities and variablities of the system family can be initially identified and captured within a domain model. For developing a single system the domain model is then be instantiated with the specific requirements. The con struction of variants within a system family hence becomes easier and faster. The specification of system families should be tool supported. In this thesis, a selection of exist ing domain analysis methods is examined to elicit requirements for such a tool, the Customizable Domain Analysis Environment (CDAE). The produced artifacts and the underlying process of each examined domain analysis method are describ ed. The results of the analysis are brought together to identify a common <b>logical</b> <b>product</b> model for domain analysis methods. The model is validated using a mapping to a common process of domain analysis methods that has been published by Arrango [2].

It is shown that {{the architecture of the}} CDAE allows easily extensions and adaptations. The flexibility enables the CDAE to support a large number of domain analysis methods. The tool development contribution of this work is embodied by a subsystem of the CDAE that supports the modelling of scenarios. The integration of scenarios into the CDAE is also an example of what is to do to extend the initial version of the environment.
