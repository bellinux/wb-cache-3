50|$|The Olympians are {{a race of}} extra-dimensional {{beings that}} possess a variety of mystical superhuman {{abilities}} that were once worshipped by civilizations centered on or around the Mediterranean, Agean, Ionian, Tyrrhenian and <b>Ligurian</b> <b>seas</b> such as Greece, the Roman Empire and parts of Egypt and Turkey as gods from roughly 2500 BC until roughly 500 AD. The Olympians are related to every other pantheon of gods that have ever been worshiped on Earth, such as the Asgardians and the Gods of Heliopolis (ancient Egypt) because Gaea, the spirit that represents life on Earth, {{was the mother of}} the first race of gods to appear on Earth. The various pantheons that exist today are the descendants of these earlier gods. It is believed that the Olympians were born somewhere on Earth but currently reside in another dimension that is adjacent to Earth known as Olympus.

5|$|Although the <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Sea</b> was by {{this stage}} largely French {{territorial}} waters, after the Royal Navy had destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile off Egypt in 1798, the British in fact controlled {{it and the}} whole Mediterranean Sea. By 1801 British bases at Gibraltar, Menorca and Malta allowed British naval forces to cruise throughout the sea largely unopposed; their presence forced {{the remnants of the}} French fleet based at Toulon to make short journeys between French bases to avoid interception and capture. It was therefore not until a large French squadron under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume briefly asserted regional naval superiority that a French expeditionary force was able to secure Elba. They sailed from Piombino on 2 May 1801 with 1,500 men under General Jean Victor Tharreau, who landed unopposed at the Neapolitan town of Porto Longone.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte {{advanced}} into Italy, achieving victories {{against the}} Austrian Empire {{at the battle}} of Marengo. After a year of warfare, the French and Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, which divided Northern Italy between the states and awarded the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to the French. Included in this division was the island of Elba in the <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Sea</b> off the Western Italian coast, which at that time was shared between Tuscany and the Kingdom of Naples. On 28 March 1801, the Treaty of Florence was signed between Naples and France, officially turning the entirety of Elba over to French control, although it had not yet been surrendered by its Neapolitan and Tuscan commanders.|$|E
5|$|Although Bonaparte had not {{expected}} British interference in his operations against Egypt, the Royal Navy had responded to the reports of French mobilisation on the south coast by despatching a small squadron to the <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Sea</b> under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Arriving on 21 May, Nelson's squadron {{was struck by a}} severe storm and was forced to make hasty repairs off Sardinia. The storm had also dispersed the squadron's frigates, leaving Nelson with only three ships of the line. Although he was reinforced by another ten ships of the line and a fourth rate on 7 June, he still lacked any scouts and was thus severely hampered in his ability to search for information on French operations. The detached frigates had been scattered across the Western Mediterranean, and were unable to locate either the British or the French fleets. Reinforcements sent by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent at the Tagus River suffered from the same problem, the frigates spreading out widely in their search but failing to discover either of the main British or French forces, which were rapidly sailing southeastwards towards Alexandria.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the first}} half of August 2002, a {{sequence}} of extreme precipitation episodes affected many regions of central and southern Europe, culminating {{in one of the most}} severe flooding events ever experienced along sections of the river Elbe and its tributaries. In this paper, the synoptic meteorological situation during the primary flooding event, 11 - 13 August 2002, and its recent background is illustrated and discussed. Then, backward trajectory modelling of water vapour transport is employed to determine the sources and transport pathways of the moisture which rained out during the event. The Lagrangian trajectory model FLEXTRA is used together with high resolution operational meteorological analyses from the ECMWF to track a very large number of trajectories, initialized in a dense three-dimensional grid array over the extreme rainfall region. Specific humidity changes along each trajectory are mapped out to yield source-receptor relationships between evaporation and subsequent precipitation for the event. Regions of significant surface evaporation of moisture which later rained out were determined to be parts of the Aegean and <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Seas</b> during the initial stages of the event, while strong evaporation from eastern European land surfaces and from the Black Sea became dominant later on. The method also provides precipitation estimates based solely on specific humidity changes along Lagrangian airmass trajectories, which can be compared to ECMWF model forecast precipitation estimates...|$|R
40|$|A catch {{assessment}} {{survey to}} monitor the landed elasmobranchs was enforced at the Viareggio harbour, the more important fishing port of the Tyrrhenian and <b>Ligurian</b> <b>seas.</b> Monthly data of catches by species and gear, size structure of the catches and spatial information on fishing effort distribution were collected over the period 1990 - 2001. Data on catch rates and geographical distribution of species were also collected with trawl-surveys carried out {{each year in the}} same area in the period 1985 - 2001. For the most important chondrichthyan species, the distribution of the fishing effort for every main fishing strategy was compared with catch rates of trawl surveys. The analysed species were two batoids: Raja asterias and Raja clavata and two sharks: Scyliorhinus canicula and Galeus melastomus. The catch rates trends derived from fishery independent and fishery dependent sources resulted not in agreement probably due to spatial shifts in the effort allocation that occurred as a consequence of changes in the target of some fisheries. The current level of fishing pressure and fishing pattern seems sustainable for all the studied species. This can be related to a light fishing pressure on some grounds where certain species are concentrated, to the discard at sea of an important fraction of the individuals caught as well as to life history characteristics of each single species that make them more or less sensitive to enhancements in fishing mortality...|$|R
5|$|Bonaparte's armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May 1798, making rapid {{progress}} through the <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Sea</b> and collecting more ships at Genoa, before sailing southwards along the Sardinian coast and passing Sicily on 7 June. On 9 June, the fleet arrived off Malta, then under the ownership of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, ruled by Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim. Bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to the fortified harbour of Valletta. When the Knights refused, the French general responded by ordering a large scale invasion of the Maltese Islands, overrunning the defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing. The Knights formally surrendered on 12 June and, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, handed the islands and all of their resources over to Bonaparte, including the extensive property of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta. Within a week, Bonaparte had resupplied his ships, and on 19 June, his fleet departed for Alexandria {{in the direction of}} Crete, leaving 4,000 men at Valletta under General Claude-Henri Vaubois to ensure French control of the islands.|$|E

Biology of the species along southern and southeastern parts of the basin such as off Libya, Algeria, and northern Egypt, is unclear due to lacks of scientific approaches although whales have been confirmed off the furthermost of the basin such as along in shore waters of Levantine Sea including Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus.

40|$|A {{program to}} monitor {{commercial}} elasmobranchs {{was put into}} effect at Viareggio, the most important fishing port of the Tyrrhenian and <b>Ligurian</b> <b>seas.</b> Size structure of the catches and spatial information on fishing effort distribution were collected monthly by species and gear over the period 1990 – 2001. Data on catch rates and geographical distribution were also obtained from annual research trawl surveys during 1985 – 2001 {{in the same area}} that the fish landed at Viareggio were caught. The distribution of the fishing effort for every major fishery was compared with catch rates of research trawl surveys for the more important elasmobranch species; two batoids, Raja asterias and Raja clavata and two sharks, Scyliorhinus canicula and Galeus melastomus. Trends in catch rates derived from fishery independent and fishery dependent sources appear inconsistent. This is probably due to spatial shifts in the effort allocation of the fisheries as a consequence of changes in target species that occurred during the analysed period. The current level of fishing pressure and fishing pattern, that remained almost unchanged for the last 10 years, seems sustainable for each one of the four species studied. This may be related to a relatively low fishing pressure on some grounds where certain spe-cies are concentrated, to the discarding of a portion of the individuals caught as well as to life history characteristics of some species that make them less sensitive to increased fishing mortality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During a deep-penetration {{multichannel}} seismic cruise, the North Tyrrhenian basin was investigated. This basin has {{a shallow}} Moho along the Italian coast. Two kinds of dipping reflections {{were identified in}} the crust. The westward-dipping reflections are interpreted as Apennines or/and Alpine thrusts whereas the eastward-dipping reflections may be the seismic expression ofextensional detachments. The deep part of the 10 km thick Corsica Basin is well imaged on the continental shelf. This basin was formed before or during {{the opening of the}} Balearic-Ligurian basin and is related to the collapse of the Alpine Corsica belt. We emphasize the active role of plutonic bodies that rise from a 3 km depth during the mid-Pliocene. The thinning of the North Tyrrhenian crust could be explained by a delamination f the Adriatic lithosphere that re reats towards the east. The formation of extensional basins in conver-gent setting is a major problem of Earth sciences (Faccena et al. 1996). In the past years formation of marginal basins behind subduction zones was the best explanation for extensional tectonics. Indentation theory was an alternate hypothesis to explain extension in the collided plate. In recent years several studies highlighted the col-lapse of former orogens to explain the extension. The Mediterranean Sea is an ideal place to study the formation of extensional basins that were fully developed in the Western Mediterranean basins (Balearic and <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Seas)</b> with early Miocene emplacement of oceanic crust. The North Tyrrhenian Basin is underlain by conti-nental basement and its evolution is very recent (late Miocene to Pliocene). Consequently in this region we can study the young extensional pro-cesses that are inactive in the others basins of th...|$|R

This remote monitoring system of the sea, called OSIS ® (Ocean Seismic - Integrated Solution), is a pilot project and will be presented in its main features. The main advantage of the OS-IS® is that it is installed inland and there are no parts in the sea. The key elements of the system are a high sensitivity accelerometers and apposite algorithms for the evaluation of the sea state using the micro-seismic signals {{on the basis of the}} mathematical models and the appropriate calibration factors. Actually, since the beginning of the 1900, is well known that the sea waves are sources of a microseismic noise and this phenomenon has been described with more and more precise models since the 1950 by Longuet-Higgins. The OS-IS® system used for "Wind, Ports and Sea" project is made of three micro-seismic stations installed near the La Spezia gulf: each accelerometric station is equipped with a weather station and a data logger that automatically transfers the data to a central server which runs the algorithm of the OS-IS®. In the following will be shortly described the installed systems focusing on its reliability and in the comparison with the traditional monitoring system using buoy. Finally the first measurements will be shown in comparison with those of the conventional method based on the buoys...|$|R
5|$|On 19 May 1798, a French fleet {{departed}} Toulon for a {{top secret}} destination. The force consisted of 22 warships and 120 transports, {{to be joined}} by additional forces from Genoa, Corsica and Civitavecchia as it passed south through the <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Sea.</b> The fleet's target was Egypt, a territory nominally controlled by the Ottoman Empire that French General Napoleon Bonaparte considered an ideal springboard for operations against British India. Passing southwards without interference from the Royal Navy, which had been absent from the Mediterranean for over a year following the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain, Bonaparte's convoy passed Sicily on 7 June and two days later was at anchor off the harbour of Valletta on Malta. The island nation of Malta was under the command of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, a religious order that depended on France for much of its wealth and recruits. Bonaparte believed that capturing Malta was essential to controlling the Central Mediterranean, and when Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim refused the fleet entry to the harbour, Bonaparte responded with a large scale invasion. The knights put up no resistance, although fighting against native Maltese troops lasted for 24 hours until the central city of Mdina fell. With this defeat the knights withdrew to their fortress at Valletta but were persuaded to surrender the following day with promises of pensions and estates in France.|$|E
5|$|When news reached Bonaparte that Ganteaume had {{returned}} to Toulon for a second time, he once again issued orders for the admiral {{to go to sea}} and fulfill his original orders to resupply the Egyptian garrison. On 27 April, the French force sailed for the third time, with seven ships of the line, two frigates, a corvette and two storeships. Before sailing to Egypt Ganteaume first cruised off Elba in the <b>Ligurian</b> <b>Sea,</b> achieving regional superiority long enough that a force was able to cross to the island from Piombino, rapidly subduing all but the fortress of Porto Ferrajo, which was besieged. Ganteaume's ships bombarded the fortress on 6 May, but an outbreak of typhus in the squadron significantly reduced its operational effectiveness. Ganteaume therefore divided his force, taking four ships with healthy crews south, while Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole were all too undermanned to perform efficiently, and were sent back to Toulon. Having reorganised his force, Ganteaume passed through the Straits of Messina on 25 May. On 5 June off Brindisi, the squadron sighted and chased the British frigate HMS Pique under Captain James Young, which was able to effect an escape to Alexandria and warn Keith of Ganteaume's approach. A planned rendezvous off Brindisi with three Neapolitan frigates did not occur, and by 7 June the squadron was close enough to Egypt for Ganteaume to send his corvette Héliopolis to investigate the situation at Alexandria.|$|E
