50|$|The Australian Silver Kangaroo is a one {{troy ounce}} silver bullion coin minted by the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra, Australia. They have {{legal tender status}} in Australia and are one of few legal tender bullion silver coins to change their design every year.

500|$|Beginning in 1895, Oregonians {{proposed}} {{honoring the}} centennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a fair {{to be held in}} Portland, a city located along the party's route. [...] In 1900, a committee of Portland business men began to plan for the event, an issue of stock was successful in late 1901, and construction began in 1903. [...] A long drive to gain federal government support succeeded when President Theodore Roosevelt signed an appropriations bill on April 13, 1904. [...] This bill allocated $500,000 to exposition authorities, and also authorized a gold dollar to commemorate the fair, with the design and inscriptions left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury.

5000|$|There are {{collector}} {{versions of}} the America the Beautiful 5 ounce Silver Bullion Coin Program which debuted in December 10, 2010. They feature an uncirculated finish and contain a ‘P’ mintmark indicating they were struck at the US Mint’s facility in Philadelphia. The bullion coins were also struck in Philadelphia but contain no mintmark. The United States Mint struck these coins late in 2010 with an extremely <b>limited</b> <b>mintage</b> of only 27,000. The Mint apparently had insufficient time to strike more {{before the end of}} the year owing to initial production difficulties with both America the Beautiful Five Ounce Coin series. This forced the Mint to only release these Hot Springs Coins the following year on April 28, 2011. Demand was intense in the first hours of availability with collectors ordering 19,000 of them in the first nine hours. Within two weeks, the Mint indicated a sell-out of the <b>limited</b> <b>mintage</b> strikes. Each coin's price is determined by the current value of silver and the 2010 issues sold for $279.95. Many subsequent issues have even lower mintages and higher secondary market values. These 5 oz. silver quarters are the [...] "Big Boys'" [...] quarter collection and due to their low mintage, have increased their value over issue price, even in the face of declining silver prices.|$|E
5000|$|The Royal Canadian Mint commemorated this by {{creating}} a 1/20th ounce gold coin. The coin was released in October 2006 and was composed of 99.99% pure gold.

Obverse: Queen Elizabeth II. Reverse: the royal monogram (4 double [...] "L"s) surmounted by a crown with fleur de lis and the motto [...] "CHRS REGN VINC IMP" [...] (Christus regnat, vincit, et imperat. Latin > [...] "Christ reigns, conquers and commands"). Engravers: Royal Canadian Mint engravers.|$|E

As evidence of the collecting craze, three extensive reference works on the indexing and collecting of provincial tokens were published before 1800 by Pye (first edition in 1795), Birchall (1796), and Conder (1798).
