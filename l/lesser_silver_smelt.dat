5000|$|As for technology, {{reconstruction}} {{indicates a}} culture of the late Neolithic bordering on the early Bronze Age, with tools and weapons very likely composed of [...] "natural bronze" [...] (i.e., made from copper ore naturally rich in silicon or arsenic). Silver and gold were known, but not <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> (as PIE has no word for lead, a by-product of <b>silver</b> <b>smelting),</b> thus suggesting that silver was imported. Sheep were kept for wool, and textiles were woven. The wheel was known, certainly for ox-drawn wagons.|$|R

Renowned for its {{important}} <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> site in the Tang Dynasty, the output of gold and silver in the ancient time and the golden streams running through the mountains, it was named Jinxi (golden stream). Some <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> relic sites and relevant inscriptions which were the earliest physically written record in ancient China's mining and metallurgy have still remained in the county.

40|$|Introduction: Two fish species, {{the greater}} <b>silver</b> <b>smelt</b> Argentina silus and the roundnose {{grenadier}} Coryphaenoides rupestris, are highly {{abundant in the}} deep-water areas of the Skagerrak. Since the 1970 s, a small aimed trawl fishery for the smelt has developed and now also some grenadier is landed. The biology and general distribution of both species have been described from the Skagerrak and elsewhere. Due to their benthopelagic distribution at depths from 200 to 700 m, previous attempts at estimating abundance and biomass of the Skagerrak concentrations yielded unsatisfactory results. In April 1992, during what appears as a major spawning season of the greater <b>silver</b> <b>smelt,</b> abundance estimation by the SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder and integrator was attempted. Comparisons were made between observations made by the hull-mounted transducer and a transducer mounted in a newly developed towed body...|$|R
50|$|There are no {{specific}} archaeological accounts about <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> or mining in the Andes {{prior to the}} Incas. However, silver and lead artefacts {{have been found in}} the Peruvian central highlands dated in the pre-Inca and Inca periods. From the presence of lead in silver artefacts, archaeologists suggest that cupellation may have occurred there.|$|R

5000|$|Lead, {{a product}} of the ancient <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> process, was {{produced}} in the Roman Empire with an estimated peak production of 80,000 metric tons per year - a truly industrial scale. The metal was used along with other materials in the vast water supply network of the Romans for the manufacture of water pipes, particularly for urban plumbing.|$|R
50|$|Argentina silus (synonymous with Salmo silus) is {{also known}} as Atlantic argentine, great <b>silver</b> <b>smelt,</b> greater argentine, herring smelt or simply smelt. It is a {{northern}} Atlantic herring smelt and can be found at depths from 140 to 1440 m. This species reaches a length of 70.0 cm SL. It is of commercial importance and it is used as seafood.|$|R
50|$|Agustín Edwards {{was born}} in La Serena, the son of George Edwards Brown and Isabel Ossandón Iribarren. At the age of 19, he started to manage the <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> {{operations}} owned by his father in the cities of Vallenar and Freirina. In 1837, {{by the age of}} 22, he became independent and moved to the city of Copiapó, with a small capital he had managed to save.|$|R
5|$|Rome's {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} Europe {{and across the}} Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era, with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes. Like their predecessors, the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by-product of <b>silver</b> <b>smelting.</b> Lead mining occurred in Central Europe, Britain, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, and Hispania, the latter accounting for 40% of world production.|$|R
50|$|A German silver smelter and adventurer Burchard Kranich ran a <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> house between 1556 and 1583. The house cost £300 {{to build}} and to fund the house he {{borrowed}} money from Mary Tudor, William Godolphin and several others. The mill, used for crushing ore, had a leat of 2000 paces, and the melting house, for refining the silver, was sited at what is now Fen Cottage and Fen Field {{which used to be}} known as Fining. At least 2,000 ounces of <b>silver</b> were <b>smelted</b> with ore coming from mines in Tregadoke, Padstow, St Delion, Portysyke, Peran and St Columb. In 1573 Queen Elizabeth ordered that a rate be levied for rebuilding the bridge in to aid production of silver.|$|R

By {{the second half of}} the 16th century the ore deposits near the surface were exhausted and mining largely ground to a standstill. During the Thirty Years' War mining operations ceased completely.|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a European Union (UE) contract and with voluntary participation of commercial fishing vessels, a discard sampling programme based on stratified random sampling by fisheries covered the activities of trawl and long line Spanish fleets fishing in ICES Subarea VII in 1994. Discards of commercial and non-commercial species, including species of pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, caught incidentally were estimated in kg per fishing hour by ICES rectangle and depth stratum in 1994. The sampling programme was carried out by observers on board commercial fishing vessels during normal fishing activity. A total of 238 species caught by trawlers and 76 by long liners were determined. The comparison of the two fleets regarding their ratios of discards in 1994 shows that the larger percentages of discards relative to total catches are found in the trawl fisheries (48 %) and around 50 % are primarily due to the discards of three species of fish and one of crustacea. Seasonal variation in the case of discards of the two main species (Great <b>Silver</b> <b>Smelt</b> and Horse Mackerei) was observed. The depth at which discards were hig lies between 200 and 400 m. Conversely, long line fishing in Subarea VII shows a lower discard rate than that of trawlers (10 %). Approximately 60 % of discards primarily comprise two species of fish, Blue Whiting and Great <b>Silver</b> <b>Smelt,</b> both of which show the highest discard value per f. h. in the 3 rd quarter. No differences were observed by depth strata...|$|R

50|$|The Karachipampa {{lead and}} <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> {{facility}} in Potosí {{was built to}} be the nation's largest smelter. Completed in 1984, Karachipampa employed Soviet technology but was constructed by a Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) company.

In 2010, protests by the Potosí Civic Committee demanded its activation. Following Atlas Precious Metals' unsuccessful efforts to open and operate the plant, Comibol resumed control of the plant in January 2011. , Comibol promises to begin its operation in November; one-quarter of the production at the San Cristóbal mine is pledged as input to the facility.|$|R

50|$|Ward's immense {{wealth and}} {{business}} interests were so large {{at the time}} of his death that it is said that hardly any town of any importance in the Midwest was not affected by his death. His capital was so large and vast that it took several different accountings to figure it out. His businesses extended through several States reaching from Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico. His businesses were chiefly invested in iron, silver and copper mines, pine lands, sawmills, in rolling mills, <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> works, railroads, farming lands, and glass works. Ward was nominally the wealthiest man in the whole Midwest {{at the time of}} his death. His capital was estimated anywhere from about $7,000,000 to about $22,000.000. Realistically about $10,000,000 was all that was obtained from his estate when it was ultimately cashed out. It was not enough to cover all the liabilities Ward entailed.|$|R
