5|$|Altgens {{and former}} Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston {{a short time}} later. Connally told Altgens that he also had been called to testify and {{received}} airfare, but he decided to cash the check and spend the money. Connally pressed Altgens to spend his as well. Altgens <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> {{that they were not}} required to attend.|$|E
5|$|When {{the wife}} of Chicago {{publisher}} Horace O'Donoghue read him the news of Shepard's death {{four days after the}} event, he picked up a razor and slit his throat. Although his suicide was first thought to be impulsive, it was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that the likely cause was O'Donoghue's large debts to Chicago publishing houses.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, Booth {{learned that}} Lincoln would be {{attending}} {{a performance of}} the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home {{in the attempt to}} kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president did not appear. Booth <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that Lincoln had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington where, coincidentally, Booth was then staying.|$|E

5|$|Shakur's {{attorneys}} {{sought a}} new trial {{on the grounds that}} one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's sequestration order. Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order. McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement. Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.|$|E
5|$|Teller <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> of Oppenheimer's {{solicitation}} and {{his role}} in the Interim Committee's decision to drop the bombs, having secretly endorsed an immediate military use of the new weapons. This was contrary to the impression that Teller had received when he had personally asked Oppenheimer about the Szilard petition: that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Following Teller's discovery of this, his relationship with his advisor began to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|The first {{expedition}} {{to reach the}} geographic South Pole was led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. He and four others arrived at the pole on 14December 1911, five weeks ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott {{as part of the}} Terra Nova Expedition. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.|$|E

5|$|Wentworth Arthur Matthew {{founded the}} Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919. Matthew was {{influenced}} by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular. When Matthew <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them.|$|E
5|$|Woodruff was a {{lover of}} {{classical}} music, and after taking up the organ at university and learning from A. E Floyd, the organist of St Paul's Cathedral, he became the college organist at Queen’s College in Melbourne; he <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> to play the piano. In his spare time, Woodruff continued to pursue his love of pure mathematics, especially number theory. He periodically attempted to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, but failed.|$|E
5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath, {{widow of}} {{publicist}} Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 {{lawsuit against the}} $2,000,000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E
5|$|Klemana Schuetz was {{identified}} as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and fraudster, who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black {{the day before the}} executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians.|$|E

5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> {{that this process}} was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary {{censorship}} of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After {{the start of}} the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the National Academy of Sciences to clear articles. William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post in September 1940 on atomic fission, <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue. The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist Georgy Flyorov wrote to Josef Stalin on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.|$|E
5000|$|Raamo's sister Pomma {{is seriously}} ill, and {{has participated in}} healing ceremonies with Ol-zhaan D’ol Neric, to little avail. Raamo <b>later</b> <b>learns</b> that Neric {{is the one who}} called him [...] "twice chosen".|$|R

5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad {{was aware}} that heavy water {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not {{been aware of the}} connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the {{transport}} of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (<b>later</b> <b>learned</b> to be timed {{to coincide with the}} Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point {{in the middle of the}} North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes. Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.|$|E
50|$|When Troy {{returns to}} New York, she {{is picked up}} at the airport by Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown. Troy <b>later</b> <b>learns</b> her mother is in the {{hospital}} and is taken to see her.|$|R
50|$|Brannum {{was born}} in Sandwich, Illinois in 1910 to a Methodist minister. He {{attended}} Maine Township High School in suburban Chicago, where he played sousaphone in the school's marching band, <b>later</b> <b>learning</b> the bass violin.|$|R
50|$|Maximilian Forte also {{lived in}} Italy, and spent {{extended}} periods in England, {{as well as}} French Polynesia. His first language was Italian, which he continue to speak, in addition to <b>later</b> <b>learning</b> Spanish and French.|$|R
