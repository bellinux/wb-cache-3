5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a <b>lamprophyre.</b> The <b>lamprophyre</b> is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the <b>lamprophyre</b> magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the <b>lamprophyre</b> magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands.

5000|$|Rock {{considered}} <b>lamprophyres</b> {{are part}} of a [...] "clan" [...] of rocks, with similar mineralogy, textures and genesis. <b>Lamprophyres</b> are similar to lamproites and kimberlites. While modern concepts see orangeites, lamproites and kimberlites as separate, a vast majority of <b>lamprophyres</b> have similar origins to these other rock types.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lamprophyres</b> occur {{throughout}} all geologic eras. Archaean examples are {{commonly associated with}} lode gold deposits.

40|$|<b>Lamprophyres</b> are mafit to ultramafic {{porphyritic}} rocks containing phenocrysts of hydrated mafic minerals, namely dark mica (phlogopite, biotite) and amphibole {{that are}} present {{also in the}} matrix and commonly are euhedral or nearly euhedral. On the other side, felsic minerals as various feldspars and feldspathoids, are present only in the matrix sometimes containing also significant amounts of primary carbonates. <b>Lamprophyres</b> are commonly divided into three major groups - (1) calc-alkaline, (2) alkaline, and (3) ultramafic. Some of them {{are closely related to}} kimberlites, lamproites and carbonatites and gradual transitions to these rocks as well as to other non-lamprophyric types do exist. <b>Lamprophyres</b> are volumetricaly minor group of igneous rocks [...] In some respects, however, they are very important, particularly for our understanding of complicated petrogenetic processes in the upper mantle and lower crust, and also diamond or gold prospecting. Significant role in proper <b>lamprophyres</b> classification is played by perception of processes of <b>lamprophyres</b> magmas forming and their possible interaction with crustal material or enrichment by some elements contained in mantle. <b>Lamprophyres</b> may be very similar to normal igneous rocks.

25|$|Rock types {{produced}} by small degrees of partial melting in the Earth's mantle are typically alkaline (Ca, Na), potassic (K) and/or peralkaline (high aluminium to silica ratio). Typically, primitive melts of this composition form <b>lamprophyre,</b> lamproite, kimberlite and sometimes nepheline-bearing mafic rocks such as alkali basalts and essexite gabbros or even carbonatite.|$|E

5000|$|Mitchell {{considered}} the <b>lamprophyres</b> as a [...] "facies" [...] of igneous rocks {{created by a}} set of conditions (generally; late, highly volatile differentiates of other rock types).

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{distinguish}} ancient <b>lamprophyres</b> from other mafic and ultramafic intrusive rock types {{has become increasingly}} important. <b>Lamprophyres</b> {{have been used as}} marker horizons in the mapping of several Precambrian terranes, they have been recognized for decades as possible indicators of gold mineralization, and their presence has implications for the tectonic interpretation of ancient greenstone belts. Whilst fresh, undeformed <b>lamprophyres</b> are readily recognized, metamorphosed, altered and/or deformed examples are more problematical. The intrusive ages of Kambalda <b>lamprophyres</b> are constrained by available field and geochronological evidence, including direct dating of one kersantite, to the period 2684 - 2660 Ma. These rocks therefore belong to the world 2 ̆ 7 s oldest group of alkaline rocks and <b>lamprophyres</b> so far recognized, which also includes contemporaneous examples from Canada, Zimbabwe and, probably, Tanzania. Despite their extreme age and low- to medium-grade regional metamorphic history, these rocks still preserve characteristic lamprophyric textures, chemistry and mineralogy. Only where metamorphism has been overprinted by gold-related alteration and deformation do the <b>lamprophyres</b> cease to be recognizable petrographically. However, their unique chemistry persists and, despite losses of the most mobile elements from presumed magmatic compositions, altered and deformed specimens still retain far higher contents of Sr, K, Ba, Th, Nb, P, Zr and Ce than basalts of the local greenstone succession. Even <b>lamprophyres</b> which have been converted to biotite-plagioclase-carbonate-pyrite schists retain this distinctive chemical signature. During both alteration and metamorphism, 2 ̆ 7 mobile 2 ̆ 7 elements (K, Rb, Sr, Ba) display far larger changes than archetypal 2 ̆ 7 immobile 2 ̆ 7 elements (Ce, Nb, Zr, P, Ti), clearly sanctioning traditional preference for the latter in assessing altered rocks. However, the surprising loss of Nb during biotitization of hornblende indicates that negative Nb anomalies, conventionally regarded as indicators of subduction-related magmatism, can also be induced purely by alteration processes...|$|R
25|$|Zircon is {{a common}} {{accessory}} to trace mineral constituent of most granite and felsic igneous rocks.

Zircon is rare within mafic rocks and very rare within ultramafic rocks aside {{from a group of}} ultrapotassic intrusive rocks such as kimberlites, carbonatites, and <b>lamprophyre,</b> where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.|$|E
25|$|Shiprock is {{composed}} of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock called minette, or <b>lamprophyre.</b> It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the volcanic breccia formed in a diatreme. The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but it was exposed after {{millions of years of}} erosion. Wall-like sheets of minette, known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the minette establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of minette and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this volcanic field.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} of K2 and Broad Peak, {{and the area}} westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the K2 Gneiss {{and part of the}} Karakroam Metamorphic Complex. The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers, who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the Gilkey-Puchoz sequence, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and south spur of K2, <b>lamprophyre</b> dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.|$|E
