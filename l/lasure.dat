40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the base material of the coating systems for wood durability when we exposed them to external conditions. The theoretical part is devoted to wood durability and weather resistance with {{a detailed description of the}} tests the durability of coating systems. A substantial part of the theory is devoted to description binder component of the coating material. In the practical part was performed the experiment, which examined {{the influence of the}} thickness of the coating system, the type of coating material (paint or <b>lasure)</b> as well as the type of binder (water dispersion with an alkyd or acrylic resin, respectively solution coating system with the alkyd resin). All coating systems were exposed to natural and artificial durability tests. The criterions for evaluation were chosen differences of colours...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare Japanese and Belgian {{elementary}} school pupils' (lack of) activation of real-world knowledge during understanding and solving arithmetic word problems in a school context. The word problem test used in a study by Verschaffel, De Corte, and <b>Lasure</b> (1994) was collectively administered to 91 Japanese fifth graders. Besides standard problems which can be modeled in a straightforward way by one or two basic arithmetic operations with the given numbers, this test contained a series of problematic items which cannot be modeled and solved in such a way, at least if one seriously takes into account the realities of the context evoked by the problem statement. The results of the study revealed that Japanese pupils, similarly to Belgian children, have a strong tendency to neglect commonsense knowledge and realistic considerations during their solution of word problems. Moreover, a comparison of Japanese pupils with and without extra hints aimed at improving the disposition towards more realistic mathematical problem solving revealed that these extra hints had only a small effect.

40|$|When {{elementary}} school pupils solve a mathematical word problem, {{they tend to}} solve it purely mathematically, without considering their everyday knowledge {{of the real world}} situation described in the problem (Verschaffel, Greer, & De Corte, 2000). In order to encourage pupils to think more realistically about these problems, Dewolf, Van Dooren, EV Cimen, and Verschaffel (2012), set up a study in which pupils received a set of word problems that are problematic from a realistic point of view (i. e., P - items from the research of Verschaffel, De Corte and <b>Lasure,</b> 1994), together with representational illustrations that represent the problematic situation described in the problems. It was expected that the illustrations would help pupils to mentally imagine the problem situation and so solve the items realistically, but no effect of the illustrations was found. Afterwards, we conducted two follow -up studies to investigate if and to what extent people attend to these illustrations. In the first study, we measured higher education students’ eye movements to investigate whether they paid attention to the illustrations that accompanied the P-items. The findings of this study showed that, as {{elementary school}} children (Dewolf et al., 2012), higher education students neglect their everyday knowledge when solving P-items, but also that they barely look at the illustrations. In the second study, we manipulated the presence of the illustrations so students could not but look at them, but, again, these were ineffective. The theoretical and educational implications of this set of related studies will be discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
