500|$|The soundtrack album, {{entitled}} Birdy: Music {{from the}} Film, {{was released on}} March 18, 1985 by Geffen Records and Charisma Records. AllMusic's Tom Demalon awarded it four stars out of five, writing, [...] "The fact that Birdy is [...] all instrumentals means that listeners whose familiarity with Gabriel is limited to [...] "Sledgehammer" [...] and [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] will be largely disappointed. However, its meditative nature makes it fine, reflective <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> more adventurous." ...|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It's not {{an understanding of the}} head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E
500|$|The 1998 {{eruption}} of Axial Seamount {{was preceded by}} several large earthquake swarms, common indicators of volcanic activity. The swarms correlated to magma movements in the volcano; bottom pressure recorders deployed on the volcano between 1987 and 1992 recorded five instances of deflation in the summit surface (caused by lava movement), ranging from [...] In 1991, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was granted access to the United States Navy's SOSUS system, a chain of submerged hydrophones in the North Pacific originally used by the Navy to detect Russian submarines during the Cold War. Since 1993, the NOAA has maintained a real-time monitoring system that alerts the organization whenever an event occurs. The hydrophones are able to detect even very small earthquakes (~ magnitude 1.8) by <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> acoustic waves generated by T-waves. These waves can propagate over large distances with minimal loss in power, making them an ideal way to record otherwise unnoticeable submarine earthquakes; {{over the course of}} the eruption, only 3 earthquakes were strong enough to register on land-based systems. However, they cannot interpret earthquake depth or what caused them.|$|E

500|$|The dolphin's {{search for}} food is {{aided by a}} form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by {{producing}} sounds and <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam {{in front of the}} dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an [...] "echoic image" [...] or sound picture of their targets.|$|E
2500|$|The US Coast Guard also {{despatched}} two cutters and two patrol {{boats to}} the scene; one was only 70 nautical miles (130km) away {{but the other}} three had to come from Cape Cod, Massachusetts; New York; and Norfolk, Virginia. The commercial tanker Esso Baytown {{was the first to}} arrive {{at the scene of the}} accident and reported at 23:25 that she had sighted wreckage and had lowered her lifeboats. By <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sound of their cries – they were in fact singing – Esso Baytown rescued six passengers and four members of the crew who had clung together on the water for ten hours. The United States Navy gunboat [...] transferred a doctor to Esso Baytown but because of the high seas and darkness had to discontinue the search for any other survivors. The ten survivors were taken to New York, arriving on 23 January 1939; the other three people aboard were lost.|$|E
2500|$|Sonar (originally {{an acronym}} for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a {{technique}} that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or {{under the surface of}} the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name [...] "sonar": passive sonar is essentially <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of [...] "targets" [...] in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.|$|E
