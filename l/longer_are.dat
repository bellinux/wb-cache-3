25|$|Immigrant {{status in}} the United States is a {{predictor}} for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the Hispanic paradox {{plays a role in}} the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; Hispanic women {{who have been in the}} United States for <b>longer</b> <b>are</b> less likely to breastfeed. This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for bottle-feeding as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that Hispanic women feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.|$|E

25|$|Travelcards {{for seven}} days or <b>longer</b> <b>are</b> known as season tickets and allow travel {{at any time of}} the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a {{magnetic}} stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway.|$|E

Conrad's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume's family, where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark {{in the shape of a}} rose on her thigh. This knowledge is presented as proof that the seneschal has taken her virginity.|$|E

[...] Hempstead said that thirty-five men had been laid upon the floor and the British left them, unattended and uncovered, until Dr. Downer and Dr. Prentiss arrived. Ebenezer Avery recovered, but lost his hearing, and continued to live in the house until his death on January 11, 1828 at age 81.

[...] Rabin also quotes the 11th century Rabi, Rashi, as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, [...] "And Moses died there", but it must have been written by Joshua. However, it is also noted that the second century commentator Rabbi Meir, has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.|$|E
