500|$|Rodman {{admitted}} {{his frequent}} transgressions, but asserted {{that he lived}} his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: [...] "I just took {{the chance to be}} my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1849, Tubman {{became ill}} again, which diminished her {{value as a}} slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but {{could not find a}} buyer. Angry at him for trying to sell her and for {{continuing}} to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways. She said later: [...] "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> trying to sell me." [...] When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, [...] "I changed my prayer," [...] she said. [...] "First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way.'" [...] A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.|$|E
2500|$|Called a [...] "cheerful muse" [...] by New York Magazine, Andre J. {{says his}} {{positive}} {{outlook on life}} has influenced his style: [...] "I want people to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> feel inspired, to feel hope, to smile. I want to surge positive energy in your body, confirm that you too can be yourself." [...] He {{says he has been}} affirmed by strangers telling him that they were glad he was alive, and believe that he were put on the earth [...] "to be a bodhisattva, to just glow, emanate love, respect, peace, pizzazz".|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{was just}} a fat heavy," [...] Burr told {{journalist}} James Bawden. [...] "I split the heavy parts with Bill Conrad. We were both in our twenties playing much older men. I never got the girl but I once got the gorilla in a 3-D picture called Gorilla at Large. I menaced Claudette Colbert, Lizabeth Scott, Paulette Goddard, Anne Baxter, Barbara Stanwyck. Those girls would take one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> scream and can you blame them? I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. But I knew I was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dickey {{was drafted}} by the Texas Rangers {{in the first round}} (18th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. After being drafted by the Rangers, Dickey was {{initially}} offered a signing bonus of $825,000, before a Rangers team physician saw Dickey's throwing (right) arm hanging oddly in a picture of him with other Team USA players in Baseball America. The Rangers subsequently did further evaluation of Dickey, leading to the discovery of a missing ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow joint, and reduced their offer to $75,000. [...] Dickey has been quoted as saying, [...] "Doctors <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say I shouldn't be able to turn a doorknob without feeling pain," [...] making his ability to pitch somewhat remarkable.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{suspects}} (except Salaam) had confessed on videotape {{in the presence}} of a parent or guardian, they retracted their statements within weeks, claiming that they had been intimidated, lied to, and coerced into making false confessions. The detectives had indeed used ruses to convince {{the suspects}} to confess, with Salaam confessing to having been present only after he was told that fingerprints were found on the victim's clothing. According to Salaam, [...] "I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room", and [...] "they would come and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say: 'You realise you're next.' The fear made me feel really like I was not going to be able to make it out." [...] While the confessions themselves were videotaped, the hours of interrogation that preceded the confessions were not.|$|E

2500|$|The actors {{lived in}} Crema {{and were able}} to absorb the rhythm of small town life. Guadagnino engaged deeply with the cast and filmmakers, often cooked and showed films for them in his house. Hammer and Chalamet, who did not have to do a screen test together, {{met for the first time}} during the {{production}} in Crema. They spent a month before shooting together to build character development. [...] "We’d hang out with each other all the time, because we were pretty much the only Americans there, and we were able to defend one another and really get to know one another," [...] Chalamet recalled. The actors rehearsed their scenes every night before shooting, and spent several days shooting completely nude. [...] "I’ve never been so intimately involved with a director before. Luca was able to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> completely undress me," [...] Hammer said. At the end of the film, Chalamet wears a distinctive New Romantic-looking shirt, picked by the costume designer Giulia Piersanti.|$|E
2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ichiro {{joined his}} high school {{baseball}} team, his father told the coach, [...] "No matter how good Ichiro is, don't ever praise him. We have to make him spiritually strong." [...] When {{he was ready to}} enter high school, Ichiro was selected by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya's Aikodai Meiden (...) High School. Ichiro was primarily used as a pitcher instead of as an outfielder, owing to his exceptionally strong arm. His cumulative high school batting average was [...]505, with 19 home runs. He built strength and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy shovel, among other regimens. These exercises helped develop his wrists and hips, adding power and endurance to his thin frame. Despite his outstanding numbers in high school, Ichiro was not drafted until the fourth and final round of the professional draft in November 1991, because many teams were discouraged by his small size of [...] and [...] Years later, Ichiro told an interviewer, [...] "I'm not a big guy and hopefully kids could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> see that I'm not muscular and not physically imposing, that I'm just a regular guy. So if somebody with a regular body can get into the record books, kids can look at that. That would make me happy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
