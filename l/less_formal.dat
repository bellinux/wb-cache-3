5|$|Military decorum at Fort Roach was <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> {{than in most}} units. Saluting was optional, and unit members called {{each other}} by their first names. Hal Roach Studios did not have barracks, so {{commuting}} from home was commonplace. Men {{from out of the}} area were billeted at nearby Page Military Academy.|$|E

40|$|During the Japanese era, {{there was}} a lower risk premium in {{northern}} Taiwanese capital markets than in southern markets. Evidence suggests {{this was due to}} superior informal institutions in the north. As a result, northern property rights were better defined, northerners were <b>less</b> dependent on <b>formal</b> credit markets and landless farmers who had <b>less</b> access to <b>formal</b> markets were at a smaller disadvantage in the north than in the south. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
5|$|Pope Francis, {{the current}} pope of the Catholic Church, succeeded Pope Benedict XVI in 2013 {{as the first}} pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere and the first Pope from outside Europe since the Syrian Gregory III, who reigned in the 8th century. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, {{emphasis}} on God's mercy, concern for the poor, and the environment, {{as well as his}} commitment to interfaith dialogue. He is credited with having a <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> approach to the papacy than his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Though they {{maintained}} a formal neutrality policy {{in regards to}} religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, fear of a pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the Sahel led the French to adopt policies that aimed {{to prevent the spread}} of Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> policies, and French efforts often used these to balance the spread of Islam in the region.|$|E
30|$|The policy {{experiments}} {{show that}} workers decide to work <b>less</b> in the <b>formal</b> sector when the compulsory career is shorter and replacement rates are lower (PAYG scheme), {{even if they}} ultimately obtain a lower pension income. When requirements become stricter, they work more in formal employment, especially among those workers who are closer to the new thresholds. It is remarkable that when the requirement for the first level of the FP is less strict, they work <b>less</b> in <b>formal</b> employment which rules out a higher pension, even {{among those who are}} {{at the top of the}} distribution. The main changes in behavior occur in the last part of careers, above the age of 45.|$|R

5|$|Allan Ramsay {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> and more intimate studies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, Louise's father was not yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as Duke until 1794), and {{consequently}} she was not born in a court, but rather in a <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> home. Charles was field marshal of the household brigade in Hanover, and soon after Louise's birth he was made Governor-General of that territory by his brother-in-law George III, king of the United Kingdom and Hanover (husband of his sister, Queen Charlotte). The family subsequently moved to Leineschloss, the residence of Hanoverian kings, though during the summer they usually lived at Herrenhausen.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{underneath}} the State Apartments is {{a suite of}} slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar NicholasI of Russia, and, {{on the other side}} of the Bow Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor NapoleonIII of France. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.|$|E

5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal record-keeping. Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} shorthand script for non-royal, non-monumental, and <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E
5|$|Several {{residential}} squares with terraces of three-storey {{houses were}} laid out around central gardens. An example is Portland Square, which was built between 1789 and 1820, and is now largely occupied by offices. In the 1830s, much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol Riots, and {{to the north of}} the city, Kings Square. The most fashionable areas were at the top of the hill, as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed down the hill. Further development, though in a <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> manner, continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham, towards Horfield and in the St Phillips, Redcliffe and Bedminster areas.|$|E
5|$|The charismatic {{movement}} {{forced a}} reevaluation {{of what it}} was to be Pentecostal. The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.). On the local level, Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> Assemblies of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.|$|E

[...] Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian gave it 5 stars out of 5 and praised Arielle Holmes' performance, saying: [...] "While her accent is reminiscent of Linda Manz, her energy recalls Gena Rowlands {{in the best of}} Cassavetes' films." ...|$|R
25|$|Some Burmese {{linguists}} such as Minn Latt, a Czech academic, proposed {{moving away}} from the high form of Burmese altogether. Although the literary form is heavily used in written contexts (literary and scholarly works, radio news broadcasts, and novels), the recent trend has been to accommodate the spoken form in informal written contexts. Nowadays, television news broadcasts, comics, and commercial publications use the spoken form or a combination of the spoken and simpler, <b>less</b> ornate <b>formal</b> forms.|$|R
40|$|In this note, a {{detailed}} step-by-step refinement of an informally developed bidirectional bubble sort algorithm is presented. A <b>less</b> rigorous <b>formal</b> {{approach has been}} followed to refine an already developed algorithm to a provable one. Proofs of correctness that have guided the refinement steps have been provided along with the intermediate versions of the algorithm. It is concluded that, Dijkstra-Gries formal method can be easily used to refine an already developed program to a provable one...|$|R
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E

After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also more intimate works like that of Queen Charlotte and her Children (c. 1755). His work has been seen as anticipating the Grand Manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> and more intimate studies.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E
50|$|Term logic, {{also called}} Aristotelian logic, treats {{quantification}} {{in a manner}} that is closer to natural language, and also <b>less</b> suited to <b>formal</b> analysis. Term logic treated All, Some and No in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities.|$|R
5000|$|A {{saltwater}} {{swimming pool}} {{was completed in}} 1972. The island was operated in a <b>less</b> than <b>formal</b> manner and many tourists came back year after year to enjoy that informality. There were several cyclones over this period and the island suffered considerable damage. It was also used as a stop off point for numerous Royal Australian Navy vessels including the [...] "Attack" [...] class patrol boats and Landing Craft. In the 1970s Fitzroy McLean's sons, Ian, Mark, Fitzroy Junior and Peter all worked on the island.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} Serviss changed his entire {{attitude}} towards these people. They were too genuine, too trustful, and too fine to permit of any patronization, and the girl's dignified silence and {{the charm of}} her pellucid eyes and rose-leaf lips quite transmuted him from the curious onlooker to the friend. [...] "I can understand your dilemma," [...] he said, with <b>less</b> of <b>formal</b> cheer and more of genuine sympathy. [...] "And yet, if your daughter has most decided talent it is only fair {{to give her a}} chance to show what she can do." ...|$|R
5|$|Ramsay {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women are <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> and more intimate studies. Gavin Hamilton studied at the University of Glasgow and in Rome, and after a brief stay in London, primarily painting portraits of the British aristocracy, he returned to Rome {{for the rest of his}} life. He emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's Iliad, as well as acting as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.|$|E
5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E
5|$|They were {{exhibited}} in 1946 and shown all together {{to the public}} during four years (1950–1954) {{in order to allow}} rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947–1949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister Alain Juppé initiated the Mattéoli Commission, headed by Jean Mattéoli, to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners. During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to <b>less</b> <b>formal</b> criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Fixed-rate {{mortgage}} {{are common}} in the United States, unlike most of Western Europe where variable-rate mortgages are more common. The United States has home ownership rates comparable to Europe, but overall default rates are lower in Europe than in the United States. Mortgage loan financing relies more on secondary mortgage markets and <b>less</b> on <b>formal</b> government guarantees backed by covered bonds and deposits. Prepayment penalties are discouraged by underwriting requirements of large organizations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgages loans are often nonrecourse debt, unlike {{the most of the}} world.|$|R
40|$|Stability of {{spatially}} inhomogeneous {{solutions to}} the Vlasov equation is investigated for the Hamiltonian mean-field model to provide the spectral and formal stability criteria {{in the form of}} necessary and sufficient conditions. These criteria determine stability of spatially inhomogeneous solutions whose stability has not been decided correctly by using a <b>less</b> refined <b>formal</b> stability criterion. It is shown that some of such solutions {{can be found in a}} family of stationary {{solutions to the}} Vlasov equation, which is parametrized with macroscopic quantities and has a two-phase coexistence region in the parameter space...|$|R
50|$|Last, {{but not the}} least, {{counseling}} {{has proved}} a challenge in India even to contemporary Indian families (Kashyap 2004).
