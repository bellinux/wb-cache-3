5000|$|Optical {{activity}} occurs due to molecules {{dissolved in}} a fluid or {{due to the}} fluid itself only if the molecules are one of two (or more) stereoisomers; {{this is known as}} an enantiomer. The structure of such a molecule is such that it is not identical to its mirror image (which would be that of a different stereoisomer, or the [...] "opposite enantiomer"). In mathematics, this property is also known as chirality. For instance, a metal rod is not chiral, since its appearance in a mirror is not distinct from itself. However a screw or light bulb base (or any sort of helix) is chiral; an ordinary right-handed screw thread, viewed in a mirror, would appear as a <b>left-handed</b> <b>screw</b> (very uncommon) which could not possibly screw into an ordinary (right-handed) nut. A human viewed in a mirror would have their heart on the right side, clear evidence of chirality, whereas the mirror reflection of a doll might well be indistinguishable from the doll itself.|$|E

In the present work, we develop an experimental study of melting in twin screw extruders, including pressure and temperature measurements, dead-stop experiments and sampling, observation of cross sections and quantification of solid fraction. The influences of process parameters (screw speed and feed rate), screw profile, pellets size and extruder size are also investigated. An original model of the melting process is proposed, deduced from these observations. This model allows one to calculate the evolution of mean shear, rate, pressure gradient, dissipated energy, pellet radius and both solid and liquid temperatures along the screws, for a sequence of right- and <b>left-handed</b> <b>screw</b> elements and blocks of kneading discs.

40|$|Abstract. It has {{recently}} been suggested by Luminet et al. (2003) that the WMAP data are better matched by a geometry in which the topology {{is that of a}} Poincaré dodecahedral model and the curvature is “slightly ” spherical, rather than by an (effectively) infinite flat model. A general back-to-back matched circles analysis by Cornish et al. (2003) for angular radii in the range 25 − 90 ◦, using a correlation statistic for signal detection, failed to support this. In this paper, a matched circles analysis specifically designed to detect dodecahedral patterns of matched circles is performed over angular radii in the range 1 − 40 ◦ on the one-year WMAP data. Signal detection is attempted via a correlation statistic and an rms difference statistic. Extreme value distributions of these statistics are calculated for one orientation of the 36 ◦ ‘screw motion ’ (Clifford translation) when matching circles, for the opposite screw motion, and for a zero (unphysical) rotation. The most correlated circles appear for circle radii of α = 11 ± 1 ◦, for the <b>left-handed</b> <b>screw</b> motion, but not for the right-handed one, nor for the zero rotation. The favoured six dodecahedral face centres in galactic coordinates are (l II, b II) ≈ (252 ◦,+ 65 ◦),(51 ◦,+ 51 ◦), (144 ◦,+ 38 ◦),(207 ◦,+ 10 ◦), (271 ◦,+ 3 ◦),(332 ◦,+ 25 ◦) and their opposites. The six pairs of circles independently each favour a circle angular radius of 11 ± 1 ◦. The temperature fluctuations along the matched circles are plotted and are clearly highly correlated.

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{studies have}} been conducted on individual fibers of human deoxyhemoglobin S (sickle cell hemoglobin). The fibers are obtained by injection of gelled samples into a large excess of glutaraldehyde, which quickly stabilizes the fibers by cross-linking. The fibers are negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid or shadowed with platinum-carbon. The fibers are approximately 200 Å in diameter, and display long and short helical striations with an opposite handedness. The long striations occur at an angle of about 15 ° from the fiber axis, and complete one turn around the helix at a distance of about 2 × 103 Å along the fiber axis. The short striations occur at an angle of about 80 ° from the fiber axis, with a spacing of about 65 Å, and complete one turn around the helix at a distance along the fiber axis of about 130 Å. The structure of the fiber appears to be a sextuple helix in terms of the long striations, and a double helix in terms of the short striations. The shadowed samples are consistent with a <b>left-handed</b> <b>screw</b> sense for the short striations, thus implying a right-handed sense for the long striations. A structural model incorporating these features is compatible with the atomic structure of hemoglobin, with individual molecules oriented with their dyad axis of symmetry perpendicular to the fiber axis and their α 1 -β 1 pseudo-dyad axis roughly parallel to the fiber axis. This orientation places the two β- 6 regions of each molecule (sites of the sickle cell mutation) in contact with the β- 6 regions of the molecules above and below along the long striations. Both the long and short striations are accounted for by individual hemoglobin molecules arranged in double helical arrays with 6. 4 molecules per turn in each array...|$|E
