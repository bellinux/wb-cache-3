40|$|The {{parameters}} Phi and N of Miedema are quoted precise to {{the second}} decimal place and are considered very accurate after adjustment in their values to correctly predict {{the signs of the}} heats of formation of more than 500 metallic binary systems. In this paper, we argue that Phi is proportional to the electronegativity (Chi) of metallic elements and that N^(1 / 3) is the valence effective on a <b>linear</b> <b>bond.</b> We show that, with the above hypothesis, Chi can be derived in the absolute sense, following Gordy, as the electrostatic potential due to the effective charge of the nucleus of an atom in a metal, felt at the mid-point of a bond to the nearest atom. The exponent 1 / 3 has its origin in the high ligancy and resonance in metals. An excellent agreement with the hypothesis is observed for the hypoelectronic elements, while the buffer and hyperelectronic elements show interesting variations. It is argued that the unlike atom pair bond energies, which are correlated to the distribution of binary systems on the map constructed using the magnitudes of parameters del Phi and del N of Miedema, originate from the scatter in the distribution of elements in the electronegativity versus N^(1 / 3) /R graph. Since it is the scatter that is important, we see that the small corrections effected by Miedema et al. to the parameters Phi and N are significant in deciding the energies involved.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In conventional finite element analysis of reinforced concrete the steel bars are normally assumed to lie along the concrete element edges and very often the bond gripping the steel to the concrete {{is assumed to be}} infinitely stiff. The first assumption makes it difficult to model all steel bars leading to the inclusion of only a few representative bars. Shear reinforcement is usually ignored. Thin concrete cover also creates difficulty by causing long thin finite elements in that region. The second assumption does not reflect the true behaviour of the system. In this research a new method for the modelling of steel in reinforced concrete by finite element analysis has been developed which allows all steel reinforcement {{to be included in the}} analysis. The method is based on modelling the steel and concrete separately, the two materials being interconnected by the bond forces between them. Thus, bond stiffness is naturally included in the analysis. Such interconnection of steel and concrete is achieved by an interface bond matrix which is derived from the relative displacements between the steel and the concrete at the steel nodes. A <b>linear</b> <b>bond</b> slip relation is assumed for the bond, and a linear stress strain relation is assumed for the concrete and the steel. The work has extended also to nonlinear bond stress-slip relation. Concrete is represented by 8 -noded isoparametric quadrilateral elements, and the steel is represented by two noded bar elements. The bond is represented by springs joining each steel node to all 8 -concrete nodes. The solution of the resulting system of equations is achieved in an iterative manner which converges quite rapidly, and which requires less computation than the direct solution needs. Three types of problems are analysed in two dimension to demonstrate the application of this new method. These are beam, cantilever and pullout problems. The first two, being real problems, demonstrate the ability of the method to handle complex steel arrangements, thin concrete covers and anchorage of steel, while the third problem shows the application of load to the steel rather than to the concrete. Concrete and steel deformations and stresses are calculated at their nodes. Bond stresses are given at all steel nodes. In the nonlinear bond analysis, deterioration of bond will be demonstrated in pullout and pushout tests at high loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on polycrystalline Rh electrode is studied by using programmed potential sweep method and in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Emphases are laid {{on the study of}} surface processes involved in the reduction. The adsorbed species derived from CO 2 reduction (r-CO 2) have been determined by in situ FTIR as bridge(COB) and linear(COL) bonded CO 2 which yield IR absorption bands respectively around 1905 and 2020 cm(- 1). The onset potential of CO 2 reduction has been determined at - 0. 05 V. The programmed potential sweep experiments demonstrated that the oxidation of r-CO 2 occurred in a current peak at about 0. 36 V, from which the charge of r-CO 2 oxidation(Q(ox)) has been measured quantitatively. It has been revealed that the Q(ox) varies with the potential (E-r) and the time (t(r)) applied for CO 2 reduction. At a given t(r), Q(ox) increases along with the decrease of E-r from - 0. 15 V to - 0. 40 V. At each E-r, Q(ox) reaches its saturation value (Q(ox) (s)) when t(r) is longer than 250 s. In comparison with the oxidation charge(498 mu C. cm(- 2)) for a saturation adsorption of CO on Rh electrode, the small value of Q(ox) (s) (e. g., 270 mu C. Cm- 2 even for E-r at - 0. 40 V) indicates that the quantity of adsorbed CO species produced in CO 2 reduction is far from that of a monolayer coverage. The ratio of the intensity of IR band of bridge bonded CO to that of <b>linear</b> <b>bonded</b> CO is served to figure out the surface site occupancy by r-CO 2. In considering that the number of surface site occupied by bridge and <b>linear</b> <b>bonded</b> CO is 2 and 1 respectively t the surface site occupancy by r-CO 2 has been evaluated at only 73 % for CO 2 reduction at - 0. 25 V for 600 s.
