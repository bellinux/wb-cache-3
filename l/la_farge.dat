25|$|The First Presbyterian Church {{building}} of 1905 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{is said to}} be unique in that it uses Tiffany windows that partially make use of painted glass. Use of the colored glass itself to create stained glass pictures was motivated by the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement and its leader William Morris in England. Fellow artists and glassmakers Oliver Kimberly and Frank Duffner, founders of the Duffner and Kimberly Company and John <b>La</b> <b>Farge</b> were Tiffany's chief competitors in this new American style of stained glass. Tiffany, Duffner and Kimberly, along with <b>La</b> <b>Farge,</b> had learned their craft at the same glasshouses in Brooklyn in the late 1870s.|$|E

[...] A number of visitors investigated the ruins of Toniná in the 19th century, the first being an expedition led by Guillaume Dupaix in 1808. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood visited in 1840, and Stephens wrote an extensive description of the site. Eduard Seler and Caecilie Seler-Sachs investigated the monuments at Toniná, publishing their reports at the turn of the 20th century. Karl Sapper visited the site in 1895 and 1896.

5000|$|The [...] "Poissel" [...] name {{extends to}} and, to a degree, arrogates <b>La</b> <b>Farge's</b> third book, The Facts of Winter (McSweeney's, June 2005) which, on its front cover, states, [...] "by Paul Poissel, {{translated}} by Paul La Farge". It is also set in Paris, although {{the year is}} now 1881, a decade into the Third Republic. The reader is privy to [...] "a series of short dreams, each dreamed by people in and around Paris, {{which is to say}} that it is a fictional account of the imaginary lives of people who may or may not be real". Again, <b>La</b> <b>Farge's</b> command of French is featured, as the dream accounts come to the reader in both French and English, and the descriptive language is hauntingly poetic.

500|$|La Venta Monument1 is speculated to {{have been}} the {{portrait}} of La Venta's final ruler. Monument1 measures [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep; it weighs 24 tons. The front of the headdress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or fangs of an animal. Above these symbols is an angular U-shaped decoration descending from the scalp. On each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress, passing in front of the ear. Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earlobe {{to the base of the}} monument. The features are those of a mature man, with wrinkles around the mouth, eyes and nose. Monument1 is the best preserved head at La Venta but has suffered from erosion, particularly at the back. The head was first described by Franz Blom and Oliver <b>La</b> <b>Farge</b> who investigated the La Venta remains on behalf of Tulane University in 1925. When discovered it was half-buried; its massive size meant that the discoverers were unable to excavate it completely. Matthew Stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940, after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years. Monument1 has been moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. The head was found in its original context; associated finds have been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600BC.|$|E
500|$|Japanese art, and {{particularly}} ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western {{art from the}} time of the early Impressionists. [...] Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s: the patterned wallpapers and rugs in Manet's paintings were inspired by ukiyo-e's patterned kimonos, and Whistler focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes. [...] VanGogh was an avid collector, and painted copies in oil of prints by Hiroshige and Eisen. [...] Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives. [...] Ukiyo-e's flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers. [...] Toulouse-Lautrec's lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e's flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes. [...] He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints. [...] Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include Monet, <b>La</b> <b>Farge,</b> Gauguin, and Les Nabis members such as Bonnard and Vuillard. [...] French composer Claude Debussy drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Horoshige, most prominently in La mer (1905). [...] Imagist poets such as Amy Lowell and Ezra Pound found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called Pictures of the Floating World (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.|$|E
2500|$|Frans Blom and Oliver <b>La</b> <b>Farge</b> {{made the}} first {{detailed}} descriptions of La Venta and San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 during their 1925 expedition.

50|$|His second novel, Each to the Other (1939), {{was also}} written in verse. Its plot {{revolved}} around the domestic difficulties of {{a father and a}} son, and at least one reviewer saw in it reflections of <b>La</b> <b>Farge’s</b> own life. It was a Book-of-the-Month-Club selection and won the Benson Silver medal of the London Royal Society of Literature. <b>La</b> <b>Farge's</b> third novel, The Sudden Guest (1946, written in prose), was likewise a Book-of-the-Month-Club selection. Set in Rhode Island, its central character is an unpleasant old woman who reminisces about the great New England Hurricane of 1938 as she prepares for the arrival of another hurricane. With its acutely observed protagonist—self-righteous, rigid, and anti-Semitic—the story forms a parable intended to remind Americans of the cost of isolationism. It was LaFarge’s most successful book, selling {{more than half a million}} copies. His last verse novel, Beauty for Ashes (1953), was a novel of relationships revolving around a beautiful young woman and three men in rural Rhode Island.|$|R

Frank, the titular character, paints portraits of the missing, among whom are his parents, his brother James and, eventually, even his romantic interest, enigmatic police photographer Prudence, whose job it was {{to take pictures of}} corpses.

40|$|By {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} hypertext fiction was no longer the predominant form of digital writing produced by authors of electronic literature. In recent years, electronic poetry is more often produced than hypertext fiction, and rich multimedia largely predominates over text. Yet some notable exceptions, such as Judd Morrissey’s database narrative The Last Performance (2007), and Paul <b>La</b> <b>Farge’s</b> Luminous Airplanes (2011) are continuing to push the hypertext novel in some new directions. If hypertext per se is no longer predominant, many aspects of hypertext fiction, such as trigger actions that extend narrative texts and texts that integrate elements of spatial navigation, are increasingly integrated into newer forms such as locative narrative and virtual reality narratives...|$|R
50|$|The church {{building}} {{is located at}} 54 - 57 Washington Square South. In addition to <b>La</b> <b>Farge's</b> stained-glass windows and Saint-Guadens's marble frieze, it features Italian Renaissance influences wedded to a basic Italianate form, and has notable examples of scagliola, a very convincing handcrafted imitation of marble made of highly polished pigmented plaster. Overall, the exterior {{and shape of the}} building is said to resemble the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, Italy, while the entrance is said to be inspired by the Renaissance church San Alessandro, built in Lucca, Italy, in 1480. The fourteen stained glass windows in the church's main sanctuary are the largest collection of major LaFarge windows in any one place in the U.S.|$|R
2500|$|The album {{featured}} {{stories of}} {{a multitude of}} native peoples, mostly of their violent oppression by white settlers: The Pima ("The Ballad of Ira Hayes"), Navajo ("Navajo"), Apache ("Apache Tears"), Lakota ("Big Foot"), Seneca ("As Long as the Grass Shall Grow"), and Cherokee ("Talking Leaves"). Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one {{with the help of}} Johnny Horton, but the majority of the protest songs were written by folk artist Peter <b>La</b> <b>Farge</b> (son of activist and Pulitzer prizewinner Oliver <b>La</b> <b>Farge),</b> whom Cash met in New York in the 1960s and whom he admired for his activism. The album's single, [...] "The Ballad of Ira Hayes," [...] was neglected by non-political radio at the time, and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and thus [...] "unappealing" [...] nature.

500|$|Bartholdi {{had made}} a first model of his concept in 1870.

Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France. He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians. One of these was the Lion of Belfort, a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort, which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months. The defiant lion, [...] long and half that in height, displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism, which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty.|$|R
50|$|Sometime in August 1819, Alabama was {{temporarily}} assigned to New Orleans to help thwart the pirate incidents in those waters with the Louisiana. On August 31, the two ships were sailing the Gulf off southern Florida when they sighted the schooner Bravo. The Americans gave chase and eventually came within range. Bravo resisted {{and a brief}} gunnery duel occurred, in which the first officer and three crew members of the Louisiana were wounded. The Americans then boarded the Bravo and the pirates were captured. Jean <b>La</b> <b>Farges,</b> who commanded the suspected privateer, was a lieutenant of Jean Lafitte.

Three years later, in June 1938, the Pope ordered American Jesuit John <b>La</b> <b>Farge</b> to prepare an encyclical condemning antisemitism, racism and the persecution of Jews, which he did together with fellow Jesuits t Gustav Gundlach (Germany) and Gustave Desbuquois (France), resulting in a draft for an encyclical which was on Pius XI's desk when he died, but was never promulgated by Pius XII.|$|E
2500|$|Connick {{preferred}} to use clear [...] "antique" [...] glass, {{similar to that}} of the Middle Ages and praised this type of glass as [...] "colored radiance, with the lustre, intensity, and baffling vibrant quality of dancing lights." [...] He employed a technique of [...] "staggered" [...] solder-joints in his leading and bars, which English stained-glass historian Peter Cormack says gives the windows their [...] "syncopated or 'swinging' character." [...] His style incorporated a strong interest in symbolism as well. Connick expressed the opinion that the first job of stained glass was to serve the architectural effect, and he believed that his greatest contribution to glasswork was [...] "rescuing it from the abysmal depth of opalescent picture windows" [...] of the sort popularized by Louis Comfort Tiffany and John <b>La</b> <b>Farge.</b> Although firmly committed to a regenerated handicraft tradition, Connick welcomed innovation and experimentation in design and technique among his co-workers at his studio.|$|E

40|$|The book is an {{investigation}} of American collecting between 1900 and 1914 and {{of the impact of}} transatlantic displacements and mass media on the public's perception of old master paintings. Rather than a consideration of single collectors or the itineraries of their acquisitions, this is an analysis of the political, cultural, and social implications of the phenomenon and how it functioned within American society and in relation to Europe. Retrieved is the New York milieu of journalists, political commentators, and "tastemasters" who constructed a journalistic genre, a means of collective identification, and an instrument of personal strategy around the arrival of old master paintings in America. These actors rapidly and effectively turned the acquisition of old masters into a national cultural act, which this text places in a larger narrative that involves issues of national identity and cultural definition.
