2500|$|All {{the pupils}} under John Bosco {{observed}} a monthly event called The Exercise of a Happy Death; this practice continues {{under the name}} The Monthly Day of Recollection. [...] This practice was encouraged by Pope Pius IX. Part of this {{was to make a}} Confession and Communion as though they were the last ones to be made before death. Bosco notes that Dominic observed this practice devoutly, and that one day, Dominic said that he would be the first amongst the group to die. During the month of May, before his death, the intensity of his spiritual practices increased. John Bosco notes that he said, [...] "Let me do what I can this year; if I am here next year I'll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> my plans are." ...|$|E

[...] "I'll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is the matter. I'll publish this, sir, to the medical world;" [...] and as he shrieked out {{the words of the}} threat, he stood on tiptoes and brandished his eye-glasses up almost into his enemy's face.|$|E

5000|$|The British {{documentary}} filmmaker Adam Curtis, whose {{style is}} modeled on Dos Passos', says, [...] "Why I love Dos Passos is he tells political stories {{but at the}} same time he also <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it feels like to live through them. Most journalism does not acknowledge that people live at least as much in their heads as they do in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. Servants {{have too}} much license. They hang {{together}} so terribly you never can tell what they're really thinking; it's {{as if they were}} all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark. Even with Marlow, you feel that he never <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> really in his mind. I hate that secretiveness; it destroys all confidence. I feel sometimes I should like to shake him.|$|R

6000|$|Isabel {{listened with}} extreme respect to this admonition, {{but she said}} after a minute: [...] "I {{must tell you that}} what I shall think about is some way of <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ask is impossible--letting <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it without making you miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would," [...] she {{interrupted}} gently, [...] "and so {{of course}} I did not cry out. You had all had enough to try you to the utmost, and I {{was not going to}} risk your life by <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> had happened. It flashed across me at once that if you had seen it happen you would have been down from the roof in an instant and struck the man. Had you done so, your fate would have been sealed, you would have had half a dozen bullets in your body; therefore, I simply dropped my veil, and I can assure you that the smart of the Boer's sjambok gave me less pain when I felt that <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> nothing of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, put the {{children}} {{down on that}} sofa," [...] Captain Clinton said, [...] "and take yourself off for the present; you have done mischief enough for a lifetime. I will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we decide upon later on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In judging {{for myself}} I {{have thought it}} right {{to tell you the}} exact truth, and to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is that you would possess if you should choose to take me." [...] Then again she was silent, and waited for her doom.|$|E

5000|$|While not announcing an {{official}} breakup, Oxymoron {{has been on}} an indefinite hiatus since 2002, when Oxymoron announced: [...] "In the near future you won't hear much from us. Oxymoron will have a break for a while! We'll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> going on here, {{but first of all}} we definitely to take some time off with the band." [...] In 2005 they reported that [...] "the band is still on ice." [...] 2006 saw the release of somewhat new material in the Noize Overdose split EP with Bonecrusher.

500|$|Percy {{became the}} fifth {{member of the}} Gunpowder plot on Sunday 20 May 1604. [...] Almost a year earlier, he had called at Robert Catesby's home at Ashby St Ledgers, and complained bitterly about James, who since {{succeeding}} Elizabeth had done little to fulfil his expectations. [...] He had threatened to kill the new king with his own hands, but was asked by Catesby to restrain himself, and told [...] "I am thinking of a most sure way and I will soon <b>let</b> <b>thee</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is." [...] Thus Percy found himself at the Duck and Drake inn near the Strand in London, along with Catesby and his cousin Thomas Wintour, John Wright and Guy Fawkes. [...] His first words at the meeting were [...] "Shall we always, gentlemen, talk and never do anything?" [...] All five later swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then celebrated Mass in another room with Father Gerard, who was ignorant of their pact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You {{had better}} tell Mr. Glover {{to run up}} the Spanish flag if any doubtful-looking craft is seen to be making for the entrance, and I should always keep a couple of signallers up on the cliff, so as to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{beforehand}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> might have to expect, and {{to see that there}} is nothing showing that could excite their suspicions, until it is too late for them to turn back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every {{place is}} immoral," [...] he said. [...] "Of {{course you do}} find spicy bits in Paris. Go {{to one of the}} students' balls, for instance.

6000|$|... "Madam,--I said I would <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> goes on here, when I {{thought there}} was need of it. There seems to be need now. Mr. Vimpany came to us yesterday.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall have}} to see Soames. If there's {{anything}} I {{can do for you}} I'm always at your service.

6000|$|Bunter {{was very}} sensitive; {{he left her}} rather brusquely at the last. He got on board in good time, and {{produced}} the usual impression on the mud-pilot in the broken-down straw hat who took the Sapphire out of dock. The river-man was very polite to the dignified, striking-looking chief mate. [...] "The five-inch manilla for the check-rope, Mr.--Bunter, thank you--Mr. Bunter, please." [...] The sea-pilot who left the [...] "gem of ships" [...] heading comfortably down Channel off Dover told {{some of his friends}} that, this voyage, the Sapphire had for chief mate a man who seemed a jolly sight too good for old Johns. [...] "Bunter's his name. I wonder where he's sprung from? Never seen him before in any ship I piloted in or out all these years. He's the sort of man you don't forget. You couldn't. A thorough good sailor, too. And won't old Johns just worry his head off! Unless the old fool should take fright at him--for he does not seem the sort of man that would let himself be put upon without <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he thinks of you.

6000|$|... "Nonsense! Mr Gresham; {{it is no}} nonsense. As {{you speak}} in that way, I must <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> plainly <b>what</b> I feel. I am endeavouring to do my duty by my son.

When I found that the young people were actually talking of being in love with each other, making vows and {{all that sort of}} thing, I did think it time to interfere. I did not, however, turn them out of Greshamsbury as you accuse me of doing. In the kindest possible manner--" ...|$|R
