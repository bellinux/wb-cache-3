25|$|Wang Wei {{never lived}} to see the empire return to peace, as the An-Shi {{disturbances}} and their aftermath continued beyond his lifetime. However, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> enjoy a relative return to stability compared to the initial years of the rebellion, especially {{when he had the}} opportunity to spend time in the relative seclusion of his Lantian estate, which allowed him both a poetic and a Buddhist retreat, as well as a place to spend time with his friends and with nature, painting and writing. But, finally, his writing came to an end, and in the seventh month of 759, or in 761, Wang Wei requested writing implements, wrote several letters to his brother and to his friends, and then died. He was then buried at his Lantian estate.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the troubled}} {{development}} of Kill the Irishman, Reid {{decided to make}} a documentary about Greene's life; known as Danny Greene: the Rise and Fall of the Irishman. Due to the research he had done for the movie, Reid became specialized in the Northern Ohio crime scene and Greene’s life. Reid felt that by doing the documentary, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go to his [...] "grave 'saying I tried'". In 2009, with 17 hours of the documentary shot, Reid was told his film had been green-lit. He joined forces with production company Code Entertainment and engaged with a [...] "reliable" [...] director; Jonathan Hensleigh. They then signed actors Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken to the project. This was followed by the signing of actors Vincent D’Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas), and Irish actor Ray Stevenson, respectively. Stevenson was filming The Book of Eli when he got a telephone call from Hensleigh, so they arranged to meet in Los Angeles. According to Stevenson, he was drawn to the script and immediately made a deal.|$|E

60|$|She did {{not know}} in the <b>least</b> what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> mean, {{but she was too}} sick at heart to ask; she only thought he looked unwell, jaded, and fagged, and with a heated complexion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} already, that at first, when I {{picked him up}} in the garden, he was incoherent. Afterwards he was {{naturally}} reticent. But I gather at <b>least</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not help himself." ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers. During a radio {{broadcast}} in Honolulu, he enjoyed the opportunity {{to say hello to}} Rita ("Here's a great big radio hug, the best I can do under the circumstances") and to his mother ("Love from me to you"). On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, a grand total of 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten." [...] It was a sentiment he would voice often in the following two months.|$|E
6000|$|Flambeau did not {{understand}} the sherry, but he did not object to it in the <b>least.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only say amiably: [...] "Oh, thank you very much." ...|$|E
60|$|For an instant, Harry {{thought that}} they might run away; {{but it was only}} for an instant. That long-legged man could catch them before they had gone a dozen yards--at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> catch Kate.|$|E
60|$|Sammy Jay sat in {{the dark}} and shivered. Sammy was lonely, more lonely than he had ever {{supposed}} anybody could be. And to tell the truth Sammy Jay was scared. Yes, Sir, that was just the way Sammy Jay felt--scared. Every time a leaf rustled, Sammy jumped almost out of his skin. His heart went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> hear it himself, or at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and {{it seemed to him that}} if Hooty the Owl should happen to come along, he would surely hear it.|$|R
60|$|The Patriarch {{insisted on}} his staying to dinner, and Flora signalled 'Yes!' Clennam so wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{have done more}} than stay to dinner--so heartily wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have found the Flora that had been, or that never had been--that <b>he</b> thought the <b>least</b> atonement <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make for the {{disappointment}} he almost felt ashamed of, was to give himself up to the family desire. Therefore, he stayed to dinner.|$|R
50|$|Bailey {{arrived in}} Morocco {{for his last}} posting just after an attack had been made on the royal aeroplane, during which the king, Hassan II, {{had been forced to}} take the controls. But Bailey found it a {{tranquil}} appointment, not <b>least</b> because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> speak to the sovereign in Arabic, Spanish and French.|$|R
60|$|She now {{retorted}} {{that if he}} did {{not choose}} to take her at her word be need not, but that whatever he did she should have nothing to reproach herself with; and, at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not say that she had trapped him into anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing in}} such a matter," [...] Vanderbank {{observed}} {{as if it were}} the <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> decently say, [...] "like challenging enquiry; and here's Harold, precisely," [...] he went on in the next breath, [...] "as clear and crisp and undefiled as a fresh five-pound note." ...|$|E
60|$|Close {{beside the}} sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now {{luminous}} and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay the Morning Post, the advertisement columns {{of which he had}} promised her to explore. The <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do was to begin at once.|$|E
50|$|The {{cartoonist}} Bill Box first {{experimented with}} his 1951 Bop Cards showing hipster figures on Christmas cards. Although Los Angeles gift shops initially showed little interest, sales soared at the USC and UCLA student stores. His cards were tall, explained Box, {{because he was}} more comfortable drawing standing figures and because #10 envelopes were the <b>least</b> expensive <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Kent, {{during his}} near death experience, {{explained}} to Clark's soul how, being a Kryptonian, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never die, or at <b>least</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> die only after much more grievous injuries {{than a simple}} beating: he merely accepted his death because his human upbringing instilled in him {{a strong sense of}} human mortality, to which he conformed. Once he accepted and embraced his alien makeup, he was able to refuse death and lead his father back {{to the land of the}} living.|$|R
60|$|The {{man in the}} iron-gray suit {{showed a}} much more minute {{knowledge}} of these particulars than I had the <b>least</b> pretension to. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> tell the very {{year in which the}} family of De Haga first settled on their ancient barony.|$|R
60|$|Hypatia trembled {{from head}} to foot at the {{unexpected}} apparition.... Well; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> know nothing of last night and its disgrace. But not daring to look him in the face, she took the letter and opened it.... If she had hoped for comfort from it, her hope was not realised.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, nothing,' Herbert replied, {{turning away}} {{his eyes from}} her keen, searching gaze uncomfortably. He congratulated himself {{inwardly}} on the lucky {{fact that she was}} fully of age, for then at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only get into a row with her, and not with her parents. 'And now, Selah, do you know what I strongly advise you?' ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth as a {{watch-dog}} to {{keep her}} father off--what a new idea. Yet it was not unpleasing. Henchard had neglected her all these days, after compromising her indescribably in the past. The <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done when he found himself free, and herself affluent, {{would have been to}} respond heartily and promptly to her invitation.|$|E
60|$|Kaviri battled bravely {{against his}} antagonist, for {{he felt that}} death had already claimed him, and so the <b>least</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{do would be to}} sell his life as dearly as possible; but it was soon evident that his best was quite futile when pitted against the superhuman brawn and agility of the {{creature}} that at last found his throat and bent him back {{into the bottom of the}} canoe.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 2005, he {{made the}} news pages in Puerto Rico again, when he asked judge Salvador Casellas for his {{sentence}} of 45 years to be either suspended or, at <b>least,</b> modified so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> leave jail at an earlier time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He {{must have}} known that nothing would change me,--at <b>least,</b> nothing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. I thought of that. I shouldn't like him to feel that I couldn't {{appreciate}} it, even if I did think it was silly. Should you write to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|If ever face plainly told {{another that}} he was her first and best, Laura's did so now. Away went misgivings, {{and he looked at}} her in {{happiness}} too great for speech, at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak till he had mastered his emotion, but his countenance was sufficient reply. Even then, {{in the midst of this}} flood of ecstasy, came the thought, 'What have I done?' ...|$|E
60|$|Malchus {{followed}} the man, congratulating himself {{that if he}} must serve as a slave, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly have found an easier situation. The pets consisted of some bright birds from the East, a Persian greyhound, several cats, a young bear, and a half grown lion. Of these the lion alone was fastened up, in consequence of his attack upon the slave on the previous day.|$|E
6000|$|Following {{the first}} great law of the Army, which says [...] "all {{property}} is common except money, and you've only got to ask the next man for that," [...] The Infant offered tobacco and drink. It was the <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do; but not the most lavish praise in the world held half as much appreciation and reverence as The Infant's simple [...] "Say when, sir," [...] above the long glass.|$|E
50|$|The {{judge was}} not an {{absolute}} ruler of feudal tradition, at <b>least</b> in form: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not declare war or sign a peace treaty {{without the consent of}} the Corona de Logu. However, that was composed primarily of his aristocracy's relatives and, therefore, linked by common interests.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew his}} Asiatic {{servants}} were marvels of discernment--and discretion, {{he had to}} add. But there were the women. Women were cats. To {{the best of them}} it would be great joy to catch the radiant, unimpeachable Paula as clay as any daughter of Eve. And any chance woman in the house, for a day, or an evening, might glimpse the situation--Paula's situation, at <b>least,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not make out Graham's attitude yet. Trust a woman to catch a woman.|$|R
25|$|A {{controversial}} but undeniably important historical figure, reviled by {{many and}} followed almost blindly by others, Juan Lechín Oquendo died in August 2001, {{at the age}} of 87. A major criticism used against him is that he tended to de-stabilize precisely those regimes that were friendliest to the interests of the working class (Paz Estenssoro, Torres, Siles Zuazo between 1982 and 1985), while being quite deferential to the most hardline right-wing governments (Barrientos, Banzer, Garcia Mesa), at <b>least</b> until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get safely out of the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the image}} of Mrs. Cecil Grainger's, my dear, and I got it for a song. As long as Trixy gave me the horse, I told Sid the <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do was {{to give me the}} brougham and the harness. Is Master Sid asleep?" [...] she inquired of the maid who had been patiently waiting at the door. [...] "I meant to have got home in time to kiss him." ...|$|E
60|$|His only aim {{and purpose}} now was her safety. One thing at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do: by fair means or foul stop Leonard's mouth, so that others need not know her shame! He groaned aloud as the thought came to him. Beyond this first step {{he could do}} nothing, think of nothing as yet. And he could not take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he could understand.|$|E
60|$|I was {{faithful}} to my promise to Milly, but the secret leaked out somewhere; perhaps Mac told it, {{and before the}} game that day all the players knew it. The Rube, having recovered his good humor, minded it not in the <b>least.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not have felt ill-will {{for any length of}} time. Everything seemed to get back into smooth running order, and the Honeymoon Trip bade fair to wind up beautifully.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 1980s Guitar {{manufacturers}} {{were seeking}} {{to meet an}} ever-increasing demand for musical instruments. [...] This led to major manufacturers like Gibson and Fender {{as well as others}} to begin importing guitars from the Orient. [...] Dean was determined to keep production in the U.S.A. in order to maintain quality; at <b>least</b> until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> assure that the (import) quality was as good as <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> deliver. [...] While he did import for a time, he wound up selling the company in 1991 to take some time off to raise a young family of his own, with his wife, Playboy Playmate - Suzi Schott (Zelinsky).|$|R
50|$|Men {{earn enough}} in the U.S. to live and send money home, {{but not enough to}} support a typical family of 5. In 2000, a man could earn $1100 per month, or up to $1300 with two jobs, and his living {{expenses}} were at <b>least</b> $500. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> live and work in the U.S. and send money home, where his wife and children worked and lived cheaply. In Atlanta, expenses for a family of 5 were at least $1400 per month, more than one man’s salary, but within the reach of a two-worker family.|$|R
50|$|The special {{missions}} of attack class submarines took the US Navy into Soviet waters, and collisions with Russian submarines were occurring. At DTMB this was suspected, {{as they were}} sometimes asked to analyze pieces of rubber coating or samples of paint that came from Soviet submarines. What they didn’t know was that reports of these collisions were interfering with high-level disarmament talks. The situation got so bad {{that at the end}} of April 1970, then President Nixon suspended all special operations, at <b>least</b> until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be assured that collisions could be avoided.|$|R
