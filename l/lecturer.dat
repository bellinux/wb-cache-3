We found out that <b>lecturers</b> working in the field of humanities dedicate significantly more time to activities requiring social competencies than the <b>lecturers</b> working in other fields being identified. The percentual differences between the individual fields of practice indicate that <b>lecturers</b> working in the field of humanities and languages perform more activities related to social competencies than <b>lecturers</b> working in other fields do.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} scenario, women have more {{responsibility}} {{since they are}} maintaining a balance between work and life. With particular reference to women <b>lecturers</b> they {{have a feeling that}} sometime their life is balanced and in other instances it is unbalanced. Since women <b>lecturers</b> are playing dual roles especially the personal and professional roles {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a balanced life. In the working environment women <b>lecturers</b> have to effectively manage the problems and maintain a cordial relationship with the staff members. An optimum level of balance is needed between personal and college work. When women <b>lecturers</b> experience more stress it affects their work life balance. Married women <b>lecturers</b> have more responsibilities as they have to take care of family members and meet their requirements as and when needed. But it is comparatively low with unmarried women <b>lecturers.</b> <b>Lecturers</b> do their paper correction work at home. It indirectly affects the work life balance. Children‘s education is also affected due to paper correction work at home. At the same time women <b>lecturers</b> work for long hours but are not able to accomplish more goals. Women <b>lecturers</b> also experience role conflict and ultimately the concentration power is also reduced due to family problems. Therefore personal problems affect the involvement of women <b>lecturers</b> in work...|$|R

This study aimed to learn from un-promoted <b>lecturers</b> and their administrators about the <b>lecturer’s</b> experiences with changing work expectation and the <b>lecturer’s</b> difficulties with promotion. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 <b>lecturers</b> and 10 administrators at two private upgraded vocational higher institutions.; Seven barriers were found for <b>lecturer’s</b> difficulties in conducting research and getting promoted to higher rank and there was much agreement in the categories mentioned by <b>lecturers</b> and administrators. The seven barriers identified were inadequate research support such as research equipment, funding, library database, and research assistants; work adjustment from teaching and service to teaching, research and service due to changing workload; barriers of publishing in prestigious international journals due to inadequate research and English skills; difficulty of using the authoring of specialized publications and technical reports to earn a promotion to associate professor due to unclear expectations from the Ministry of Education; longer time frame required to earn a doctorate in the humanities and social sciences versus in other specialized disciplines; age, especially in that <b>lecturers</b> over 50 had less tolerance of long hours of research and study; and family responsibility, such as taking care of small children and sick parents for <b>lecturers</b> of both genders.; It was further found that both the <b>lecturers</b> and the administrators perceived the <b>lecturers</b> should be mainly responsible for the success of their promotion to higher rank because the institutions had policies in place to encourage <b>lecturers</b> to promote to higher rank. Though both the administrators and the <b>lecturers</b> perceived lecturers’ barriers to promotion as less related to problems such as inadequate research equipment and funding and more related to personal problems such as age and family responsibility, there are still some improvements the institutions can make to increase the promotion rates for all <b>lecturers.</b> The recommendations provided in this study can not only be helpful in improving lecturers’ promotion rates but can also enhance mutual understanding between institutions and <b>lecturers...</b>|$|R

First, <b>lecturers</b> need to appreciate the differences between expert and novice views of accessibility and how students will engage with the materials. Second, <b>lecturers</b> need to understand that learners perceive instructional materials containing visual representations as more accessible compared to ?text only? versions. Hence greater use of these may enable students to engage more readily in learning.

The research methodology was an interpretivist case study and involved semi-structured interviews with New Zealand <b>lecturers</b> and reflective journals blogs recorded by the Vietnamese students over a period of six weeks between the end of May through to early July 2012. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize important aspects of the intercultural context. The findings highlight difficulties with the English language, teaching approaches and problems associated with distance learning, communication and cultural issues for both students and <b>lecturers.</b> Students and <b>lecturers</b> noted significant differences in teaching and learning approaches in the universities between Vietnam and New Zealand. English language skills presented communication challenges for students and this impacted negatively on their overall satisfaction of the learning experience. Students and <b>lecturers</b> described distance teaching and learning as requiring more effort than their face-to-face learning and teaching. <b>Lecturers</b> noted that Vietnamese students enjoyed socialising with their <b>lecturers</b> and preferred a closer working relationship than their Western counterparts. Vietnamese students enjoyed group learning situations and preferred in-direct communication. To address the learning and teaching challenges students and <b>lecturers</b> adopted a range of strategies which included practising English with <b>lecturers,</b> online English activities and reading widely. Teachers also attempted to use a range of technologies such as video conferencing, wikis and blogs to assist students. Some also attempted to modify their course delivery methods and to utilise the Vietnamese teaching assistants to support student learning. The findings of this research demonstrate key issues facing teachers and learners undertaking degree level courses in offshore contexts. The communication and language issues facing both <b>lecturers</b> and students have implications for the delivery of courses to students in diverse cultural contexts. This study establishes a first step in understanding the learning and teaching experiences of Vietnamese students and their New Zealand <b>lecturers</b> in the offshore programme, it presents the learning and teaching challenges the learners and <b>lecturers</b> faced and strategies they adopted to overcome the issues...|$|R
