40|$|Firm-level {{entrepreneurship}} is {{an important}} contributor to firm survival and performance (Stevenson 2 ̆ 6 Jarillo, 1990; Tushman, 1997). It includes innovation, venturing and strategic renewal (Zahra, 1996). Although researchers have examined various determinants of firm-level entrepreneurship, this study {{will be the first}} to comprehensively investigate the influence of top management teams (TMTs). ^ Drawing upon Hambrick 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) framework, this study examines top teams from four conceptual aspects: composition (the collective value of TMT members), process (the nature of interaction among top managers), incentive (the compensation contract that TMT members receive), and the CEO (the leadership styles of CEOs). These four aspects are characterized by TMT risk propensity, TMT behavioral integration, TMT <b>long-term</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation,</b> and CEO transformational leadership respectively. It is hypothesized that these four specific TMT characteristics individually, and interactively, affect firms 2 ̆ 7 engagement in entrepreneurial activities. ^ Data was collected from 109 small, privately-held firms in a Northeastern state in the U. S. The results provided partial support for the hypotheses. Results show that CEO transformational leadership, TMT risk propensity, and TMT <b>long-term</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> have strong, positive effects on firm-level entrepreneurship, whereas TMT behavioral integration has a marginal, negative effect on it. Furthermore, TMT behavioral integration is found to interact with TMT <b>long-term</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> and CEO transformational leadership. ^ By investigating the characteristics of TMTs that are related to firm-level entrepreneurship, this study seeks to enrich the literature on both entrepreneurship and upper-echelons theory. It extends entrepreneurship literature by explaining entrepreneurial initiatives from the TMT perspective rather than the more common perspectives of environment and organization. It enhances the literature on upper-echelons by developing more precise specification of the TMT aspects included in Hambrick 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) framework. It also provides more specific assertions about the interactions among these aspects, which have previously been discussed only separately. Further, unlike many current upper-echelons studies which rely on demographic information, this study directly measured top managers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and behaviors through a multiple-respondent survey. In doing so, it has the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of TMTs 2 ̆ 7 effect on firm-level outcomes, particularly, on firm-level entrepreneurship. ...|$|E

40|$|Magister Commercii - MComAs {{a result}} of high {{economic}} inequality, widespread discontent with excessive chief executive officer (CEO) compensation levels is acute in South Africa (SA). Some commentators argue that instead of high levels of CEO pay causing inequality, it {{may be part of}} the solution if higher levels of CEO compensation translate into better company performance, so reducing unemployment. International studies investigating the relationship between CEO short-term cash compensation and current company performance generally report a weak or no relationship where accounting based measures of performance are used. Developments in the international literature reflect a stronger relationship when <b>long-term</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> (LIC) is included and total shareholder return (TSR) used to measure company performance. However, a concerning negative association between the highest paid CEOs in terms of excess LIC and future abnormal TSR is reported. In contrast, SA pay-performance research is largely not reflective of the developments in the international literature, with local studies mostly finding no pay-performance relationship, except where size-related accounting measures are used. As {{a result of}} the strong correlation between CEO pay and company size reported in the international literature, and local studies not adequately controlling for company size, the accuracy of the conclusions drawn in prior studies on the pay-performance sensitivity relationship in SA are brought into question.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{corporate}} performance influences Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay in UK public listed companies. Specifically it is to identify evidence of relative performance evaluation in CEO pay, following the recommendation in the Combined Code (2003) to link <b>long-term</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> to relative firm performance. The major and a novel contribution of this study is the focus on the payments received by CEOs from performance-based long-term incentive schemes. The pay-for-performance relationship is investigated in a longitudinal setting using random and fixed-effect panel data estimation methods. An unbalanced panel of CEOs is drawn from 204 of the largest, nonfinancial UK companies, between 2003 and 2007. From a principal-agent theory perspective it is hypothesised that firm performance is positively associated with chief executive pay and from a relative performance evaluation theory perspective it is hypothesised that, whilst controlling for actual firm performance, peer group performance is negatively associated with chief executive pay. The CEO compensation data are hand collected exclusively for this study and provides a level of detail not previously found in the literature. The findings demonstrate that it is crucial to distinguish between the different elements of pay and the different performance conditions that attach to those elements in order to establish a comprehensive understanding of the pay-for-performance relationship. New and convincing evidence shows that actual bonus pay is determined relative to annual FTSE- 350 market performance and actual long-term pay is determined relative to three-year FTSE- 350 sector performance. These findings provide robust evidence that is consistent with the principal-agent framework of executive pay and corporate performance. This study may alleviate the concerns held by some stakeholder groups that pay is not clearly linked to corporate performance. These findings will be of particula r practical importance to investors who expect the interests of executives to be aligned with those of the company shareholders, via an incentive contract that rewards executives for enhanced corporate performance and consequently shareholder wealth maximisation. The findings also confirm that changes introduced to improve corporate governance practice in the field of executive pay are working to the benefit of shareholders.

40|$|This {{research}} links together disparate {{literature on}} family and nonfamily firms, {{large and small}} firms, and risk for small firms. The literature is not coherent in one theme: whether family firms operate with greater risk relative to nonfamily firms. Yet the literature finds performance advantage to family firms without an explanation of why family firms on average generate better accounting returns and values relative to nonfamily firms other than for reduced agency costs translated into value. The first essay examines two measures of risk [...] debt ratio and idiosyncratic risk [...] of small publicly held family firms relative to nonfamily firms to investigate differences in financial risk between them. Using a unique hand-collected data set of small family and nonfamily firms, I analyze certain firm characteristics (family ownership, family member on the board, size, and dual class status) and find that family and nonfamily firms do not differ in their book-based debt ratios but do differ in their market-based debt ratios. Specifically, I find that family firms that tightly control voting rights through dual class status have higher debt ratios and hence have higher risk than nonfamily firms. Furthermore, I find a positive relation between idiosyncratic risk and family ownership, and I find {{as the percentage of}} family ownership increases idiosyncratic risk increases. The second essay utilizes the likelihood of <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> presence and <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> ratio of small publicly held family firms relative to nonfamily firms to investigate differences in CEO dividends and <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation.</b> The tools available for boards of directors to incentivize CEOs to act in accordance with diverse shareholder wishes, including risk-taking, investment selection, and the on-the-job consumption of resources, are stock options, stock grants, and cash bonuses.

We develop and test a simple model that highlights the role of complementarities between tax sheltering and managerial diversion in determining how high-powered incentives influence tax sheltering decisions. The model generates the testable hypothesis that firm governance characteristics determine how <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> changes sheltering decisions. In order to test the model, we construct an empirical measure of corporate tax avoidance - the component of the book-tax gap not attributable to accounting accruals - and investigate the link between this measure of tax avoidance and <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation.</b> We find that, for the full sample of firms, increases in <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> tend to reduce the level of tax sheltering, suggesting a complementary relationship between diversion and sheltering.

He demonstrates that allowing people to provide narrative explanations for their decisions reduces the amount of operational distortion observed under an <b>incentive</b> <b>compensation</b> scheme, and also reduces surrogation.

We conjecture that boards of directors, acting on behalf of shareholders, increase the size of <b>long-term</b> <b>incentive</b> awards in order to compensate executives for the perceived loss of value when compared with less risky, more certain and more immediate forms of reward. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
