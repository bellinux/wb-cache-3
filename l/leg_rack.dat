40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the carcass and meat traits of Morada Nova, Santa Ines and ½ Ile de France ½ Texel lambs finished in feedlot. Weight and proportion of meatcuts, measures of carcass size and color, tenderness, cooking loss and ultimate pH of meat from 10 Morada Nova, 6 Santa Ines and 10 ½ Ile de France ½ Texel were evaluated. The lambs were finished in collective pens, fed ad libitum with 50 % corn silage and 50 % concentrate and slaughtered at about six months old. Analysis of variance was performed by the procedure PROC GLM of SAS (SAS Inst., Inc., Cary, NC) and means were compared by Tukey test at 5 % significance. The Morada Nova lambs had values of 14. 1 kg, 13. 9 kg, 0. 240 kg/cm, 56. 2 cm and 35. 8 cm for hot and cold carcass weight, compactness index, hip and leg circumference respectively and these values were lower (P 0. 05) among genetic groups. The scores for conformation and fat cover were higher (P < 0. 05) in ½ Ile de France ½ Texel lambs (2. 4 and 3. 0) and the carcass length was greater in Santa Ines lambs (66. 3 cm). The ½ Ile de France ½ Texel lambs had smaller (P< 0. 05) proportion of neck and greater of leg (9. 10 % and 33. 1 %) compared to Morada Nova lambs (10. 3 % and 30. 4 %) and Santa Inês (10. 9 % and 31. 6 %). The weight of shoulder, <b>leg,</b> <b>rack,</b> ribs and flank was lower (P< 0. 05) in Morada Nova (1. 306, 2. 127 kg, 0. 999 kg, 0. 775 kg and 0. 433 kg respectively) compared to Santa Inês (1. 820 kg, 2. 972 kg, 1. 355 kg, 0. 959 and 0. 509 kg) and ½ Ile de France ½ Texel (1. 791 kg, 3. 007 kg, 1. 212 kg, 1. 016 kg and 0. 563 kg). The neck was heavier in Santa Ines (1. 038 kg) which differed (P < 0. 05) from the other genetic groups (0. 725 kg for Morada Nova and 0. 830 kg for ½ Ile de France x ½ Texel lambs). The ½ Ile de France ½ Texel lambs showed meat with higher luminosity (37. 4) than Morada Nova (33. 5) and Santa Ines (31. 7) lambs. When slaughtered at six months of age lambs of the genetic groups evaluated result in similar good quality meat, however, Morada Nova lambs have lower weights of carcass and meat cuts as well as smaller carcass than Santa Ines and ½ Ile de France ½ Texel lambs. </span...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the carcass characteristics of two goat breed types under different durations of feedlot management. Forty eight yearling intact male Borana (n= 24) and Arsi-Bale (n= 24) goats were used in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, the factors being breed-type (Borana and Arsi-bale) and feeding days (90, 120 and 150). The goats were slaughtered after 18 hours fasting to evaluate the various carcass traits. The carcasses were separated into <b>leg,</b> lion, <b>rack,</b> shoulder and neck and breast and shank primal cuts. The Borana goats possessed heavier live weight, empty body weight, carcass weight and length than the Arsi-Bale goats in the feedlot environment. Dressing percentage varied from 41. 0 to 45. 9 % for both goat breed types. Borana had greater rib eye area than Arsi-Bale goats for 120 (42. 9 ± 3. 99) and 150 (47. 3 ± 1. 28) feeding days. Back fat thickness was higher for both breed-types for 150 days feedlot feeding. The highest bone proportion was 30. 9 % for Arsi-Bale goats while the lowest was 25. 7 % for Borana goats.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of substitution of Cynodon hay with banana plantation residue hay on the carcass characteristics and tissue composition of commercial cuts of feedlot Santa Inês lambs. Twenty-five whole lambs were used, with an average age of five months and an initial live weight of 26. 95 kg (± 1. 5), distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments (1 = 40 % Cynodon spp. hay + 60 % concentrate; 2 = 20 % banana leaf hay + 20 % Cynodon spp. hay + 60 % concentrate; 3 = 40 % banana leaf hay + 60 % concentrate; 4 = 20 % banana pseudostem hay + 20 % Cynodon spp. hay + 60 % concentrate; 5 = 40 % banana pseudostem hay + 60 % concentrate) and five repetitions. The lambs were slaughtered on day 69 of the experiment. The variables evaluated were: live weight without fasting (LWWF), live weight post-fasting (LWPF), morphometric measurements in vivo and postmortem, hot and cold carcass weights (HCW, CCW), hot and cold carcass yield (HCY, CCY), biological performance and weight loss by chilling. The carcasses were divided into eight commercial cuts: neck, shoulder, foreshank and hindshank, breast and flank, loin, <b>leg</b> and <b>rack.</b> The <b>leg,</b> shoulder and loin were dissected into muscle, fat and bone. The animals fed on pseudostem hay showed higher LWWF, LWPF, body length, HCW and CCW; however, the HCY, CCY, morphometric measurements and commercial cut weights and yields were not altered by the treatments. The use of pseudostem hay allows for heavier carcasses; however, the use of coproducts changed the characteristics and carcass yield of the assessed commercial cuts. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of introducing Sugar Beet bulb as a cheap substitute for grains in rations formulated for sheep fattening. Materials and Methods: This trial was conducted at the Experimental unit of Rural Development and extension center, Faculty of animal production, University of Gezira. Twenty four Sudanese desert lambs (Ashgur ecotype) were purchased from local markets to assess the effects of replacing grain with Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris saccharifera) Bulb on feed lot performance, carcass traits under tropical conditions of Sudan. Sugar Beet bulb was incorporated in three rations with a control ration (A: control, B, C, D) at percentages of 0, 11, 22, and 33. Results: The results showed that total weight gain and daily feed intake in group D were significantly different at (P< 0. 05) where values of 5. 59 &# 177; 1. 73 and 0. 94 &# 177; 0. 13 kg were recorded. Total weight gain, daily dry matter intake, daily energy intake and feed conversion ratio were in the range of 10. 67 - 5. 59, 1. 03 - 0. 83, 0. 33 - 0. 27 and 11. 77 - 7. 70 kg respectively. Treatments showed no significant differences at (P< 0. 05) for slaughter weight, empty body weight, dressing % on slaughter weight basis and dressing % on empty weight basis, the obtained results for these traits were 27. 78 - 25. 37, 24. 76 - 22. 22, 45. 80 - 43. 45 % and 51. 41 - 49. 65 %.

50|$|The {{dragline}} {{was invented}} in 1904 by John W. Page (as a partner of the firm Page & Schnable Contracting) for use in digging the Chicago Canal. By 1912, Page realized that building draglines was more lucrative than contracting, so he created the Page Engineering Company to build draglines. Page built its first crude walking dragline in 1923. These used <b>legs</b> operated by <b>rack</b> and pinion on a separate frame that lifted the crane. The body was then pulled forward by chain on a roller track and then lowered again. Page developed the first diesel engines exclusively for dragline application in 1924. Page also invented the arched dragline bucket, a design still commonly used today by draglines from many other manufacturers, and in the 1960s pioneered an archless bucket design. With its walking mechanism badly behind that of competitor Monighan (see below), Page updated their mechanism to an eccentric drive in 1935. This much improved mechanism gave a proper elliptical motion and was used until 1988. Page modernized its draglines further with the 700 series in 1954. Page's largest dragline was the Model 757 delivered to the Obed Mine near Hinton, Alberta in 1983. It featured a 75-yard bucket on a 298-foot boom and an operating weight of 4,500 tons. In 1988, Harnischfeger Corporation (P&H Mining Equipment) purchased Page Engineering Company.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Feeder lambs (n = 90) were selected to represent the five USDA yield grades (YG). Ewes and wethers (n= 15 for each group) were selected from Suffolk, F 1 (Suffolk X Commercial Rambouillet first cross), and Commercial Rambouillet. Lambs were sorted randomly into one of five YG treatments and placed on a finishing diet. A three-member team of trained livestock evaluators estimated fat thickness in the live lambs. Lambs were slaughtered according to appropriate humane slaughter methods at staggered intervals when evaluators determined that the lambs had reached their assigned endpoint. All carcasses were evaluated for USDA quality and yield grade at 48 hours postmortem. Carcasses were fabricated into a rough <b>leg,</b> loin, <b>rack,</b> shoulder, neck, breasts, shanks, plates, and flanks. The rough subprimals were then split into right and left sides and all right side subprimals were physically dissected into dissectable lean, bone, and fat (subcutaneous, seam, and internal). Dissectable tissues were weighed for each subprimal. Analysis of variance of the means revealed that breed was significant for virtually all subprimals. Sex class was significant for most bone weights and percentages. Mean analysis of percentage total, subcutaneous, seam, and internal fat and percentage lean and bone reveals the high variability between breeds and sex classes within the five yield grades. Regression equations were developed to predict compositional development of percentage lean, bone, and fat (total, subcutaneous, seam fat, and internal) given actual fat thickness. These equations revealed that Suffolk lambs had lower percentages of total and subcutaneous fat than Commercial Rambouillet and Fl lambs, respectively. Commercial Rambouillet lambs were lower for percentage seam fat than Suffolk and Fl lambs, respectively. Carcasses from ewes were slightly higher than their wether counterparts for total, subcutaneous, and internal fat, and percentage lean. Wether carcasses had more seam fat and bone than ewe carcasses. Across the five yield grades, breed and sex-class impact the ultimate composition of lambs...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Feeder lambs (n= 90) were selected from three breed types (Commercial Finewool, Suffolk X Commercial Finewool first cross (Fl cross) and Suffolk) to represent the current market supply in Texas. Three wethers and three ewes from each breed type were assigned randomly to one of five yield grade treatment groups (n= 18), devised to simulate the fat thickness ranges designated by the USDA yield grade equation. The lambs were evaluated periodically and visually appraised by a team of three experienced livestock evaluators. They were slaughtered at staggered intervals, according to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, when the evaluators had determined that an individual lamb had reached its assigned fat thickness. Before slaughter, certain linear measurements were obtained for each lamb, and live weights were recorded. All carcasses were evaluated for USDA quality and yield grade characteristics by trained carcass evaluators at 48 h postmortem. Additional carcass measurements and characteristics were recorded. Carcasses were fabricated into a rough leg, rough loin, rough rack, rough shoulder, neck, right and left breasts, right and left plates. Kidney and pelvic fat (KP) was removed from the rough leg and rough loin following breaking. The rough primals were then split into left and right sides, and the <b>leg,</b> loin, <b>rack,</b> and shoulder from {{the left side of the}} carcass were fabricated into closely trimmed retail cuts, lean trim, bone, and fat (external, seam, and internal). Yield grade class was significantly related to the weight and percentage of retail product and to the percentage of trimmable components. Additional live and carcass measurements revealed significant correlations with these weights and percentages. Regression equations offered higher predictive values when estimating weight rather than percentage of retail product. As days on feed and live weight increased, yield grade class, along with weight and percentage of trimmable fat, also increased...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: e goal of {{the study}} was to examine and {{evaluate}} the effect of lamb genotype on the growth, feed con-sumption, feed conversion and carcass value of Awassi ram lambs, F 1 crossbreds of Romanov × Awassi and Charollais × Awassi. Average daily weight gain and total weight gain during the trial were 199 ± 0. 01 g and 12. 33 ± 0. 58 kg in pure Awassi ram lambs, 216 ± 0. 01 g and 13. 37 ± 0. 71 kg in F 1 crossbreds A × Ch and 268 ± 0. 01 g and 16. 66 ± 0. 58 kg in F 1 crossbreds A × R (P ≤ 0. 01). Statistically significant differences between the genotypes were found in diagonal body length, rump height and chest girth (P ≤ 0. 01). Evaluation of carcass by-products shows that the genotype affected the weight of full and empty digestive tracts, small intestine, heart, liver, intestinal fat, testicles, kidney and kidney fat (P ≤ 0. 05 – 0. 01). e highest dressing percentage (including fat tail) in warm condition was 50. 93 ± 1. 11 % in Awassi ram lambs and if compared with F 1 crossbred A × Ch 50. 34 ± 1. 36 % and F 1 cross-breeds A × R 49. 05 ± 1. 11 % no statistically significant difference was found. e highest percentage ratios of <b>leg,</b> loin and <b>rack,</b> which represent the prime meat of carcass, 57. 08 ± 1. 72 % were in F 1 crossbreds A × Ch, 54. 14 ± 1. 40 % in F 1 crossbreds A × R and 48. 99 ± 1. 40 % in Awassi ram lambs (P ≤ 0. 001). e highest fat tail percentage 13. 4 ± 1. 06 % was in Awassi ram lambs and the lowest 1. 76 ± 1. 06 % in F 1 crossbreds A × R (P ≤ 0. 001).

40|$|The {{objective}} present {{work was}} {{to evaluate the}} weight earnings, the morfometric and the characteristics of carcass of two genotype of lambs fedlot hair, Santa Ines and Somalis. Two experiments were accomplished: I - for weight earnings and morfometric of males and females, in confinement, and II - for evaluation {{of the characteristics of}} carcass of the males. In the experiment I, 10 males and 10 females of the race Santa Ines, and 10 males and 06 females of the race Somalis, were used, in a completely randomized design, in factorial outline 2 x 2 (two races and two sexes), which totaled four treatments. The adopted alimentary handling was the supply of pricked grass-elephant and concentrated (400 g/head/day), distributed in the morning and in the afternoon. The experimental period had duration of 60 days, where every fifteen days the animals were heavy and accomplished the following weight measures: withers height (HW), crop height (CH),thorax height (TH), length of the body (LB), thoracic perimeter (TP), width of the thorax (WT), width of the croup (WC), croup length (CL), ileum width (IW) and width isqueum (IW). In the experiment II, a completely randomized design, where nine males Santa Ines and six Somalis were abated when they reached an average of 28 kg of alive weight. The appraised characteristics were, the alive discount weight (DW), hot carcass weigh (HCW), cold carcass weigh (CCW), hot carcass revenues (HCR) and cold (CCR), cooling loss (CL), internal length of the carcass (CLI) and the index of compactness of the carcass (ICC). In the cold carcass they were appraised the revenue of the following commercial cuts: neck, palette, whole loin, <b>leg,</b> chest, <b>rack,</b> rib and flank. There was significant difference (P< 0. 05) among the races and enter the sexes so much for the corporal weight as for most of the accomplished measures, of the 150 to the 210 days of age, and the race Santa Ines was superior the race Somalis, and the superior males the females. Among the carcass characteristics, the race Somalis presented smaller averages for PR and ML (P< 0. 05) than Santa Ines. There were not significant differences for the other carcass characteristics, {{as well as for the}} revenues of the cuts, among the appraised races. Santa Ines presented larger weights, weight measures, internal length of the carcass and it breaks for cooling than Somalis.

Foram realizados dois experimentos: I â para ganho de peso e morfometria de machos e fÃmeas, em confinamento, e II â para avaliaÃÃo das caracterÃsticas de carcaÃa dos machos. No experimento I, foram utilizados 10 machos e 10 fÃmeas da raÃa Santa InÃs, e 10 machos e 06 fÃmeas da raÃa Somalis Brasileiros, em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 2 x 2 (duas raÃas e dois sexos), o qual totalizou quatro tratamentos. O manejo alimentar adotado foi o fornecimento de capim-elefante picado e concentrado (400 g/ cabeÃa/dia), distribuÃdos pela manhÃ e Ã tarde. O perÃodo experimental teve duraÃÃo de 60 dias, onde a cada quinze dias os animais foram pesados e realizadas as seguintes medidas corporais: altura da cernelha (ACE), altura da garupa (AGA), altura do tÃrax (ATO), comprimento do corpo (CCO), perÃmetro torÃcico (PTO), largura do tÃrax (LTO), largura da garupa (LGA), comprimento da garupa (CGA), largura do Ãlio (LIL) e largura do Ãsquio (LIS). No experimento II, foi utilizado um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, onde nove machos Santa InÃs e seis Somalis foram abatidos quando atingiram uma mÃdia de 28 kg de peso vivo. As caracterÃsticas avaliadas foram, o peso vivo ao abate (PVA), peso da carcaÃa quente (PCQ), peso da carcaÃa fria (PCF), rendimentos de carcaÃa quente (RCQ) e fria (RCF), perda por resfriamento (PR), comprimento interno da carcaÃa (ML) e o Ãndice de compacidade da carcaÃa (ICC). Na carcaÃa fria foram avaliados o rendimento dos seguintes cortes comerciais: pescoÃo, paleta, lombo inteiro, perna, peito, carrÃ, costela e fraldinha. Houve diferenÃa significativa (p< 0, 05) entre as raÃas e entre os sexos tanto para o peso corporal como para a maioria das medidas realizadas, dos 150 aos 210 dias de idade, sendo que a raÃa Santa InÃs foi superior a raÃa Somalis, e os machos superiores as fÃmeas. Dentre as caracterÃsticas de carcaÃa, a raÃa Somalis apresentou menores mÃdias para PR e ML (p< 0, 05) do que a Santa InÃs. NÃo houve diferenÃas significativas para as demais caracterÃsticas de carcaÃa, como tambÃm para os rendimentos dos cortes, entre as raÃas avaliadas.
