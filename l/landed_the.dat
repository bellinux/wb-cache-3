50|$|The sea has {{a greater}} heat {{capacity}} than <b>land,</b> so <b>the</b> surface of the sea warms up more slowly than <b>the</b> <b>land's.</b> As <b>the</b> temperature of the surface of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> rises, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> heats <b>the</b> air above it by conduction. The warming air expands and becomes less dense, decreasing the pressure over <b>the</b> <b>land</b> near <b>the</b> coast. The air above the sea has a relatively higher pressure, causing air near the coast to flow towards the lower pressure over <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between <b>the</b> <b>land</b> and <b>the</b> sea. If a strong offshore wind is present (that is, a wind greater than sp=us 8 kn) and opposing {{the direction of a}} possible sea breeze, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.|$|R

Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character.

Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have <b>landed</b> <b>the</b> role.|$|E
