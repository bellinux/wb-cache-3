Forward motion {{is limited by}} the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT), and horizontal and vertical motion acuity are limited by <b>lateral</b> <b>motion</b> thresholds. The <b>lateral</b> <b>motion</b> limit is generally below the looming motion limit, and for an object of a given size, <b>lateral</b> <b>motion</b> becomes the more insightful of the two, once the observer moves sufficiently far away from the path of travel. Below these thresholds subjective constancy is experienced in accordance with the Stevens' power law and Weber–Fechner law.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} test the hypothesis that a higher level of knee pain is associated with higher <b>lateral</b> trunk <b>motion</b> in patients with knee OA.

40|$|The dual-reciprocating drill (DRD) is a biologically-inspired low-mass {{alternative}} to traditional drilling techniques, using backwards-facing teethed halves to grip the surrounding substrate, generating a traction force {{that reduces the}} required overhead penetration force. Previous experiments using a proof-of-concept test bench have provided evidence as to the significant role of sideways movements and lateral forces in improving drilling performance. The system is also progressing to a first system prototype concept, in which an actuation mechanism is integrated within the drill heads. To experimentally {{determine the effect of}} <b>lateral</b> <b>motions,</b> a new internal actuation mechanism was developed to allow the inclusion of controlled sideways movements, resulting {{in the creation of the}} circular and diagonal burrowing motions. This paper presents an investigation into the performance of the reciprocation and burrowing motions by testing them in a planetary regolith simulant. Analysis of force sensor measurements has shown a relationship between the penetration and traction forces and the internal friction of the mechanism and depth achieved. These tests have also experimentally demonstrated the benefit of <b>lateral</b> <b>motions</b> in drilling performance, with both the burrowing mechanisms and drilling tests performed at an angle able to penetrate further than traditional vertical reciprocation, leading to the proposition of new burrowing and diagonal drilling mechanics. From this, a new fully integrated system prototype can be developed which incorporates <b>lateral</b> <b>motions</b> that can optimise the drilling performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{designing}} lateral control {{systems for the}} safe landing of VTOL aircraft on small ships is addressed. A ship model is derived. The issues of estimation and prediction of ship motions are discussed, using optimal linear linear estimation techniques. The roll motion {{is the most important}} of the <b>lateral</b> <b>motions,</b> and it is found that it can be predicted for up to 10 seconds in perfect conditions. The automatic landing of the VTOL aircraft is considered, and a lateral controller, defined as a ship motion tracker, is designed, using optimal control techniqes. The tradeoffs between the tracking errors and the control authority are obtained. The important couplings between the <b>lateral</b> <b>motions</b> and controls are demonstrated, and it is shown that the adverse couplings between the sway and the roll motion at the landing pad are significant constraints in the tracking of the <b>lateral</b> ship <b>motions.</b> The robustness of the control system, including the optimal estimator, is studied, using the singular values analysis. Through a robustification procedure, a robust control system is obtained, and the usefulness of the singular values to define stability margins that take into account general types of unstructured modelling errors is demonstrated. The minimal destabilizing perturbations indicated by the singular values analysis are interpreted and related to the multivariable Nyquist diagrams...|$|R

For the Chicago–Seattle Empire Builder, the speed restrictions added 6 hours to what had been a 46-hour schedule. Another important development was the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the new HEP-equipped Amfleet I coaches, designed for short runs, into service.

Let us point out that a "good" modeling is often quite difficult or even impossible to obtain.

To overcome this type of difficulties, we consider a model-free control approach leading to "intelligent" controllers.
