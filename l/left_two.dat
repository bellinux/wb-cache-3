5|$|It is {{slightly}} larger than Pallas, though significantly more massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that <b>left</b> <b>two</b> enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.|$|E
5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, <b>left</b> <b>two</b> superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs {{formed the basis of}} the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.|$|E

5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the annual Scotland v England fixture in 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield {{was about to be}} redeveloped without public funding. None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this <b>left</b> <b>two</b> terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and <b>left</b> <b>two</b> weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|By now the beachhead {{had been}} reinforced; the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had all arrived during the day. Communication {{between the two}} sides {{resulted}} in a more formal truce on 24 May. At 07:30 all firing ceased and parties moved out to bury the dead. This lasted until 16:30 when the truce ended and both sides returned to their own lines. Firing recommenced at 16:45. The Turkish commanders now realised just what would be required to capture the beachhead. Instead of trying again they <b>left</b> <b>two</b> of their depleted divisions, the 16th and 19th, to man their lines while the others were withdrawn. The still independent 77th Infantry Regiment also remained behind, in the same position covering the south.|$|E

5|$|Despite its poor cloud structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over {{portions}} of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of Martinique received a record 12inches (305mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, affecting many northern villages and communes. Le Prêcheur was devastated by an extensive debris flow, which washed away entire structures. The disaster wrought $19million (1993USD) in damage across Martinique, and <b>left</b> <b>two</b> people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed {{two people in the}} Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown.|$|E
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and {{refugees}} from Odessa, and various revolutionary factions were active in the area. One event, the Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which <b>left</b> <b>two</b> dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{that preceded}} the storm forced {{thousands}} of gamblers along the Las Vegas Strip to be evacuated and <b>left</b> <b>two</b> people missing. The remnants of the storm later moved into the region, bringing additional flooding. Many parking lots in the resort town of Laughlin were flooded. Furthermore, the villages of Searchlight and Blue Diamond were isolated due to flooding. Several major streets in Paradise were closed because of flooding and sandbag barriers were erected alongside Caesars Palace to prevent further flood damage. In addition, record river levels were measured along the Amargosa River near Death Valley.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei Road area. The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil. The opium addicts were mainly poor, elderly people from working-class groups. In early 1991, a spate of fires destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road. Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident <b>left</b> <b>two</b> people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of North Carolina, the storm {{produced}} 34-foot (10-m) waves and storm force winds which damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard. All nine were injured to some degree; three endured hypothermia, one received a broken rib, and one Coast Guardsman experienced back injuries from the surf. Another boat and its four occupants were reported missing, and after twelve days they remain missing. Rough waves from the precursor low <b>left</b> <b>two</b> kayakers missing near Seabrook Island, South Carolina. One was found the next day, {{and the other was}} found dead a week later.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall {{is known}} to have <b>left</b> <b>two</b> sons: Ruaidrí (died 1247?) and Domnall. Domnall's line, the meic Domnaill (or Clann Domnaill), went on to produce the {{powerful}} Lords of the Isles who dominated the entire Hebrides and expansive mainland-territories from {{the first half of the}} fourteenth- to the late fifteenth centuries. Ruaidrí founded the meic Ruaidrí (or Clann Ruaidrí), a more obscure kindred who were seated in Garmoran. Ruaidrí seems to have been the senior of Ragnall's sons, and is first recorded by name in 1214. Four years previous, Áengus and his sons are recorded by the Chronicle of Mann to have been slain on Skye. This particular record could be evidence that Áengus had succeeded Ragnall, after which the latter's sons extinguished Áengus's line, and Ruaidrí assumed control of the meic Somairle succession.|$|E

5|$|That still <b>left</b> <b>two</b> {{separate}} governments {{claiming to}} be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in Paris. To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the Paris Peace Conference. Articles 87–93 of the Versailles Treaty and the Little Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.|$|E
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he <b>left</b> <b>two</b> years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston <b>left</b> <b>two</b> dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E

5|$|Although most of {{the storms}} {{impacted}} land, overall effects were minimal. Ana caused minor flooding and wind damage in the Carolinas and <b>left</b> <b>two</b> dead in North Carolina. Tropical Storm Bill and its remnants caused flooding primarily in the South Central, Midwestern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, while its precursor also left flooding in Central America and Mexico. The storm resulted in two deaths in Honduras, two in Guatemala, one in Mexico, and three deaths in the United States. Additionally, the United States suffered about $17.9million (2015USD) in damage. Claudette and Danny left very minimal impact on land. In late August, Tropical Storm Erika brought heavy rainfall to Dominica, leading to devastating floods. Erika caused nearly $500million in damage and 30fatalities, making it the island's deadliest natural disaster since Hurricane David in 1979. The storm also flooded other nearby islands, but to a much lesser degree, such as Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. Five additional deaths occurred in Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Approaching I-96 {{from the}} south, the freeway passes {{east of the}} DeltaPlex Arena, and it median widens further {{across the river from}} Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, {{widening}} the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 occupies the <b>left</b> <b>two</b> lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US131. At the split between I-296 and US131, I-296 curves northwest, and US131 curves northeast to follow a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and passes over West River Drive. To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with southbound US131 north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{tropical}} cyclones {{affected countries}} bordering the Atlantic Ocean throughout 2010. Alex caused 52 deaths {{and up to}} $1.89 billion (2010 USD) in damage as it struck northern Mexico in June. The next month, Tropical Storm Bonnie struck Florida as a weak cyclone, leaving one dead. Tropical Storm Colin led to one drowning death, and rip currents produced by Tropical Depression Five killed two people. Hurricane Danielle passed east of Bermuda while Earl moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States and into Nova Scotia throughout late August, resulting in 2 and 8 deaths, respectively. In early September, Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding across Texas and killed 8 people. The strongest hurricane of the year, Igor, killed four as it traversed the Atlantic and across Newfoundland. Latin America was hard hit by Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew, with 22 and 126 deaths, respectively. In late September, Tropical Storm Nicole produced torrential rainfall from the Caribbean into the U.S. East Coast, resulting in 16 fatalities. Hurricane Paula caused a tourist to drown offshore Cozumel in mid-October, while Hurricane Richard <b>left</b> <b>two</b> dead in Belize later that month. The season concluded with Tomas which caused 35 fatalities along its track through the Caribbean and into the Atlantic.|$|E
