40|$|The retinex {{algorithm}} for lightness {{and color}} constancy is extended to include 3 -dimensional spatial information reconstructed from a stereo image. A key aspect of traditional retinex is that, within each color channel, it makes local spatial comparisons of intensity. In particular, intensity ratios are computed between neighboring spatial locations, retinex assumes {{that a large}} ratio indicates a change in surface reflectance, not a change in incident illumination; however, this assumption is often violated in 3 -dimensional scenes, where an abrupt change in surface orientation {{can lead to a}} significant change in illumination. In this paper, retinex is modified to use the 3 -dimensional edge information derived from stereo images. The edge map is used so that spatial comparisons are only made between locations lying on approximately the same plane in 3 -dimensions. Experiments on real images show this method works well, however, they also reveal that it can lead to isolated regions, which, as a result of being isolated, are incorrectly determined to be grey. To overcome this problem, stereo retinex is extended to allow information that is orthogonal to the space of possible illuminants to propagate across changes in surface orientation. This is accomplished by transforming the original RGB image data into a color space based on coordinates of <b>luminance,</b> <b>illumination</b> and reflectance. This coordinate system allows stereo retinex to propagate reflectance information across changes in surface orientation, {{while at the same time}} inhibiting the propagation of potentially invalid illumination information. The stereo retinex algorithm builds upon the multi-resolution implementation of retinex known as McCann 99. Experiments on synthetic and real images show that stereo retinex performs significantly better than unmodified McCann 99 retinex when evaluated in terms of the accuracy with which correct surface object colors are estimated.

When displayed on a monitor, the exact chromaticities of the reference white point 1,1,1, the reference black point 0,0,0, and the primaries (1,0,0, 0,1,0, and 0,0,1) are specified. To meet the color appearance requirements of the color space, the luminance of the monitor must be 160.00 cd/m2 at the white point, and 0.5557 cd/m2 at the black point, which implies a contrast ratio of 287.9.

40|$|Introduction The {{luminance}} of {{a surface}} {{results from the}} combined effect of its reflectance (albedo) and its conditions of <b>illumination.</b> <b>Luminance</b> can be directly observed, but reflectance and illumination can only be derived by perceptual processes. Human observers are good at judging an object's reflectance in spite of large changes in illumination; this skill is known as "lightness constancy. " Most research on lightness constancy has used stimuli consisting of grey patches on a single flat plane. The models are typically {{based on the assumption}} that slow variations in luminance are due to illumination gradients, while sharp changes in luminance are due to reflectance edges. The retinex models for use with "Mondrian" stimuli are good examples (Land and McCann, 1971; Horn, 1974). But in three-dimensional scenes, sharp luminance changes can arise from either reflectance or from illumination, as illustrated in Figure 11. 1 (a). The edge marked (1) is due to a reflectance change...|$|R
40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{describes a}} new procedure {{to evaluate the}} optical conspicuousness of advertisement boards in a natural environment. The object of this procedure is the computer-aided positioning of advertisements as well as optimizing the layout of individual boards or posters. For this purpose the scenario to be examined within a modelling process is first geometrically described. The geometric models thus created contain additional attributes such as color and <b>luminance</b> at calibrated <b>illumination.</b> A ray casting process then creates {{an image of the}} board to be evaluated and of its environment from an observer position to be analyzed. To evaluate the optical conspicuousness a two-pass-model of the human visual systems is presented, modelling the retina by way of isotropic Laplace-filters and simple cells of the visual cortex by anisotropic edge extractors and Fourier transform. The image analysis giving a quantitative measure for optical conspicuousness is carried out on the i mage presentations appearing in the individual model phases. The method of the procedure here described is documented with first examples and can be compared with classical methods of eye-tracking in psychology of advertising...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Intrinsicimagesrepresenttheunderlyingpropertiesofascene such as {{illumination}} (shading) {{and surface}} reflectance. Extracting intrinsic images is a challenging, ill-posed problem. Human performance on {{tasks such as}} shadow detection and shape-from-shading is improved by adding colour and texture to surfaces. In particular, when a surface is painted with a textured pattern, correlations between local mean luminance and local luminance amplitude promote the interpretation of <b>luminance</b> variations as <b>illumination</b> changes. Based on this finding, we propose a novel feature, local luminance amplitude, to separate illumination and reflectance, and a framework to integrate this cue with hue and texture to extract intrinsic images. The algorithm uses steerable filters to separate images into frequency and orientation components and constructs shading and reflectance images from weighted combinations of these components. Weights are determined by correlations between correspondingvariations inlocal luminance, local amplitude,colour andtexture. The intrinsic images are further refined by ensuring the consistency of local texture elements. We test this method on surfaces photographed under different lighting conditions. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated bythecorrelation between ourintrinsic images andground truth shading and reflectance data. Luminance amplitude {{was found to be}} a useful cue. Results are also presented for natural images. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe snake {{illusion}} is {{an effect}} {{in which the}} lightness of target patches is strongly affected by the luminance of remote patches. One explanation is that such images are decomposed into a pattern of illumination and a pattern of reflectance, involving a classification of <b>luminance</b> edges into <b>illumination</b> and reflectance edges. Based on this decomposition, perceived reflectance is determined by discounting the illumination. A problem for this account is that image decomposition is not unique, and that different decompositions may lead to different lightness predictions. One way to rule out alternative decompositions and ensure correct predictions is to postulate that the visual system tends to classify curved luminance edges as reflectance edges rather than illumination edges. We have constructed several variations of the basic snake display {{in order to test}} the proposed curvature constraint and the more general image decomposition hypothesis. Although the results from some displays have confirmed previous findings of the effect of curvature, the general pattern of data questions the relevance of the shape of luminance edges for the determination of lightness in this class of displays. The data also argue against an image decomposition mechanism as an explanation of this effect. As an alternative, a tentative neurally based account is sketched...|$|R
40|$|In {{this current}} project, the {{reflective}} behaviour of road surfaces {{under the influence}} of vehicular lighting was examined. Study of the relevant literature describes the results achieved up until now for the reflective behaviour of these road surfaces. It becomes clear that the majority of studies which have been carried out have concentrated on reflective behaviour caused by stationary road lighting. The relationships of special vehicle geometry with small angles for illumination and observation as well as measuring distances of up to 100 m, have never been considered in detail. It was possible to calculate the dependency of the <b>luminance</b> factor for <b>illumination</b> and observation angles which are present with the vehicle geometry in laboratory tests. The tests were supplemented with outside measurements. In order to measure the index values, a new kind of luminance measuring system was used which facilitates high resolution measurement of road surface luminance values. To carry out outside measurements easily, a portable reflectometer for road surfaces was developed. A criterion for the designation of reflective behaviour of road surfaces {{under the influence of}} vehicular lighting has been proposed. This is based on the correlation of the surface luminance factors in forward and reverse direction at various geometries. Furthermore, a simple method for describing the characteristics of reverse reflection from dry road surfaces was set up. (orig.)

40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{has been}} studied by applying methods of direct scaling to color appearances of stimuli perceived under different conditions of adaptation. This study differs from previous work {{in a number of}} ways. The color appearances of surface color stimuli were scaled by both magnitude estimation and magnitude production psychophysical methods. Changes in color appearances resulting from variations in correlated color temperature of adapting <b>illumination,</b> <b>luminance</b> factors of samples, illuininance, and surround induction conditions were scaled by a group of seven observers who had been trained to describe their perceptions in a uniform manner. This factorial approach to chromatic adaptation- influences on color appearance has yielded information about changes throughout a color solid rather than a single planar section of that solid. A distinction was made between absolute and relative attributes of color appearance. valuations of both internal and external consistency indicate that the data generated have relatively high precision and validity. The results indicate that chromatic adaptation induces smooth, continuous changes in color appearance. The nature of these changes depends upon correlated color temperature, luminance factor, and illuminance of surface color stimuli. Saturation, or colorfulness, is most susceptible to change and is highly dependent upon luminance factor and illuminance in addition to color temperature. These dependencies are systematic and explicit in the results presented here. Hue appearance of a given sample depends primarily upon color temperature of adapting illumination. Little or no change in hue was found for the range of variation in illuminance and luminance factor included in this study. In general, the hues of' all stimuli change with adaptation but there are important exceptions. The results do not support a linear model for the chromatic adaptation process...|$|R
