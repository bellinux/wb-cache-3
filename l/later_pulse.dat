40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{propagation}} through an extended sample of two- and three-level atoms on the coherent accumulation of excitation by an ultrashort pulse train. In the two- level case, previous pulses in the train may prepare the medium such that a <b>later</b> <b>pulse</b> may experience amplification and absorption in different positions inside the sample. For a large number of pulses, the atomic medium may be saturated by the train, and some pulses propagate without experiencing either absorption or amplification. In general, absorption of the resonant pulse frequency during propagation compromises the accumulation efficiency. In the three-level case, the coherent accumulation of excitation leads to electromagnetically induced transparency of the pulse train, and the pulses exit the medium without any distortion in their temporal profile...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{physical}} mechanisms {{are thought to}} be responsible for the triggering and spatiotemporal evolution of aftershocks. Here we analyze a vigorous aftershock sequence and postseismic geodetic strain that occurred in the Yuha Desert following the 2010 M_w 7. 2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. About 155, 000 detected aftershocks occurred in a network of orthogonal faults and exhibit features of two distinct mechanisms for aftershock triggering. The earliest aftershocks were likely driven by afterslip that spread away from the mainshock with the logarithm of time. A <b>later</b> <b>pulse</b> of aftershocks swept again across the Yuha Desert with square-root time dependence and swarm-like behavior; together with local geological evidence for hydrothermalism, these features suggest the events were driven by fluid diffusion.

40|$|Tetrahymena pyriformis {{were brought}} to a non-growing state by removal of {{pyrimidine}}s from their growth medium. During pyrimidine deprivation cell number increased 3 - to 4 fold, and this increase was accompanied {{by one or more}} complete cycles of macronuclear DNA replication. Autoradiographic studies show that endogenous protein and RNA were turning over throughout starvation and that RNA breakdown products were used to support the DNA synthesis that occurred during the early period of starvation. However, after 72 hours of starvation all DNA synthesis and cell division had ceased. Feulgen microspectrophotometry shows the macronuclei of these cells to have been stopped at a point prior to DNA replication (G 1 stage). After pyrimidine replacement the incorporation of H 3 -uridine, H 3 -adenosine, and H 3 -leucine was measured by the autoradiographic grain counting method. The results indicate that RNA synthesis began to increase almost immediately, but that there was a lag of almost an hour before an increase in protein synthesis. In agreement with the autoradiographic data, chemical data also show that cellular content of RNA began to increase shortly after pyrimidine replacement but that cellular protein content did not increase until about one hour <b>later.</b> <b>Pulse</b> labeling of the cells with H 3 -thymidine at intervals after pyrimidine replacement shows that labeled macronuclei first began to appear at 150 minutes; that 98 per cent of the macronuclei were in DNA synthesis at 240 to 270 minutes; and that the percentage then began to decrease from 300 to 390 minutes, at which time only 25 per cent of the macronuclei were labeled. Cellular content of DNA did not increase for at least 135 minutes after pyrimidine replacement; however, just before the first cells divided (360 minutes) the DNA content had doubled.

The peak and power law decay of the early optical emission strongly indicates {{the presence of a}} decelerating relativistic shell during that phase. Prior to this burst, it was not known if the shell decelerated during the burst, so an external shock origin for the gamma rays was still possible. If the gamma-rays are produced in the external shock, then the pulse widths should reflect the observed deceleration of the shell and increase by about 2. 3. We analyze the fine time structure observed in the gamma-ray data from BATSE and determine that the width of the peaks do not increase as expected for a decelerating shell; the <b>later</b> <b>pulses</b> are, at most, a factor of 1. 15 longer than the earlier pulses. We also analyze the variability to determine what fraction of the shell’s surface could be involved in the production of the gamma rays, the so-called surface filling factor.

The lack of pulse width evolution eliminates the only remaining kinematically acceptable external shock explanation for the gamma-ray phase and, thus, the gamma rays must originate at a central engine.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} summation {{characteristics of the}} neural network subserving self-stimulation reward.

The time constant of the first integrator is approximately 450 msec, whereas that of the second integrator is approximately 6. 5 sec. Furthermore, these integrators {{are sensitive to the}} spatiotemporal arrival of the signals. When prolonged stimulation is delivered at a high pulse frequency, the initial pulses contribute the most to the rewarding effect. <b>Later</b> <b>pulses</b> are affected by the reduced ability of the neurons or synapses to transmit signals along the neural network due to fatigue. A fatigue effect may be dissipated by splitting a pulse train into two parts by an interval of no stimulation. This should increase the rewarding effectiveness of the pulse train. However, the rewarding effectiveness is dependent upon the duration of the interval of no stimulation and the magnitude of the two pulse-train halves. A long interval of no stimulation combined with a low stimulation magnitude may cause a frustration response and a decay in memory of the associations between the response, first pulse-train half, and second pulse-train half. These would make the rewarding effectiveness of the two pulse-train halves lower than that of a continuous pulse train. Previous models of summation are unable to predict the present results.

This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the <b>later</b> <b>pulses</b> pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU.

Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars {{at the tip of the}} asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.

Among 8 single-pulse long GRBs, 5 show hard-to-soft evolution, while 3 show intensity-tracking. The multi-pulse long GRBs have more complicated patterns. Among the GRBs whose time-resolved spectrum is available for the first pulse, almost half (15 / 32 GRBs) show clear hard-to-soft evolution, {{and the other half}} (17 / 32 GRBs) show clear intensity-tracking. <b>Later</b> <b>pulses</b> typically show the tracking behavior, although a hard-to-soft evolution pattern was identified in the 2 nd pulse of 2 GRBs whose pulses are well separated. Statistically, the hard-to-soft evolution pulses tend to be more asymmetric than the intensity-tracking ones, with a steeper rising wing than the falling wing. Short GRBs have E_ p tracking intensity exclusively with the 16 ms time resolution analysis. We performed a simulation analysis, and suggest that at least for some bursts, the late intensity-tracking pulses could be a consequence of overlapping hard-to-soft pulses. However, the fact that the intensity-tracking pattern exists in the first pulse of multi-pulse long GRBs and some single-pulse GRBs suggest that intensity tracking is an independent component, which may operate in some late pulses as well. For the GRBs with measured redshifts, we present a time-resolved E_ p-L_γ, iso correlation analysis and show that the scatter of the correlation is comparable to that of the global Amati/Yonetoku relation.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model of plasma flow from a metal plate hit by an intense, pulsed, electron beam aims {{to bridge the}} gap between radiation-hydrodynamics simulations and experiments, and to quantify the self-effect of the electron beam penetrating the flow. Does the flow disrupt the tight focus of the initial electron bunch, or <b>later</b> <b>pulses</b> in a train? This work aims to model the spatial distribution of plasma speed, density, degree of ionization, and magnetization to inquire. The initial solid density, several eV plasma expands to 1 cm and 10 {sup {minus} 4 } relative density by 2 {micro}s, beyond which numerical simulations are imprecise. Yet, a Faraday cup detector at the ETA-II facility is at 25 cm from the target and observes the flow after 50 {micro}s. The model helps bridge this gap. The expansion of the target plasma into vacuum is so rapid that the ionized portion of the flow departs from local thermodynamic equilibrium. When the temperature (in eV) in a parcel of fluid drops below V{sub i} x [(2 {gamma} - 2) /(5 {gamma} + 17) ], where V{sub i} is the ionization potential of the target metal (7. 8 eV for tantalum), and {gamma} is the ratio of specific heats (5 / 3 for atoms), then the fractional ionization and electron temperature in that parcel remain fixed during subsequent expansion. The freezing temperature as defined here is V{sub i}/ 19. The balance between the self-pinching force and the space charge repulsion of an electron beam changes on penetrating a flow: (i) the target plasma cancels the space-charge field, (ii) internal eddy currents arise to counter the magnetization of relativistic electrons, and (iii) electron beam heating alters the flow magnetization by changing the plasma density gradient and the magnitude of the conductivity...|$|R

Dose accumulation (memory) effects were attributed to the accumulation of OH radicals and lattice vacancies in the irradiated ice.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} causes for, and {{distribution}} of, unimodal versus bimodal seasonal {{cycle of vegetation}} greenness in the Southwest United States using extensive site observations, climate data, satellite data, and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) vegetation model. Peak vegetation greenness is achieved in a clockwise manner across the Southwest, beginning in spring in the Sonoran Desert following winter rains, then in Utah-Colorado with snowmelt/summer rains, and finally in New Mexico–eastern Arizona with late summer monsoon rains. At high elevations, spring-summer snowmelt is critical for supplying the necessary soil moisture to trigger vegetation growth. A bimodal seasonal cycle of vegetation greenness is evident in satellite data and LPJ simulations across eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, characterized by peaks during late spring–early summer and late summer–early autumn. This bimodal green-up remains a pressing paradox for which many competing hypotheses exist. The mechanism for this seasonal pattern is demonstrated using LPJ and observational data and is found to deviate from the traditional pulse-reserve paradigm. This paradigm states that rainfall events in arid lands produce nearly immediate pulses of vegetation growth and accumulation of reserves but does not consider cold dormancy, time-lagged vegetation responses, or rainfall seasonality. The following soil moisture based mechanism for bimodal greening is proposed. The initial peak in vegetation greenness during late spring–early summer results from a break in cold dormancy and benefits from the gradual winter-long accumulation of deep soil moisture from weak synoptic rain events and snowmelt in colder regions. Limited precipitation and ongoing transpiration, from the initial vegetation greening, trigger a midsummer drying of the soil and a consequential minimum in vegetation activity. <b>Later,</b> <b>pulses</b> of monsoon rainfall in late summer–early autumn support the secondary greening, although significant runoff of brief, intense rainstorms and substantial soil evaporation limit moisture to the upper soil layers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Caleu pluton, {{which is}} located in the Coastal Range of central Chile, {{consists}} of three N­S elongated lithologic zones which define an across-pluton compositional variation characterized by a westward increase in SiO 2 content, the Gabbro-Diorite (GDZ), Tonalite (TZ) and Granodiorite (GZ) Zones. A total of 547 cores were drilled at 68 sites within the different zones to carry out magnetic fabric and paleomagnetic studies. The highest values of magnetic susceptibility and remanent magnetization are found in the GDZ (0. 04 ­ 0. 1 SI), whereas the lowest values are observed in the GZ (0. 01 ­ 0. 02 SI). This is consistent with the significant decrease in magnetite content from the GDZ to the GZ. The dips of the magnetic foliation planes are steep within GDZ and TZ, and shallower dips are observed in GZ. Magnetic foliations along some borders of the pluton are parallel to the corresponding contacts. The parallelism observed between the magnetic foliations and the contacts between zones suggests that these zones have recorded the same mechanism of emplacement at the magmatic state. The peculiar foliation pattern observed in the central parts of TZ and GZ is attributed to a lobe-like structure that was acquired during the late stages of emplacement and inflation. The distinct compositional characteristics of these three zones were not acquired in situ. Rather they were emplaced successively from mafic to felsic from a subjacent stratified sill-like magma reservoir, which was filled after tilting of the host volcanic succession. The rapid upward transport of these melts of different compositions up to a shallow depth is attested by both the equilibration pressure of late magmatic hornblende (200 MPa) and the pressure of early magmatic epidote crystallization (500 ­ 600 MPa).
