50|$|The {{first step}} is a {{nucleophilic}} attack by the imine nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon to generate a zwitterionic intermediate. Electron donating groups on the imine facilitate this step, while electron-withdrawing groups impede the attack. The second step is either an intramolecular nucleophilic <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> or a conrotary electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>closure.</b> The second step is different from typical electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> as predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. Under photochemical and microwave conditions the intermediate's 4π-electron system cannot undergo a disrotatory <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> to form the β-lactam, possibly because the two double bonds are not coplanar. Some products of the Staudinger Synthesis differ from those predicted by the torquoelectronic model. In addition, the electronic structure of the transition state {{differs from that of}} other conrotary <b>ring</b> <b>closures.</b>|$|R

40|$|Ring closure {{following}} {{flash photolysis}} in alkane solvents has been detected for several complexes {{in the series}} (η 5 -C 5 H 4 R) Mn(CO) 3 where R = COCH 3 (1), COCH 2 SCH 3 (2), CO(CH 2) 2 SCH 3 (3), COCH 2 OCH 3 (4), (CH 2) 2 CO 2 CH 3 (5), CH 2 CO 2 CH 3 (6). In each case where <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> occurs, a metal CO is ultimately substituted by the side chain functional group. Photoacoustic calorimetry studies reveal that <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> occur with rate constants faster than 10 7 s- 1 or between 10 6 – 10 7 s- 1, {{or in some cases}} the <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> is biphasic with rate constants in both ranges. The enthalpies of CO dissociation followed by <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> for 2 and 3 are the same (12 kcal/mol) and more favorable than those for 4 - 6 (25 - 15 kcal/mol). Studies of 1 - 3 by transient ps to µs infrared spectroscopy further indicate biphasic dynamics for 2 and 3 : <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> occurs immediately (k> 5 x 10 9 s- 1) and at slower rates (k = 10 8 – 10 6 s- 1). We propose that some <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> occurs before solvent coordination and that the remaining <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> is much slower resulting in the displacement of solvent. The relationships of the rates and energetics of <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> to structure and quantum yields are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|DOT, DOE and NRC Type A and Type B {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transport packages routinely use industrial or military specification drums with conventional clamp <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> as an overpack. Considerable testing has been performed on these type packages {{over the past}} 30 years. Observations from test data have resulted in various design changes and recommendations to the standard drum specification and use, enhancing {{the reliability of the}} overpack. Recently, performance capability of the 9975 conventional clamp <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> design was questioned by the Regulatory Authority. This paper highlights the observations of recent 9974 and 9975 package testing that led to redesign of the 9975, replacing the standard clamp <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> with a bolted <b>ring</b> <b>closure.</b> In the course of this review and redesign effort, 18 package designs and approximately 100 Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) drops of various size and weight drum packages were evaluated. A trend was observed with respect to overpack lid failures for packages utilizing conventional <b>ring</b> <b>closure.</b> Based on this trend, a limit on the ratio of the content weight to total package weight was identified, beyond which clamp <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> failure may be expected...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} asymmetrically induced {{cyclization}} reactions are described, furnishing specifically substituted steroid-like systems with thiophene as the A <b>ring.</b> Ring <b>closure</b> of achiral compounds gives two enantiomeric trans-anti-fused products, containing three chiral carbon atoms each.

A chiral center far removed from the cyclization initiator also influences the stereochemical outcome of such cyclizations.
