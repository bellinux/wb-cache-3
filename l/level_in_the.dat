Methods: Total IgE antibodies and allergen-specific IgE antibodies in each sample of nasal mucosal tissue from 11 allergic rhinitis patients were measured with the AlaSTAT 3 gAllergy assay. We compared the levels of total IgE and IgEs specific for house dust (HD), mites, and cedar pollen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum and the inferior turbinate. Results: The total IgE levels and the cedar pollen-specific IgE <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inferior turbinate mucosal tissue correlated significantly with their respective <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> serum. <b>The</b> HD- and mite-specific IgE <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inferior turbinate mucosal tissue did not correlate significantly with their respective <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum.

Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E

5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness.

Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout.
