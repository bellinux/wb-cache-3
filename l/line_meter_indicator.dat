These unobservable attacks present a potentially serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of <b>line</b> power <b>meters</b> is presented. This requires O(n 2 m) flops for a power system with n buses and m <b>line</b> <b>meters.</b> If all <b>lines</b> are <b>metered,</b> there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5 -sparse unobservable attacks.

There are four channels of detection for two hands and two feet. Four G-M detectors {{have been used in}} a single unit to cover the whole area of hand and feet. A regulated high voltage DC power supply (900 V) has been designed using the PIC 12 F 675 microcontroller to operate the pancake Geiger-Müller detectors. The reading is displayed on a linearly scaled 0 - 100 Bq/cm 2 analog panel meter. The monitor detects beta–gamma radiation emitted by radioactive materials, and if the detected value exceeds a preset level, the monitor sounds an alarm and displays a reading in the respective panel <b>meter.</b> <b>Indicator</b> lamps are used to show the status of contamination.

40|$|Limited {{presence}} of nodal and <b>line</b> <b>meters</b> in distribution grids hinders their optimal operation {{and participation in}} real-time markets. In particular lack of real-time information on the grid topology and infrequently calibrated line parameters (impedances) adversely affect the accuracy of any operational power flow control. This paper suggests a novel algorithm for learning the topology of distribution grid and estimating impedances of the operational lines with minimal observational requirements - it provably reconstructs topology and impedances using voltage and injection measured only at the terminal (end-user) nodes of the distribution grid. All other (intermediate) nodes in the network may be unobserved/hidden. Furthermore no additional input (e. g., number of grid nodes, historical information on injections at hidden nodes) is needed for the learning to succeed. Performance of the algorithm is illustrated in numerical experiments on the IEEE and custom power distribution models...|$|R
