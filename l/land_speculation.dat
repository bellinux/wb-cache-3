5|$|During {{his nine}} years as {{territorial}} governor, Edwards {{made a good}} deal of money through several profitable ventures, including farming, <b>land</b> <b>speculation,</b> and investment in sawmills, grist mills, and stores.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Magoffin {{returned}} to his legal practice and engaged in agricultural pursuits in Harrodsburg. A series of <b>land</b> <b>speculation</b> ventures near Chicago, Illinois made him very wealthy. He encouraged his fellow Kentuckians to accept {{the results of the}} war. He advocated for civil rights for blacks and urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Boone {{worked as}} a {{surveyor}} and merchant, but fell deeply into debt through failed Kentucky <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b> Frustrated with the legal problems resulting from his land claims, in 1799, Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where {{he spent most of}} the last two decades of his life (1800–20).|$|E
50|$|Learned {{was elected}} to the upper house of assistants in 1791, and elected as a Pro-Administration {{candidate}} to the Second and Third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1791 to March 3, 1795. He engaged in <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> while serving in Congress.|$|R
50|$|Tank became {{associated}} with the Fox-Wisconsin River Improvement Company, but eventually lost heavily in the venture. He then turned his promotional activities to <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> in Menasha and Manitowoc, and to railroad ventures, chiefly the Green Bay and Minnesota Rail Road.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first white}} {{settlers}} in Eldred Township were mostly Quakers, {{attracted by the}} <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> of Robert Morris, and others in Muncy Township. Among these settlers were the Winners, Wilsons, and Marshalls. The neighborhood of their settlement is now known by the title of [...] "Quaker Hill." ...|$|R
5|$|Owing to Henry Drummond's {{concerns}} in 1852 that the LNC was a front for <b>land</b> <b>speculation,</b> {{the sale of}} LNC-owned land for building had been expressly forbidden by the Act of Parliament establishing the LNC, and consequently much of the land not in use for burials remained undeveloped, aside from the land sold in the 1850s and 1860s, and the areas sold by Cyril Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in the St. Lawrence river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{national}} prosperity followed {{the end of}} the War of 1812. In Kentucky, rapid population growth and strong demand for the state's goods led to <b>land</b> <b>speculation</b> becoming a popular enterprise. The charter of the Kentucky Insurance Company in 1802 and the Bank of Kentucky in 1806 made currency for loans plentiful. The establishment of branches of the Second Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington further augmented the availability of credit. In 1818, the General Assembly chartered 40 more state banks, and later added six more.|$|E
50|$|Murray {{resolved}} {{to become a}} good business investor in <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> and construction projects. He continued {{to do business with}} the Bronson sons. He became involved in rather dubious Rutherford Land Grab of 1834 in the Carolinas, but was not convicted. He was also in a partnership that invested extensively in the 'Ohio Country' as far west as Chicago and Kalamazoo.|$|R
50|$|In 1843 {{there was}} a panic which was {{attributed}} to an influx of British capital being used for <b>land</b> <b>speculations,</b> with the money being deposited in banks at interest, lent to squatters, and its sudden withdrawal {{for the purpose of}} remitting to London in payment for immigration and other demands. The panic was also caused by low wool prices and the cessation of transportation.|$|R
50|$|McArthur {{obtained}} a position with Nathaniel Massie in 1793, {{and worked with}} Massie on a surveying expedition in the Northwest Territory. In 1796, he worked with Massie {{to lay out the}} new town of Chillicothe, Ohio, which was to become the state capital in 1803. McArthur moved across the Ohio River in 1797 to Chillicothe, where he gained wealth by his <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> in the Northwest Territory.|$|R
5|$|Allen wrote {{accounts}} of his exploits {{in the war}} that were widely read in the 19th century, as well as philosophical treatises and documents relating {{to the politics of}} Vermont's formation. His business dealings included successful farming operations, one of Connecticut's early iron works, and <b>land</b> <b>speculation</b> in the Vermont territory. Land purchased by Allen and his brothers included tracts of land that eventually became Burlington, Vermont. He was twice married, fathering eight children.|$|E
5|$|Ayer {{has been}} a major {{railroad}} interchange since the Fitchburg Railroad opened through South Groton in 1845, followed by the Stony Brook Railroad, Worcester and Nashua Railroad, and Peterborough and Shirley Railroad in 1848. The original depot was replaced with a union station with a large trainshed in 1848. <b>Land</b> <b>speculation</b> and industrial development spurred by the railroad access expanded the tiny farm village into the independent town of Ayer.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation participating in <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b> Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and other areas of the United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E
25|$|Greenleaf's speculations {{ruptured}} his {{relationships with}} his family, {{most of whom}} he had persuaded to invest in his <b>land</b> <b>speculations.</b> It also left impoverished the family of William Cranch (who had married Greenleaf's sister) and many Bostonians. But by early 1795, Greenleaf had mended his personal relationship with his old business partner, James Watson, and with other business associates in New York City. He also was reconciled to his sister, Rebecca.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the young}} Brigadier General Samuel Waldo (pictured at right) {{he became a}} land {{speculator}} {{of as much as}} 15,000 acres [...] in the Falmouth area (near present-day Portland, Maine). The two partners prospered until, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Waldo [...] "had led him into large <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> ... then struck upon him in an unfortunate time." [...] "Waldo by unscrupulous or ruthless means divested Westbrook of his lands and much of his wealth by 1743..." ...|$|R
50|$|John Hill {{made several}} {{speculative}} land investments in Adelaide and at Yorke Peninsula. The most significant was in May 1841 {{when he was}} the original purchaser of the land grant for Section 2112, being 134 acres comprising all of modern Port Adelaide southward of St Vincent Street. Hill sold this at a loss in July 1843 when a financial crisis beset the colony, he having already returned to London in January 1843 aboard the barque Sarah and Elizabeth. He had also lost money in other <b>land</b> <b>speculations.</b>|$|R
5|$|Frustrated {{with the}} legal hassles that went with <b>land</b> <b>speculation,</b> in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he {{operated}} a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, {{he was elected to}} the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.|$|E
5|$|Hinde was {{involved}} with the newspaper for less than two years. He converted from Deism to Methodism and decided that operating a political journal conflicted with his new religious views. After retiring from the newspaper business, he engaged in locating military lands and in <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b> For {{the rest of his}} life, Hinde published editorials in newspapers and religious publications. He organized several camp meetings with other preachers, saying that the camp meeting could unite the different Protestant denominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Mexican government passed {{new laws}} allowing land sale in Texas, and Bowie returned to <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b> He was appointed a land commissioner and tasked with promoting {{settlement in the}} area purchased by John T. Mason. His appointment ended in May 1835 when President Antonio López de Santa Anna abolished the Coahuila y Tejas government and ordered the arrest of all Texans (including Bowie) doing business in Monclova. Bowie was forced to flee Monclova {{and return to the}} Anglo areas of Texas.|$|E
6000|$|Many {{have thought}} this dream {{was a mere}} {{invention}} of Oloffe Van Kortlandt, who, it is said, had ever regarded Communipaw with an evil eye, because he had arrived there after all the land had been shared out, and who was anxious to change the seat of empire to some new place, where he might be present at the distribution of [...] "town lots." [...] But we must not give heed to such insinuations, which are too apt to be advanced against those worthy gentlemen engaged in laying out towns and in other <b>land</b> <b>speculations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States, he assumed the surname of [...] "Edwards" [...] and returned to New York to resume his law practice. He remarried Eliza Jumel, the wealthy socialite widow of Stephen Jumel, but she left him after four months due to his <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> reducing her finances. Historians attribute his self-imposed exile and using a different surname in part to escape from his creditors, as he was deeply in debt. Burr died on September 14, 1836, {{the same day that}} his divorce from his wife was granted.|$|R
50|$|The Dinsmore family, {{who lived}} in the {{historic}} home from 1842 through 1926, were associated with many historical events and trends that help to inform an understanding of local, regional, national, and global history. Some of the interesting events members of the family were involved in and wrote about include: relations between the U. S. Government and the Cherokee and Choctaw, early Republic <b>land</b> <b>speculations,</b> (for example, Macomb's Purchase), the Texas Revolution of 1836, Early Republic politics, the Adams Express Company, the American Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the sinking of the Titanic, the sinking of the Lusitania, and World War I.|$|R
5|$|Tucker {{was asked}} for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, {{borrowing}} the remainder {{from members of}} the academy board. He also acted as custodian of other funds, blended them with his own and spent it on overindulgence and <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b> Later he was required to defend himself in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly. Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not <b>land</b> <b>speculation,</b> but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full term in Congress, Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison, accusing him of using his office for {{personal}} gain, of taking part in questionable <b>land</b> <b>speculation</b> deals, and needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier. Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison's authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians. When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810, Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment. Harrison's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.|$|E
50|$|John Torrance was a {{stockholder}} in {{the short-lived}} Bank of Canada in Montreal {{and became a}} director of the Bank of Montreal from 1826 to 1857, {{after the death of his}} brother, Thomas.In the 1840s, he was {{a director of the}} Montreal Provident and Savings Bank and at one time had £2,000 invested in the City Bank of New York. In the 1850s, he was elected a director of the Montreal Fire, Life & Inland Navigation Assurance Company and of the Equitable Fire Insurance Company of London, England. He had been a founder of the Committee of Trade in 1822 and invested in a variety of <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> and mortgages.|$|R
60|$|Stanley {{raised his}} level eyebrows. It was a stumper. Without great care {{he felt that}} he would be getting over the border into the uncharted <b>land</b> of <b>speculation</b> and philosophy, {{wandering}} on paths that led him nowhere.|$|R
5000|$|Sadat {{used his}} immense {{popularity}} with the Egyptian people {{to try to}} push through vast economic reforms that ended the socialistic controls of Nasserism. Sadat introduced greater political freedom and a new economic policy, {{the most important aspect}} of which was the infitah or [...] "openness". This relaxed government controls over the economy and encouraged private investment. While the reforms created a wealthy and successful upper class and a small middle class, these reforms had little effect upon the average Egyptian who began to grow dissatisfied with Sadat's rule. In 1977, Infitah policies led to massive spontaneous riots ('Bread Riots') involving hundreds of thousands of Egyptians when the state announced that it was retiring subsidies on basic foodstuffs. Infitah has been criticized as bringing [...] "wild rents, <b>land</b> <b>speculations,</b> inflation, and corruption." ...|$|R
5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{continued}} {{to work as a}} surveyor in the 1840s while also engaging in <b>land</b> <b>speculation.</b> By 1850, he was promoted to district surveyor; he had, by then, acquired 10,000 acres of land in Navarro and Johnson counties. He devoted some of the land to farming, but also donated some lots to Johnson County for the erection of the county seat, in Cleburne. He became a lawyer in 1860, but never developed a sizable law practice. Chambers married three times: first in 1852 to Susan Wood, who died the next year; secondly in 1854 to Emma Montgomery, who died in childbirth the next year; and finally in 1861 to Harriet Killough. Chambers had no children who survived infancy with the first two wives, but with his third wife he would have three children: Mary, Patrick, and Isabella.|$|E
5|$|David {{was born}} Elizabeth Gwynne, {{the second of}} four children, all {{daughter}}s, of Rupert Sackville Gwynne and his wife, the Hon. Stella Gwynne, daughter of the 1st Viscount Ridley. Both parents' families had considerable fortunes, the Gwynnes from engineering and <b>land</b> <b>speculation</b> and the Ridleys from coal mining. Through the two families, David was of English, Scottish and Welsh or Irish descent and, through an ancestor on her father's side, also Dutch and Sumatran. She and her sisters grew up in Wootton Manor in Sussex, a seventeenth-century manor house with extensive modern additions by Detmar Blow. Her father, despite having a weak heart, insisted on pursuing a demanding political career, becoming Conservative MP for Eastbourne, and a junior minister in Bonar Law's government. Overwork, combined with his vigorous recreational pastimes, chiefly racing, riding, and womanising, brought about his death in 1924, aged 51.|$|E
6000|$|Most {{of the men}} {{who came}} to the flat, whether they were army {{officers}} or radicals who hated the army, had the easy gentleness, the acceptance of women without embarrassed banter, for which she had longed in Gopher Prairie. Yet they seemed to be as efficient as the Sam Clarks. She concluded that it was because they were of secure reputation, not hemmed in by the fire of provincial jealousies. Kennicott had asserted that the villager's lack of courtesy is due to his poverty. [...] "We're no millionaire dudes," [...] he boasted. Yet these army and navy men, these bureau experts, and organizers of multitudinous leagues, were cheerful on three or four thousand a year, while Kennicott had, outside of his <b>land</b> <b>speculations,</b> six thousand or more, and Sam had eight.|$|R
2500|$|When Queensland {{separated}} from New South Wales in 1859, Jewish {{people began to}} settle in Brisbane, forming the Brisbane Hebrew Congregation in 1865. The congregation used a number of venues as temporary places of worship, including a building in the grounds of Samuel Davis's home at North Quay (the house later known as Aubigny), while raising money through various <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> to purchase a site and build a synagogue. They purchased land in Margaret Street for £200 and in 1885 called for designs, choosing the plans of Arthur Morry, an architect {{who worked for the}} Queensland Colonial Architect. Arthur Midson, a prominent Brisbane building contractor, built the Synagogue for the sum of £6450. The Brisbane Synagogue was consecrated on 18 July 1886, its spiritual name being [...] "Kehilla Kedosha Sha'ari Emuna" [...] (The Holy Congregation of the Gates of Faith).|$|R
50|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th Century, <b>land</b> <b>speculations</b> and a general {{building}} boom marked the beginning of Minya's dramatic 20th-Century expansion. In the beginning of the century, the establishment of the railway to join Cairo began. Later, the city extended east and west on the railway sides, which penetrated the current city. By that time, Great Britain established a consulate in Minya mainly to promote cotton trade. In 1907, the Ottoman Bank opened a branch in the city in recognition of its increasing economic importance. Utilities, serving mainly the new developments, were introduced under long-term franchises granted to foreign enterprises: a courthouse in 1927, the fire department in 1931, the city council and the administration building in 1937. The wide paved streets of the modern city diverted commercial activity away from the old city, hastening its deterioration.|$|R
