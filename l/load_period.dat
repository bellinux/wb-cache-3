Thus hydro power stations are ending up to cater base load instead of peak load in non-monsoon months also (ex: Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, HP, J&K, Uttarakhand, etc.). TSO is responsible to ensure the provision of reserves (including spinning reserve for base load power plants by operating in frequency follow mode with upper & lower generation caps) that will allow for sudden contingencies by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each grid trading period.

However, Taiwan has not finished the relevant legislative procedure so far, the power market is still engaged in without competition by Taiwan Power Company, so rate is stipulated and still needed to be checked and ratified by the government. In design of rate, in order to implement the load management strategy, the Taipower adopts the time-of-use rate to reduce the growth of peak load. For lack of base-load generation units, a certain portion of the system demand is supplied by LNG-fired and oil-fired units.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the survival and success rates of Korean Osstem implants US II Plus, GS II following <b>loading</b> <b>period.</b> Materials and Methods: Dental records were obtained in total 201 patients who were treated with Korean Osstem implants US II Plus, GS II on both maxillary and mandibular anterior and posterior areas in six different clinics for 2 years from January 2007 to December 2008. Total 430 implants were evaluated clinically and radiographically using predefined success criteria prospectively and following results were obtained. Result: US II Plus, GS II implants showed high survival rates of more than 99 % and high success rates more than 90 % independent of <b>loading</b> <b>period.</b> As a result of cross analysis to evaluate clinical significance between implant <b>loading</b> <b>period</b> and success rate, the P-value of US II Plus was 0. 10 (P> 0. 05), and the P-value of GS II was 0. 17 (P> 0. 05), which showed no statistical significance.

Ergon Energy has identified voltage regulation as one of the key issues being faced in this area, as loads continue to grow in rural distribution networks. These voltage regulation issues cause capacity limitations on the SWER feeders. Voltage drop during peak <b>load</b> <b>periods</b> is one issue, but high voltages during low <b>load</b> <b>periods</b> caused by the Ferranti effect is another key factor on long SWER feeders. Currently, Ergon uses fixed shunt reactors to control line overvoltages during low <b>load</b> <b>periods,</b> but these reactors add to the line load during peak load conditions. At AUPEC 2005, Central Queensland University presented a thyristor controlled reactor option as a potential solution to this problem. This paper follows on from that and presents two lower technology solutions, namely switched reactors and saturable reactors. Both options aim to reduce the steady state voltage range between peak load and low load, thus freeing up additional capacity on the SWER feeder for growing load. This paper presents the development of both options and comments on the suitability of the options to perform to the required specifications. PSCAD/EMTDC is used to model the problem...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExisting {{low-power}} MAC protocols {{only provide}} low throughput {{because of the}} fixed low duty-cycle. This often leads to poor performance when dealing with time- constrained burst traffic. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid CSMA/TDMA MAC protocol, called Queue- MAC, that dynamically adapts the duty-cycle according to the current network traffic. The queue length of nodes is used as the network traffic indicator. When the traffic increases, the active CSMA period is accordingly extended by adding dynamic TDMA slots, allowing thus to efficiently handle burst traffic under real-time constraints. This protocol is implemented on the STM 32 W 108 SOC chips and compared with both a fixed duty-cycle reference protocol and an optimized IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC protocol. Through extensive experimental measurements, we showed that our queue- length aware hybrid CSMA/TDMA MAC protocol largely outperforms the compared protocols. The proposed protocol can be easily implemented through slight adaptation of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard. It presents an optimal bandwidth and energy allocation scheme according to the traffic to be carried. In fact, low-duty cycle, so low power consumption is preserved during light traffic <b>load</b> <b>period,</b> while high throughput is obtained during heavy burst <b>load</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E
