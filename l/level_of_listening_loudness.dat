Next, contingent upon their anxiety result, they were ordered in to three groups namely: low anxious students, average anxious students, and high anxious students. Therefore, first, the minimum and the maximum anxiety outcome were distinguished. Since the FLLAS comprised of 33 items in the questionnaire and the score of per item ranged from 1 to 5 points, the potential mark of every student’s anxiety should go from 33 to 165 points; and lower scores show lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> anxiety while higher scores mean higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> anxiety. Then, {{the range of the}} minimum and the maximum anxiety result was computed (165 – 33 [*]=[*] 132). Then, the earned finding was classified in to three equipollent groups. Consequently, the first group who scored between the ranges 33 – 77 was considered as low anxious students. The second group (78 – 121) as average anxious students and the last group (above 122) was considered as high anxious students.|$|R

This study reports a series of four experiments which were designed and conducted to explore the expertise reversal effect in the field <b>of</b> foreign language <b>listening</b> teaching and learning. Three instructional formats (read-only, listen-only, and read-and-listen) were designed to teach native Chinese students English (Experiments 1 - 3) or French (Experiment 4) listening skills.

The results of Experiment 2 replicated the counterintuitive findings of Experiment 1. Experiment 3 testing less knowledgeable students than Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that the read-and-listen condition was more effective for novice learners. Experiment 4 testing beginner-level learners of French as a foreign language obtained results {{consistent with those of}} Experiment 3 in that lower expertise learners gained greater benefits from the read-and-listen than the read-only or listen-only teaching approaches.

40|$|Two closely interrelated {{techniques}} of phrase expansion occasionally used by eighteenth-century composers {{but so far}} not recognized by music theorists are twisted caesuras and overridden caesuras.

For the purpose of the topic, three groups of students consisting of eighty four were cluster randomly selected and were divided into two groups of twenty eight as the experimental and control class. Research method was quasi-experimental. The instruments were multiple choice test and questionnaire. Both groups were taught in the same style. Before the instruments were used, a tryout had been administered to know the validity and reliability of the instruments. Furthermore, it was found out that the data were in normal distribution and homogeneous based on the normality testing and homogeneity testing. The researcher analyzed the <b>listening</b> test scores <b>of</b> students who had high and low listening habit in both groups. Multifactor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were applied with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> significance α = 0. 05. The results of the test and the related comparisons, findings showed that: (1) podcast is more effective than movie to teach listening comprehension; (2) students having high listening habit have better listening comprehension than those having low listening habit; (2) there is interaction effect between teaching media and different listening habit on the students’ listening comprehension. To sum up, podcast is an effective media to teach listening to the eighth grade students of SMP Muhammadiyah 1 Way Jepara, in the academic year 2014 / 2015.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1970 s, {{listening}} {{has been recognized}} as an important skill in language learning due to its critical role in academic success, communication, comprehension of lectures, and it‘s positive influence ―on the development of other skills‖ and the overall language proficiency (Rizzi & Absalom, 2007; Dunkel, 1991 a; Long, 1985; Krashen, 1996; Rost, 2002, cited in Vandergrift, 2007 b, p. 191). Numerous {{studies have been conducted}} to help learners improve in this skill namely in the area <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> strategy research and problem identification (Murphy, 1985; Vandergrift, 1999; Ozeki, 2000; Goh, 2000; Cross, 2009). However, most of the strategy-related studies (Fujita, 1985; Bacon, 1992 a; Paulauskas, 1994; Seo, 2000; Kohler, 2002; Carrier, 2003; Goh and Taib, 2006; Chen, 2007; Zeng, 2007) are not based on any prior identification <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> problems. Additionally, those studies that focus on problem identification (Goh, 2000; Hasan, 2000; Liu, 2002) are followed by strategy recommendations that have not been tested. The present study has aimed to examine more closely the EFL learners‘ self-perceived listening comprehension problems and strategy use before and after the listening strategy instruction phase to determine the effectiveness of the strategy instruction and the potential correlation among the perception <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> problems, strategy use, and listening comprehension. A mixed method design was employed. Data from the experimental and correlational study were the main sources and semi-structured interview was conducted to support the quantitative data. The participants were 70 Iranian tertiary level first-year EFL learners who were split into a control group and an experimental group. The data were collected through a Listening Comprehension Test (LCT), two questionnaires: one on Listening Comprehension Problems (LCPQ) and another on Listening Strategy Use (LSUQ), and semi-structured interview. Pre-and-post tests were administered on both groups but only the experimental group was interviewed after the treatment. The duration of the study was 12 weeks. The experimental group received listening strategy training but the control group was trained by traditional procedure (presentation, practice and production). The quantitative study results were significant but with differing effect sizes: compared to the control group, the experimental group perceived gains for all three components LCT, LCPQ and LSUQ but the effect size was large for the perception <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> strategy use (LSUQ) and small for the perception <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension problems (LCPQ) and the results <b>of</b> the <b>listening</b> comprehension tests (LCT). The correlational results revealed that the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> strategy use do not necessarily lead to equally high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> success in <b>listening</b> comprehension or low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> problems. The qualitative results showed that after the treatment, the learners had problems in bottom-up processing listening skills and the strategies were only partly effective in solving these problems. Theoretically, the mixed method design of the study made explicit the quantitative and qualitative effect of strategy instruction on EFL learners‘ perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>listening</b> comprehension problems and strategy use; and pedagogically, the findings would be beneficial for those in the EFL context to be better informed in helping learners in using strategies more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Listening {{anxiety is}} said to have a direct effect on listeners’ {{abilities}} to comprehend what has been said. This is often because listeners are concerned that the message is so complex {{that they will not be}} able to understand what they are listening to. In relevance to listening tests, students’ listening anxiety may prove to be a variable that could affect their listening test scores especially for second language (L 2) learners. This preliminary study was carried out, as a part of a bigger experimental study to investigate if L 2 students experienced listening anxiety. The Foreign Language Learning Survey (FLLAS) (Kim, 2000) was used as the main data collection instrument. The survey comprised of 33 items, which was tested for reliability in this study (Cronbach Alpha α =. 928).

Given the enormous rise in mobile music consumption {{and the many}} sensors inte-grated into today’s smart-phones, at the same time, an unprecedented source for user context data of different kinds is becoming available. Equipped with a smart-phone application, which had been developed to monitor contextual aspects <b>of</b> users when <b>listening</b> to music, we collected contextual data <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> events for 48 users. About 100 different user features, in addition to music meta-data have been recorded. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between aspects of the user context and music listening preference. The goals are to assess (i) whether user context factors allow predicting the song, artist, mood, or genre <b>of</b> a <b>listened</b> track, and (ii) which contextual aspects are most promising for an accurate prediction. To this end, we investigate various classifiers to learn relations between user context aspects and music meta-data. We show that the user context allows to predict artist and genre to some extent, but can hardly be used for song or mood prediction. Our study further reveals that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> activity has little influence on the accuracy of predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether task-irrelevant novel sounds presented during an auditory task can {{provide information about}} the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> effort. METHODS: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for novel sounds presented during two Experiments, a frequency discrimination task and a speech-perception-in-noise (SPIN) test, each {{with varying degrees of}} task difficulty (easy, medium, hard). Difficulty was adjusted to the individual frequency discrimination threshold and 50 % speech recognition signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), respectively. Older listeners (age range 60 - 86 years) with either normal hearing for their age or a mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated. RESULTS: Amplitudes of Novelty P 3 and late positive potential (LPP) increased with increasing task difficulty, whereas amplitudes of N 1 and N 2 decreased. Participants with hearing loss had significantly larger LPP amplitudes in the easy condition of the SPIN test than did normal-hearing listeners. Most correlations between ERP amplitudes and behavioral data were not significant suggesting that listening effort is not a simple equivalent of behavioral performance. CONCLUSIONS: LPP amplitude appeared to be the most sensitive component for capturing listening effort reflecting the arousal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the listener. SIGNIFICANCE: ERPs to novel sounds could be easily recorded during hearing tests and provide an objective physiological measure <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> effort, thus supplementing behavioral performance data...|$|R

If this seems to be a contradiction, then it needs to be remembered, for example, that the 54 students researched in the paper on speaking were first-year students doing compulsory courses in English, and therefore they represent a relatively homogeneous sample, compared with the large range of ability to speak English across the whole Chinese education system. It is highly likely that a relatively large number <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> or sub-levels <b>of</b> language proficiency will be needed to cover this range.|$|R

Our results indicate that intrinsic motivation yielded the strongest impact on L 2 listening proficiency, and separately predicted greater self-regulated learning behavior, which in turn predicted lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> anxiety. L 2 listening strategy use was additionally associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> L 2 linguistic knowledge, but did not directly predict higher L 2 listening success. It was only through the mediation of L 2 linguistic knowledge that L 2 listening strategy use was linked to low L 2 listening anxiety and higher overall L 2 listening proficiency.

The test was designed to measure global comprehension at the intermediate <b>level,</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> and reading texts and general knowledge of vocabulary, grammar and structure as measured by a cloze text. The data were subsets <b>of</b> <b>listening,</b> reading and cloze items used on two or more occasions.

The estimates were obtained using three estimation methods (LOGIST, BILOG, NoHarm) and three IRT models. In addition the unidimensionality of the data sets was examined using a method described by Gessaroli and De Champlain (1991). The results suggest that IRT models may not be suitable with test data such as those used in this study. Failure could not be consistently linked to too few candidates, issues of statistical dimensionality, too few items, or the difficulty of the material in which the target subsets were embedded. If an expanded study yields similar results, then the issue is one of validity, whether the definition of ESL global comprehension at the intermediate level is compatible with how an ability is defined under an IRT model...|$|R

The articles with a broader definition of the problem and a broader problem solving, have a predominantly agonistic debate strategy. Even if the debate rhetoric is primarily designed to win over the opponents, there is partly a genuine listening and an interest in finding new possible solutions. But despite that the opponents’ arguments are mainly used to present the authors own arguments, the authors’ intentions seems to be predominantly honest. There is more than rheterology than rhetrickery in these articles. The articles with a more narrow definition of the problem, also has a narrower problem solving and a more antagonistic debate strategy. The rhetoric here also aims to win over the opponents. But although there is some listening even in these articles, the listening is not about bringing the issue under debate towards a new possible solution.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the nature of self-efficacy among 161 Thai {{undergraduate}} EFL students through the investigation <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> their self-efficacy {{and the relationship between}} their self-efficacy and their proficiency in listening comprehension. Learners’ attributions for success and failure, which might also influence their self-efficacy beliefs, were also explored. The second aim {{of the study was to}} examine whether a programme <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> strategy instruction could improve their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-efficacy, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> their <b>listening</b> comprehension, and their reported use <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> strategies. Finally, the study examined whether learners from different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> proficiency benefit from the strategy instruction in a similar manner. This research study is of a quasi-experimental, mixed method design, with one intervention group and one comparison group. Listening proficiency was measured by a free-recall listening task and a listening comprehension question task. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-efficacy and strategy use were elicited by a set of questionnaires. The manner of strategy use was also further investigated by using a stimulated-recall interview which required 14 participants to give a verbal account of how they had performed the previous listening tasks. These instruments were implemented at pre- and post-test data collection points before and after the intervention which lasted 12 weeks. The findings of the study indicate that, at pre-test, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-efficacy among the participants was rather low but correlation analyses suggest a moderate relationship between self-efficacy and listening comprehension levels. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in how much the intervention and comparison groups improved their self-efficacy levels from pre-test to post-test. However, the intervention group participants improved their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension significantly more than the comparison group participants on both the free-recall and the listening comprehension question task. This was true for both high and low proficiency learners. While a 2 × 2 ANOVA on the strategy questionnaire items did not indicate statistically significant changes in strategy use as a result of the intervention, a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis suggested that a greater number of the intervention group participants had positive behaviours at post-test than was the case at pre-test. The manner <b>of</b> the participants’ <b>listening</b> strategy use was further explored by looking at the frequency of strategies reported in the stimulated recall interview as well as the way in which strategy combinations were employed. At post-test, the intervention group reported a much higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hypothesis formation, hypothesis monitoring and hypothesis formation than at pre-test, which was not the case for the comparison group. Likewise, the intervention participants also reported greater use of word or chunk identification as well as being able to combine other strategies to compensate for gaps in their bottom-upskills. Thus, there was evidence that the intervention group had changed the way in which they employed listening strategies as a result of the intervention, while the comparison group showed much fewer changes. The study not only provides evidence of the potential benefits of strategy instruction for improving L 2 <b>listening</b> comprehension, regardless <b>of</b> learners’ proficiency <b>levels,</b> but also has methodological implications, as the strategy analyses demonstrated the value of exploring strategy use through a qualitative approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} {{the problem of}} {{organizing}} blended learning of the course “Practical phonetics of German language” by means of virtual learning environment Moodle is revealed. The author summarizes the best practices of native and foreign researchers {{on the issues of}} blended learning implementation and technology of designing distance courses in the virtual learning environment Moodle. It is noted that the specificity of exercises in the course of practical phonetics is in the fact that they should contain tasks for recording their own voice to assess the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> and pronunciation, rhythmic and intonation skills. The author describes his own experience in implementing the distance course in teaching the phonetics to students of the specialty “Primary Education”. The course offered by the author covers eight themes; each theme assumes the fulfillment of tasks in three blocks – theoretical, practical, and communicative. The article presents data of experimental verification of the implemented course that confirm its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 75 - 84) Background {{thoughts to}} the study are, one, that today???s lifestyle proliferates the spoken word, particularly in the college classroom where informative oral presentations predominate; and, two, that the complex physiological, psychological, and intellectual processes <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> are affected by many variables. The {{purpose of this study}} was to gain insight into the role <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> abilities in scholastic success at the college level. The scores on a listening comprehension test administered to a specific group of senior business students were used as evidence <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> abilities <b>of</b> business students at San Fernando Valley State College. The scholastic success of these students was evidenced by their grade-point averages. In addition, data were gathered from the test participants as to their personal and educational background. These data were then submitted to both descriptive and correlative statistical analyses. Attempts were made to control certain factors within the testing situation: environment for testing, presentation of the test, and motivation of the test participants. The results of the analyses indicate that while there is a positive relationship between listening abilities and scholastic success, that relationship is not necessarily significant. It was observed that the relationship between certain listening abilities (the comprehension of central ideas, inferences, and organization in lecture format) and scholastic success is much more positive and significant. Implied is the possibility that a test comprised of the lecture format only is a more reliable instrument for testing the <b>listening</b> abilities <b>of</b> college- <b>level</b> business students than is a test <b>of</b> specific <b>listening</b> skills. The high incidence of the lecture comprehension section score being the lowest of all section scores indicates a lack <b>of</b> critical <b>listening</b> abilities among business students. Areas for further study indicated by the findings of this study are the redesign <b>of</b> the <b>listening</b> comprehension test itself and the rates of retention of aurally presented material over varying spans of time...|$|R
40|$|Informe de Seminario para optar al grado de Licenciado en Lengua y Literatura InglesaThe {{present study}} {{attempted}} to establish relationships between second or foreign language learners’ metacognitive awareness and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension proficiency. Metacognition {{is defined as}} the awareness of the knowledge an individual has or does not have and to the ability to monitor and control cognitive activities in learning processes (Flavell, 1979; Maichenbaum, 1985). According to Vandergrift & Goh (2012), listening is the most commonly used, important, and active skill in oral communication; and yet, it is the skill which is least likely to be taught effectively and the most underresearched one. Vandergrift (2004, 2007) and Vandergrift and Goh (2012) proposed a Metacognitive Pedagogical Sequence that intends to improve students’ use of metacognitive strategies when performing listening comprehension tasks. The present research is a quantitative quasi-experimental study which intends to explore the effects of an implicit metacognitive listening strategy intervention on the students’ <b>listening</b> comprehension <b>level</b> <b>of</b> proficiency. In order to conduct this research, two groups were selected as the experimental and control groups. The participants were 12 second year students from the English Linguistics and Literature program offered at Universidad de Chile. On the one hand, an implicit metacognitive intervention based on the Pedagogical Sequence was designed for the experimental group and, on the other hand, the control group continued with their regular listening classes. The students in the experimental group attended six 45 -minute listening instruction sessions given by the teacher <b>of</b> the <b>Listening</b> subcomponent <b>of</b> the English Language II course. Two sample versions of the First Certificate in English (FCE) listening comprehension test were given in order to assess the students’ listening comprehension proficiency. The first version was used as a pre-test whereas the second version was used as a post-test. The questionnaire chosen to elicit the data about the students’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> metacognitive <b>listening</b> awareness was the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire designed by Vandergrift, Goh, Mareschal, & Tafaghodtari (2006). Concerning the results of the study, the general averages of the experimental group listening comprehension tests and of the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaires increased. In turn, the metacognitive instruction intervention was moderately successful. Therefore, it can be claimed that there was a slight improvement on the students’ listening performance and their metacognitive listening awareness...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{listening}} effort expended by {{adolescents and young}} adults using implants versus their peers with normal hearing when these two groups are achieving similar speech perception scores. The study also aimed to compare listening effort expended by {{adolescents and young adults}} with bilateral cochlear implants when using two implants versus one. METHODS: Eight participants with bilateral cochlear implants and eight with normal hearing aged 10 - 22 years were included. Using a dual-task paradigm, participants repeated consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) words presented in noise and performed a visual matching task. Signal-to-noise ratios were set individually to ensure the word perception task was challenging but manageable for all. Reduced performance on the visual task in the dual-task condition relative to the single-task condition was indicative of the effort expended on the listening task. RESULTS: The cochlear implant group, when using bilateral implants, expended similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> effort to the normal hearing group when the two groups were achieving similar speech perception scores. For three individuals with cochlear implants, and the group, listening effort was significantly reduced with bilateral compared to unilateral implants. DISCUSSION: The similar amount <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> effort expended by the two groups indicated that a higher signal-to-noise ratio overcame limitations in the auditory information received or processed by the participants with implants. This study is the first to objectively compare listening effort using two versus one cochlear implant. The results provide objective evidence that reduced listening effort is a benefit that some individuals gain from bilateral cochlear implants. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
