40|$|In {{this work}} {{properties}} of a vacuum phototriode (VPT) and preamplifier unit {{designed for the}} electromagnetic calorimeter of the PANDA experiment being built at FAIR are investigated. With the use of lead tungstate and <b>lanthanium</b> bromide scintillators the VPT properties are studied at low photon energies, from tens of key in the <b>lanthanium</b> bromide measurements and between 10 MeV and 60 MeV in the lead tungstate measurements. At these energies {{the noise of the}} VPT unit can be expected to influence its performance significantly. It is shown that the noise contribution to the measured energy resolution, under optimal conditions, is consistent with a fluctuation of (one standard deviation) approximately 200 electrons at the VPT anode. For a lead tungstate crystal this is equivalent to a noise of 1. 2 MeV. For <b>lanthanium</b> bromide this makes it possible to use VPTs for gamma ray spectroscopy above a few hundreds of keV without noticeable effects on the energy resolution compared to measurements with a standard photomultiplier.

40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of lanthanide (europium or <b>lanthanium)</b> bimetallic triple helicates {{from two}} closely related chiral ligands {{resulted in a}} very different supramolecular phenomenon.

The first X-ray crystal structure of a chiral ligand based lanthanide triple-helicate indicates that successive CH-pi interactions were found to maintain the supramolecular helical structure.

The rare earth metal used here is Lanthanum to produce Mg- 4 Al- 1. 5 La alloy. The microstructure was characterized by optical microscopy. The phases of this alloy were identified by X-ray diffraction. The microstructure of Mg- 4 Al consists of &# 945;-Mg and grain boundaries with precipitated phase particles. With the addition of Lanthanum, three distinct phases were identified in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as cast Mg- 4 Al- 1. 5 La: Mg, Al 11 La 3, Al 4 La.

40|$|A {{study of}} the fine {{structural}} localization of the acyltransferases of the monoglyceride and a-glycerophosphate pathways for triglyceride synthesis in the intestinal absorptive cell is reported. Glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue was found to synthesize diglyceride and triglyceride from monopalmitin and palmityl CoA, and parallel morphological studies showed the appearance of lipid droplets in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the absorptive cell. Glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue also synthesized triglyceride from a-glycerophosphate, although this enzyme system was more susceptible to fixadon than the monoglyceride pathway acyltransferases. Cytocliemical methods for the localization of free CoA were based (a) on {{the formation of the}} insoluble <b>lanthanium</b> mercaptide of CoA and (b) on the reduction of ferricyanide by CoA to yield ferrocyanide which forms an insoluble precipitate with manganous ions. By these methods the monoglyceride pathway acyltransferases were found to be located mainly on the inner surface of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} magnetocaloric {{effect in the}} <b>lanthanium</b> {{manganite}} La(0, 67) Ca(0, 22) Sr(0, 11) MnO(3) {{by means of the}} so-called 3 -omega detection technique. The aim is to determine whether the 3 -omega detection technique is suitable for measuring the magnetocaloric effect of certain magnetic materials. An experiment is conducted by subjecting the material to an oscillating magnetic field. The oscillating magnetic field is generated by applying a voltage to a solenoid. By means of Fourier transformation, the third harmonic is extracted from the output voltage. It is concluded that the magnetocaloric effect cannot be detected in the conducted experiment, due to fact that the resulting third harmonic is too small to be measurable. However, an improved experimental design might make it possible to enhance the signal to a measurable level. In this case, the 3 -omega detection technique has some advantages compared to the usual techniques used for measuring magnetocaloric effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of cadmium (Cd(2 +)) on adenine nucleotide concentration in a reaction mixture consisting of rat liver mitochondria and ADP was studied using high performance liquid chromatography. The results were as follows: An increase in AMP concentration was {{brought about by}} the addition of Cd(2 +). This increase in AMP concentration occurred in parallel with increase in Cd(2 +) concentration. The appearance of AMP was thought to be due to an ATPase reaction and an adenylate kinase reaction stimulated by Cd(2 +) although further studies on the adenylate kinase reaction stimulated by Cd(2 +) are needed. An increase in AMP may influence metabolism via glycolysis. As <b>lanthanium</b> (La(3 +)) is related to Ca(2 +) -binding sites, the effect of La(3 +) on the K(+) -release of rat liver mitochondria induced by Cd(2 +) was also studied.

Electron paramagnetic resonance of SrLaAlO 4 : 1 % Er 3 + identifies two distinct Er 3 + ion centers in this material: a tetragonal (C- 4 v) symmetry center with spin Hamiltonian parameters of g parallel to = 2. 7 +/- 0. 05 and g perpendicular to = 8. 5 +/- 0. 05 and a minor center of orthorhombic symmetry having g(x) = 9. 4 +/- 0. 05, g(y) = 6. 8 +/- 0. 05, and g(z) = 2. 3 +/- 0. 05. From a combination of optical absorption and polarized laser selective excitation, a total of 40 energy levels and their irreducible representation symmetry labels have been determined for the C- 4 u symmetry center, while 22 energy levels have been determined for a minor center.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} production of 1, 4 -cis-polybutadiene is currently {{carried out by}} solution polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalysts. In order to reduce significantly the costs for the sterospecific butadiene polyermization and, at the same time, to enhance the environmental protection, the gas-phase technology would be desired. For the introduction of such a technology, {{it is necessary to}} develop highly active and selective supported organometallic catalysts. Various methods were investigated to fix new allyl complexes of neodymium and <b>lanthanium</b> to metal oxide supports. The heterogenization of methylalumoxane (MAO) -activated allyl lanthanoid complexes on MAO-functionalized SiO_ 2 of optimum texture led to supported catalysts which catalyze the 1, 4 -cis-polymerization of butadiene with a high activity of 50, 000 mol C_ 4 H_ 6 /(mol Nd x h) and selectivity of 97 % in solution and in gas phase with simultaneous fragmentation. The kinetics of butadiene polyermization with these supported catalysts in heptane yields a first-order dependence of the overall rate of polyermization on the monomer and neodymium complex without deactivation of active centres.

40|$|International audienceGuided optics spectrometers can be {{essentially}} {{classified into}} two main families: based on Fourier transform or dispersion. In the first case, an interferogram generated inside an optical waveguide and containing the spectral information is sampled using spatially distributed nanodetectors. These scatter quasi-non-perturbingly {{light into the}} detector that is {{in contact with the}} waveguide, helping to reconstruct the stationary wave. A dedicated FFT processing is needed in order to recover the spectrum with high resolution but limited spectral range. Another way is to directly disperse the different wavelengths to different pixels, either introducing differential optical path in the same propagation plane (multiple Mach-Zehnder interferometers or Arrayed Waveguides Gratings), or using a periodic structure to perpendicularly extract the optical signal confined in a waveguide (photonic crystals or surface gratings), and by means of a relay optics, generate the spectrum on the Fourier plane of the lens, where the detector is placed. Following this second approach, we present a laser-fabricated high-resolution compact dispersive spectro-interferometer (R> 2500, 30 nm spectral range at lambda = 1560 nm), using four parallel waveguides that can provide up to three nonredundant interferometric combinations.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{describes}} {{the development of a new}} high resolution x-ray single crystal diffractometer (RED) and its multiple applications. It is shown that the application of the presently available technologies allows very flexible and even completely new possibilities of structural investigations of single crystals with x-rays in laboratories. The quick exchange between different beam optics allows flexible and efficient scientific work. Available are standard optics for Bragg data collection (Cu-K_alpha- and Mo-K_alpha radiation), an additional secondary monochromator unit for pure elastic scattering experiments and a Ge-fourfold monochromator for high resolution measurements using pure Cu-K_alpha_ 1 radiation. The standard optics allow in combination with the large dynamical ranges (max. 500. 000 cps linear) of the available detectors detailed investigations of structures with extreme differences between integrated intensities. Furthermore, detailed temperature dependent measurements can be performed down to 20 K by using an additional closed-cycle cryostat, e. g. for structural investigations at phase transitions. The Ge-fourfold monochromator yields high resolutions comparable to those of similar instruments at synchrotron sources (e. g. Si-(111) reflection with a halfwidth of < 0. 0030 Â°, Rocking scan). This allows a very precise analysis of reflection profiles for characterization of sample quality and the observation of smallest structural distortions. On principle the available radiation intensity of the RED is significantly smaller than that of a synchrotron. Nevertheless measurements of several samples show that the flexibility of the RED yields scientific possibilities for structural investigations at the home laboratory which are normaly available only at synchrotron facilities. The second part of this work describes structural investigations with neutron diffraction of strontium doped <b>lanthanium</b> cuprate La(2 -x) Sr(x) CuO 4 (LSCO), a high-temperature-superconductor (HTSC). LSCO is a layered perovskite which undergoes a structural transition from a high-temperature tetragonal phase (HTT) to a low temperature orthorhombic phase (LTO) up to x= 0. 21. In the LTO-phase the CuO 6 octahedrons are tilted in an ordered and well defined manner against the CuO 4 -planes. Up to now, the question of the possible coupling between superconductivity and lattice structure of the HTSC could not be finally answered. As a result of this experts are highly interested in the recent conclusions of different working groups using local methods on LSCO with x= 0. 15 (max. Tc= 38 K). They deviate from their results partially strong deviations of the local structure from the mean structure. Diffraction with fast neutrons enables the accurate distinction of the mean square displacements (msd) of the atoms. This allows clear statements about the upper limits of the local deviations from the mean structure, which gives the opportunity to check the different postulated models. Therefore, a set of neutron diffraction experiments was performed during this thesis on LSCO samples (x= 0. 15) at different temperatures above and below their structural phase transitions. The results show an enlargement of the msd of the oxygens into the tilt directions of the CuO 6 -octahedrons which is independent from temperature. This yields small (< 2 Â°) variations around the temperature dependent average values and is compatible â€“ also quantitatively â€“ to harmonic lattice dynamical calculations which take a statical disorder caused by Sr-doping into account. Because of this, different postulated local deviations like an order-disorder transition or a large tilt (about 16 Â°) of a larger number of CuO 6 -octahendrons can be excluded. The results of this work limit the possible interpretations of the results from local structure investigations significally. Superconductivity itself has â€“ on a macroscopic scale â€“ no significant influence on the structure except of the freeze-in of the tilt angles. The investigation of the oxygen content shows a significant influence on the phase transition of the LSCO structure even for small variations. This emphasizes the importance of an accurate characterization of LSCO samples â€“ especially of their stochiometry â€“ to assure the comparability of results from different investigations and sources...|$|E
