40|$|The {{requirement}} for adaptable and re-configurable control systems for manufacturing has highlighted the inadequacies of traditional centralised control approaches, leading researchers {{to focus on}} decentralised approaches. The question of {{what is the most}} appropriate <b>control</b> <b>architecture</b> for a given system has led industrial and academic researchers to develop a spectrum of decentralised <b>control</b> <b>architectures</b> ranging from hierarchical to non-hierarchical structures. While current research has confirmed the potential of decentralised architectures, neither extreme of this <b>control</b> <b>architecture</b> spectrum has proven to be the most appropriate choice for a given manufacturing system.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a Service Specific <b>Control</b> <b>Architecture</b> (SSCA) in an ATM {{environment}} is presented. Here a <b>Control</b> <b>Architecture</b> denotes the out-of-band control and management mechanisms operational in a network or virtual network (or part thereof).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the control and management of ATM networks, by allowing different <b>control</b> <b>architectures</b> to be operational within the same network, and on the same switch. The resources available on an ATM switch are divided into switchlets, each of which encapsulates {{a subset of the}} physical ATM switch resources. A set of switchlets on different ATM switches combine to form a virtual ATM network. Each virtual network created in this way can potentially use different control and management mechanisms which are collectively called a <b>control</b> <b>architecture.</b> For example one virtual network might run ATM Forum signalling, another might implement an IP switching <b>control</b> <b>architecture,</b> while yet another can be reserved for an in house secure <b>control</b> <b>architecture.</b> In this manner a new <b>control</b> <b>architecture</b> can be introduced into a network without disrupting existing services and applications, thereby facilitating change management in an elegant way.
