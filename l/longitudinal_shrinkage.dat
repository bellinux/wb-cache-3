The tangential, radial and longitudinal anisotropy directions of timber correspond respectively to the thickness, width and length directions of the leaf. The shrinkage thicknesswise dominance over the others dimensional shrinkages {{is comparable to the}} dominance of the tangential shrinkage in wood over the radial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkages.</b> Furthermore, the shrinkage widthwise is generally either greater or close to the shrinkage lengthwise, which is quite similar to the shrinkage behavior in wood.

40|$|Tension wood xylem of {{arboreal}} eudicot species often produces unusual wood fiber, called {{gelatinous fiber}} (G-fiber). The G-fiber forms a gelatinous layer (G-layer) as the innermost {{layer of the}} multi-layered cell wall. The G-fiber generates a high tensile growth stress, which enables the hardwood species to perform the negative-gravitropic behaviors in its inclined shoot. However, the tension wood often causes various obstacles when we use the forest resources as the raw material for the timber products. Examples are the processing defects caused by its abnormal growth stress. Other examples are a high longitudinal Young's modulus and a high longitudinal drying shrinkage; their combined effect causes serious processing defects during the lumbering and drying process, e. g., distortion and cleavage of the sawn lumber, and so forth. Some researchers consider that characteristic properties of the G-fiber should {{be attributed to the}} intrinsic behaviors of the G-layer, while others emphasize the role of other lignified layer because the G-layer is often peeled off the lignified layer in the same direction during microtoming. Lately, Clair et al. revealed that detachment of the G-layer is an artifact that is caused by the stress concentration from the microtome blade, and they concluded that the G-layer is strongly attached to the lignified layer even in the oven-dried specimen. This positively supports the idea that the characteristic behaviors of the G-fiber originate from the property of the G-layer. However, the researchers still have no explanation for the generation mechanism of those G-layer properties. In our presentation, we focused our attentions on the moisture dependent changes of the longitudinal Young's modulus and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkages</b> in two Quercus acctissima containing the tension wood xylem. And, we revealed the astonishing difference of those properties between G-layer and the lignified wall (= normal wood cell wall).

This paper presents a way to model moisture-induced bow from <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> data predicted from an analysis of images of the surface of Norway spruce studs. For this study, eight studs (45 × 95 × 2500 [*]mm and 45 × 120 × 3000 [*]mm) of Norway spruce timber were selected. Bow in these studs was measured at two moisture contents below the fiber saturation point. The studs were then split into three slices 11 [*]mm thick, and the surfaces of these slices were scanned to obtain color information and images of the tracheid effect. The slices were cut into sticks with dimensions of 10 × 10 × 200 [*]mm. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> coefficient of these sticks was measured. A multivariate model was created to model the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> coefficient data from the information in the images. The predicted <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> data was used to model bow. The mean value of the measured <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was 0.0121 (SD 0.0123). The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for the multivariate model was 0.0079, which is regarded as good.

30|$|To {{discuss the}} role of the {{gelatinous}} layer (G-layer) on the origins of the physical properties peculiar to the tension wood fiber (TW fiber), the deformation process of an isolated TW fiber caused by a certain biomechanical state change was formulated mathematically. The mechanical model used in the present formulation is a four-layered hollow cylinder having the compound middle lamella (CML), the outer layer of the secondary wall (S 1) and its middle layer (S 2), and the G-layer (G) as an innermost layer. In the formulation, the reinforced matrix mechanism was applied to represent the mechanical interaction between the cellulose microfibril (CMF) as a framework bundle and the amorphous substance as a matrix skeleton in each layer. The model formulated in the present study is thought to be useful to investigate the origins of extensive <b>longitudinal</b> drying <b>shrinkage,</b> large tensile growth stress, and a high axial elastic modulus, which are rheological properties peculiar to the TW.

Tension and normal wood specimens were sampled from the leaning stems of a 75 - and a 40 -year-old Kunugi oak (Quercus acutissima) tree, and the moisture dependencies of the longitudinal Young's modulus and longitudinal dimensions were measured. The results, which were analyzed {{in relation to}} the anatomical properties of the specimens, revealed that the ratio of increase in the longitudinal Young's modulus with drying was higher in the G-layer than in the lignified layer (L-layer); the <b>longitudinal</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> displayed a similar pattern. It was found that the lattice distance of the [200] plane in the cellulose crystallite increased with drying, moreover, the half-width of the [200] diffraction peak increased with drying, which was remarkable in the tension wood. Those results suggest that in the green state, the polysaccharide matrix in the G-layer behaves like a water-swollen gel; however, it is transformed into a condensed and hard-packed structure by strong surface tension during moisture desorption, which is a form of xero-gelation.

40|$|International audienceWood {{behaviour}} {{is characterized}} by a high sensibility to humidity, swelling when humidity increases and shrinkage during drying. From green condition to ovendry condition, shrinkage ranges from 0. 05 % to 0. 3 % along the grain direction, however, two cases exist where <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> starts to be more important: in reaction wood (tension wood of hardwoods and compression wood of conifers) and juvenile wood. In these two types of wood, axial shrinkage can reach 1 % or more. These changes in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> {{can be explained by the}} wood fibre structure. The knowledge of the wood cell structure, as a multi-layer fibre composite, allows the modelling of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> considering that the cell wall is reduced to S 2 layer. These models give a good understanding of macroscopic axial shrinkage for different values of microfibril angle, for normal, compression and juvenile wood. However, they cannot explain the behaviour of tension wood. Tension wood cell wall is characterised by a very low microfibrils angle. In some species, important changes occur and part of the secondary wall is replaced by a distinct layer. This layer is described as purely or highly cellulosic, highly crystalline and with microfibril angle very low or nil. However, although a very low microfibril angle in G-layer, macroscopic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is high in tension wood. Some years ago, we shown the experimental evidence of the G-layer shrinkage, thinks to the new observation techniques such as Atomic Force Microscopy but we were enable to explain it. Recent observations of some cutting arfefact in G-layer evidenced the weakly bonding of microfibrils in G-layer transversally to the fibre axis. Latter X-ray diffraction experiments proved that cellulose microfibrils d-spacing is very lightly shortened during axial shrinkage compare to macroscopic one. These observations conclude that cellulose was subject to buckling during G-layer shrinkage and cannot be the driving force of G-layer <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The origin of G-layer shrinkage is then still in question. In this study, we concentrate on the characterisation of the non-cellulosique component of the G-layer, its organisation and its behaviour during drying...|$|E

The medium-sized poly-EGs at 30 % weight/ weight concentration absorbed almost all the evaporable water from the fibre.

40|$|Improved {{understanding}} of moisture and mechanical behaviour {{is an international}} objective for wood drying research. The main objective of this licentiate thesis work was to develop an experimental method suitable for collecting valuable response data related to the moisture and mechanical behaviour of drying wood. Another objective was to provide an example on how multivariate methods {{can be used to}} analyse response data. A method for simultaneous non contact measuring of two dimensional surface deformations and interior densities have been developed. This was done using Digital Speckle Photography, DSP, and X-ray Computerised Tomography (CT). Displacements and densities were used for calculation of strains and moisture contents using a custom software developed in Matlab. Experimental tests of the measuring method were made on cross sections of Scots pine. The following accuracy was stated for different properties: - Displacements measured with DSP could be measured with a random error down to 0. 01 pixels. A more typical calculated displacement error of approximately 10 micrometres, was found in paper I. - Strains derived from the displacements had a maximal error of 1. 11 mstrain in an experimental test in paper II. - Accuracy in density measurements was expected to be less than +- 6 kg/m 3 for wet wood with moisture contents ranging from 6 - 100 % and less than +- 2 kg/m 3 in dry wood, at a significance level of 0. 05. This was estimated for a 2 x 2 x 1. 5 mm 3 measuring volume. - Moisture content measuring accuracy was estimated by simulations in paper II, which resulted in a measuring accuracy of +- 1. 8 % moisture content at a significance level of 0. 05 in a measuring volume with the approximate size of 2 x 2 x 1. 5 mm 3. A multivariate analysing method has been used to present an example on multivariate modelling of shrinkage behaviour in Radiata pine. The method was found to be an easy-to-use tool and useful for valid prediction of radial, tangential, <b>longitudinal</b> and volume <b>shrinkage</b> in the moisture range between 0 % and 22 % moisture content of the studied wood. The method also proved to be effective for untangling relationships between variables and generating information out of data. Finally, it can be stated that the developed measuring technique and the tested multivariate analysing method will be of use to improve the {{understanding of}} the behaviour of drying wood, focusing on moisture and mechanical properties.

40|$|Timber is {{a natural}} {{material}} that is environmentally friendly, renewable, light, strong and, {{in the eyes of}} most people, beautiful. Timber does, however, have one important drawback when it is used in a modern mechanised building process - its lack of straightness. This {{is one of the main}} reasons for the building industry to choose materials other than timber. The main objective of this work was to identify the cause of moisture-induced distortion and create statistical and analytical models to predict distortion on the basis of material parameters. The work also gives recommendations on the parameters that should be focused on in order to develop methods to remove material prone to distortion. Studies were conducted in which the distortion in a large number of studs was measured at several moisture content levels. The changes in moisture content were made without outer restraints in order to study the effect of the material without the effect of restraints. Several material parameters were also measured on the studs; spiral grain angle, annual ring curvature, juvenile wood, knots, annual ring width, compression wood, cracks, wane, density, shrinkage and skew sawing. Spiral grain angle and annual ring curvature together explain about 65 % of the variation in twist. An analytical model for twist created by Stevens and Johnston (1960) was used. The same level of coefficient of determination was found as that produced by the statistical method. This model was based on annual ring curvature, spiral grain angle and tangential shrinkage strain. None of the measured parameters was able to explain bow and spring statistically. Detailed studies to determine how the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage</b> varies within a stud were conducted. A simple model was developed to calculate bow and spring on the basis of the variation in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> This model shows that the most of the bow and spring caused by changes in moisture content can be explained by the variation in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The most important parameters which can be used to remove timber prone to distortion are, in the case of twist, annual ring curvature and spiral grain angle and, in the case of bow and spring, the variation in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shrinkage...</b>|$|E
