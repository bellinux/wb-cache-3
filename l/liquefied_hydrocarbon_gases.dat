We report a 20 years old woman who was found in a coma with extensor muscle hypertonia, brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar (Babinski) responses after being exposed to propane gas. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions in both hippocampi and white matter in the oval center. The patient had a normal oxygen saturation of 98 %, a carboxyhemoglobin of 1. 6 % and a metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7. 01 with an anion gap of 16 mEq/l. This pattern suggested that it was a consequence of the intermediary metabolism of isopropanol. The recovery of the patient was slow and four months later she still had lesions on MRI and limitations in her cognitive sphere, memory and executive functions. Thus, liquefied gas exposure can cause a toxic encephalopathy with a persistent damage of the central nervous system...|$|R

Conventional cans and filling technology There is only a feasible energy source which is inert gas (i. e. compressed air) to replace VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) and greenhouse gases, which must be avoided, to improve atomisation by generating gas bubbles and turbulence inside the atomiser insert and the actuator. This research concentrates on using "bubbly flow" in the valve stem, with injection of compressed gas into the passing flow, thus also generating turbulence. The new valve designed in this investigation using inert gases has advantageous over conventional valve with butane propellant using high viscous product (> 400 Cp) because, when the valving arrangement is fully open, there are negligible energy losses as fluid passes through the valve from the interior of the container to the actuator insert. The use of valving arrangement thus permits all pressure drops to be controlled, resulting in improved control of atomising efficiency and flow rate, whereas in conventional valves a significant pressure drops occurs through the valve which has a complex effect on the corresponding spray...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of the viscosity and phase behavior of pure <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures is essential for reliable reservoir characterization and simulation and, hence, for optimum usage and exploitation. The variety of possible <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures at different conditions of interest preclude obtaining the relevant data by experimental means alone; thus, the development of prediction methods is required. Many pure <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> viscosity correlations are available. However, a wide-ranging and accurate viscosity correlation of gas mixtures associated with heavier hydrocarbon components and impurity components, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen sulphide, is not available.

The temperature distribution of the spherical tank and the environment after spherical tank pipeline leaking was analyzed. The influences of leakage location and leak area on the spherical tank temperature distribution were analyzed, and a meaningful conclusion was obtained.

Three sites were drilled at the Cape Fear Diapir of the Carolina Rise, and one site was drilled on the Blake Ridge Diapir. Methane concentrations at these sites result from microbial generation which {{is influenced by}} the amount of pore-water sulfate and possible methane oxidation. Methane hydrate was found at the Blake Ridge Diapir site. The other <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> at these sites are likely the product of early microbial processes. Three sites were drilled on a transect of holes across the crest of the Blake Ridge. The base of the zone of gas-hydrate occurrence was penetrated at all three sites.

Prediction of the density and viscosity values for <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> is necessary in several <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> engineering calculations such as the calculation of gas reserves, gas metering, gas compression, estimating the pressure gradient in gas wells and {{for the design of}} pipeline and surface facilities. Literature correlations for the density and viscosity of pure <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> such as methane, ethane, propane, butane and isobutene are available. However, wide-ranging and accurate correlations for predicting the gas viscosity and density are not available for gas mixtures associated with heavier hydrocarbon components and impurities components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium and hydrogen sulphide. This paper presents two new models for estimating the density and viscosity of pure <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures containing high amounts of pentane, plus small concentrations of non-hydrocarbon components (i. e. carbon dioxide, nitrogen and helium), over a wide range of temperatures and pressures on the basis of fuzzy logic approach.

However, the viscosity model was developed using density, apparent molecular weight and pseudo-reduced temperature. The fuzzy models were derived from 5, 350 measurements of density and viscosity of various pure gases and gas mixtures. The partitioning of the input space into the fuzzy regions, represented by the individual rules, was obtained through fuzzy clustering. Accuracy of the new fuzzy models was compared to various literature correlations by blind tests using 1, 460 measurements of density and viscosity.

In VAPEX, a pair of horizontal injector-producer wells is employed. The gaseous hydrocarbon solvent (normally propane or a mixture of methane–propane or propane–butane) is injected from the top well and the diluted oil drains downward by gravity to the bottom producer. Recently, the idea of incorporation of CO 2 into the gaseous hydrocarbon mixture has emerged. Incorporation of CO 2 is believed to make the process more economical and environmentally and technically attractive. CO 2 is cheaper than the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> and has higher solubility into the heavy oil {{than most of the}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases.</b> It also adds value to the environmental side of the process as CO 2 can be sequestered while improving the VAPEX performance at the same time.
