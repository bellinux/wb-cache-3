5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} the misery into which I had fallen, {{and much more}} at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past <b>life,</b> <b>not</b> without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid {{in the last years of}} Wilfrid's <b>life,</b> <b>not</b> a close companion.|$|E

5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in <b>life,</b> <b>not</b> the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E
25|$|To {{point out}} 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given {{the variety of}} schools, the {{extended}} history of 1500 years, and the emphasis on suchness, reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily <b>life,</b> <b>not</b> in words. But common to most schools and teachings is this emphasis on suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.|$|E
25|$|In the East, a contemplative <b>life</b> <b>not</b> {{centered}} {{on the idea of}} deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of Jainism, Buddhism, and certain sects of Hinduism in India, and of Taoism in China. Within the astika ("orthodox") schools of Hindu philosophy, the Samkhya and the early Mimamsa school did not accept a creator-deity in their respective systems.|$|E

25|$|Galán {{was largely}} {{influenced}} by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's ideas and Nikos Kazantzakis's books.

25|$|Parlichev {{always had}} a great respect towards the Greek culture, history, and literature, and in the time {{before and during the}} writing of the poem he was a passionate philhellene, {{identifying}} as Greek rather than Slavic Bulgarian, as he did before and after this period of his <b>life.</b> <b>Not</b> only because of the great impression that the Kingdom of Greece left on him he decided to write in Greek, but also because of the Homeric style that he chose to compose his poem.|$|E

25|$|Another {{difference}} is {{between those who}} believe the New Covenant has already substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning {{a member of the}} New Covenant no longer has to be taught anything at all regarding the Christian <b>life</b> (<b>not</b> just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).|$|E

25|$|One {{problem is}} how to {{integrate}} the doctrine of anatta {{with the idea of}} karma and rebirth. The anatta-doctrine stipulates that there is no underlying self, while the idea of karma and rebirth seems to implicate an underlying essence that's being reborn. A solution to this problem was the proposition of the existence of karmic seeds. The karmic effects of the human deeds lie dormant, as seeds, until they germinate in this or a next <b>life.</b> <b>Not</b> an individual self, but these karmic seeds are the base for the generation of a following life.|$|E

The enactment of the Act was criticised by various pro-life groups and the Roman Catholic bishops, but supported by a majority of the electorate in polls, with many indicating they wished to see a more liberal law on abortion.|$|E
25|$|HK has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in firearms, {{such as the use of}} polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns.

In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and gas operation (via Short-stroke piston).|$|E

25|$|The {{area around}} the Blue Mounds, Dane County, was first settled in 1828 by Ebenezer Brigham, a {{successful}} lead miner from Massachusetts. He had traveled to Wisconsin {{to join in the}} lead rush of the late 1820s. After arriving, he set up operations just north of where the cave lies today. Ebenezer's house later became a trading post, an inn, a stagecoach stop, and the first post office in Dane County. Ebenezer Brigham later became a colonel and helped build and command Fort Blue Mounds during the Blackhawk War.

25|$|The early {{reports are}} {{considered}} of great historical value by {{the academic community}} in China and are currently {{in the care of}} the Chinese Literature Society. Most of Xiao's featured reports were based on first hand experience from the front line. He selected scenes that he believed would reflect society at that time. He also used contour line drawings to vividly depict events, display emotions, and illustrate the story for the reader.

25|$|An {{alternative}} perspective {{focuses on}} the role of the welfare state as an institution that improves quality of <b>life</b> <b>not</b> only by increasing the extent to which basic human needs are met, but also by promoting greater control of one's life by limiting the degree to which individuals find themselves at the mercy of impersonal market forces that are indifferent to the fate of individuals. This is the argument suggested by the U.S. political scientist Benjamin Radcliff, who has presented a series of papers in peer reviewed scholarly journals demonstrating that a more generous welfare state contributes to higher levels of life satisfaction, and does so to rich and poor alike.|$|E
