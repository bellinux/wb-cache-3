25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever <b>love</b> <b>us</b> back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

500|$|The falsification {{principle}} {{has been}} developed as an alternative theory by which {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement [...] "God loves us" [...] both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not <b>love</b> <b>us.</b> Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and {{you know what that}} means to us—that they <b>love</b> <b>us.</b> It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We hate being trendy and we never try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People can <b>love</b> <b>us</b> or hate us, I don't care." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 24. When {{we suffer}} {{something}} unpleasant from our best friend, {{we know that}} he did not do it intentionally and that he <b>loves</b> <b>us.</b> We must think likewise of God, Who created us, for our sake incarnated, and died for our sake having endured enormous suffering. We must remind ourselves that He does everything from His goodness and from His <b>love</b> for <b>us.</b> We may think that while our friend <b>loves</b> <b>us,</b> in not having sufficient good sense in order to do everything correctly, he therefore involuntarily hurt us. This cannot be said of God because He is the highest wisdom. He knows what is good for us and accordingly, directs everything for our benefit, even in the smallest things. It can also be said that although our friend <b>loves</b> <b>us</b> and is sufficiently sensible, he is powerless to help us. But this certainly cannot be said of God, because to Him everything is possible and nothing is difficult for Him. Consequently, we know that God <b>loves</b> <b>us</b> and shows clemency toward us, that He is eternally wise and omnipotent. Everything that He does, He does for our benefit, and we should accept it with gratitude as from a Benefactor, even though it may appear to be grievous.|$|R

2500|$|The {{music video}} was shot with Anthony Mandler, {{director}} of the [...] "Over" [...] video in Kingston, Jamaica {{during the week of}} April 12, 2010, exclusively revealed to Rap-Up. Drake told MTV News, [...] "We went to Kingston, We went to this 'hood. They call it the 'gully' side. It's bad out there, real bad. They had 'Young Money' sprayed on the gates, 'Drake and Wayne,' 'cause I came to shoot the video out there. I'm talking about you drive by people's homes, they had 'Drake,' 'Young Money,' 'Drake, Welcome Here,' 'Drake We Love You' — crazy sh--, man. It was so crazy. This dude was like, 'Original Weezy tha God! You tha boss! Weezy tha God!' It's crazy. They <b>love</b> <b>us,</b> 'cause we show love out there." [...] The video was released on May 11, 2010, on Drake's blog and on MTV. In an interview with MTV News the video's director, Anthony Mandler said, [...] "Part of the objective of making this video was to do that same twist again, to give you something unexpected, not only tonality with the song but with the video thematically. It's kind of like the anti-love love story. It's really about crossing lines, what was said in the first scene. It's about really understanding what's right and what's wrong and it's really easy to lose that when you're the center of attention. He did it fearlessly, he did it without any sign of hesitation. He wanted to do something that went further with the song, that took the essence of the song but communicated it with imagery that made people think, rather than go up the middle and make an obvious R video." ...|$|E
