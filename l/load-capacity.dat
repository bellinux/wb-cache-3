40|$|Corrosion is {{a severe}} problem that affects {{oil and gas}} {{pipelines}} all over the world. When combined with the complex loading combinations faced by buried pipelines, the effects of corrosion can be devastating. Corrosion decreases the burst pressure, longitudinal <b>load-capacity,</b> and lateral <b>load-capacity</b> of affected pipes. Much {{research has been conducted}} to address this problem, and many repair techniques have been developed, including the use of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs). Most of the research that has been conducted on the use of FRP composites to repair pipes is concerned with increasing the burst pressure. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use a relatively new fibre, basalt, to increase the bending capacity of corroded pipes. To this end, five full-scale lab experiments and finite element analysis was conducted. It was found that a composite made of basalt fabric can increase the ultimate load of a pipe in bending. However, only a pipe specimen with a corrosion depth of 20 % of the wall thickness could fully recover the bending capacity to that of an uncorroded pipe through the use of basalt FRP (BFRP) composite. Analysis of different thicknesses of BFRP composites and different orientations of the fabric using finite element analysis software indicated that increasing the amount of BFRP layers only yields a marginal increase in strength when bending...|$|E

The present paper focuses on window glazing {{since this is}} a <b>load-capacity</b> system which, when subject to blast loading, has caused significant damage and injury to building occupants. Structural reliability techniques are used to derive fragility and blast reliability curves (BRCs) for annealed and toughened glazing subjected to explosive blast, for a variety of threat scenarios.

Example applica-tions include positioning a probe or sample in atomic force microscopy, alignment of tool and sample in stamping processes, and fine-positioning of wafer steppers in semi-conductor manufacturing. Such applications necessitate nanopositioning systems that satisfy critical functional requirements, such as <b>load-capacity,</b> bandwidth, resolution, and range. Therefore, a systematic approach for design and control is an important tool {{for research and development}} for flexure-based nanopositioning systems. In this thesis, a novel methodology is presented for generating flexure-based topolo-gies that can meet performance requirements, such as those dictating structural strength or dynamical behavior. We present performance metrics that allow for the generation of topologies that are tuned for a desired level of structural strength or modal separation.

40|$|The Eurocode 3 {{concerning}} thin-walled steel members divides members {{subjected to}} compression into four classes, considering their ductility. The {{representatives of the}} class C 4 are short bars, for which the <b>load-capacity</b> corresponds to the maximum compression stresses less than the yield stress. There are bars prone to local buckling in the elastic range {{and they do not}} have a real post-elastic capacity. The failure at ultimate stage of such members, either in compression or bending, always occurs by forming a local plastic mechanism. This fact suggests the possibility to use the local plastic mechanism to characterise the ultimate strength of such members. The present paper is based on previous studies and some latest investigations of the authors, as well as the literature collected data. It represents an attempt to study the plastic mechanisms for members in eccentric compression about minor axis and the evolution of plastic mechanisms, considering several types of lipped channel sections...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} {{nonlinear analysis}} of fibre reinforced concrete in DIANA, what influence changes in fibre orientation and density {{have on the}} load capacity and the load-bearing ability when the displacement grows. The {{most important part of}} the report are the modeling and results from the analysis. The first part of the report includes background theory for nonlinear analysis to give a better understanding of the analysis. Additionally the report include a literature study, based on earlier research and published material about fibre reinforced concrete and its mechanical properties. Especially the residual tensile strength is interesting, since it is here the fibres become the most useful. Both modeling and analysis have been done in the FEM-program DIANA. The beams were modeled after the rules in NS-EN 14651. Mostly the analysis were run with a displacement control up to a displacement of 4 mm to make it easier to see what influence the specific types of fibre reinforced concrete had on the <b>load-capacity</b> with increasing displacement. Force-controlled analysis were also tested, but most of the analysis stopped shortly after reaching the maximum <b>load-capacity</b> because of convergence. Calculations were done to check the contribution from the fibres to the shear capacity. The calculations were based on a set of rules suggested by COIN. Because of the existence of the notch, the first crack will always occur in the mid-section. The results showed that with a good consistency between the normal vector for the crack and the orientation of the fibres, it would be considerable contributions to the shear capacity. With higher density in the critical area, this contribution would become larger. The results from the analysis showed that up to 45 degrees between the normal vector and the fibre orientation, the fibres would have a positive effect on the load-bearing capacity after larger displacements when cracks have occurred. This thesis shows that through FEM-analysis it is possible to make good models of fibre reinforced concrete. However, more research on strain softening and hardening of FRC, and how to look at local changes, are necessary. In addition a set of design rules should be developed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} high {{strength}} concrete (HSC) has become increasingly popular {{in the construction of}} buildings and infra-structures. The utilization of HSC has been spurred on by the superior mechanical properties of the material and its cost-effectiveness. However, HSC tends to be more brittle or less tough than normal strength concrete. Therefore, external confinements are used to overcome and enhance the concrete characteristics. This study investigates the effectiveness of using steel straps in increasing the strength and ductility of HSC. Its also investigate the effects of using steel straps with different ultimate tensile strength and placed with different spacings. All the cylinders were tested under axial compression load to study their stress-axial strain and stress-lateral strain characteristics upon loading. Mode of failure of the cylinders has been observed. The results indicated that the confined cylinders have higher ultimate <b>load-capacity</b> and ductility compared to the unconfined cylinders. It also shows that higher strength of steel straps will increase the strength and ductility of confined {{high strength}} concrete. Further work needs to be carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of using low-cost steel straps as alternative to more costly confining materials such as Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) ...|$|E
40|$|URM (Unreinforced Masonry) {{historic}} buildings can be generally arranged into three categories: adobe, brick and stone masonry. However, a common feature of URM structures is typically the low mechanical {{properties of the}} masonry material, {{especially in terms of}} shear strength. URM buildings are not amenable to seismic analysis, and the relatively low strength of stone and brickwork masonry often requires expensive and invasive retrofitting intervention. Hard, intractable stones broke artificially or naturally into random shapes were often used for construction in many parts of Europe and constitute the main material of {{historic buildings}}. Thin, cement or lime-based renders are often employed to protect masonry construction, but these are frequently ignored in analysis and design. This paper shows how standard, thin, cement-based renderings can highly enhance the lateral <b>load-capacity</b> and shear stiffness of wall panels. An experimental campaign was carried out on-site to assess the effect of cement-based renders. In detail, compression and shear tests were conducted on twelve full-scale wall panels up to failure, and comparisons are presented to study the effect of cement-based renders on the structural behavior of stone and brickwork masonry panels...|$|E

Improving dynamic function of respiratory muscles during exercise might help to reduce symptoms and improve exercise capacity. Areas covered: The aims of this review are to 1) summarize physiological mechanisms linking respiratory muscle dysfunction to dyspnea and exercise limitation; 2) provide an overview of available therapeutic approaches to better maintain <b>load-capacity</b> balance of respiratory muscles during exercise; and 3) to summarize current knowledge on potential mechanisms explaining effects of interventions aimed at optimizing dynamic respiratory muscle function with a special focus on inspiratory muscle training. Expert commentary: Several mechanisms which are potentially linking improvements in dynamic respiratory muscle function to symptomatic and functional benefits have not been studied so far in COPD patients. Examples of underexplored areas include the study of neural processes related to the relief of acute dyspnea and the competition between respiratory and peripheral muscles for limited energy supplies during exercise. Novel methodologies are available to non-invasively study these mechanisms. Better insights into the consequences of dynamic respiratory muscle dysfunction will hopefully contribute to further refine and individualize therapeutic approaches in patients with COPD. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{infrastructure}} {{networks are}} often coupled together and thus could be modeled as interdependent networks. Overload and interdependent effect make interdependent networks more fragile when suffering from attacks. Existing research has primarily {{concentrated on the}} cascading failure process of interdependent networks without load, or the robustness of isolated network with load. Only limited {{research has been done}} on the cascading failure process caused by overload in interdependent networks. Redundant design is a primary approach to enhance the reliability and robustness of the system. In this paper, we propose two redundant methods, node back-up and dependency redundancy, and the experiment results indicate that two measures are effective and costless. Two detailed models about redundant design are introduced based on the non-linear <b>load-capacity</b> model. Based on the attributes and historical failure distribution of nodes, we introduce three static selecting strategies-Random-based, Degree-based, Initial load-based and a dynamic strategy-HFD (historical failure distribution) to identify which nodes could have a back-up with priority. In addition, we consider the cost and efficiency of different redundant proportions to determine the best proportion with maximal enhancement and minimal cost. Experiments on interdependent networks demonstrate that the combination of HFD and dependency redundancy is an effective and preferred measure to implement redundant design on interdependent networks. The results suggest that the redundant design proposed in this paper can permit construction of highly robust interactive networked systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective: Angiotensin {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) gene {{contains a}} polymorphism consisting {{of either the}} presence (I) or absence (D) of a 287 base pair fragment. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} the I-allele may be associated with superior exercise endurance; respiratory muscle function may be similarly influenced. The pressure-time index of inspiratory muscles (PTImus) {{is a measure of the}} <b>load-capacity</b> ratio of the inspiratory muscles. The objective of this study was to determine whether infants homozygous for the I-allele have lower PTImus compared to infants homozygous for the D-allele or heterozygous I/D. Patients and Methods: One hundred thirty two infants were studied. ACE genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using DNA from peripheral blood. PTImus was calculated as (Pimean/Pimax) x(Ti/Ttot), where Pimean was the mean inspiratory pressure estimated from airway pressure, generated 100 milliseconds after an occlusion (P 0. 1), Pimax was the maximum inspiratory pressure and Ti/Ttot was the ratio of the inspiratory time to the total respiratory cycle time. Pimax was the largest pressure generated during brief airway occlusions performed at the end of a spontaneous crying effort. Results: Infants with I/I genotype had significantly lower PTImus than infants with either D/D or I/D genotypes (p= 0. 000007). ACE genotype was significantly related (p= 0. 005) to PTImus measurements independent of other factors that may affect respiratory muscle function. Conclusion: These results suggest that an association of ACE genotypes with PTImus measurements may exist in infants...|$|E
40|$|Flexure-based mechanisms, also {{referred}} to as flexures, are widely being used as motion-guidance, or bearing, elements in applications requiring multi-degree-of-freedom positioning and alignment. Unlike friction-bearings (such as sliding or rolling contact bearings), flexures can be designed to offer, to a large extent, reliable linear elastic motion with a high resolution (on the order of nanometers) over small ranges of motion (on order of micrometers). Example applications include positioning a probe or sample in atomic force microscopy, alignment of tool and sample in stamping processes, and fine-positioning of wafer steppers in semiconductor manufacturing. These applications are often required satisfy critical functional requirements, such as <b>load-capacity,</b> bandwidth, resolution, and range. A systematic approach is needed to simultaneously address the design and control challenges involved, starting from the initial design concept generation stage to the final control implementation and testing. In this paper, we present an integrated design and control method for implementing flexurebased nanopositioning systems. We discuss the need for varying design topology and order of a controller in design and control optimization. An automation engine generates a set of flexurebased design topologies and also controllers of varying order in the optimization. A simple 1 -DOF example is worked out to illustrate the steps involved in using this methodology. The outcome of the exercise is a novel design topology, with it shape and size optimized, and a controller synthesized such that a desired control bandwidth and design requirements of strength and modal separation are met...|$|E
40|$|Breathing is {{maintained}} {{and controlled by}} a network of automatic neurons in the brainstem that generate respiratory rhythm and receive regulatory inputs. Breathing complexity therefore arises from respiratory central pattern generators modulated by peripheral and supra-spinal inputs. Very little is known on the brainstem neural substrates underlying breathing complexity in humans. We used both experimental and theoretical approaches to decipher these mechanisms in healthy humans and patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). COPD is the most frequent chronic lung disease in the general population mainly due to tobacco smoke. In patients, airflow obstruction associated with hyperinflation and respiratory muscles weakness are key factors contributing to <b>load-capacity</b> imbalance and hence increased respiratory drive. Unexpectedly, we found that the patients breathed with a higher level of complexity during inspiration and expiration than controls. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned the brain of the participants to analyze the activity of two small regions involved in respiratory rhythmogenesis, the rostral ventro-lateral (VL) medulla (pre-Bötzinger complex) and the caudal VL pons (parafacial group). fMRI revealed in controls higher activity of the VL medulla suggesting active inspiration, while in patients higher activity of the VL pons suggesting active expiration. COPD patients reactivate the parafacial to sustain ventilation. These findings may be involved in the onset of respiratory failure when the neural network becomes overwhelmed by respiratory overload We show that central neural activity correlates with airflow complexity in healthy subjects and COPD patients, at rest and during inspiratory loading. We finally used a theoretical approach of respiratory rhythmogenesis that reproduces the kernel activity of neurons involved in the automatic breathing. The model reveals how a chaotic activity in neurons can contribute to chaos in airflow and reproduces key experimental fMRI findings...|$|E
40|$|Decentralised {{wastewater}} treatment is increasingly gaining interest {{as a means}} of responding to sustainability challenges. Cost comparisons are a crucial element of any sustainability assessment. While the cost characteristics of centralised waste water management systems (WMS) have been studied extensively, the economics of decentralised WMS are less understood. A key motivation for studying the costs of decentralised WMS is to compare the cost of centralised and decentralised WMS in order to decide on cost-efficient sanitation solutions. This paper outlines a model designed to assess those costs which depend on the spatial density of decentralised {{wastewater treatment}} plants in a region. Density-related costs are mostly linked to operation and maintenance activities which depend on transportation, like sludge removal or the visits of professionals to the plants for control, servicing or repairs. We first specify a modelled cost-density relationship for a region in a geometric two-dimensional space by means of heuristic routing algorithms that consider time and <b>load-capacity</b> restrictions. The generic model is then applied to a Swiss case study for which we specify a broad range of modelling parameters. As a result, we identify a 'hockey-stick'-shaped cost curve that is characterised by strong cost reductions at high density values which level out at around 1 to 1. 5 plants per km 2. Variations in the cost curves are mostly due to differences in management approaches (scheduled or unscheduled emptying). In addition to the well-known diseconomies of scale in the case of centralised sanitation, we find a similar generic cost behaviour for decentralised sanitation due to economies of density. Low densities in sparsely populated regions thus result in higher costs for both centralised and decentralised system. Policy implications are that efforts to introduce decentralised options in a region should consider the low-density/high-cost problem when comparing centralised and decentralised options...|$|E

In this thesis, a novel methodology is presented for generating flexure-based topologies that can meet performance requirements, such as those dictating structural strength or dynamical behavior. We present performance metrics that allow for the generation of topologies that are tuned for a desired level of structural strength or modal separation. The topology generation is aimed as a valuable addition to the design toolkit, facilitating novel designs that could not have been conceived otherwise. The parameters within any particular topology could be adjusted at a subsequent phase through a detailed shape and size optimization. The thesis also proposes a controller generation approach. Unlike existing controller parameterizations, a novel parameterization formulated in this thesis allows for directly tuning the sensitivity transfer function of the closed-loop system. Tuning sensitivity is critical in mitigating the effects of disturbances affecting the system, as well as those arising from cross-coupling and parasitic error motions. Further, an integrated methodology for design and control is presented. This methodology uses the design topology generation approach and controller generation approach proposed in the thesis. The key distinction of our design for control approach is that the design is iterated over topologies and not just parameters within a selected topology. A simple one-degree-of-freedom positioning system example is worked out to detail the steps of the proposed integrated design and control methodology. A novel design topology that is ideally suited for achieving a desired design and control performance is derived using this methodology. Finally, the hardware design and control of a novel flexure-based nanopositioner implementation for scanning probe microscopy are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approaches discussed in this thesis. by Vijay Shilpiekandula.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} durable, versatile, and widely used construction materials. It can be used to make small posts, vast bridges, and tall buildings as well as lining tunnels and constructing pipeline. Generally, this composite material is capable of withstanding a wide range of environments, from oil rigs in the North Sea to deserts. However, occasionally it does not give the low maintenance life expected of it. Sometimes this is due to more adverse condition than initially expected. Consequently, there are many structures in the built environment suffering from corrosion induced damage. During the last few years, infrastructure deterioration caused by corrosion has escalated, warranting serious consideration. Among the different distressing consequences of reinforcing-bar corrosion, the most common is concrete cover cracking. When a reinforcing steel bar corrodes in concrete, a surface layer of steel is consumed and a layer of corrosion products rust forms on the perimeter of the bar. The rust that forms occupies a larger volume than the consumed steel layer, the increased volume creates internal high pressure against the surrounding concrete, and cracking and spalling result. Thus, steel corrosion may cause damage in steel, concrete, and the bond between them. Investigations have been conducted during the last three decades regarding chloride penetration and prediction of corrosion initiation. However, few investigations have dealt with corrosion propagation and/or residual life predictions, which are also needed for durability forecasting. Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to discuss, based on experimental information from previous investigations, the possibility of linking the degree of degradation (from a <b>load-capacity</b> reduction point of view) to the surface distress (for example, crack width opening) of a corroding reinforced concrete element in a marine environment. This dissertation presents a laboratory study, applied to three different type of concrete, in order to analyze and monitor the material behavior under accelerated ageing. The purpose of an accelerated test is to cause, degradation, corrosion or failure in a shorter time period than under normal conditions without change in failure mechanism. The studyoutline is based on different reference, but basically it was carried out performing accelerated corrosion test and using knowledge related to mechanical, chemical and electrochemical engineering. The analysis provided information concerning durability and service life of material. This information were applied to investigate on the possibility of on-field analysis and the correlation among traditional techniques of monitoring, service life modeling and increasing of acoustic emission technology for health monitoring...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the film stiffness of dry gas seal, and keep a low leakage rate at the same time, {{a great deal of}} numerical and experimental study on groove structure and parameter optimization of DGS under varying operation conditions have been carried out. The effect of geometry parameters of groove, such as spiral angle, groove-dam ratio and groove depth, on the performance of a S-DGS, such as opening force, film stiffness, leakage rate and stiffness-leakage ratio, are numerically analyzed by Zirkelback et al. [8], Liu et al. [9], Peng et al. [10]. The optimum structural parameters of groove with different objective functions in different operating conditions are presented. In recent years, the effect of groove structural optimization on performance improvement of DGS has attracted more and more researchers’ attention because the limitation of performance enhancement by optimum design of groove geometry parameters of S-DGS simply. Recently, a parametric study and performance evaluation of typical bidirectional dry gas seals with modified surface were presented by Su et al. [11, 12] and Blasiaka and Zahorulko [13]. Hashimoto and Ochiai [14 – 16] presented an entirely new optimum design methodology, in which the groove geometry can be flexibly changed by using the spline function, {{to maximize the}} stiffness of gas films for grooved thrust bearings. The film stiffness and <b>load-capacity</b> of the optimized bearing are higher than that of common spiral groove bearing and herringbone bearing, which were both theoretically and experimentally verified. The sealing performance of the spiral groove DGS with an inner annular groove (AS-DGS) [17] was numerically analyzed by Peng et al. [18], which was invented by Flowserve Corporation. The results show that the opening force and film stiffness of AS-DGS is larger than that of the common S-DGS at the condition of low-speed and high-pressure, while the leakage is a little larger. Dresser-Rand Corporation presented a patented pattern of short grooves in combination with the longer grooves to provide excellent lift-off effect and optimum gas film stiffness at low speed as well as high speed. During operation, the short grooves could create obvious high pressure to separate the mating rings at slow speed, while the longer grooves contribute to creating a stable gas film between the two rings at high speed. The uni-directional V groove with the combined radial-circumferential tapered groove bottom [19], which was invented by Burgmann Corporation, causes a reduction in the opening force and leakage rate. Despite that there are only few researchers pay attention to the experiment of the sealing performance test of DGS, most of the researchers only focus on the numerical simulation and analysis of groove structure and geometry parameters optimization as the subject to improve the gas film stiffness and reduce the fluid leakage of DGS.|$|E
40|$|With more {{advanced}} methods and increasing computational power, the simulation of reinforced concrete in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{has become more}} and more realistic. In a non-linear analysis of reinforced concrete, cracking behaviour and the maximum <b>load-capacity</b> can be determined. Such analyses sometimes suffer from unstable behaviour, especially when large parts of the structure crack at the same time. It is expected that spatially varying concrete material properties will affect crack initialization, crack patterns and the stability of the analysis. In this report, the use of spatial variability in the material properties of concrete in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was investigated. To incorporate spatial variation in the Finite Element method (FEM), discretized random fields are used which are assigned to elements or integration points in the Finite Element (FE) model. In this research the following methods are implemented and have been assessed on their performance: Covariance Matrix Decomposition method (CMD), Fast Fourier Transform method (FFT), Local Avarage Subdivision method (LAS) and Expansion Optimal Linear Estimation method (EOLE). To be appropriate for the implementation in a general purpose FEM program the method has to be efficient with respect to computation time, accurate in representing the statistical characteristics of concrete and easy to implement in the program. In a literature review, a large variation was found in the used values for the statistical characteristics which are involved in the modelling of the spatial variation of concrete properties. In the assessment of the random field generators this range of values was used as input. From literature and the assessment {{it was found that the}} CMD method is easy to implement and is the most accurate in representing the statistical characteristics of concrete. With respect to efficiency, the method performs poorly when the number of nodes increases. This is the case for random fields in multiple dimensions and/or for random fields with a small correlation length. The FFT method is slightly less accurate but performs very well with respect to efficiency when the number of nodes increase. The derivation of the one sided Spectral Density Function (SDF), which is needed in the FFT method, is however quite difficult. The threshold value in the correlation function and the distribution type have the largest influence on the accuracy of the random field. If the threshold value increases, and a log-normal distribution type with a high coefficient of variation (COV) is selected, the accuracy of the different methods decreases. The FFT method is slightly more accurate in representing the statistical characteristics in that case. With a large correlation length and a threshold value, the values in the random field are strongly correlated. It was found that in such a case the assumption of ergodicity does not hold any more. In the general purpose FEM program DIANA, a random field application has been developed. The guidelines in the JCSS Probabilistic Model Code are followed and implemented as a material model in the program. This material model is used in an example to assess the model code and the influence of spatially varying material properties on a non-linear FEA. A concrete floor submitted to a shrinkage load was analysed using the JCSS material model and some variations on this material model. Unfortunately, none of the analyses reached the convergence norm in all the load steps where cracking occurs. The results are therefore not reliable since the true equilibrium path may not be followed. However, they do give insight in the influences of spatially varying material properties on a non-linear FEA. The analysis resulted in non-symmetric cracking patterns, more gradual grow in the total number of cracks and crack initialization on the weakest point in the structure. In future studies the observations from this research can be used in a probabilistic analysis where the uncertainty in the material properties, which vary in space, can be taken into account which will yield a more accurate estimate of the reliability of a structure.

However, even after decades of research the role of the respiratory muscles in the rehabilitation program of these patients remains controversial. It is still unclear whether the addition of IMT to a general exercise training program can lead to additional gains in clinically relevant outcomes. This has been attributed to methodological shortcomings and considerable heterogeneity among the several small, single center clinical studies that have been performed and published so far. From meta-analysis it was concluded that IMT might be most effective in patients with pronounced inspiratory muscle weakness. In this PhD project, we investigated a newly developed device for IMT that provides a tapered flow resistive loading (TFRL) and allows for controlling training quality during the IMT sessions. We observed significantly larger increases in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, as well as changes in breathing pattern during endurance loaded breathing tasks after TFRL-IMT in comparison to the conventionally applied mechanical threshold loading IMT. We also found that patients participating in a combined general exercise training and IMT intervention achieved favorable changes in breathing pattern (breathing deeper and slower) during exercise in comparison with patients participating in rehabilitation without added IMT. The additional benefits of IMT as an adjunct to a general exercise training program on outcomes beyond respiratory muscle dysfunction in patients with COPD were examined in a large multicenter randomized double-blind controlled trial. Superior improvements in inspiratory muscle function did not translate into additional improvements in 6 minute walking distance. However, a larger improvement was observed in endurance cycling time, as well as reductions in dyspnea symptoms at iso-time during the cycling test. The training quality indices (both external work and power achieved during the IMT sessions) and training intensity (and not compliance) were significantly related to improvements in inspiratory muscle strength which in turn was related to improvements in endurance cycling time. We also reviewed potential physiological mechanisms explaining effects of IMT on exercise capacity and dyspnea in patients with COPD and have identified areas in which further research would be warranted. This fundamental knowledge will be a guideline incorporating inspiratory muscle training into evidence-based treatment recommendations for clinical practice and will provide insights for future research on inspiratory muscle training in patients suffering from respiratory muscle dysfunction.
