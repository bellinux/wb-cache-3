40|$|ABSTRACT: Process {{industry}} involves large plants; mainly {{operating in}} continuous form, to achieve economic mass production output. However {{in some situations}} process vessels and tanks are used, where batch processes, take place. These tanks often contain reactants and products in the liquid state. After treatment or processing, valves are opened to allow the product to drain and vessels may receive the next batch. However, with conventional valves {{there will always be}} an amount of fluid trapped between the valve closing element and the <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessel,</b> especially for those which are jacketed to allow heating or cooling. This amount is usually untreated, that is to say has not undergone the changes or processing taking place on the fluid bulk in the vessel. Moreover, no matter how accurately this amount is estimated to be isolated from the processed amount leaving the vessel, it will still contaminate with the processed product. From hygiene point of view, this may not be accepted. In this work a valve design is introduced; where no fluid is trapped between a process tank and the valve closing element. When the valve is opened the fluid flows to the outlet flow line without any contamination with unprocessed fluid. Thus a contamination free valve design is utilised to achieve hygiene design <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> used in batch based processes. Thus cheap equipment acquiring the hygiene requirements necessary for food and some other products that only can be achieved using expensive mass production lines is obtained...|$|R

Both workers were in their mid-teens and had started their first jobs only a few weeks previously. One death can be attributed to sniffing. In the second case, the worker is thought to have been washing his hands in the few inches of cold solvent at the base of an open tank used for metal degreasing. The operator was found slumped {{over the side of the}} tank and could not be revived when eventually dis-covered. The concentration of solvent in the general atmos-phere of the workroom was well below the Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 350 parts per million (ppm). The concen-tration immediately below the rim of the tank was 6000 ppm when the tank was not in use, and rose to over 70 000 ppm when the liquid solvent was disturbed. The reputation which 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane has achieved for low chronic toxicity at or below the TLV does not justify a belief in total absence of risk in its use. The solvent is readily volatile even at room temperature, and the vapour is heavier than air.

This description includes waste characteristics, waste types, locations, and associated hazards. The goal to be met by the Transition Phase preclosure activities is to place the TSD unit into a safe and environmentally secure condition for the long-term Surveillance and Maintenance (S&M) Phase of the facility decommissioning process. This preclosure work plan has been prepared in accordance with Section 8. 0 of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) (Ecology et al. 1996). The preclosure work plan is one of three critical Transition Phase documents, the other two being: B Plant End Points Document (WHC-SD-WM-TPP- 054) and B Plant S&M plan. These documents are prepared by the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and its contractors with the involvement of Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology). The tanks and vessels addressed by this preclosure work plan are limited to those tanks end vessels included on the B Plant Complex Part A, Form 3, Permit Application (DOE/RL- 88 - 21). The criteria for determining which <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> are in the Part A, Form 3, are discussed in the following. The closure plan for the TSD unit will not be prepared until the Disposition Phase of the facility decommissioning process is initiated, which follows the long-term S&M Phase.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of {{pressure}} and heat leakages on Boil-off Gas (BOG) in Liquefied Natural Gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>tanks.</b> The Lee-Kesler-Plocker (LKP) and the Starling modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWRS) empirical models were used to simulate the compressibility factor, enthalpy and hence heat leakage at various pressures to determine the factors that affect the BOG in typical <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks</b> of different capacities. Using a case study data the heat leakage of 140, 000 kl, 160, 00 kl, 180, 000 kl and 200, 000 kl <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks</b> were analyzed using the LKP and BWRS models. The heat leakage of <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks</b> depends on the structure of tanks, and the small tanks lose heatto the environment due to their large surface area to volume ratio. As the operation pressure was dropped to 200 mbar, all four of the LNG tanks’ BOG levels reached 0. 05 vol%/day. In order to satisfy the BOG design requirement, the operating pressure of the four large <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks</b> in the case study was maintained above 200 mbar. Thus, the operating pressure impacts BOG on <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks,</b> but this effect is limited under the extreme high operation pressure. An attempt was made to determine the relationship between the compositions of LNGand BOG; one been combustible and the other non-combustible gases. The main component of combustible gas was methane, and nitrogen was of non-combustible gases. The relationship between BOG and methane compositions was that, as the methane fraction increases in the LNG, the BOG volume also increases. In general, results showed a direct correlation between BOG and operating pressure. The study also found that larger <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks</b> have less BOG; however as the operation pressure is increased the differences in the quantity of BOGamong the four tanks decreased...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a {{new type}} of <b>LNG</b> <b>tank</b> named “KC- 1 {{membrane}} LNG tank” has been developed by Korean Gas Corporation (KOGAS), and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) is currently building KC- 1 membrane type LNG carriers. Unlike other <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks,</b> the KC- 1 membrane <b>LNG</b> <b>tank</b> has a single-insulation structure rather than a double-insulation structure. For a given tank’s boundary condition, heat transfer analysis is performed from the external to the internal environment of the <b>LNG</b> <b>tank</b> by numerical simulation for three tanks. In each tank, the main thermally resistant layer of insulation is assembled with a High density rigid Polyurethane Foam (H-PUF), which is blown with one of three different types of hydrofluorocarbons-namely-HFC- 365 mfc, 245 fa, and 245 fa-e (enhanced). Advantage of such blowing agents is that it has a lower Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) than HCFC- 141 b or carbon dioxide (CO 2) that has been used in the past as well as having low thermal conductivity. A Reduced Order Model is utilized to a 3 -dimensional section of the insulation to calculate equivalent thermal conductivity.

Therefore, for the dynamic design of a <b>LNG</b> <b>tank</b> filled with liquid and operated on seaway, it is necessary to accurately predict its natural characteristics and dynamic response considering fluid structure interactions. To address these two key issues in the dynamic design stage, the developed computer software based on a mixed displacement–pressure finite element model to complete fluid-structure interaction analysis is introduced. An integrated internal liquid-tank-external water interaction system investigated by numerical simulations is summarised to consider the two issues involving the dynamic design of <b>LNG</b> <b>tanks.</b> The five studied cases include: i) 50 % filled LNG liquid in a fixed rigid tank, ii) elastic tank only, iii) 50 % filled <b>LNG</b> liquid-elastic <b>tank</b> interaction, iv) empty elastic tank-external sea water interaction and v) internally 50 % filled LNG liquid-elastic tank-external sea water interaction.
