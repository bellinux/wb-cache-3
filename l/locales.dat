40|$|In the topos {{approach}} to quantum theory by Heunen, Landsman and Spitters, one associates to any unital C*-algebra A, a topos T (A) of sheaves on a <b>locale</b> and a commutative C*-algebra A within that topos. The Gelfand spectrum of A is a <b>locale</b> Σ in this topos, which {{is equivalent to}} a bundle over the base <b>locale.</b> We further develop this external presentation of the <b>locale</b> Σ, by noting that {{the construction of the}} Gelfand spectrum in a general topos can be described using geometric logic. As a consequence, the spectrum, seen as a bundle, is computed fibrewise. As a by-product of the geometricity of Gelfand spectra, we find an explicit external description of the spectrum whenever the topos is a functor category. As an intermediate result we show that locally perfect maps compose, so that the externalization of a locally compact <b>locale</b> in a topos of sheaves over a locally compact <b>locale</b> is locally compact, too. ...|$|R
