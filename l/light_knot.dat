The woodland at Dersingham is quite recent and contains Scots pine, oak, sweet chestnut, sycamore and birch. The woodland glades attract birds such as redpoll, crossbill, long-eared owl, tree pipit, woodlark, shelduck, nightjar, and sparrowhawk.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} the helical vortex solution in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates which can be identified as a twisted vorticity flux. Based on this we argue that the recently proposed knot in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates can be interpreted as a vorticity knot, a vortex ring made of the helical vortex. This picture shows that the knot is made of two quantized vorticity fluxes linked together, whose topology π_ 3 (S^ 2) is fixed by the linking number of two vorticity fluxes. Due to the helical structure the knot has both topological and dynamical stability. We estimate the energy of the <b>lightest</b> <b>knot</b> to be about 3 × 10 ^- 3 eV.

40|$|We {{study the}} topological objects in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. We compare two {{competing}} theories of two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, the popular Gross-Pitaevskii {{theory and the}} recently proposed gauge theory of two-component Bose-Einstein condensate which has an induced vorticity interaction. We show that two theories produce very similar topological objects, {{in spite of the}} obvious differences in dynamics. Furthermore we show that the gauge theory of two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, with the U(1) gauge symmetry, is remarkably similar to the Skyrme theory. Just like the Skyrme theory the theory admits the non-Abelian vortex, the helical vortex, and the vorticity knot. We construct the <b>lightest</b> <b>knot</b> solution in two-component Bose-Einstein condensate numerically, and discuss how the knot can be constructed in the spin- 1 / 2 condensate of ^ 87 Rb atoms.

However, the question of when an initially null light field stays null has remained challenging to answer. By establishing a mapping between Maxwell's equations and transport along the flow of a pressureless Euler fluid, we show that an initially analytic null light field stays null {{if and only if}} the flow of the initial Poynting field is shear-free, giving a design rule for the construction of persistently <b>knotted</b> <b>light</b> fields. Furthermore we outline methods for constructing initially <b>knotted</b> null <b>light</b> fields, and initially null, shear-free light fields, and give sufficient conditions for the magnetic (or electric) field lines of a null light field to lie tangent to surfaces.

5000|$|The {{design was}} {{intended}} as a smaller follow-on from the preceding Tribal class, and incorporated one radical new idea that was a departure from all previous Royal Navy destroyer designs. That was the adoption of a two boiler room layout. This reduced hull length and allowed for a single funnel, both reducing the profile and increasing the arcs of fire of the light anti-aircraft (A/A) weapons. However, this also increased vulnerability, as there were now two consecutive large compartments with the resultant risk of a single well placed hit flooding both and resulting in a total loss of boiler power. This illustrates somewhat the Admiralty's attitude to the expendable nature of destroyers. This is of course, as opposed to the 3-boiler-room layout that was used starting with the F class in the early 1930s. Early ships also tended to use twin boiler rooms, which are still a great improvement over a single boiler room. In any case, destroyers are lightly armored and fast vessels meant to survive by avoiding being hit at all. The odds of a single hit striking just the right spot to disable both boiler rooms simultaneously were considered remote enough to be worth risking in exchange for the benefits given by a two-room layout.

But Guert objected to 'spoiling the sport,' as he called it, insisting that the logs of the house would be slow to ignite, and that we might at any moment scatter the knots, by a rapid sortie.

40|$|The nucleus and jet of M 87 was mapped with an eight-station {{very long}} {{baseline}} interferometric array at 18 cm wavelength with high dynamic range. It {{was found that}} the nucleus of M 87 consists of a core-jet structure with a peak brightness temperature greater than 10 to the 10 th K.

In addition, the nucleus contains a significant structure of lower brightness at approximately the same position angle, although no counterjet is observed. By invoking relativistic beaming in order to enhance the jet and diminish the counterjet, it is shown that the jet must be aligned within about 60 degrees to our line of sight, and its flow velocity must exceed about 60 % of the speed of <b>light.</b> The <b>knots</b> embedded in the 20 '' jet contain no bright compact structures, and the sizes of the innermost knot (knot D) is between 0. 1 - 0. 3 ''...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. At all {{the seven}} Early Christian basilicas found {{so far in}} Sandanski (South-West Bulgaria) the {{application}} of river boulders as construction material is documented. The walls of Basilica N 4 are made of granite boulders as well as porphyry granite stones whose feldspar admixtures are coloured in pink. Also made of granite are the Roman-Dorian style columns and capitals from atrium of the basilica. The study of the marble ornaments from Basilica N 4 shows that they are from two mineral types: calcite and slightly dolomite marbles. Some of them have middle-grained massive texture, <b>light</b> yellow <b>knotted</b> shell surface. Other marble material is presented in white, middle-grained but homogenous texture. The light-grey marbles are presented by shining crystal reflecting the light again with middle-grained homogenous massive texture.

Also, the line luminosities of the extranuclear knots are typical for giant H II regions. There is neither evidence for tidal tails nor for high velocity differences between the knots. In addition, the linear arrangement of the knots does not support interaction. It rather suggests self-propagating star formation. In this picture, the faintness of the nuclear region can be understood by an edge-on view. In addition, the nuclear starburst appears to be fading {{in contrast to the}} young extranuclear star formation regions.
