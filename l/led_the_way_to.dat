5|$|The breed {{was first}} {{registered}} with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1918. During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed and the dogs destroyed, due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower. Following the war several kennels <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reestablishing the breed including the Bellmead Kennels, located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor. Dandies continued to be bred up at Bellmead up until the early 1990s, when it passed {{into the hands of}} Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{and the introduction of}} the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|Once again, though, the Dukes {{were unable}} to build {{momentum}} as they lost 60–76 to #19 ranked Temple. Bill Clark and Eric Evans led the team with just 12 points each. On February 6, the Dukes braved a blizzard for {{a game against the}} George Washington Colonials in Washington, D.C.. Saunders <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a 70–63win with a career-high 27 points. Returning home on February 11 to face the Massachusetts Minutemen, the Dukes {{were unable to}} win two consecutive games for the third straight time, losing 80–84. Damian Saunders scored 15points, but was injured and left the game for a while; when he returned, he did not score in the remainder of his playing time. He did, however, become Duquesne's 33rd player to pass the 1,000career points mark.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth of}} eight {{children}} of a wealthy Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza, under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his Via Panisperna boys. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the discovery of nuclear fission. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he joined the French Communist Party, as did his sisters Guiliana and Laura and brother Gillo. The Italian Fascist regime's 1938 racial laws against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The website Box Office Mojo, {{which publishes}} reports on film grosses, divides the movie year into five seasons. It defines the winter season as lasting {{from the first}} day after New Year's week or weekend ends through the Thursday before the first Friday in March. The site's data go back to 1982, and in every year the winter season has had the lowest box office grosses. The weakest winter was 1983, when The Entitys $13 million take <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a total of $93.4 million in {{domestic}} grosses for all movies released during that season. On the other end, 2012 had the strongest winter, at $1.24 billion, topped by Safe House, which took in $124 million.|$|E

25|$|Like the Edsel, {{to which}} it has {{sometimes}} been likened, Manjoo said the Zune's failure may have <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> eventual success with other products. The HD's user interface, he noted, was the first such Microsoft product to rely on text rather than icons, and it would {{form the basis for}} Windows Phone, Windows 8, Xbox and all of the company's web-based services. The Segoe typeface that is now used in all of them, as well as Microsoft's current logo, was first used on the Zune.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrialization}} {{drive was}} meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but definitely not welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, not long after that, the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the first calculators {{appeared}} with field-effect, twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them {{to cut out}} damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs {{is that they are}} passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.|$|E

25|$|India {{started their}} World cup {{campaign}} well by defeating Kenya at Cuttack, first restricting them to 199/6 with Kumble taking 3/28 and then chasing it down easily {{to win by}} 7 wickets due to Tendulkar's century (127 not out from 138 balls, 15 fours, 1 six). India's next match against the West Indies at Gwalior went much the same way: after bowling the West Indies side out for 173 with Kumble capturing 3/35 and Prabhakar 3/39, Tendulkar (70 runs, 91 balls, 8 fours) <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> another victory.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{with the}} Mongols would {{essentially}} disappear after 1320, while {{relations with the}} Franks were reinforced, {{with the establishment of}} the French Lusignan dynasty as the ruling family in Cilician Armenia, due to the policy since 1254 of inter-marriage between the royal families of Cyprus and Cilician Armenia. Following the murder of Leo IV in 1341, his cousin Guy Lusignan was elected king. However, when the pro-Latin Lusignans took power, they tried to impose Catholicism and the European way of life. The Armenian leadership largely accepted this, but the peasantry opposed the changes. Eventually, this <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> civil strife.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Forces {{came under}} NATO command {{at the end}} of July, and the 1 RCR Battle Group {{replaced}} the PPCLI. Canadians launched Operation Medusa in September in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters from Panjwaii once and for all. The fighting of Operation Medusa <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the second, and most fierce Battle of Panjwaii in which daily gun-battles, ambushes, and mortar and rocket attacks were targeting the Canadian troops. The Taliban had massed with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 fighters. The Taliban were reluctant to give up the area, and after being surrounded by the Canadian Forces, they dug in and fought a more conventional style battle. After weeks of fighting, the Taliban had been cleared from the Panjwaii area and Canadian reconstruction efforts in the area began.|$|E

25|$|Sold out Tests against New Zealand and South Africa at Crystal Palace saw the RFU realise {{the benefit}} of owning their own ground. Committee member William Williams and {{treasurer}} William Cail <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> purchasing a 10.25 acre (4 hectare) market garden in Twickenham in 1907 for £5,500 12s 6d. The first stands were constructed the following year. Before the ground was purchased, {{it was used to}} grow cabbages, and so Twickenham Stadium is affectionately known as the Cabbage Patch. After further expenditure on roads, the first game, between Harlequins v. Richmond, was played on 2 October 1909, and the first international, England v. Wales, on 15 January 1910. At the time of the English-Welsh game, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 20,000 spectators. During World War I the ground was used for cattle, horse and sheep grazing. King George V unveiled a war memorial in 1921.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 Buccaneers {{defense is}} widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). Derrick Brooks was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a 12–4 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined – all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes – returning 4 for touchdowns – and collected 11 sacks.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur was {{responsible}} for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. He performed experiments that showed that without contamination, microorganisms could not develop. Under {{the auspices of the}} French Academy of Sciences, he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed, and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow. Although Pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory, his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that it was true. Today, he is often {{regarded as one of the}} fathers of germ theory. Pasteur made significant discoveries in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization. Early in his career, his investigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of what is now called optical isomers. His work <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.|$|E

500|$|In 1934 Pontecorvo {{contributed to}} Fermi's famous {{experiment}} showing {{the properties of}} slow neutrons that <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the discovery of nuclear fission. Pontecorvo's name was included on the Via Panisperna boys' patent [...] "To increase the production of artificial radioactivity with neutron bombardment". He was made a temporary assistant at the Royal Institute of Physics on 1 November 1934 and the University of Rome, and on 7 November, he was listed as co-author, along with Fermi and Rasetti, of a landmark paper on slow neutrons that reported that hydrogen slowed neutrons more than heavy elements, and that slow neutrons were more easily absorbed. An Italian patent was granted for the process in October 1935, {{in the name of}} Fermi, Pontecorvo, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti and Emilio Segrè. A US patent was granted on 2 July 1940.|$|E
500|$|In 1953, {{the pianist}} George Russell {{published}} his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization,Library of Congress Catalog Record available at.Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization website located at.Author George Russell’s website located at which offered {{an alternative to}} the practice of improvisation based on chords and chord changes. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships, the Lydian Chromatic Concept introduced the idea of chord/scale unity and was the first theory to explore the vertical relationship between chords and scales, as well as the only original theory to come from jazz. This approach <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> [...] "modal" [...] in jazz. Influenced by Russell's ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of his studio album Milestones (1958). Satisfied with the results, Davis prepared an entire album based on modality. Pianist Bill Evans, who had studied with Russell but recently departed from Davis's sextet to pursue his own career, was drafted back into the new recording project, the sessions that would become Kind of Blue.|$|E
