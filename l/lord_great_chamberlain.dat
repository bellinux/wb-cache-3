5|$|The Great Officers of State {{traditionally}} participate {{during the}} ceremony. The offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable {{have not been}} regularly filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, revived for coronation ceremonies.

5|$|The ninety-two {{peers are}} made up of three {{separate}} groups. Fifteen 'office-holders' comprise Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen, and are elected by the House, while seventy-five party and Crossbench members are elected by their own party or group. In addition, there are two royal appointments: the <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> currently the Marquess of Cholmondeley, is appointed as the Queen's representative in Parliament, while the post of Earl Marshal remains purely hereditary; the office has been held since 1672 by the Dukes of Norfolk and is responsible for ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is {{also carried}} before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath is bound in crimson velvet {{decorated}} with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises. In the centre is the royal badge of joint-sovereigns WilliamIII and MaryII, for whose coronation the sheath {{was made in}} 1689. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. At coronations, a peer gives the Sword of State to the <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> who places it {{on a table in}} StEdward's Chapel.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Robert's grandson, John Fleming, 2nd Lord Fleming, was {{appointed}} as a guardian to James V of Scotland during the king's infancy in July 1515. In 1517 John became Chancellor of Scotland. However {{while he was}} out hawking on 1 November 1524, he was assassinated by John Tweedie of Drummelzier (chief of Clan Tweedie) and others. Malcolm Fleming, 3rd <b>Lord</b> Fleming was <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> of Scotland and married Lady Janet Stewart, daughter of James IV of Scotland.

Dated at Jedburgh 14 January 1512-13, David Routlege {{witnessed}} a charter by [...] "William Douglas of Drumlanrig knight and {{lord of the}} barony of Hawick, granting and selling to Alexander <b>Lord</b> Home <b>great</b> <b>chamberlain</b> of Scotland, the lands of Braidlie in the barony of Hawick and sheriffdom of Roxburgh.

[...] AD 1514. English raiders attacked Hawick but were routed by the town's youth. It is presumed that Routledges, as citizens of Hawick, were involved when, as recounted by historian Robert Wilson, [...] "a marauding party of the English, {{the year after the}} Battle of Flodden 1513 came up the Teviot for plunder...Recollections of Flodden sharpened the revenge of the people...about 200 stout men...met the English plunderers at Trows, two miles below Hawick, where a desperate conflict took place. The enemy, about forty in number, with a flag were come upon rather by surprise...a complete massacre ensued. The flag was taken and scarcely a soldier escaped. This colour or its emblem has been carried round the marches of the burgh property at the Common Riding ever since." ...|$|R
5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E
25|$|After the Restoration, Lindsey was re-appointed to the Privy Council, {{admitted}} as <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> {{and appointed}} Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire.

The {{members of the}} College walk in the procession in virtue of them being Her Majesty's [...] "Kings, Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of England." [...] They do so alongside their Scottish colleagues: the Lord Lyon, the Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of the Lyon Court. The Garter King of Arms is usually placed next to the <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> in the procession, he has the duty of guiding, but not performing the ceremony. Garter's duties during the coronation ceremony are therefore not unlike those of a Master of Ceremonies. It is only during this ceremony that the Kings of Arms are allowed to wear their distinctive crowns, the only group of individuals, apart from the King and Queen, authorised to do so.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> {{presents}} the spurs, which represent chivalry.

The Archbishop then delivers several Crown Jewels to the sovereign. First, he delivers the Orb, a hollow gold sphere decorated with precious and semi-precious stones. The Orb is surmounted by a cross, representing the rule of Jesus over the world; it is returned to the altar immediately after being received. Next, the sovereign receives a ring representing his or her [...] "marriage" [...] to the nation. The Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, so called because it is surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Ghost, and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross, which incorporates CullinanI, are delivered to the sovereign.|$|E

The new Council agreed on making Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford Lord Protector with full powers, which in effect were those of a prince. At {{the same time the}} Council awarded themselves a round of promotions based on Henry VIII's wishes; the Earl of Hertford became the Duke of Somerset and John Dudley was created Earl of Warwick. The new Earl had to pass on his post of Lord Admiral to Somerset's brother, Thomas Seymour, but advanced to <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain.</b> Perceived as the most important man next the Protector, he was on friendly terms with Somerset, who soon reopened the war with Scotland. Dudley accompanied him as second-in-command with a taste for personal combat. On one occasion he fought his way out of an ambush and, spear in hand, chased his Scottish counterpart for some , nearly running him through. In the Battle of Pinkie Dudley led the vanguard, being [...] "one of the key architects of the English victory".|$|E

500|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{provides}} firstly that [...] "No-one {{shall be}} a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage." [...] (The Act treats the Principality of Wales and the Earldom of Chester as hereditary peerages, though those titles, granted normally to the heir-apparent, are never inherited.) The Act then provides that 92 peers, including the Earl Marshal, the <b>Lord</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> and 90 other peers elected in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House, would be excepted from the exclusion of hereditary peers, and that after the first session of the next Parliament, whenever one of these seats fell vacant, the Lords would have to proceed to a by-election. The Act also provided that a hereditary peer would be entitled to vote in elections for, and sit in, the House of Commons, unless he or she was a member of the House of Lords. Previously, hereditary peers had been constitutionally disqualified from being electors to, or members of, the House of Commons.
