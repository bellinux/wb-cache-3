25|$|Because the {{chemicals}} coated on the nests are {{equivalent to that}} present in adult P. dominula bodies, young wasps <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> chemical template {{in the very early}} state of the adult life to later on be able to distinguish their nest mates from non-nest mates. The CHC composition of the larvae and adults are very different, in that the larvae's relative abundance of low-molecular-weight CHCs is higher and that the larval profiles are more uniform than those of adults. Adults are also able to distinguish odors of their own colonial larval CHCs from those of foreign colonys.|$|E
25|$|Because April 7 was {{the second}} day of the far bloodier Battle of Shiloh, the {{campaign}} for Island No. 10 soon fell from public notice. It has become memorable principally for the run of USS Carondelet past the batteries, whose passage marked the introduction of a new tactic in warfare. The use of steam for driving ships meant that they no longer had to slug it out with fixed forts. The tactic later became commonplace in the Civil War, being employed by Farragut at New Orleans, Port Hudson, Vicksburg, and Mobile, and by David D. Porter at Vicksburg. Consequently, the value of fixed fortifications was much diminished. The South did not <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> lesson, continuing to rely on forts until the end of the war, but the restored nation had to consider it when designing its defense system from 1865 on.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{study of}} sleep in small invertebrates is complicated. Insects go through circadian rhythms of activity and passivity but some {{do not seem}} to have a homeostatic sleep need. Insects {{do not seem to}} exhibit REM sleep. However, fruit flies appear to sleep, and systematic disturbance of that state leads to cognitive disabilities. There are several methods of measuring cognitive functions in fruit flies. A common method is to let the flies choose whether they want to fly through a tunnel that leads to a light source, or through a dark tunnel. Normally, flies are attracted to light. But if sugar is placed in the end of the dark tunnel, and something the flies dislike is placed in the end of the light tunnel, the flies will eventually learn to fly towards darkness rather than light. Flies deprived of sleep require a longer time to <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> and also forget it more quickly. If an arthropod is experimentally kept awake longer than it is used to, then its coming rest period will be prolonged. In cockroaches that rest period is characterized by the antennae being folded down and by a decreased sensitivity to external stimuli. Sleep has been described in crayfish, too, characterized by passivity and increased thresholds for sensory stimuli as well as changes in the EEG pattern, markedly differing from the patterns found in crayfish when they are awake.|$|E
500|$|Hebel's admirers include Goethe, Gottfried Keller and Tolstoy.

But {{on the question of}} whether he would translate Hebel's works, Goethe said: [...] "Such a great poet should be only read in the original! One just needs to <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> language!" [...] The Brothers Grimm also admired Hebel, and he met Jacob Grimm in Karlsruhe in 1814.|$|E

Gilbert attended rehearsals directed by Robertson to <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> art first-hand from the older director, {{and he began to}} apply it in some of his earliest plays. He sought realism in acting, settings, costumes and movement, if not in content of his plays (although he did write a romantic comedy in the [...] "naturalist" [...] style, as a tribute to Robertson, Sweethearts), shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.|$|E
