5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
