40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{tremendous}} development of GSM services over the last years, the number of related services used by organizations has drastically increased. Therefore, monitoring GSM services is becoming a business critical issue {{in order to be able}} to react appropriately in case of incident. In order to provide with GSM coverage all the CERN underground facilities, more than 50 km of <b>leaky</b> feeder <b>cable</b> have been deployed. This infrastructure is also used to propagate VHF radio signals for the CERN’s fire brigade. Even though CERN’s mobile operator monitors the network, it cannot guarantee the availability of GSM services, and for sure not VHF services, where signals are carried by the <b>leaky</b> feeder <b>cable.</b> So, a global monitoring system has become critical to CERN. In addition, monitoring this infrastructure will allow to characterize its behaviour over time, especially with LHC operation. Given that commercial solutions were not yet mature, CERN developed a system based on GSM probes and an application server which collects data from them via the CERN GPRS network. By placing probes in strategic locations and comparing measurements between probes, it is possible now possible to determine if there is a GSM or VHF problem on one <b>leaky</b> feeder <b>cable</b> segment.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{theoretical}} model for indoor propagation {{in a straight}} corridor with adjacent rooms is developed and evaluated. One objective is to assess the effect of different conductivities and permittivities in the walls between rooms have on the power levels, in both the corridor and the rooms. Furthermore, {{a model of a}} <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> is proposed for which the corresponding propagation characteristics are evaluated and compared to that of a dipole antenna to assess if a <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> is a viable alternative for radio coverage in an indoor environment. In order to evaluate the model, a wideband measurement campaign has been conducted at 2. 44 GHz with a 40 meter long leaky coaxial cable and two vertically polarized dipole antennas. The proposed model is based on the waveguide model in 2 D, the mode matching method and cascade coupling of scattering matrices. A section of a corridor is modeled as waveguides with different cross section where one waveguide contains a dielectric medium which models the wall between two rooms. Mode matching is used to determine how the waveguide modes are coupled at the boundaries between the waveguides and the result is collected in a scattering matrix. Multiple corridor sections are then connected together, by cascade coupling the corresponding scattering matrices of each section, into a long corridor with adjacent rooms. Point sources are used to excite the waveguides as an approximation of dipole transmitting antennas. Moreover, the radiating slots in the <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> are modeled by multiple point sources that are phase and amplitude shifted in order to achieve the same radiation direction and longitudinal loss as the <b>leaky</b> <b>cable.</b> Finally, the inverse discreet Fourier transform is applied to the wideband electromagnetic field distribution {{in order to determine the}} propagation characteristics in the time domain. The results from the model are in good quantitative agreement with the measurement data, and it is shown that a <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> give a more even radio coverage in an office corridor compared to a dipole antenna, especially when the internal walls are highly reflective. Moreover, it is shown that the direct path is dominating for transmission between rooms with transparent walls, like plasterboard, while the main propagation path for highly reflective walls is along the corridor...|$|E

40|$|Plants in the Bromeliaceae {{known as}} tank bromeliads {{essentially}} lack stems and absorptive roots and instead take up water from reservoirs formed by their overlapping leaf bases. For such plants, leaf hydraulic conductance is plant hydraulic conductance. Their simple strap-shaped leaves and parallel venation make them suitable for modeling leaf hydraulic conductance based on vasculature and other anatomical and morphological traits. Plants {{of the tank}} bromeliad Guzmania lingulata were investigated in a lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica and a shaded glasshouse in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Stomatal conductance to water vapor and leaf anatomy related to hydraulic conductance were measured for both groups. Tracheid diameters and number of veins were used with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate axial hydraulic conductance. Measurements of leaf hydraulic conductance using the evaporative flux method were also made for glasshouse plants. Values for axial conductance and leaf hydraulic conductance were used in a model based on <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> theory to estimate the conductance of the radial pathway from the vein to the leaf surface and to assess the relative contributions of both axial and radial pathways. In keeping with low stomatal conductance and density, low vein density, and narrow tracheid diameters, leaf hydraulic conductance for G. lingulata was quite low in comparison with most other angiosperms. Using the predicted axial conductance in the <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> model, the radial resistance across the leaf mesophyll was predicted to predominate; lower, more realistic values of axial conductance resulted in predicted radial resistances that were closer to axial resistance in their impact on total leaf resistance. Tracer dyes suggested that water uptake through the tank region of the leaf was not limiting. Both dye movement and the <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> model indicated that the leaf blade of G. lingulata was structurally and hydraulically well-suited to conserve water...|$|E

30|$|High-speed rail {{is a type}} of {{passenger}} rail transport that operates significantly faster than the normal speed of rail traffic. Specific definitions by the International Union of Railways (UIC) and European Union include 200 km/h for upgraded track and 250 km/h or faster for new track [1]. High-speed rail receives considerable attention recently due to its cost-efficiency, almost all-weather operation, low carbon-dioxide (CO 2) emission, and many other advantages. In Japan, Shinkansen lines run at speeds of up to 300 km/h. In China, high-speed conventional rail lines operate at top speeds of 350 km/h and reaches as high as 487.3 km/h during a recent test run [1, 2]. Research on even higher speed train in vacuum tube is also underway in China with target operational speed of 600 – 1000 km/h in 10 years. Regional or international high-speed rail is under planning or construction in the United States, Europe, Asia, and South America [1]. Therefore, there is an increasing yet challenging demand on broadband mobile communications for high-speed trains, as it is necessary to provide information (such as voice, Internet, video conference) and onboard entertainment services to passengers, support communication-based train control (CBTC), and transmit surveillance video and sensory data from the high-speed train to track-side base stations for the safety and efficient operation of high-speed rail. In addition, positive train control which has been developed in the United States is another major driver for highly reliable high-speed rail broadband mobile communications. Various technologies (such as <b>leaky</b> <b>cable,</b> GSM, satellite, and 802.11 WLAN) have been employed for railway wireless communications. However, each of the above-mentioned technologies has some shortcoming or limitations when applied to high-speed rail broadband mobile communications. The key problem associated with <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> is its high attenuation and high cost of deployment and maintenance; the key issue with GSM-based approach is its limited bandwidth and low data rate; the key problems associated with satellite-based approach are the lost of connection in tunnels, high systems cost, and significant delay; whereas the key problems with WLAN-based approach are the limited coverage per access point, modifications required to support smooth handover, and significant performance degradation for higher train speed (e.g., above 300 km/h) [3].|$|E
40|$|For myelinated fibers, it is {{experimentally}} {{well established}} that spike conduction velocity {{is proportional to}} fiber diameter. However no really satisfactory theoretical treatment has been proposed. To treat this problem a theoretical axon was described consisting of lengths of passive <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> (internode) regularly interrupted by short isopotential patches of excitable membrane (node). The nodal membrane was assumed to obey the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. The explicit diameter dependencies of the various parameters were incorporated into the equations. The fiber diameter to axon diameter ratio was taken to be constant, and the internode length was taken to be proportional to the fiber diameter. Both these conditions reflect the situation that exists in real, experimental fibers. Dimensional analysis shows that these anatomical conditions are equivalent to Rushton's (1951) assumption of corresponding states. Hence, conduction velocity will be proportional to fiber diameter, {{in complete agreement with}} the experimental findings.

With {{the growing}} demand for security products, intrusion alarm system, based on <b>leaky</b> <b>cables,</b> is favored by majority of enterprises, with advantages of system stability, high concealment and installation location unlimited. Traditional intrusion detection method relies on signal amplitude threshold. However, this method is prone to produce false positives with complex environment interference and false negatives when the leaked electromagnetic field is weak. To solve this problem, this paper, by analyzing time and frequency domain features of the intrusion and interference signals, attempts to use a time-domain analysis method to recognize the intrusion signal. Then we research on how to establish the feature model of intrusion signal, and finally we propose an intrusion signal recognition algorithm based on similarity matching. Through identifying and verifying {{a large number of}} actual sample signals, results show that the similarity matching method can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives, and improve the accuracy of alarm system...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the comprehensive {{experimental study of}} radiation characteristics of a single slot in a coaxial cable shield. The slot was realized in four different embodiments, which varied by slot orientation and length. Three orthogonal polarizations of radiated electric field were analyzed along the axis perpendicular to cable, broadside to the slot, in a broadband frequency range (80 - 1000 MHz). The analysis was based on thorough measurements of the coupling loss, which is the common parameter for the <b>leaky</b> <b>cable</b> characterization. The obtained {{results showed that the}} electric field component longitudinal to the cable axis considerably dominates over other two orthogonal components, for all four slot types. Doubling the length of the slot caused a ca. 20 dB increase of the radiated field.

The results of this experimental study clearly and visibly demonstrate the radiating slot field dependence on polarization and slot geometry in a wide frequency range.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has long}} been assumed that one {{important}} mechanism for the dissipation of local potassium gradients in the brain extracellular space is the so-called spatial buffer, generally associated with glial cells. To date, however, {{there has been no}} analytical description of the characteristic patterns of K+ clearance mediated by such a mechanism. This study reanalyzed a mathematical model of Gardner-Medwin (1983, J. Physiol. (Lond.). 335 : 393 – 426) that had previously been solved numerically. Under suitable approximations, the transient solutions for the potassium concentrations and the corresponding membrane potentials of glial cells in a finite, parallel domain were derived. The analytic results were substantiated by numerical simulations of a detailed two-compartment model. This simulation explored the dependence of spatial buffer current and extracellular K+ on the distribution of inward rectifier K+ channels in the glial endfoot and nonendfoot membranes, the glial geometric length, and the effect of passive KCl uptake. Regarding the glial cells as an equivalent <b>leaky</b> <b>cable,</b> the analyses indicated that a maximum endfoot current occurs when the glial geometric length is equal to the corresponding electrotonic space constant. Consequently, a long glial process is unsuitable for spatial buffering, unless the axial space constant can match the length of the process.
