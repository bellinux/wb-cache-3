Male Wistar rats, rendered obese by bilateral electrolytic <b>lesions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> (VMH) were subjected to 15 min swimming. Permanent cardiac catheters allowed frequent blood sampling. At rest, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), and insulin concentrations were elevated in the obese animals, whereas catecholamine levels were similar in both groups. During exercise, glucose concentrations reached higher values in the lesioned rats, whereas these animals did not display the normal FFA increment. Plasma insulin concentrations were suppressed in both groups, {{and the rate of}} suppression was very similar when expressed as percentage change from resting levels. There was no difference in plasma epinephrine responses during swimming, but the increase in norepinephrine was diminished in the obese animals. The results suggest that obesity after VMH lesion leads to reduced stimulation of lipolysis by norepinephrine and a predominant mobilization of glucose during exercise, both favoring glucose utilization and the accumulation of fat. ...|$|R

To explore this possibility, a COOH-terminal radioimmunoassay was used to measure concentrations of CCK in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and brain stem of rats and mice after a variety of nutritional manipulations. CCK, mainly in the form of its COOH-terminal octapeptide, was found to appear in rat brain shortly before birth and to increase rapidly in cortex and brain stem throughout the first 5 wk of life. Severe early undernutrition had no effect on the normal pattern of CCK development in rat brain. Adult rats deprived of food for up to 72 h and rats made hyperphagic with highly palatable diets showed no alterations in brain CCK concentrations or distribution of molecular forms of CCK as determined by Sephadex gel filtration of brain extracts.

The total blood volume of each animal exchanges approximately ten times each day, therefore, factors that are rapidly cleared from the circulation do not reach equilibrium across the parabiotic union whereas those with a long half-life achieve a uniform concentration and bioactivity in both members of a pair. Involvement of a circulating factor in the regulation of energy balance was first demonstrated when one member {{of a pair of}} parabiosed rats became hyperphagic and obese following bilateral <b>lesioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> The non-lesioned partner stopped eating, lost a large amount of weight and appeared to be responding to a circulating “satiety” factor released by the obese rat.

Studies with phenotypically similar ob/ob obese and db/db diabetic mice indicated that the obese mouse lacked a circulating signal that regulated energy balance, whereas the diabetic mouse appeared insensitive to such a signal.

Methods: Selective <b>lesions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> prefrontal cortex were made using quinolinic acid in rats previously trained on a 3 -choice serial reaction time task. Sham rats received phosphate buffered saline. Following a period of recovery, milnacipran (0 or 10 mg/kg/d x 14 days) was orally administered 60 minutes prior to testing on the 3 -choice task. After 7 days of drug cessation, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiological analysis, and morphological analysis were conducted.

The nucleus of the solitary tract and ventrolateral reticular nuclei of the medulla oblongata contained significantly (P < 0. 05) greater levels of PrRP mRNA than any hypothalamic region. Within the hypothalamus, the highest level of PrRP expression was localised to the dorsomedial aspect <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> All other hypothalamic regions exhibited significantly (P < 0. 05) lower levels of expression, including the rostral and caudal dorsomedial hypothalamus.

Similarly, PrRP expression in hypothalamic regions did not differ between lactating and non-lactating (dioestrous) animals. During validation of RT-PCR techniques we cloned and sequenced a novel splice variant of PrRP from the hypothalamus. This variant arises from alternative splicing of the donor site within exon 2, resulting in an insert of 64 base pairs and shift in the-codon:reading frame with the introduction of an early stop codon. In the hypothalamus and brainstem, mRNA expression of the variant was restricted to regions that expressed PrRP. These results suggest that PrRP expression in the hypothalamus may be more Widespread than previously reported. However, the relatively low level of PrRP in the hypothalamus and the lack of significant changes in expression during the oestrous cycle and lactation provides further evidence that PrRP is unlikely {{to be involved in the}} regulation of prolactin, secretion.

The increased Tre in the semi-restrained group during cold exposure was markedly attenuated by the systemic injection of beta-blocker (propranolol: 10 mg/kg, I. P.), indicating that this increase of Tre was caused by activation of non-shivering thermogenesis (n. s. t.). Furthermore, the rise in Tre in the semi-restrained group was preceded by a greater increase in {{the temperature of the}} interscapular brown adipose tissue. Using the autoradiographic [14 C]deoxyglucose technique, it was revealed that the enhanced n. s. t. in the no-behaviour and the semi-restrained groups was accompanied by a significant increase of metabolic activity in the anterior part <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> We conclude that during cold exposure motionlessness of slightly restrained animals increase n. s. t. when thermoregulatory behaviour to gain heat is not available. This increased n. s. t. is mediated by activation of hypothalamic function...|$|R
40|$|Aggression is {{a costly}} behavior, {{sometimes}} with severe consequences including death. Yet aggression is prevalent across animal species ranging from insects to humans, demonstrating its {{essential role in}} the survival of individuals and groups. The {{question of how the}} brain decides when to generate this costly behavior has intrigued neuroscientists for over a century and has led to the identification of relevant neural substrates. Various lesion and electric stimulation experiments have revealed that the hypothalamus, an ancient structure situated deep in the brain, is essential for expressing aggressive behaviors. More recently, studies using precise circuit manipulation tools have identified a small subnucleus in the medial hypothalamus, the ventrolateral part <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> (VMHvl), as a key structure for driving both aggression and aggression-seeking behaviors. Here, we provide an updated summary of the evidence that supports a role of the VMHvl in aggressive behaviors. We will consider our recent findings detailing the physiological response properties of populations of VMHvl cells during aggressive behaviors and provide new understanding regarding the role of the VMHvl embedded within the larger whole-brain circuit for social sensation and action...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Daily {{subcutaneous}} {{injections of}} lente insulin reduced the hypertension and bradycar-dia which developed consistently in streptozotocin diabetic rats. Insulin-treated rats also became less hyperglycemic, drank less water, and gained weight faster than untreated diabetic controls. Behavior-al and tachy card lac effects elicited by electrical stimulation <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> while the rats were awake were similar, but attendant pressor responses were larger in {{those that had}} been treated with insulin. Under subsequent urethane anesthesia, pressor and sympathetic responses to hypothalamic stimulation, as well as pressor responses to tyramine and vasopressin, were augmented in insulin-treated rats. A generalized increase in cardiovascular reactivity caused by insulin seemed unlikely since pressor responses to norepinephrine were unaltered. Enhanced hypothalamic respon-siveness was considered due to improvement of diabetic encephalopathy rather than to direct CNS stimulation by insulin because the injected insulin had mostly dissipated by the time pressor responses were recorded. By showing that insulin treatment produced changes opposite to those occurring during induction of diabetes our results suggest that insulin can alleviate cardiovascular and hypotha-lamic dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.

50|$|Having {{earned a}} Ph.D. in Physiological Chemistry at Yale in 1948 and a Doctor of Science degree in Physiology at the Sorbonne in 1950, Mayer {{accepted}} {{the offer of}} a Professorship from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1950. He would direct a laboratory in the School of Nutrition there until 1976. Its breakthrough in discovering the physiological bases of hunger and food metabolism would occur when Mayer {{and one of his}} graduate students, Norman Marshall, discovered that the body’s hunger mechanisms were controlled by the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to glucose under varying conditions. (In technical terms, their discovery was that gold thioglucose, which was known to cause obesity in mice, did so because the gold caused destruction <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> Experiments then showed that other substances containing gold components—gold thiomalate, gold thiogalactose, gold thioglycero, etc—did not have the same effect, suggesting that it was the special affinity of this portion of the hypothalamus for glucose that led first to destruction by the heavy metal and then, as a direct consequence, to obesity due to a failure of appetite regulation.) This basic insight would lead, after many more years of research and experimentation, to Mayer’s greatest contribution: the so-called glucostatic theory of the regulation of food intake.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{described}} changes in beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-ELI) in the rat brain {{in response to}} pain and stress stimuli. In order to ascertain the components of beta-ELI, brain samples of rats experiencing acute prolonged (tonic) pain were evaluated for their beta-ELI and later submitted to a chromatographic purification allowing the measurement of beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and acetyl beta-EP. The chromatographic analysis <b>of</b> both <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> (VMH) and periaqueductal grey (PAG) homogenates indicates that beta-ELI is distributed in several fractions including shortened forms of beta-EP and their respective acetylated compounds. Quantitatively, while beta-ELI in formalin-injected animals was increased by 48 % in VMH and 45 % in PAG in respect to controls, the net increase of purified beta-EP was 1100 % and 470 %, respectively, for VMH and PAG. Moreover, the maximal increase of beta-ELI was evident at 120 min, in both tissues. In contrast, the beta-EP peak was reached at 30 min in VMH and at 60 min in PAG. Acetyl beta-EP was unchanged by treatment in both central areas. No correlation of beta-ELI and beta-EP was found in VMH. These data demonstrate that the evaluation of beta-ELI gives a poor estimate of beta-EP changes, due to several components of the endorphin family...|$|R
40|$|Masculinization of the altricial rodent {{brain is}} driven by {{estrogen}} signaling during a perinatal critical period. Genetic deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (Esr 1 /ERα) results in altered hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis signaling and a dramatic reduction of male sexual and territorial behaviors. However, the role of ERα in masculinizing distinct classes of neurons remains unexplored. We deleted ERα in excitatory or inhibitory neurons using either a Vglut 2 or Vgat driver and assessed male behaviors. We find that Vglut 2 -Cre;Esr 1 lox/lox mutant males lack ERα in the ventrolateral region <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> (VMHvl) and posterior ventral portion of the medial amygdala (MePV). These mutants recapitulate the increased serum testosterone levels seen with constitutive ERα deletion, but have none of the behavioral deficits. In contrast, Vgat-Cre;Esr 1 lox/lox males with substantial ERα deletion in inhibitory neurons, {{including those of the}} principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr), posterior dorsal MeA (MePD), and medial preoptic area (MPOA) have normal testosterone levels, but display alterations in mating and territorial behaviors. These mutants also show dysmasculinized expression of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor beta (Esr 2). Our results demonstrate that ERα masculinizes GABAergic neurons that gate the display of male-typical behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have found}} a {{regional}} distribution of IL 1 / 3 mRNA and IL 1 activity in the normal adult rat brain, which reveals at least partially a colocalization with nerve growth factor (NGF). The predominantly neuronal signal patterns were found over the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the granule cells of the cerebellum, the granule and periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb, and over dispersed cells <b>of</b> the <b>ventromedial</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> and <b>of</b> the frontal cortex. In these areas also {{the highest levels of}} IL 1 activity were observed. In the striatum and septum much lower levels of IL 1 / 3 mRNA and IL 1 activity (shown for the striatum), most likely synthesized by glial cells, could be determined. IL 1 / 3 -expressing cells were mainly found in brain regions that also synthesize NGF mRNA as shown by in situ hybridization. NGF mRNA could be demonstrated over pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb and over prefrontal cortex neurons. These data indicate that IL 113, among other factors, might also play a regulatory role in the synthesis of NGF in the CNS, as has been demonstrated in the peripheral nervous system (Lindholm...|$|R
