40|$|SummarySenescence is a {{cellular}} response preventing tumorigenesis. The Ras oncogene is frequently activated or mutated in human cancers, but Ras activation {{is insufficient to}} transform primary cells. In a search for cooperating oncogenes, we identify the lysine demethylase JMJD 2 A/KDM 4 A. We show that JMJD 2 A functions as a negative regulator of Ras-induced senescence and collaborates with oncogenic Ras to promote cellular transformation by negatively regulating the p 53 pathway. We find CHD 5, a known tumor suppressor regulating p 53 activity, as a target of JMJD 2 A. The expression of JMJD 2 A inhibits Ras-mediated CHD 5 induction leading to a reduced activity of the p 53 pathway. In addition, we show that JMJD 2 A is overexpressed in mouse and human lung cancers. Depletion of JMJD 2 A in the human lung cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>A</b> 549 <b>bearing</b> <b>an</b> activated K-Ras allele triggers senescence.

40|$|In Drosophila, {{clusters}} of P transgenes (P-lac-w) display a variegating phenotype for the w marker. In addition, X-ray-induced rearrangements of chromosomes bearing such clusters {{may lead to}} enhancement of the variegated phenotype. Since P-lacZ transgenes in subtelomeric heterochromatin have some P-element repression abilities, we tested whether P-lac-w clusters also {{have the capacity to}} repress P-element activity in the germline. One cluster (T- 1), located on a rearranged chromosome (T 2; 3) and derived from <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>a</b> variegating tandem array of seven P-lac-w elements, partially represses the dysgenic sterility (GD sterility) induced by P elements. This cluster also strongly represses in trans the expression of P-lacZ elements in the germline. This latter suppression shows a maternal effect. Finally, the combination of variegating P-lac-w clusters and a single P-lacZ reporter inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatic sequences at the X chromosome telomere (cytological site 1 A) leads to strong repression of dysgenic sterility. These results show that repression of P-induced dysgenic sterility can be elicited in the absence of P elements encoding a polypeptide repressor and that a transgene cluster can repress the expression of a single homologous transgene at a nonallelic position. Implications for models of transposable element silencing are discussed...|$|R

The scale is true (k=1) on the equator so that multiplying its length on a printed map by the inverse of the RF (or principal scale) gives the actual circumference of the Earth. The bar scale on the map is also drawn at the true scale so that transferring a separation between two points on the equator to the bar scale will give the correct distance between those points.

40|$|Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) {{stress is}} an important pathway to cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously demonstrated that ER stress is linked to neurotoxicity associated with formation of inclusions of mutant Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1). Cells bearing mutant inclusions undergo mitochondrial apoptotic signalling. Here, we demonstrate that the BH 3 -only protein, Bim, is a direct link between ER stress and mitochondrial apoptosis. In the murine neuroblastoma cell <b>line,</b> Neuro 2 <b>a,</b> <b>bearing</b> mutant SOD 1 inclusions, indicators of both ER stress and apoptosis are expressed.
