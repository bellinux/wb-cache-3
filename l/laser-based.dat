5|$|The {{base model}} Su-25 {{incorporates}} {{a number of}} key avionics systems. It has no TV guidance but includes a distinctive nose-mounted laser rangefinder, that is thought to provide for <b>laser-based</b> target finding. A DISS-7 doppler radar is used for navigation; the Su-25 can fly at night, in visual and instrument meteorological conditions.|$|E
5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for <b>laser-based</b> surgery.|$|E

25|$|Theodor W. HÃ¤nsch and John L. Hall shared {{half of the}} 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics for {{contributions}} {{to the development of}} <b>laser-based</b> precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency-comb technique. The other half of the prize was awarded to Roy Glauber.|$|E
25|$|Laser-assisted NPDS is {{performed}} {{with the use of}} a CO2 laser system. The <b>laser-based</b> system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.|$|E
25|$|The UOMZ 101KS Atoll {{electro-optical}} system includes the 101KS-V infra-red search and track turret {{mounted on the}} starboard side {{in front of the}} cockpit. This sensor can detect, identify, and track multiple airborne targets simultaneously. The 101KS-O infrared countermeasure system has sensors housed in turrets mounted on the dorsal spine and forward fuselage and uses <b>laser-based</b> countermeasures against heat-seeking missiles. The Atoll complex also includes the 101KS-U ultraviolet missile warning sensors and 101KS-N navigation and targeting pod.|$|E
25|$|The National Ignition Facility, or NIF, {{is a large}} <b>laser-based</b> {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) research device, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress {{a small amount of}} hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place. NIF's mission is to achieve fusion ignition with high energy gain, and to support nuclear weapon maintenance and design by studying the behavior of matter under the conditions found within nuclear weapons. NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.|$|E
25|$|ELPJ, a Japanese-based company, sells a laser {{turntable}} {{that uses}} a laser to read vinyl discs optically, without physical contact. The laser turntable eliminates record wear {{and the possibility of}} accidental scratches, which degrade the sound, but its expense limits use primarily to digital archiving of analog records, and the laser does not play back colored vinyl or picture discs. Various other <b>laser-based</b> turntables were tried during the 1990s, but while a laser reads the groove very accurately, since it does not touch the record, the dust that vinyl attracts due to static electric charge is not mechanically pushed out of the groove, worsening sound quality in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Directorate {{announced}} a new manufacturing method for use producing the turbine exhaust casing for the F119 jet engine used on the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter which will result in an estimated savings of 35% of the cost while also improving the durability. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, the Directorate helped develop a new <b>laser-based</b> ultrasonic scanner to inspect composite parts also for use on the F-22. The Directorate also developed an advanced thermoplastic composite material {{for use in the}} landing gear doors on the F-22. In 2008, the Air Force announced that the Directorate had developed a method of using fabric made of fiber optic material in a friend or foe identification system.|$|E
25|$|The Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland AFB, North Oscura Peak on White Sands Missile Range, and the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing {{observatory}} (AMOS) {{are also}} operated by {{divisions of the}} Directed Energy Directorate {{in addition to their}} facilities at the Directorate's headquarters at Kirtland AFB. The Starfire Optical Range is used to research various topics of advanced tracking using lasers as well as studies of atmospheric physics which examines atmospheric effects which can distort laser beams. North Oscura Peak is used to research the various technologies necessary to facilitate successful tracking and destruction of an incoming missile via a laser and is used frequently for <b>laser-based</b> missile defense tests. AMOS provides space observation capabilities and computational resources to AFRL, the Department of Defense and other agencies of the US Government.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission was}} {{furthermore}} the third {{flight of the}} TriDAR sensor package designated DTO-701A (Detailed Test Objective), a 3D dual-sensing laser camera, intended for use as an autonomous rendezvous and docking sensor. It was developed by Neptec Design Group and funded by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency. TriDAR had previously flown on STS-128 and STS-131, aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. TriDAR provides guidance {{information that can be}} used for rendezvous and docking operations in orbit, planetary landings and vehicle inspection/navigation of unmanned rovers. It does not rely on any reference markers, such as reflectors, positioned on the target spacecraft, instead using a <b>laser-based</b> 3D sensor and a thermal imager. Geometric information contained in successive 3D images is matched against the known shape of the target object to calculate its position and orientation in real-time.|$|E
25|$|The F1AZ was {{developed}} in conjunction with Dassault and the SAAF as a dedicated ground attack variant. The F1AZs were delivered between November 1975 and October 1976 and were assigned to 1 Squadron. Paramount Group, a South African-based company owns the intellectual property for the Mirage F1AZ. The F1AZ has a <b>laser-based</b> rangefinder, permitting the highly accurate fusing and aiming of unguided munitions, such as bombs and rockets. Optical design was by the Optics (later ELOPTRO) division of Armscor in South Africa. Despite their retirement in 1997, {{the accuracy of the}} F1AZ's armament delivery is still considered classified information by the SAAF; analysis by informed news services (e.g., Jane's Defence Weekly) and pilot reports (e.g., Commandant Dick Lord, 'Vlamgat', 1999) conclude that the F1AZ has accuracies within the order disclosed by the USAF for their F-15E Strike Eagle in unguided ballistic mode.|$|E
25|$|For a robot to {{associate}} behaviors with a place (localization) requires it {{to know where}} it is {{and to be able to}} navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based triangulation. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created CAD floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' PatrolBot and autonomous wheelchair, both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own <b>laser-based</b> maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to different backgrounds and histories, {{each of the}} races have characteristic philosophies of starship design. Minmatar ships tend to be quite fast but fragile, and rely on their high speed maneuverability to evade the tracking systems of heavier weapons, while themselves using projectile weapons such as artillery or autocannons, more sophisticated kin to today's munitions technology. Amarr ships are ponderous and densely armored and pack batteries of powerful <b>laser-based</b> energy weaponry. Gallente ships are sleek and well designed and armored and specialize in deploying fleets of robotic drones while mounting hybrid weapons that operate using superconducting magnets to accelerate mass toward targets at great speed (see Railgun). Finally, Caldari ships are typically poorly armored and not particularly fast but utilize powerful energy shields, and make extensive use of torpedo/missile launchers and hybrid guns, favoring engagement at extreme ranges. However, there are exceptions to these general rules in each race.|$|E
25|$|Any real {{measuring}} instrument has a limited range over {{which it can}} accurately measure absorbance. An instrument must be calibrated and checked against known standards if the readings are to be trusted. Many instruments will become non-linear (fail to follow the BeerâLambert law) starting at approximately 2 AU (~1% transmission). It is also difficult to accurately measure very small absorbance values (below 10â4) with commercially available instruments for chemical analysis. In such cases, <b>laser-based</b> absorption techniques can be used, since they have demonstrated detection limits that supersede those obtained by conventional non-laser-based instruments by many orders of magnitude (detections have been demonstrated {{all the way down}} to 5 Ã 10â13). The theoretical best accuracy for most commercially available non-laser-based instruments is in the range near 1 AU. The path length or concentration should then, when possible, be adjusted to achieve readings near this range.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 {{features}} {{a range of}} customizable avionics systems, dependent on customer selection and purpose. On some models, French firm Thales Group provides {{various parts of the}} avionics, such as the glass cockpit, full-colour multifunction displays, tactical mission and encrypted communication systems, the TopOwl helmet-mounted sight/display, IFF and autonomous navigation systems, and the electrical power generation system. Other systems include a forward looking infrared (FLIR), weather radar, digital map generation system, enhanced ground proximity warning system, personal locator system, and VHF/UHF/HF tactical radios. In 2015, the NH90 became the first helicopter to receive an <b>laser-based</b> airborne collision avoidance system. Onboard mission systems feature a dual-redundant databus, are compliant with MIL-STD 1553, and are comprehensively managed via sensor fusion functionality. Customer demand for future avionics improvements such as new data links and communication systems, as well as additional electro-optical sensors, have been anticipated by the manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|Phoenix was a {{partnership}} of universities, NASA centers, and the aerospace industry. The science instruments and operations were a University of Arizona responsibility. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, managed {{the project and}} provided mission design and control. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, Colorado, built and tested the spacecraft. The Canadian Space Agency provided a meteorological station, including an innovative <b>Laser-based</b> atmospheric sensor. The co-investigator institutions included Malin Space Science Systems (California), Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (Germany), NASA Ames Research Center (California), NASA Johnson Space Center (Texas), MDA (Canada), Optech Incorporated (Canada), SETI Institute, Texas A University, Tufts University, University of Colorado, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), University of Michigan, University of NeuchÃ¢tel (Switzerland), University of Texas at Dallas, University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis, and York University (Canada). Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Bristol provided hardware for the mission and {{were part of the}} team operating the microscope station.|$|E
25|$|Rochester is {{a leading}} private {{university}} and a major center for diverse fields of research. The university has eight Nobel Prize winners among its faculty and alumni. The university consistently ranks among the top 40 colleges and universities nationwide in federally financed science, engineering, medical, and other research, with a total research budget of around $395 million spread across many departments and research centers, including the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, a <b>laser-based</b> nuclear fusion facility, and the extensive research facilities at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Recently, the university has also engaged {{in a series of}} new initiatives to expand its programs in biomedical engineering and optics, including the construction of the new $37 million Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics on the River Campus. Other new research initiatives include a cancer stem cell program and a Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. UR also has the ninth highest technology revenue among U.S. higher education institutions, with $46 million being paid for commercial rights to university technology and research in 2009. Notable patents include Zoloft and Gardasil. WeBWorK, a web-based system for checking homework and providing immediate feedback for students, was developed by University of Rochester professors Gage and Pizer. The system is now in use at over 800 universities and colleges, as well as several secondary and primary schools. Rochester scientists work in diverse areas; for example, physicists developed a technique for etching metal surfaces, such as platinum, titanium and brass, with powerful lasers, enabling self-cleaning surfaces that repel water droplets and will not rust if tilted at a 4 degree angle; and medical researchers are exploring how brains rid themselves of toxic waste during sleep.|$|E
500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memesâsuch as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if {{you thought you were}} sick of the memes, I was sick of it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers did not try to predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because if you do it probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a <b>laser-based</b> engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
