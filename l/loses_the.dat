5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it <b>loses</b> <b>the</b> ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south.

For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer <b>loses</b> <b>the</b> fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
