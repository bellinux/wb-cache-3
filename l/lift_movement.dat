40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of a}} piston engine driven by compressed air. The compressed air engine was a modified 100 cm 3 internal combustion engine obtained from a motorcycle manufacturer. The experiments in this study used a test bench to examine the power performance and pressure/temperature variations of the compressed air engine at pressures ranging from 5 to 9 bar (absolute pressure). The engine was modified from a 4 -stroke to a 2 -stroke engine using a cam system driven by a crankshaft and the intake and exhaust valves have a small lift due to this modification. The highest power output of 0. 95 kW was obtained at 9 bar and 1320 rpm. The highest torque of 9. 99 N·m occurred at the same pressure, but at 465 rpm. The pressure-volume (P-V) diagram shows that cylinder pressure gradually increases after the intake valve opens because of the limited <b>lift</b> <b>movement</b> of the intake valve. Similar situations occurred during the exhaust process, restricting the power output of the compressed air engine. The pressure and temperature variation of the air at engine inlet and outlet were recorded during the experiment. The outlet pressure increased from 1. 5 bar at 500 rpm to 2. 25 bar at 2000 rpm, showing the potential of recycling the compressed air energy by attaching additional cylinders (split-cycle engine). A temperature decrease (from room temperature to 17 °C) inside the cylinder was observed. It {{should be noted that}} pressures higher than that currently employed can result in lower temperatures and this can cause poor lubrication and sealing issues. The current design of a compressed air engine, which uses a conventional cam mechanism for intake and exhaust, has limited <b>lift</b> <b>movement</b> during operation, and has a restricted flow rate and power output. Fast valve actuation and a large lift are essential for improving the performance of the current compressed air engine.

Hydrogen {{can not be used}} directly in a diesel engine due to its autoignition temperature higher than that of diesel fuel. One alternative method is to use hydrogen in enrichment or induction. To investigate the combustion characteristics of this dual fuel engine, a single cylinder diesel research engine was converted to utilize hydrogen as fuel.

Introducing hydrogen to the combustion chamber reduced the diesel fuel consumption. Indicated efficiency slightly increases with hydrogen enrichment at 15 Nm load.

40|$|Human {{balance in}} stance is usually {{defined as the}} {{preservation}} of the vertical projection of the center of mass (COM) on the support area formed by the feet. Under microgravity conditions, the control of equilibrium seems to be no longer required. However, several reports indicate preservation of COM control in tasks such as arm or leg raising, tiptoe standing, or trunk bending. It is still unclear whether COM control is also maintained in complex multijoint movements during short term exposure to microgravity. In the current study, the dynamics of equilibrium control were studied in four subjects performing two series of seven whole-body <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> under microgravity during parabolic flights. The aims of the study were to examine whether the trajectory of horizontal COM motion during <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> changes in short-term exposure to microgravity and whether there is any sign of recovery after several <b>lifting</b> <b>movements.</b> It was found that, compared with control movements under normal gravity, the horizontal position of the COM was shifted backward during the entire <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> in all subjects. In the second series of <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> under microgravity, a partial recovery of the COM trajectory toward the normal gravity situation was found. Under microgravity, angles of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar joints differed significantly from the angles found under normal gravity. Recovery of joint angular trajectories in the second series of <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> mainly occurred for those angles that could contribute to a reduction of the backward COM shift. It is to be pointed out that COM control under microgravity is not redundant but functional. Persisting COM control under microgravity may be required for pure mechanical reasons, since rotational movements of the body are dependent on adequate control of the COM position with respect to external forces. It is shown that, from a mechanical perspective, subjects can benefit from a backward displacement of the COM in the downward as well as the upward phase of the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> under microgravity...|$|R

40|$|Asymmetric lifting is {{associated}} with an increased risk of low back disorders. Especially in <b>lifting</b> <b>movements,</b> characterized by a small amount of asymmetry, it is still the question if asymmetric lumbosacral torques occur, or if subjects try to avoid asymmetric back loading by twisting their pelvis with respect to the feet. An increase of the lifting speed or the box weight might amplify the lumbar torques but might also result in an attempt to limit further increase of asymmetric torques by increasing pelvic twist. In the current study, asymmetrical <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> were analyzed {{with the aid of a}} 3 D linked segment model, using cuffs mounted to the body segments. Eight subjects performed <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> with five different asymmetry conditions, ranging from 0 to 90 °lifting asymmetry with respect to the sagittal plane, using two lifting speeds and two box weights. A significant increase in lateral flexing and twisting low back torque was found for each increase in asymmetry of the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement.</b> Pelvic twist accounted more or less constantly for about 25 % of the lifting asymmetry and was hardly influenced by lifting speed or box weight. Even for 10 or 30 °of lifting asymmetry, subjects did not twist their pelvis far enough to avoid asymmetric loading of the low back. Assuming that asymmetric loading of the low back is more strenuous to the spine than symmetric loading, the current results indicate that even small deviations of a <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> from the sagittal plane can explain an increased risk of low back disorders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{simulate}} several levels of lifting strategies from parameters depending on the subject’s centre of mass movements. Usually, symmetrical lifting strategies were categorized in two major solutions (Chaffin and Andersson, 1991) : the squat lift that mainly involves a knee flexion and the back lift that mainly involves hip flexions. In the literature two main indexes (Zhang et al. 2000) were introduced to evaluate the natural selected strategy. These indexes either did not take all the articulations into account or did not consider the evolution of posture depending on time. We propose a new index based on kinematic simulation obtained through a blending of the two extreme strategies. This work was based on the motion blending technique introduced in computer animation (Witkin and Popovic, 1995). To parameterise this simulation method, five squat lifts, five back lifts and five freestyle lifts were performed by one subject. A para sagittal model with five body segments was used to describe the posture of the subject. We captured the angular trajectories of the different lifts to abstract the natural <b>lift</b> <b>movement</b> as a blending of the two extreme strategies. To this end, a blending coefficient, considered as the strategy index, was introduced to minimize the set of control parameters of such a model. Indeed, instead of specifying a blending coefficient to each joint separately, we introduced a unique blending coefficient based on the displacement of the centre of mass. This choice enabled us to use only a force plate system to generate the inputs of our model. Hence, the angular trajectorie...|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationships between the static electromyographic (EMG) activities of trunk muscles and the angles of trunk flexion in a range of positions. Previous authors have reported trunk muscle activation patterns during the stoop <b>lift</b> <b>movement</b> when trunk position changes relative to an external reference. When bending to prepare for a stoop lift, trunk flexor torque due to upper body weight increases as the trunk is flexed. In this study trunk flexor torque was constant because the upper body was maintained in a horizontal position while the lower body was strapped to a board whose inclination was varied between the horizontal and vertical positions in 10 ° increments. The length of the trunk flexor muscles increased as the trunk was flexed. Twenty young adults (10 male and 10 female) performed a total of 20 isometric contractions; 2 trials in each of 10 different postures while surface EMG of their vertebral extensor (erectores spinae and multifidi) and hip extensor (gluteus maximus and the hamstrings) muscles were recorded bilaterally. There were no significant differences between the normalised EMG values from the right and left sides, indicating that the tasks were performed symmetrically. As the trunk was flexed from 0 o (lower body horizontal) to 90 ° (lower body vertical), the EMG of the vertebral extensor muscles reduced to 50 % of their initial values, while the hip extensor muscles reduced to 20 % of their initial values. Only 4 of the subjects (all male) exhibited flexion-relaxation of the erectores spinae muscles within the range of 0 – 90 °, however all 20 subjects exhibited myoelectric silence of the vertebral extensors at full trunk flexion. The results for all muscles indicate a gradual change from active trunk stabilisation to an increasing contribution from the connective tissue structures. The contributing structures to the passive resistance to vertebral flexion include the thoracolumbar fascia, erector spinae aponeurosis, postvertebral ligaments, and the posterior annulus. It is mainly the connective tissue components of the hip extensor muscles that contribute to passive pelvic stabilisation because all the hip ligaments become slack during hip flexion...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of <b>lifting</b> <b>{{movement}}s,</b> the trunk movement is surprisingly resistant to perturbations. This study examined which factors contribute to this perturbation resistance of the trunk during lifting. Three possible mechanisms were studied: force-length-velocity characteristics of muscles, the momentum of the trunk as well as the effect of passive extending of the elbows. A forward dynamics modelling and simulation approach was adopted with two different input signals: (1) stimulation of Hill-type muscles versus (2) net joint moments. Experimental data collected during an unperturbed <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> were used as a reference, which a simulated <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> had to resemble. Subsequently, the simulated <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> was perturbed by applying 10 kg extra mass at the wrist (both before and after lift-off and with/without a fixed elbow), without modifying the input signals. The momentum of the trunk appeared to be insufficient to explain the perturbation resistance of trunk movements as found experimentally. In addition to the momentum of the trunk, the force-length-velocity characteristics of the muscles are necessary to account for the observed perturbation resistance. Initial extension of the elbow due to the mass perturbation delayed the propagation of the load to the shoulder. However, this delay is reduced due to the impedance at the elbow provided by the characteristics of muscles spanning the elbow. So, the force-length-velocity characteristics of the muscles spanning the elbow joint increase the perturbation at the trunk. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|In {{ergonomics}} research, two-dimensional (2 -D) biomechanical {{models are}} often used to study the mechanical loading of the low back in <b>lifting</b> <b>movements.</b> When <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> are asymmetric, errors of unknown size may be introduced in a 2 -D analysis.

The main cause of this underestimation was a pelvic twist, resulting in an erroneous projection of a pelvic marker on to the sagittal plane due to pelvic twist.

In most individual cases SIPs are derived from extrapolation of known SIPs of a certain population through regression equations (proportional models).

In the current study five males and five females performed four different <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> in the sagittal plane. A full body linked segment model was applied twice to the same data set, once using a proportional and once using a geometric anthropometric model. As a full body linked segment model is an overdetermined system of equations, four equations could be formed to test the summed effect of SIP errors on the inverse dynamic analysis. The overall performance in terms of coefficients of correlation was better for the geometric model as compared to the proportional model. When a back <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> was performed, the equations indicated systematic errors in the proportional model.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the study was to investigate: 1) whether motor {{programming}} as a role in perpetuating muscle imbalance and 2) if subjects with tight hip f lexors demonstrate hyperactivity of the erector spinae musculature. Subjects. From 254 potential subjects, 16 subjects who met the criteria for "loose hip" and 16 for "tight hip" flexors were selected. Subjects were selected who varied 1. 5 sd from the mean on measures standardized for this study using an inclinometer. Methods. Subjects performed two movements: 1) voluntary lift; and 2) isometric hold, while in a hip extended or hip flexed prone position. Surface EMG was taken at the right and left erector spinae, right gluteus maximus and right hamstring. Dependent variables taken from the EMG were: 1) duration of muscle onset sequence (DMOS) - the time between the onsets of the first and fourth muscles; 2) latency of the erector spinae muscles (LES latency and RES latency) -the time between muscle onset and movement onset, and 3) early amplitude of the erector spinae (EAC) - average percent MVC during 0. 4 sec after muscle onset minus average percent MVC during 0. 1 sec prior to muscle onset. Data Analysis. The research design was a 2 X 2 X 2 repeated measures. Therefore, a three-way multi-variate analysis (MANOVA) was used. Results. A three-way interaction was found for DMOS. The difference was between the loose and tight hip subjects for the lifting movement in the flexed hip position (p < 0. 0004). This suggests that the muscle activation of the back and hip extensors is different in these two populations when hip tension is altered, but only for the <b>lift</b> <b>movement.</b> A main effect of movement (p < 0. 01) was found for LES latency. There was no main effect for hip type. For EAC there was a significant movement by position 2 -way interaction (p < 0. 016), and no main effect for hip type. Conclusion. It does not appear that motor programming has a role in perpetuating this particular muscle imbalance and that subjects with tight hip flexors do not demonstrate hyperactivity of the erector spinae musculature. Clinical Relevance. This research seems to support Kendall's suggestion that muscle behaviors respond more to immediate external mechanical changes rather than constant internal mechanical differences. Hasson, Scott M.

40|$|Individuals usually {{report for}} two objects of equal mass but {{different}} volume {{that the larger}} object feels lighter. This so-called size-weight illusion has been investigated {{for more than a}} century. The illusion is accompanied by increased forces, used to lift the larger object, resulting in a higher initial lifting speed and acceleration. The illusion holds when subjects know that the mass of the two objects is equal and it is likely that this also counts for the enlarged initial effort in lifting a larger box. Why should this happen? Under microgravity, subjects might be able to eliminate largely the weight-related component of the lifting force. Then, if persistent upward scaling of the weight-related force component had been the main cause of the elevated initial lifting force under normal gravity, this elevated force might disappear under microgravity. On the other hand, the elevated initial lifting effort in the large box would be preserved if it had been caused mainly by a persistent upward scaling of the force component, necessary to accelerate the object. To test whether the elevated initial lifting effort either persists or disappears under microgravity, a lifting experiment was carried out during brief periods of microgravity in parabolic flights. Subjects performed whole-body <b>lift</b> ing <b>movements</b> with their feet strapped {{to the floor of the}} aircraft, using two 8 -kg boxes of different volume.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the size-weight illusion {{is related to the}} manner in which objects are lifted.

A consistent coordination between knee, hip, and lumbar vertebral joints during lifting was described through calculation of the relative phase between adjacent joints and found to be exaggerated with increases in load mass. During the early phase of lifting, knee extension leads hip extension, which in turn leads extension of the lumbar vertebral joints. Early in the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement,</b> when load acceleration is greatest, the erectores spinae are thus relatively long and shortening slowly.

Such a long-term force profile, formed through repeated experiences with similar objects, has been proposed to improve manipulative performance. Skillful object manipulation is crucial for many animals, particularly those that rely on tools for foraging. However, despite enduring interest in tool use in non-human animals, there has been very little investigation {{of their ability to}} form an expectation about an object’s weight.

Especially the determination of the trunk COM is prone to error. In the current study five subjects maintained three postures, differing in trunk angle, during a few seconds.

A highly significant correlation was found between the maximum rates of the load force, grip force and COP displacement rate. Different loads also influenced the onset of the COP displacement. The results corroborate the idea that the same memory representations which are used to control the manipulative <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> also control the APAs.

30|$|The size of containerships is {{increasing}} continuously. The newest generation {{is able to}} carry almost 20, 000 TEU. Container terminals are under high pressure to handle ships {{as fast as possible}} against a low price, to improve their competitive position. However, when more and more STS cranes are simultaneously executing a <b>lifting</b> <b>movement,</b> peak demand and energy-related costs increase. For an intermediate container terminal with eight STS quay cranes, the peak-related costs can account for up to 25 – 30 % of total energy costs. The energy consumption model and rules of operation developed show the opportunities for container terminals to reduce these peak-related costs, while monitoring the consequences for handling time. This could save a terminal tens of thousands of euros per year.|$|R
