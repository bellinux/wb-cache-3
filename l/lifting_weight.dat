5000|$|An {{extension}} spring counterbalance system {{consists of a}} pair of stretched springs running parallel to the horizontal tracks. The springs lift the door through a system of pulleys and counterbalance cables running from the bottom corner brackets through the pulleys. When the door is raised, the springs contract, thus lifting the door as the tension is released. Typically these springs are made of 11 gauge galvanized steel, and the lengths of these springs are based on the height of the garage door in question. Their <b>lifting</b> <b>weight</b> capacity can best be identified by the color that is painted on the ends of the springs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to assess the overall fatigue of human body movement. First of all, {{according}} to previous research regarding localized muscular fatigue, a linear relation is assumed between the mean frequency and the muscular working time when the muscle is experiencing fatigue. This assumption is verified with a rigorous statistical analysis. Based on this proven linearity, localized muscular fatigue is simplified as a linear model. Furthermore, localized muscular fatigue is considered a dynamic process and, hence, the localized fatigue levels are tracked by updating the parameters with the most current surface electromyogram (sEMG) measurements. Finally, an overall fatigue level is computed by fusing localized muscular fatigue levels. The developed fatigue-tracking system is evaluated with two fatigue experiments (in which 10 male subjects and seven female subjects participated), including holding self-weight (dip start position training) and <b>lifting</b> <b>weight</b> with one arm (arm curl training) ...|$|E
40|$|Crawler cranes {{are part}} of mobile cranes family that have complex {{structure}} with big dimensions, and high security requests. They work mostly in open environment. Their main role is <b>lifting</b> <b>weight,</b> transporting it to a distance and delivering it in a location which can be in a ground, higher or lower. They can move translational and rotate around its axes. One of main components is the boom, which can move up-down in form of rotational movement. On the boom is the hoist system with cables, ending with hook or some other grabbing device. In this workshop, {{we are going to}} simulate the work of crawler crane while lifting-lowering the boom system when fully engaged with load, which hangs in some height. The aim is to see the effects of dynamic forces (or moments) in the crane’s construction and stability during this work cycle, particularly at the start and end of the motion. To do this study, we designed “virtual crawler crane ” using model design and simulation application Visual Nastran [3], and did simulations. Crane is designed based on manuals of standard manufacturers...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a power <b>lifting</b> <b>weight</b> training program on the dynamic strength, static strength and body composition of college females. Thirteen college females volunteered for the study. The subjects trained three days per week for a total of nine weeks which consisted of a two week preconditioning period followed by a seven week heavy resistance power lifting training period. Dynamic strength tests were administered at the beginning of the seven week training period, at two mid-training dates and at the end of the training period. Static strength and body composition were measured prior to the pre-conditioning period and at the end of the strength training period. The test data were statistically treated using a paired t-test, a Student's t-test for independent samples, one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe's test. The. 05 level of significance was selected for accepting or rejecting the null hypotheses. The results of the imposed training program revealed a significant increase in dynamic strength. Changes in static strength varied with the muscle group tested. Shoulder flexion strength increased significantly, but trunk flexion and knee extension strength did not appreciably change over the training period. Alterations in body composition also varied following the training program. Lean body mass did not increase significantly, whereas a slight, but significant increase was found in the body weight of the subjects. The results of this study have several implications towards physical training for females...|$|E
40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} shown that inconsistently applied {{normalization}} for body size could be an important methodological problem in testing physical performance in areas such as sports, physical education, ergonomy, or physical medicine and rehabilitation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a part of the recently proposed classification of physical performance tests (Jaric 2003) based on the role of body size in the tested performance. Presuming a normalization method Pn=P/S b based on an allometric relationship between the tested perfor-mance P and a selected index of body size S (Pn per-formance normalized for body size; b allometric parameter), we specifically hypothesized that: (1) the tests of exertion of external force (e. g., <b>lifting</b> <b>weight,</b> pushing, pulling), (2) tests of rapid movements (jumping, sprinting, kicking) and (3) tests of supporting body weight (chin-ups, squats) would reveal the values of the allometric parameters b= 0. 67, b= 0 and b= 0. 33 when body size is expressed as body mass, or b= 2, b= 0 and b= 1 when body size is expressed as body height, respectively. Male physical education students (n= 77) were tested on 18 standard physical performance tests belonging to the aforementioned three groups. The ob-tained values of the allometric parameters proved to be closely in line with the hypothesized ones. While the finding regarding the tests of exertion of external force (i. e., the tested force should be divided by m 0. 67 in order to normalize the force for body size) have been already demonstrated by some authors, the findings related to the tests of rapid movements and, particularly, tests of supporting body weight are novel. Although the normalization methods discussed need further evalua-tion, a more accurate and consistently applied assess-ment of the body size-independent indices of the evaluated groups of standard tests could improve the methodology of physical performance testing in general...|$|E
