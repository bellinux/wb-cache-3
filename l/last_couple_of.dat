5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} in the <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, {{as well as other}} mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important in the <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters {{and at the same time}} not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E
5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within the <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, {{and the number of}} pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} belief that DAB is more {{expensive}} to transmit than FM.

Typically, the <b>last</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the pupfish {{is the most}} prolonged, and several eggs are laid in succession. After copulation, both fish lie in the substrate, and after about 2 seconds, the male will contact the female again. If the female is finished spawning, she will flee in a “panicky” style with the male in pursuit. This chase lasts for about 5 minutes before the male swims {{to the bottom and}} both fish begin foraging.|$|R
