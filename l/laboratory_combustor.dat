40|$|The {{spectra of}} {{pressure}} oscillations in combustion chambers often contain large peaks at frequencies corresponding to chamber acoustic modes. Pulsed combustors {{are designed to}} operate with fixed amplitude oscillations but in many systems the oscillations have undesirable consequences. An understanding of the nonlinear mechanisms responsible for the limiting-amplitude behavior is therefore desired. This paper {{is divided into two}} parts. First, characterization of the oscillations in terms of attractors in mathematical phase space has been performed on pressure signals measured in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>combustor</b> of premixed gases. The results for one set of operating conditions show a quasiperiodic attractor of dimension two over an order of magnitude of scales. Next, the nonlinear combustion response to oscillations of a single acoustic mode are used to model autonomous or 'self-excited' behavior. Two simple models of nonlinear combustion processes observed in the <b>laboratory</b> <b>combustor</b> result in unstable oscillations that reach limiting-amplitudes. With the variation of model parameters, the periodic limit cycles undergo subharmonic bifurcations and transition to chaos...|$|E

40|$|Combustion-generated fine particles, {{defined as}} those with {{aerodynamic}} diameters less than 2. 5 lm, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny because of suspected links to adverse human health effects. Whereas classical theories regarding coal combustion suggest that mechanisms of ash vaporization and fragmentation lead to bimodal ash particle size distributions (PSDs), this paper presents experimental results supporting other existing hypotheses that three distinct ash modes may be more appropriate. This paper focuses on the existence and generality of a central mode, between approximately 0. 7 and 3. 0 lm diameter. This central mode is presumably caused by fragmentation mechanisms, but is still important from a health perspective, because a large portion is contained within the 2. 5 lm particle size fraction. Presented here are experimental results from two different <b>laboratory</b> <b>combustors</b> and one industrial boiler, all burning pulverized coals. Use {{of a variety of}} particle-sampling and size classification methods, including electrical mobility, time-of-flight, and inertial (low-pressure impaction) methods, confirms that the central mode is not an artifact of the particle-sampling and-sizing methods used. Results from the combustion of 10 different coals consistently show that this central mode is significant for both high- and low-rank coals.

The second step consisted in applying System Identification techniques to experimental data in order to validate the model and estimate its parameters. The application of these techniques to experimental data under different operating conditions allowed us to determine the functional dependence of the model parameters upon changes in an experimental control parameter.

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of an internal}} feedback mechanism which leads to combustion instability inside a small scale <b>laboratory</b> <b>combustor</b> is presented in this paper. During combustion instability, the experimental findings show that a large vortical structure is formed at an acoustic resonant mode of the system. The subsequent unsteady burning, within the vortex as it is convected downstream, feeds energy into the acoustic field and sustains the large resonant oscillations. These vortices are formed when the acoustic velocity fluctuation at the flameholder is a large fraction of the mean flow velocity. The propagation of these vortices is not a strong function of the mean flow speed {{and appears to be}} dependent upon the frequency of the instability.

The fact that the techniques are optical facilitates performing the measurements without impinging upon the measurement object, such as the combustion event that can be involved.

The thesis also deals with the different types of equipment that can be taken advantage of and methods that can be employed to achieve measurements that are called for, as well as the basic theories behind the analyze that are performed. The thesis is structured, in brief, as follows:After the introduction, in which the need of combustion-related research is emphasized, important equipment and the basic principles behind its use are considered. In order to perform optical diagnostics, a light source of some sort is required. The chapter concerned with equipment is then introduced with information regarding the lasers employed in the thesis work. To be able to detect any signal induced by the light source involved, a suitable detector is needed. The basic principles of the different detectors employed are taken up, and the different measurement objects that the optical diagnostic techniques have been applied to, i. e. the <b>laboratory</b> <b>combustors</b> and the optical engines involved, are discussed. After measurements have been performed, the digital information acquired needs to be processed and analyzed. The information obtained is dealt with in post-processing steps, as they are called. Accordingly, basic knowledge of the tools employed in the image-post-processing work carried out is provided. The Equipment chapter concludes with a discussion of some sort of the basic theories behind various statistical quantities that can be involved in the post-processing of the data that has been collected. In order to draw adequate conclusions {{on the basis of the}} data that has been obtained and analyzed, comprehensive knowledge of the underlying theories connected with the methods employed, including those for inducing the signals that were detected, is of central importance.

Large eddy simulation (LES), in which the large-scale flow is resolved on the grid, leaving only the small-scale flow to be modeled, provides a natural framework for combustion simulations as the transient na-ture of the flow is resolved.

To better {{understand some of the}} factors that affect the performance of biomass combustors, both theoretical and experimental studies are undertaken on laboratory scale burners. The present study provides an overview of the methodologies employed to model laboratory-scale fixed-bed combustors. This thesis contributes to Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling of evaporation for different single biomass particles and also experimental application of different secondary air flow rates, configurations and positions on the particulate and gaseous emissions of combustors. The overview covers a wide range of biomass combustion topics ranging from modelling and experimental studies of both single and packed bed <b>combustors</b> particularly for <b>laboratory</b> scale fixed-bed systems. It also includes treatment of the fundamental thermo-physical fuel characteristics that should be considered when undertaking macro-scale (bed-level) modelling. The work concludes with overall observations on the modelling of fixed-bed combustion as well as opportunities for further research to resolve specific challenges. The evolution of various single biomass particles during the drying process is investigated to achieve a deeper understanding of their thermal behaviour. The two most conventional models; Arrhenius and Heat sink models have been employed for modelling several single biomass particles in simulations using Ansys-Fluent 15 software (Research version). Several sub-models are implemented in a commercial CFD code to simulate two different evaporation models. To predict transient evolution of wood composition (moisture and dry wood); the transport equations (energy and moisture evaporation) are modelled to assess reaction, heat loss, effective thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and radiative and convective heat transfers between the particle and surrounding environment. The developed models show close agreement with a set of previous works (experimental and numerical). The results indicate that the geometric shape of the particle and the external boundaries that are exposed to radiation and convection strongly influences the evaporation process. The results of this study will be used to model the drying process in fixed-bed combustion (future studies). Secondly, an experimental study of the effect of air staging distribution and position on particulate emissions in a <b>laboratory</b> scale biomass <b>combustor</b> is performed. Detailed analyse of the temperature in primary and post combustion zones, burning rate, and PM emissions in a fixed-bed <b>laboratory</b> scale <b>combustor</b> are undertaken. Two different secondary air distribution designs, uniform and nonuniform secondary air distribution system, for two different positions are assembled above the bed. The contribution of temperature, secondary air flow rates, configuration and distance from the bed level into burning rate, outflow heat, CO and PM concentrations are investigated. Uniform distribution of secondary air flow rate results in remarkable decrease in particulate matters (PM) and 50 % CO emissions. The air staging strategies have been employed to study the effect of burning rate, temperature in primary and post combustion zones, and formation of NO, CO and PM emissions, taking into account the air to fuel stoichiometric ratio.

The strong interaction between the aerodynamics-combustion-acoustic oscillations (ACA), and under specific conditions the aerodynamics-combustion-structural vibrations (ACS), is studied by a careful selection of experiments and numerical simulations performed using commercially available computational models. It is shown predominantly that the convective time scales due to the aerodynamics at the flame stabilizer and the time period related to acoustic propagation have {{to be of the}} same order in magnitude to be able to drive the system into LCO. The measurements indicated that the frequency spectrum of the oscillations of the LCO has a distinct peak close to the natural mode of the combustor along with higher order âharmonicsâ due to non-linear effects. Some non-harmonic higher order peaks are observed that are associated with the structural (liner) natural frequencies of vibration. A numerical simulation has been performed using the commercial code (ANSYS V 13. 0) that includes the effects of fluid-structure interaction by means of pressure load transfer on to the structure and vice-versa. The fluid domain is modeled using CFX and the structural domain is represented by ANSYS. The information is exchanged between the two domains dynamically at every time step computed. In order to reduce the computational effort and quickly gain insight into the problem only a 2 mm slice of the whole geometry has been considered making it essentially a 2 D analysis.

An experimental and numerical investigation into reacting vortex structures shed from a rearward facing step flameholder {{was performed to}} gain insight into the fundamental reasons why certain acoustic modes of the <b>laboratory</b> dump <b>combustor</b> were excited for a given set of flow parameters. Cases examined used premixed [ [...] . ] air mixtures [ [...] . ], various duct heights (2. 54, 5. 08 and 7. 62 cm) and dump plane speeds (21, 30 and 35 m/s). The above parameters permitted observing instabilities having either {{one or both of}} the longitudinal acoustic modes present (188 or 234 Hz) in their respective pressure and velocity spectra. 	Ignition of the vortex structures was found to be heavily dependent on geometry (i. e., duct height) and invariant to stoichiometric variations. This fact indicated the dominance of turbulent exchange processes over chemical effects for the pulsating flowfield. The coherent structures which typically convected at the local dump plane speed and exhibited high initial strain rates, were found to exhibit shorter burning times and more intense combustion for decreasing duct heights. Use of high-speed shadowgraph and chemiluminescent (CCD) imagery permitted a complete description of the typically nonuniform, reacting flowfield. Time-resolved vortex and floor temperature measurements as well as time-averaged floor heat flux measurements completed the quantitative description of the vortex structures. 	Culick's technique of expanding the acoustic filed into orthogonal modes was employed to confirm mode selection theories and suggest the importance of the shape of the average burner distribution. A nonlinear heat release model was formulated whereby the vortices were characterized as gaussian envelopes convecting at the local dump plane speed. The system of equations formulated was a set of two coupled oscillators with a nonlinear driving term. A final discussion was also undertaken to infer the geometrical implications into the mode selection process (what system acoustic mode was excited). ...|$|R

The aim is to give an indication of how fluid flow and fuel combustion proceed when both mixing and combustion are carried out at supersonic speeds, and to provide a validation of two different solver packages for fluid dynamical problems. In this study, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes models (RANS) have been used to examine supersonic flow and combustion in a model scramjet combustion chamber. The RANS-model is based on a finite volume discretization of the continuity, momentum, energy and mixture fraction equations. The configuration used is a model of a <b>laboratory</b> scramjet <b>combustor</b> at the Institute for Space Propulsion at DLR. It consists of a divergent channel with a flame-holding, wedge-shaped structure {{in the middle of the}} flow field from the base of which hydrogen is injected. Three different operational cases with varying degree of complexity have been investigated. For the purpose of validation of the simulation models the results are systematically compared with experimental data for temperature, velocity and pressure at certain cross- sections in the combustion chamber. Qualitative comparisons are also made between the simulated flow fields and experimental schlieren and shadowgraph fields. The simulation codes used are ANSYS CFX and a solver program for fluid dynamics and combustion chemistry developed by my supervisor at DLR. Each simulation model is capable of predicting both the cold supersonic flow and the reacting flow fields reasonably well, with some quantitative inconsistencies for both models. Moreover, during the work a previously undiscovered deficiency in the non-commercial code is found, which leads to an appreciated improvement of the program. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The sulfur {{chemistry}} in oxyfuel combustion {{systems has}} received growing attention lately. The formation of SO(3) is of special concern, {{because of the}} elevated SO(2) concentrations found in oxyfuel, compared to air-fuel conditions. The present study focuses on the gas-phase chemistry and examines the impact of different combustion parameters and atmospheres on the formation of SO(3) in oxyfuel and air-fuel flames, using a detailed gas-phase model. The work also includes {{a summary of the}} presently available SO(x) data from experiments in <b>laboratory</b> and pilot-scale <b>combustors.</b> The reviewed experimental data, as well as the modeling results, show significantly increased SO(3) concentrations in oxyfuel, compared to air-fuel conditions. The modeling results reveal a complex behavior of the SO(3) formation, which is influenced by direct and indirect effects of the SO(2), O(2), NO(x), and CO content in the flue gas. One of the main contributors to the increased SO(3) concentration in oxyfuel, compared to air-fuel conditions, is the high concentration of SO(2) in oxyfuel combustion. The modeling also shows that the stoichiometry, residence time, and flue-gas cooling rate are critical to the SO(3) formation. Thus, in addition to the stoichiometry of the flame, the flue-gas recycling conditions are likely to influence the formation of SO(3) in oxyfuel combustion...|$|R
