Goals of the reaserch: Main goal of this essay is to discover how the effectivness of the fast breaks influence the outcome of the top class handball matches during the most important tournaments (ME, MS). Second goal is to discover if there is a link between effectivness of the fast break (or portion of the fast breaks from the total of breaks) and final place scored on the previously mentioned tournaments. Methods: Statistic analysis, ratio of fast breaks, comparism of the ratios Results: It was discovered, the teams with greater efficiency of the fast breaks took better places, in the sample of the reaserched tournaments, than the teams with lesser efficiency of the fast breaks. Teams that won the match used more fast breaks and with greater efficiency than teams that lost. There is a greater ratio of the fast breaks from the total number of breaks in the winning match than in the <b>loosing</b> <b>match.</b> Keywords: handball, fast break, efficiency of the fast break, portion, comparism of portions, place on the top class tournament...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{acoustic}} to articulatory inversion of speech {{by using an}} analysis by synthesis approach. We used old X-ray films of one speaker to (i) the develop a linear articulatory model presenting a small geometric mismatch with the subject's vocal tract mid sagittal images (ii) and design an adaptation procedure of cepstral vectors used as input data. The adaptation exploits the bilinear transform to warp the frequency scale in order to compensate for deviation between synthetic and natural speech. This enables the comparison of natural speech against synthetic speech without using cepstral liftering. A codebook is used to represent the forward articulatory to acoustic mapping and we designed a <b>loose</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm using spectral peaks to access it. This algorithm, based on dynamic programming, allows some peaks in either synthetic spectra (stored in the codebook) or natural spectra (to be inverted) to be omitted. Quadratic programming is used to improve the acoustic proximity near each good candidate found during codebook exploration. The inversion has been tested on speech signals corresponding to the X-ray films. It achieves a very good geometric precision of 1. 5 mm over the whole tongue shape unlike similar works evaluating the error at 3 or 4 points corresponding to sensors located {{at the front of}} the tongue...|$|R

The probabilities of having correct <b>matches,</b> mismatching or <b>loosing</b> correct <b>matches</b> as well as the cost of creating the identifiers are analysed together to determine their best shape...|$|R

40|$|Imitation is a {{powerful}} mechanism whereby knowledge may be transferred between agents (both biological and artificial). A crucial problem in imitation is the correspondence problem, mapping action sequences of the model and the imitator agent. This problem becomes particularly obvious when the two agents do not share the same embodiment and affordances. This paper describes work with our general imitation mechanism called ALICE (Action Learning for Imitation via Correspondence between Embodiments) that specifically addresses the correspondence problem. The mechanism has been implemented in two different software test-beds. The previous implementation, chessworld, is briefly summarised and the current robotic arm manipulator implementation is presented in this paper. Using the robotic arm test-bed we present proof of concept for the social transmission of behavioural patterns through groups of heterogeneous agents. We also present experiments that illustrate the impact of synchronization, <b>loose</b> perceptual <b>matching</b> and proprioception on the imitative performance. The robustness and adaptive nature of the ALICE mechanism is further illustrated with examples where the imitator agent embodiment is changing during the initial and later stages of the learning process...|$|R

As more and more analysis systems are developed, using these types of tools have become common and the advantages these systems provides can be the difference between winning or <b>loosing</b> a <b>match.</b> To offer an analysis system that can capture team data, annotate important events and deliver real-time video, we present the idea of Bagadus. With all of the these goals fulfilled, it is able to provide all the capabilities needed for team development. The system combines player tracking sensors, a easy-to-use annotation system and cameras to capture video of the games. The goal of Bagadus is to be fully automatic and real-time, but currently there are several issues that needs to be solved before one can take full advantage of the system. In this thesis, we present an improved version of the previously existing Bagdus video capture component. By designing a pipeline for panorama creation, we are able to deliver a panorama video in real-time consisting of frames from four individual cameras. We will also look further into the visual output of the pipeline and how we can improve the image quality by applying a method for color correction...|$|R

40|$|Network search makes {{operational}} data available in real-time to management applications. In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format {{needs to be}} known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications - from exact matching for database-style queries to <b>loose,</b> approximate <b>matching,</b> which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present {{the design of a}} search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9 -node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75 th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5 %. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100, 000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.

40|$|A bugbear of uncalibrated stereo {{reconstruction}} is that cameras which {{deviate from}} the pinhole model {{have to be}} pre-calibrated in order to correct for nonlinear lens distortion.

This paper shows how linear estimation of the fundamental matrix from two-view point correspondences may be augmented to include one term of radial lens distortion. This is achieved by (1) changing from the standard radiallens model to another which (as we show) has equivalent power, but which takes a simpler form in homogeneous coordinates, and (2) expressing fundamental matrix estimation as a Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem (QEP), for which efficient algorithms are well known. I derive the new estimator, and compare its performance against bundle-adjusted calibration-grid data. The new estimator is fast enough {{to be included in}} a RANSAC-based matching loop, and we show cases of matching being rendered possible by its use. I show how the same lens can be calibrated in a natural scene where the lack of straight lines precludes most previous techniques.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the positional and temporal movement patterns of professional rugby union players during competition using {{global positioning system}} (GPS) units. GPS {{data were collected from}} 33 professional rugby players from 13 matches throughout the 2012 – 2013 season sampling at 10 Hz. Players wore GPS units from which information on distances, velocities, accelerations, exertion index, player load, contacts, sprinting and repeated high-intensity efforts (RHIE) were derived. Data files from players who played over 60 min (n = 112) were separated into five positional groups (tight and loose forwards; half, inside and outside backs) for match analysis. A further comparison of temporal changes in movement patterns was also performed using data files from those who played full games (n = 71). Significant positional differences were found for movement characteristics during performance (P < 0. 05). Results demonstrate that inside and outside backs have greatest high-speed running demands; however, RHIE and contact demands are greatest in <b>loose</b> forwards during <b>match</b> play. Temporal analysis of all players displayed significant differences in player load, cruising and striding between halves, with measures of low- and high-intensity movement and acceleration/deceleration significantly declining throughout each half. Our data demonstrate significant positional differences for a number of key movement variables which provide a greater understanding of positional requirements of performance. This in turn may be used to develop progressive position-specific drills that elicit specific adaptations and provide objective measures of preparedness. Knowledge of performance changes may be used when developing drills and should be considered when monitoring and evaluating performance...|$|R

DOI: 10. 1075 /is. 5. 1. 03 ali [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]The study of imitation and other mechanisms of social learning is an exciting area of research for all those interested in understanding the origin and the nature of animal learning in a social context. Moreover, imitation is an increasingly important research topic in Artificial Intelligence and social robotics which opens up the possibility of individualized social intelligence in robots that are part of a community, and allows us to harness not only individual learning by the single robot, but also the acquisition of new skills by observing other members of the community (robots, humans, or virtual agents). After an introduction to the main research issues in research on imitation in various fields (including psychology, biology and robotics), we motivate the particular focus of this work, namely the correspondence problem. We describe Action Learning for Imitation via Correspondences between Embodiments (Alice), an implemented generic framework for solving the correspondence problem between differently embodied robots. Alice enables a robotic agent to learn a behavioral repertoire suitable to performing a task by observing a model agent. Importantly, the model agent could possibly possess a different type of body, e. g. a different number of limbs or joints (implying different degrees of freedom), a different height, different sensors, a different basic action repertoire, etc. Previously, in a test-bed where the agents differed according to their possible movement patterns, we demonstrated that the character of imitation achieved will depend on the granularity of subgoal matching, and on the metrics used to evaluate success. In our current work, we implemented Alice in a new test-bed called Rabit where simple simulated robotic arm agents use various metrics for evaluating success according to actions, states, effects, or weighted combinations. We examine the roles of synchronization, looseness of perceptual matching, and of proprioceptive matching by a series of experiments. Also, we study how Alice copes with changes in the embodiment of the imitator during learning. Our simulation results suggest that synchronization and <b>loose</b> perceptual <b>matching</b> allow for faster acquisition of behavioral compentencies at low error rates. Social learning (broadly construed) plays a role as a replication mechanism for behaviors and results in variability when the transmitted behavior differs from the model???s behavior, thus providing the evolutionary substrate for culture and its pre-cursors. Social learning in robotics could therefore {{serve as the basis for}} culture in societies whose members include artificial agents. We address the use of imitative social learning mechanisms like Alice for transmission of skills between robots, and give first examples of transmission of a skill despite differences in embodiment of agents involved. In the particular setup, transmission occurs through a chain, as well as emerging in cyclic arrangements of robots. These simple examples demonstrate that by using social learning and imitation, (proto-) cultural transmission is possible among robots, even in heterogeneous groups of robots...|$|R
