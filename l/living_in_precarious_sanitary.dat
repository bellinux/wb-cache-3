This funerary joking, performed by comedians unrelated to the bereaved, signifies a strong departure from the customary funerary humor in which accepted jokers occupy particular social positions towards the deceased. Following recent changes {{in the organization of}} the mourning rituals within the circles of Kinshasa’s wealthy and the rich, these rather intimate events are ever more open to ‘strangers’, who anticipate the spending capacities of the gathered crowd. Comedians constitute one among a wide range of outsiders, who approach the bereaved community as a space of opportunities. It is argued that this new cultural genre is utterly urban, and could only emerge within urban lifeworlds, where conviviality with others, and in particular an understanding of people’s necessity of making a <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> circumstances, push the mourning community to transform into an audience paying for a cultural performance.

Klára’s business is her interpreting work with advocates who are primarily concerned with assisting Czech and Slovak Roma migrants in Leeds with the problems they face with life in a new country, principally the complex business of claiming benefits. Our work with Klára allows an insight into the lives of these new migrants, <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> conditions, on the borderline between low pay employment and benefit claiming. We examine in detail the role of the different languages in these migrants’ interpreter-mediated interactions. We examine translanguaging in four different areas: English/Czech/Slovak interlingual translanguaging, intralingual translanguaging in English, intralingual translanguaging in Czech and Slovak, and interdiscursive translanguaging. Our study extends into Klára’s home life, where we see that Klára works hard to ensure that her children have access to the Czech language. We also examine her electronically-mediated communication, much of which exemplifies the blurring of boundaries between work and social interaction in online communication. The study took place in the Leeds suburb of Harehills. In the process of collecting data with Klára, we gained an insight into the lives of new migrants, <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> conditions, on the borderline between low pay employment and benefit claiming. We examine in detail the role of the different languages in these migrants’ interpreter-mediated interactions, using the notion of translanguaging. Klára’s work as a community interpreter means that language is crucially her business. Our study also extends into Klára’s home life, and we see that Klára also makes language her business there, working to ensure that her children have regular and consistent access to the Czech language. This report comprises eight sections overall. Following this introduction we provide background on the Roma in Leeds, the population who Klára has most contact with in her professional life. In Section 3 we discuss the foundational literature relevant to our study: superdiversity and neoliberalism; the employment and also exploitation characteristic in early stage migration; how linguistic ethnography can afford rich insights that it does into the events and practices we observe; a focus on the interpreting event from a literacy studies perspective; the site of interpreting as a contact zone; translanguaging at work and at home; and the use of social media in superdiverse multilingual environments. Section 4 on methodology details our overall approach, gives an overview of data collection, and describes the individual data sets, and how our analysis enables them to work in combination.

40|$|The years 1998 to 2003 {{were marked}} by a {{deterioration}} in the economic situation of the German population with an immigrant background as the share of immigrants living {{below the poverty line}} increased at an above average rate. The older and younger age groups in this segment of the population are particularly prone to poverty. The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey, which is carried out by the DIW Berlin in collaboration with the Infratest Social Research Institute, shows that 28 % of children and young people aged under 20 with an immigrant background were <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> circumstances <b>in</b> 2003. The share of native Germans of the same age <b>living</b> <b>in</b> such circumstances was substantially lower, albeit still disturbingly high at 20 %.

Naturalised Germans are better off on average than foreign nationals, although this is not true for ethnic Germans. The fact that poverty is not a transitory phenomenon but an enduring condition for many immigrants is particularly alarming. Only improved education and training will solve this problem in the long term.

The mission's findings showed that these districts had as of 2005 an overall population of 14,000 persons, mostly <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> social conditions.

Investigating demobilized soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo demonstrated that violent offending is associated with appetitive aggression but not necessarily with symptoms of posttraumatic stress. In the present study we sought to replicate these results in an independent and larger sample of demobilized soldiers from Burundi. As with the Congolese ex-combatants, random forest regression revealed {{that the number of}} lifetime perpetrated violent acts is the most important predictor of appetitive aggression and the number of lifetime experienced traumatic events is the main predictor for posttraumatic stress. Perpetrated violent acts with salient cues of hunting (pursuing the victim, the sight of blood, etc.) were most predictive for perceiving violent cues appealingly after demobilization. Moreover, the association of violent acts and appetitive aggression as well as traumatic events and posttraumatic stress remains strong even years after demobilization. Patterns of traumatic events and perpetrated acts as predictors for posttraumatic stress and appetitive aggression seem to be robust among different samples of ex-combatants who fought in civil wars.

40|$|Background : Family {{structure}} and union dissolution {{has been one}} of the most thoroughly studied determinants of children's wellbeing worldwide. To date, however, few of these studies have examined sub-Saharan Africa, especially countries in West Africa where marital breakdowns are not uncommon. Objective : We attempt to examine the effects of a mother's divorce and widowhood on children's risk of mortality under age 5 and on their probability of entering primary school. Methods : Survival data analysis methods, specifically Kaplan-Meier and piecewise exponential models, are used for analysis, based on data come from the 2000 Migration and Urban Integration Survey of Burkina Faso. Results : Compared to those of intact families, children of divorced parents experience higher estimated mortality risks under age 5 and a lower probability of entering school, even after controlling for various other factors. This effect is large and significant during the first two years after the divorce. The death of the father is also found to greatly reduce a child's likelihood of entering school, but its effect on mortality is not significant. Conclusions : The results indicate that the family context plays an important role in determining two important aspects of children's welfare: their probabilities of dying before age 5 and of entering school. Comments : Children of divorced parents or a deceased father are <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> situations and their specific needs should be taken into account in policies in order to improve the wellbeing of all children.

30|$|How do {{collective}} identities gain salience in the workplace? How are new “capitals” {{created in}} the process? To answer these question, this study examines the confrontation of two distinctly positioned socio-economic groups {{that for the first}} time labor as co-workers in urban China, in a new type of workspace; the modern retail store. One group is the urban service proletariat, who struggle to earn a <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> service jobs but have legal entitlement to urban residence and urban services. The other group is migrant employees who, as part of the largest migration in human history, join a tide of workers who originally departed their rural villages in the 1980 s to work in foreign-invested factories on China’s southeast coast, as well as in urban constructionl. These early migrants were largely sequestered from urbanites and excluded from permanent legal residence. Drawing on data from eleven weeks of ethnographic research in a retail work setting, we examine the process through which the spatial boundaries that once separated urbanites and rural migrants become socio-cultural boundaries. The process involves three conversion mechanisms: administratively determined division of jobs, extra-organizational collective identities that some workers draw on to valorize their labor, and third party (customer) preferences. We link these micro-level dynamics to state institutions and discourses. We show that workplace culture follows the contours of boundary formation, an organizational process in which workers collectively compete for status and material resources by converting their extramural identity to workplace recognition. These conversions produce “service capital” a resource that benefits urban workers. Through this boundary work, job tasks take on meaning beyond their bureaucratic designation, and job-based identities gain meaning in everyday life that become the cultural skin in which workers live.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{data are}} {{available}} on prescriber adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment guidelines. In particular, excessively long treatment carries a risk of avoidable adverse effects and represents a waste of healthcare resources. We examined factors potentially associated with excessively long treatment. Methods We reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with TB in 2004 in the eastern Paris region. Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with excessively long treatment were identified by logistic regression analyses. Based on contemporary guidelines, excessively long treatment was defined as more than 6 months of a four-drug regimen for thoracic TB with full sensitive strains, and more than 12 months for patients with extrathoracic TB. Results Analyses concerned 478 patients with a median age of 36. 0 ± 13. 5 years, of whom 48 % were <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> conditions (i. e. poor living conditions and/or no health insurance), 80 % were born abroad, and 17 % were HIV-seropositive. TB was restricted to the chest in 279 patients (isolated pulmonary, pleuropulmonary, and isolated pleural TB in 245, 13, and 21 patients, respectively), exclusively extrathoracic in 115 patients, and mixed in the remaining 84 patients. Treatment was prescribed by a chest specialist in 211 cases (44. 1 %) and 295 patients (61. 7 %) were managed in a single institution. The treatment duration complied with contemporary guidelines in 316 cases (66. 1 %) and was excessively long in 162 cases (33. 9 %). The median duration of excessively long treatment was 313 days (IQR: 272 - 412). In multivariate analysis, isolated thoracic TB, previous TB, HIV infection, a prescriber other than a chest specialist, and management {{in more than one}} healthcare center during treatment were independently associated with excessively lengthy treatment. Conclusion One-third of TB patients received excessively long treatment, reflecting inadequate awareness of management guidelines or unwillingness to implement them. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND The eco-epidemiological {{status of}} Chagas {{disease in the}} Monte Desert {{ecoregion}} of western Argentina is largely unknown. We investigated the environmental and socio-demographic determinants of house infestation with Triatoma infestans, bug abundance, vector infection with Trypanosoma cruzi and host-feeding sources in a well-defined rural area of Lavalle Department in the Mendoza province. METHODS Technical personnel inspected 198 houses for evidence of infestation with T. infestans, and the 76 houses included {{in the current study}} were re-inspected. In parallel with the vector survey, an environmental and socio-demographic survey was also conducted. Univariate risk factor analysis for domiciliary infestation was carried out using Firth penalised logistic regression. We fitted generalised linear models for house infestation and bug abundance. Blood meals were tested with a direct ELISA assay, and T. cruzi infection was determined using a hot-start polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the kinetoplast minicircle (kDNA-PCR). FINDINGS The households studied included an aged population <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> houses whose main economic activities included goat husbandry. T. infestans was found in 21. 2 % of 198 houses and in 55. 3 % of the 76 re-inspected houses. Peridomestic habitats exhibited higher infestation rates and bug abundances than did domiciles, and goat corrals showed high levels of infestation. The main host-feeding sources were goats. Vector infection was present in 10. 2 % of domiciles and 3. 2 % of peridomiciles. Generalised linear models showed that peridomestic infestation was positively and significantly associated with the presence of mud walls and the abundance of chickens and goats, and bug abundance increased with the number of all hosts except rabbits. MAIN CONCLUSIONS We highlight the relative importance of specific peridomestic structures (i. e., goat corrals and chicken coops) associated with construction materials and host abundance as sources of persistent bug infestation driving domestic colonisation. Environmental management strategies framed in a community-based programme combined with improved insecticide spraying and sustained vector surveillance are needed to effectively suppress local T. infestans populations...|$|R
40|$|Sectoral {{policies}} make {{explicit and}} implicit {{assumptions about the}} behaviour and capabilities of the agents (such as dynamic responses to market signals, demand-led assistance, collabora-tive efforts, participation in financing) which we consider to be rather unrealistic. Because of this lack of realism, policies that aim to be neutral often {{turn out to be}} highly exclusive. They fail to give sufficient importance to the special features of the sector –with its high climatic, biological and commercial risks and its slow adaptation – or to the fact that those who take decisions in agriculture are now mostly in an inferior po-sition because of their incomes below the poverty line, their in-adequate training, their traditions based on centuries of <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>precarious</b> conditions, and their geographical location in marginal areas, far from infrastructure and with only a mini-mum of services and sources of information. These people have only scanty and imperfect access to the markets which, according to the prevailing model, should govern decisions and the (re) distribution of the factors of production. In our opinion, this explains the patchy and lower-than-expected growth registered by the sector after the reforms to pro-mote the liberalization of markets and external openness in the region. In view {{of the results of the}} application of the new model, it may be wondered whether Latin America can afford a form of development which excludes over half of its agricultural producers; what the alternatives are; and what costs and benefits each of them offers in terms of production and monetary, social, spatial and other aspects. The article outlines the changes in policies and their results at the aggre-gate level, summarizes the arguments usually put forward to explain agricultural performance in the region, and proposes a second set of explanations based on a description of the agents and the responses that may be expected from them, contrasting the latter with the supposedly neutral nature of the policies...|$|R

In the present study, we evaluated the prevalence of enteroparasitosis in tuberculosis patients, HIV-infected and non HIV infected, and we observed the influence of helminth presence in the response to tuberculin skin test (TST) and tuberculosis clinical outcomes. From 607 clinical records reviewed, 327 individuals met the study inclusion criteria and did not present any exclusion criteria. The prevalence of enteroparasites observed was 19. 6 %. There was no significant association among TST result and the variables related to the presence of: helminthes, protozoa, and stool test for parasites result (p> 0. 5). Considering the survival of this cohort, we may observe {{that there is no}} significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the survival curves of parasited and non parasited individuals. Solely the variable "eosinophils" presents a statistically significant association (p< 0. 001) with helminthes, all other associations are considered not significant.

A dominant focus on the geophysical and biophysical causes of flood events restricts the analyses {{to the source of}} flood events and does not pay critical attention to the internal actors, dynamics and processes of informal urbanization where the burden of flood impacts usually fall. Equally problematic is the approach of city authorities in African countries who focus on the informality and illegality of housing and building as the source of the problem. City authorities have used flooding to justify forced evictions, and often limit their response to the distribution of relief items. This thesis challenges both these analyses and approaches to flood vulnerability by approaching the problem of flood vulnerability through an understanding of informal urbanization. In doing so, the thesis argues that vulnerability to flood hazards in urban informal settlements in developing countries is a product of a complex assemblage of the socio-economic factors, political alliances, state activities and local actions that together produce informal urban space. Using the three case studies from Accra, Ghana of Agbogbloshie, Old Fadama and Glefe, I explore how flood vulnerability and responses in these hazard-prone places have been produced and shaped through an assemblage of processes, actors and socio-materialities within the city. The study therefore draws on urban assemblage as the theoretical framework for understanding how flood vulnerabilities and responses are continuously produced through informal urbanisation, political engagements, accumulation of knowledge and capacities by residents and relevant state institutions. Using a mix of qualitative methods including community focus group discussions, interviews with hazard victims and institutional consultations/surveys, the study reveals that flood vulnerability and responses in the three communities have co-evolved with their historical development, dynamics of urban land management, dwelling processes and the role of state and non-state actors. The thesis therefore recommends three important entry points in understanding and addressing flood vulnerability in cities of the global south. First, a rethink of the overall urban planning and development process which places great emphasis on legality and security of tenure, at the expense of land management, housing provision and access to infrastructure. Second is to harness the emerging and accumulated knowledge and capacities of informal communities for flood vulnerability management. And lastly, the study recommends a re-examination of the roles of city authorities and emerging non-state actors through participatory urban governance and improved rights to urban citizenship. ...|$|R
5000|$|People's Army for the Restoration of the Republic and Democracy or PARRD is a rebel group {{operating}} in the Central African Republic (CAR). PARRD wants to overthrow current CAR President François Bozizé. PARRD has claimed responsibility for two major attacks, contributing to the influx of Central African refugees in southern Chad. During mid-October 2006, fighting between PARRD and government troops escalated, and on October 15, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) reported that 70,000 refugees have fled the CAR to Chad and Cameroon. FIDH official, Marceau Sivieudehe, stated that: [...] "It's obvious that the civilian population is the main victim of such a chaotic situation ... they are <b>living</b> <b>in</b> an absolutely <b>precarious</b> situation." [...] S/he criticized the lack of attention {{the crisis in the}} CAR has been receiving from the international community and warned of a subregional collapse that could impact the CAR, Chad, and Cameroon.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a qualitative comparative study that looked at the meaning of ‘precarious work’ in households situated in the position of ‘precarious prosperity’ in Switzerland and Romania in 2013. The aim of this research is to explore the experiences of individuals with precarious work and to embed them into their household and national structural contexts. Employment patterns in the two countries are similar in terms of uncertainty and instability, yet vary in many other aspects. While in Romania insecurity is due mainly to the very low incomes, in Switzerland it stems from nonstandard contracts. The research shows that for households of precarious prosperity, precarious work is both a strategy to cope with uncertainty and instability and a circumstance leading to precariousness. The analysis explores qualitatively the meaning that individuals <b>living</b> <b>in</b> households of <b>precarious</b> prosperity attribute to their employment situation as contextualized by the interplay between household and individual situation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE Identify spatial {{distribution}} {{patterns of the}} proportion of nonadherence to tuberculosis treatment and its associated factors. METHODS We conducted an ecological study based on secondary and primary data from municipalities of the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Argentina. An exploratory analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the area and the distributions of the cases included in the sample (proportion of nonadherence) was also carried out along with a multifactor analysis by linear regression. The variables related to the characteristics of the population, residences and families were analyzed. RESULTS Areas with higher proportion of the population without social security benefits (p = 0. 007) and of households with unsatisfied basic needs had a higher risk of nonadherence (p = 0. 032). In addition, the proportion of nonadherence was higher in areas with the highest proportion of households with no public transportation within 300 meters (p = 0. 070). CONCLUSIONS We found a risk area for the nonadherence to treatment characterized by a population <b>living</b> <b>in</b> poverty, with <b>precarious</b> jobs and difficult access to public transportation. </sec...|$|R
30|$|The low {{values of}} {{oxygenation}} obtained could represent organic pollution, {{and the values}} lower than 30 % obtained in LDS and those lower than 50 % obtained in SRS are characteristic of very polluted ecosystems (Rodier 2009). The increase {{in the rate of}} oxygenation observed in the rainy season could be due to the phenomenon of turbulence and mixing of water, supported by the rains and winds (Rodier 2009). The average value of oxydability (12.86 [*]±[*] 16.56  mg/L of KMnO 4) obtained at Mokolo is higher than the standards recommended for surface water quality which is less than 10  mg/L of KMnO 4. This could be explained by a significant anthropogenic activity at this point, as materialized by several artisanal activities and <b>precarious</b> <b>sanitary</b> conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{supply of}} {{drinking}} water in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo City {{has been a great}} and serious challenge in the latest years. This work demonstrates the viability of the evaluation of the degree of contamination of the water reservoirs using analytical procedures, which allow the analysis of several compounds at relatively low cost: stripping square wave voltammetry (SSWV) and capillary zone electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection (CZE-CCD). The results of ionic composition indicated significant contamination of the Guarapiranga water system by human activities on the reservoir banks. In fact, the Guavirutuba and Itupu streams presented high concentrations of phosphate and ammonium ions. This can be directly related to misuse and unruled occupation of the soil and <b>precarious</b> <b>sanitary</b> infrastructure...|$|R
