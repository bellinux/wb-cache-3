40|$|A novel ex situ {{method of}} {{investigating}} the water transport in porous media for PEM fuel cells with an environmental {{scanning electron microscope}} (ESEM) is introduced. By applying two different experimental methods, a liquid water pressure gradient is created which {{is necessary for the}} liquid water transport in porous media. The first method relies on water condensation on the bottom surface of the GDL to introduce a liquid phase into the porous media. The second method applies an external pressure gradient. The relevance of the methods is shown by visualizing the water formation and transport in different GDL materials with the high spatial resolution of an ESEM. In all experiments, the fingering effect, proposed by other researchers could be confirmed. However, the water formation {{on the surface of the}} GDLs is not consistent with the common idea of water formation in GDLs. The methods were also used to investigate the advantageous effect of <b>laser</b> <b>perforating</b> GDLs on fuel cell performance. The water transport visualization near a hole of a laser perforated GDL supports the assumptions of lower liquid water saturation in the GDL (due to effective water transport in the channels), and larger in-plane water transport towards the perforations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on {{investigating}} the Nd:YAG laser perforation process of several common plastic films including biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP), biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (BOPET) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) films. Films were perforated under various pulse energies of 50, 150 and 250 mJ and with pulse duration of ~ 10 ns and pulse repetition of 1 Hz. It was found that, BOPP, BOPET and LDPE films could be perforated using our developed Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> <b>perforating</b> system. Perforation width or diameters of all films increased with increasing pulse energies. Observed perforations were different among the three film types. For instance, at the pulse energy of 150 mJ, average microperforation diameters of BOPP, BOPET, and LDPE were 51. 9, 57. 5, and 31. 0 microns, respectively. Overall results clearly demonstrated that a Nd:YAG laser perforation process {{used in this study}} was effective in developing breathable packaging films with tailored oxygen permeation property. Commercial BOPP films containing 200 - 1, 400 micro-perforations/m 2 (average perforation diameter of 50 µm) showed a significant improvement in oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of 25 - 700 % over that of the regular BOPP. Very high OTR films of 16, 000 cc/m 2. day could be effectively produced for the micro-perforated BOPP, where OTR values of close to 20, 000 cc/m 2. day was obtainable in the case of BOPET films...|$|E

40|$|Capacitive {{deionization}} (CDI) is a fast-emerging {{water desalination}} technology {{in which a}} small cell voltage of ~ 1 V across porous carbon electrodes removes salt from feedwaters via electrosorption. In flow-through electrode (FTE) CDI cell architecture, feedwater is pumped through macropores or <b>laser</b> <b>perforated</b> channels in porous electrodes, enabling highly compact cells with parallel flow and electric field, as well as rapid salt removal. We here present a one-dimensional model describing water desalination by FTE CDI, and a comparison to data from a custom-built experimental cell. The model employs simple cell boundary conditions derived via scaling arguments. We show good model-to-data fits with reasonable values for fitting parameters such as the Stern layer capacitance, micropore volume, and attraction energy. Thus, we demonstrate that from an engineering modeling perspective, an FTE CDI cell may be described with simpler one-dimensional models, unlike more typical flow-between electrodes architecture where 2 D models are required.

40|$|ZIF- 8 is an imidazolate-based metal–organic {{framework}} (MOF). ZIF- 8 micromembranes of 20 – 32 μm diameter {{are prepared}} by synthesizing the MOF on Nd:YAG laser-perforated 75 μm thick brass sheets (63 / 37 Cu/Zn). The laser irradiation activates the brass support, promoting ZIF- 8 growth. A thick and continuous ZIF- 8 membrane is crystallized on the laser irradiation outlet {{side of the}} support, while the inlet side and the inner surface of the microperforations are also coated with ZIF- 8 intergrowth crystals. <b>Laser</b> <b>perforated</b> brass supports are not only cheap, flexible, strong, and easy to handle and to process as membrane materials; they are also chemically compatible with the ZIF- 8 composition because of the shared Zn element. The ZIF- 8 membranes obtained are characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, TGA and N 2 sorption analysis. Furthermore, the membranes are applied to the separation of equimolar H 2 –CH 4, He–CH 4, CO 2 –CH 4 and O 2 –N 2 mixtures confirming the expected molecular sieving effect due to the MOF microporosity.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{computer}} paper printing, {{cross and}} edge perforations are done only by mechanical perforators. The mechanical perforation process works fine since {{the width of}} the bridges and the length of the holes to be perforated remain large. Concerned with improvements in quality, printers have introduced microperforations. The holes and bridges of the perforation pattern are so small that after the user has torn off the sheet of computer paper along the perforation pattern, the edges of the document are very smooth and clean. Unfortunately, microperforations are reaching the limits of what can be achieved by the mechanical perforators. Because of the physical contact between the perforating tool and the paper, the perforation pattern is damaged. The tensile strength of the microperforation pattern decreases significantly and the paper often jams in the computer printers. Mechanical perforator dies wear and may even break. Therefore, holes are incompletely perforated or missing, so that the document is likely to be damaged when it is torn off along the perforation pattern by the user. Incomplete or missing perforations increases the tensile strength of the perforation pattern. Therefore, the printer can increase the quality of a perforation pattern by reducing its variability in tensile strength. This thesis studies the perforation of computer paper by laser beam. It is demonstrated through a microscopic study that laser perforations are free of all the defects which are inherent to the mechanical perforation process. It has been found that <b>laser</b> <b>perforated</b> holes remain open while mechanically perforated holes close back just after being perforated. The tests which have been carried out show that using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do microperforations reduces the variability in the tensile strength from 0. 694 kilograms to 0. 0751 kilograms. This improvement is significant. However, using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do large-size perforations reduces the variability in tensile strength only from 0. 0421 kilograms to 0. 0338 kilograms. This improvement is not significant. A mathematical model expressing the relationship between the tensile strength of a perforation pattern, {{the width of the}} bridges, and the number of bridges per inch has been established. The correlation found between the model and the experimental values is high (r = 0. 98). This mathematical model is a simple method which allows the printer to adjust the tensile strength of a laser perforation pattern to the desired value. This model requires only simple calculations, and the knowledge of one basic characteristic - the tensile strength of the paper. As a conclusion, the laser beam is a very valuable tool which can achieve very high quality microperforations on computer paper. However, it seems not worth using a laser to do large-size perforations on computer paper since the decrease in tensile strength variability over the mechanical perforation process is not significant. The fact that <b>laser</b> <b>perforated</b> holes remain wide open could improve high speed folding and piling in the press deliveries by allowing the air trapped between the sheets of computer paper to escape through the perforated holes. This property has also already found an interesting application for cigarette filter paper...|$|R
40|$|High powered laser rock {{drilling}} was studied as a revolutionary method for drilling and completing deep {{gas and oil}} wells. The objectives of this 2002 to 2003 fiscal year research were to study the concept that large diameter holes can be created by multiple overlapping small beam spots, to determine the ability of lasers to drill rock submerged to some depth in water, to demonstrate the possibilities of <b>lasers</b> for <b>perforating</b> application, and to determine the wavelength effects on rock removal.

40|$|PURPOSE: The in situ {{fenestration}} of {{a standard}} endograft is currently limited by difficulties in targeting the fenestration site under fluoroscopic control and {{by the lack of}} a safe method to perforate the graft. Evidence in the literature suggests the use of a 3 [*]D electromagnetic navigator to accurately guide the endovascular instruments to the target and a <b>laser</b> to selectively <b>perforate</b> the graft. The aim of this work is to provide design guidelines to develop a sensorized catheter to guide the laser tool to the fenestration site and conduct preliminary testing of the feasibility of the proposed solution. Matherials and methods: Different catheter designs were delineated starting from engineering considerations, then prototypes were preliminarily tested to collect surgeon opinions and to steer the design process toward the preferred solution reported by the user. Finally, mechanical simulations were performed with CathCAD, a design software system for the development of composite tubing for endovascular catheters. RESULTS: Based on surgeon feedback, a 9 -French steerable catheter with a stabilization system was designed. CathCAD simulations allowed us to define the construction parameters (e. g., materials and geometric constrains) for the fabrication of composite tubes with mechanical properties (flexural, axial, and torsional rigidities) compatible with target values in the literature for guiding catheters. CONCLUSION: The presented results preliminarily demonstrate the clinical reasonability and feasibility of the designed tool in terms of mechanical properties.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} superior peripheral iridotomy versus inferior peripheral iridotomy {{in the treatment of}} primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in phakic patients. Methods: In this randomized, prospective, paired-eye comparative study, patients with primary angle closure or primary angle-closure suspects were recruited and randomized to receive neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) superiorly in one eye and inferiorly in the other eye. Patients were masked to the location of treatment in each eye. The main outcome measures were patency of iridotomy, intraocular pressure (IOP), complications and visual symptoms at each postoperative visit during a 1 year follow-up. Results: A total of 164 patients were recruited, of whom 150 (91. 46 %) completed the study. The mean age was 58. 85 ± 6. 4 years. Average IOP measurements before LPI was 22. 85 ± 7. 53 and 23. 62 ± 8. 32 in superior LPI and inferior LPI eyes respectively. After LPI, average IOP was 25. 14 ± 2. 73 and 20. 97 ± 2. 72 in superior LPI and inferior LPI eyes respectively. Inferior LPIs required less use of mean total <b>laser</b> energy to <b>perforate</b> the tissue (p =. 05) and resulted in a significantly lower incidence of iris bleeding at the time of treatment (p =. 004), lower IOP elevation following treatment (p =. 002), lower incidence of focal corneal damage (p =. 002) and a lower post-laser iritis (p =. 04). All the 300 iridotomies were patent at 12 month follow up. Conclusion: The inferior LPI appeared to be an efficient method of preventing pupil block with fewer complications. Visual symptoms following inferior LPI are similar to superior LPI. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVEWe {{compared}} {{the result of}} radiofrequency (RF) -assisted valvotomy and balloon dilation with closed surgical valvotomy and Blalock Taussig (BT) shunt as primary treatment in selected patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS). BACKGROUNDPatients with PA-IVS who have mild to moderate hypoplasia of the right ventricle (RV) and patent infundiblum have the greatest potential for complete biventricular circulation. The use of RF or <b>laser</b> wires to <b>perforate</b> the atretic valve followed by balloon dilation provides an alternative to surgery. METHODSBetween May 1990 and March 1998, 33 selected patients underwent either percutaneous RF valvotomy and balloon dilation (group 1, n = 21; two crossed over to group 2) or surgical valvotomy with concomitant BT shunt (group 2, n = 14). Second RV decompression by balloon dilation or right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction were performed if necessary. Patients who remained cyanosed were subjected to transcatheter trial closure of the interatrial communication. Partial biventricular repair was offered to those with inadequate growth of the RV. RESULTSThe primary procedure was successful in 19 patients in group 1. There was one in-hospital death and two late deaths. Of the remaining 16 survivors, 12 achieved complete biventricular circulation, 7 of whom required no further interventions. Two patients required repeat balloon dilation, 1 RVOT reconstruction and 2 transcatheter closure of interatrial communication. Two patients underwent partial biventricular repair. In group 2, there were 3 in-hospital deaths after the primary procedure and 1 patient died four months later. All survivors (n = 10) required a second RV decompression, 8 by balloon dilation and 2 by RVOT reconstruction, after which, two patients died. Of the final 8 survivors, 7 achieved complete biventricular circulation, 5 after coil occlusion of the BT shunt and 2 after closure of interatrial communication. CONCLUSIONSRadiofrequency valvotomy and balloon dilation is more efficacious and safe compared with closed pulmonary valvotomy and BT shunt in selected patients with PA-IVS...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{has become}} number one cause of death. Conventional {{treatment}} includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or combination. The combinatorial therapy in one system is highly efficient and economical. Herein, two drug delivery systems with chemo and photothermal therapy are developed {{in order to}} enhance the therapeutic efficacy in A 549 human lung cancer cells. The first one is hollow copper sulfide nanoparticle carrying doxorubicin (PEG-HCuSNPs-DOX). The second one is mesoporous silica coated CuS nanoparticles (CuS NPs) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) (PEG-CuS@MSNs-DOX). ^ Both nano-drug delivery systems are pH sensitive, laser responsive, and photothermal convertible. CuS NPs are the photothermal sensitizers in both drug delivery systems. However the drug loading efficiency is much higher in the PEG-CuS@MSNs-DOX, whereas its drug release rate is much slower. In addition, the anti-cancer efficacy of PEG-HCuSNPs-DOX is higher than that of PEG-CuS@MSNs-DOX. ^ Five chapters are prepared in this thesis. Each chapter includes an independent manuscript and separate abstract. Chapter 2 serves as preparation experiment for chapter 3. Chapter 4 is a review that expands the application of CuS NPs to transdermal delivery. Chapter 5 is a mini review on the in vivo application of CuS NPs. ^ 1. Cancer Photothermal Chemo Therapy Using Hollow Copper Sulfide Doxorubicin Nanoparticles^ The design and synthesis of the multifunctional nanoparticles responsive to external stimuli provides potential applications in biomedical fields such as controlled drug delivery. Here, near infrared (NIR) laser-controlled fast and effective tumor cell killing is achieved based on the pH sensitive and NIR light responsive hollow copper sulfide nanoparticles chelated with doxorubicin molecules (HCuSNPs-DOX). Laser exposure at 900 nm and acidic environment facilitate the release of DOX from HCuSNPs-DOX. Spontaneously, the released DOX forms DOX/Cu 2 + complex and generates cell-killing reactive oxygen species. Laser exposure to HCuSNPs-DOX also disrupts the integrity of the cell membrane instantly. The IC 50 of HCuSNPs-DOX with and without laser treatment was 4. 0 and 7. 6 µg/mL CuS, respectively. The approach developed here offers compelling chances for quick-responsive anticancer therapy. ^ 2. Facile Direct Dry Grinding Synthesis of Monodisperse Lipophilic CuS Nanoparticles^ Copper sulfide with near-infrared light absorption property is recently attracting broad interest as a photothermal carrier for smart cancer therapy. Lipophilic copper sulfide nanoparticle is preferred for high performance biomedical applications due to the high affinity with tissues. But it requires complex multi-step synthetic process under severe condition. Here, synthesis of hydrophobic copper sulfide possessing surface plasmon resonance was retained by direct dry grinding of copper(II) acetylacetonate with sulfur under ambient environment. The formed CuS nanoparticles were in uniform size of 10 nm, and they were monodispersed in pure chloroform. Each covellite CuS nanocrystal surface was modified with oleylamine through hydrogen bonding between sulfur atoms and amine groups of oleylamine. While those oleylamine capped CuS nanoparticles showed uniform morphological features, they demonstrated near-infrared light absorption for photothermal applications. The facile and mild synthetic methodology described here opened a powerful pathway for the design and preparation of photothermal lipophilic copper sulfide nanomaterials for smart cancer therapy. ^ 3. Multifunctional Mesoporous Silica-Coated CuS Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy: Synthesis, Characterization and in vitro Evaluation^ Chemo therapeutic drug-caused side effects are commonly seen in clinical practice due to nonspecific toxicity and low therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we reported a cancer chemo-photothermal multifunctional drug delivery system. Polyethylene glycol decorated mesoporous silica nanoparticles entrapping CuS nanoparticles (PEG-CuS@MSNs) were successfully synthesized and characterized for the drug delivery application. Doxorubicin (DOX) -loaded PEG-CuS@MSNs showed laser stimulated and pH-responsive properties. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that DOX-loaded PEG-CuS@MSNs combining laser exposure achieved the highest rate of death of A 549 cells, in comparison to that of PEG-CuS@MSNs-DOX chemotherapy alone. These findings provided a promising drug delivery system for cancer combinatorial therapy, which could significantly reduce drug dose and improve patient compliance. ^ 4. Laser ablation-enhanced transdermal drug delivery^ Transdermal delivery offers an excellent route for drug and vaccine administration. Nonetheless, it presents a critical challenge due to the skin 2 ̆ 7 s lipid-rich outer stratum corneum layer. <b>Laser</b> ablation <b>perforates</b> epidermis through selective photothermolysis, making skin more permeable to hydrophilic and macromolecular drugs such as peptides, proteins, and genes. This review summarizes recent applications to laser ablation-enhanced transdermal delivery. Needle- and pain-free transcutaneous drug delivery via laser ablation provides an alternative approach to achieve local or systemic therapeutics. ^ 5. Cancer Photothermal Therapy and CuS Nanoparticles^ This manuscript is being prepared according to the format of Lasers in Medical Science as a review article. ...|$|R
