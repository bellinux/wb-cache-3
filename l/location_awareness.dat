Users can {{make use of the}} new [...] "Network Center" [...] to see the status of their network connections, and to access every aspect of configuration. The network can be browsed using Network Explorer, which replaces Windows XP's [...] "My Network Places". Network Explorer items can be a shared device such as a scanner, or a file share. Network <b>Location</b> <b>Awareness</b> uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type. Windows Vista graphically presents how different devices are connected over a network in the Network Map view, using the LLTD protocol. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and media type (wired or wireless). Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's {{user interface}}. When LLTD is invoked, it provides metadata about the device that contains static or state information, such as the MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 address, signal strength etc.|$|E

40|$|Background: Extracranial meningiomas {{are common}} tumours but may occur in {{unexpected}} <b>locations.</b> <b>Awareness</b> can avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate management of these tumours. We report {{the case of}} a 54 -year-old Caucasian male with en plaque meningioma of the external ear canal and an intracranial temporal lobe meningioma. Intervention: The patient underwent extended canal wall down atticomastoidectomy with preservation of the ossicular chain and tympanic membrane and en bloc resection of the bony posterior canal wall, tumour, and overlying skin. Results: Radical removal of a grade I meningothelial meningioma was achieved. The tegmen tympani and dura were not breached. No connection with the temporal lobe meningioma was demonstrated. The patient recovered completely and experienced a marked improvement in hearing. No clinical signs of recurrent or residual tumour have occurred. Conclusion: Careful clinical examination and extensive radiological workup is required to avoid missing the unusual diagnosis of concurrent meningioma of the temporal bone and temporal lobe, and miss the chance to treat this disease adequately...|$|R

40|$|With {{the current}} trend of {{embedding}} location services within social networks, an ever growing amount of users' spatiotemporal tracks are being collected and used to generate user profiles. Issues of personal privacy and especially those stemming from tracking user location become more important to address. In this work, {{it is argued that}} support of <b>location</b> privacy <b>awareness</b> within social networks is needed to maintain the users' trust in their services. Current practices of pre-configuring location disclosure settings {{have been shown to be}} limited, where users' sense of location privacy dynamically change with context. In this paper, <b>location</b> privacy <b>awareness</b> is considered within a composite view of place, time and social data recorded in user profiles. The paper examines the possible threats to personal privacy from exposure of this data and the design of feedback tools to allow users to control their privacy. A user study is used to examine the impact of the feedback provided on users' perception of privacy and the link between their privacy concerns and their attitude towards using the geo-social network. Findings confirm the strong need for more transparent access to and control over user location profiles, and guide the proposal of recommendations to the design of more privacy-sensitive geo-social networks...|$|R

An information video about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was combined with a custom browser-based video game and successfully deployed on an existing research platform, Screens in the Wild (SitW). The SitW platform consists of 46 -in. touchscreen or interactive displays, a camera, a microphone and a speaker, deployed at four urban locations in England. Details of the platform and software implementation of the multimedia content are presented. The game {{was based on a}} psychometric continuous performance test. In the gamified version of the test, players receive a score for correctly selected target stimuli, points being awarded in proportion to reaction time and penalties for missed or incorrect selections. High scores are shared between locations. Questions were embedded to probe self-awareness about ‘attention span’ in relation to playing the game, awareness of ADHD and Adult ADHD and increase in knowledge from the video. Results are presented on the level of public engagement with the game and video, deduced from play statistics, answers to the questions and scores obtained across the screen <b>locations.</b> <b>Awareness</b> of Adult ADHD specifically was similar to ADHD in general and knowledge increased overall for 93 % of video viewers. Furthermore, ratings of knowledge of Adult ADHD correlated positively with ADHD in general and positively with knowledge gain.

30|$|Cognitive radio {{provides}} {{a solution to}} the problem of inefficient spectrum utilization by using the vacant frequency spectrum over time in a certain geographical region. In other words, a cognitive radio system can opportunistically use the available spectrum of a legacy system without interfering with the licensed users of that spectrum [2, 3]. In order to facilitate such opportunistic spectrum utilization, it is important that cognitive radio devices are aware of their positions, and monitor the environment continuously. These <b>location</b> and environmental <b>awareness</b> features of cognitive radios have been studied extensively in the literature [10, 13 – 19]. In [13], the concept of cognitive radar is introduced, which provides information related to the objects in an environment; that is, it performs environmental sensing. In [14], a radio environment mapping method for cognitive radio networks is studied. Conceptual models for <b>location</b> and environmental <b>awareness</b> engines and cycles are proposed in [10, 15, 16] for cognitive radio systems. Also, [18] introduces the concept of a topology engine for cognitive radios by studying topology information characterization and its applications to cognitive radio networks.|$|R

There is, however, increasing interest in also supporting Internet communications from and to vehicles. By allowing classical and new IP services to be accessible from vehicles, users would see an additional benefit in the installation of a communication system in their cars, and this would help increasing user acceptance and in turn facilitate initial deployment and market penetration.|$|R
