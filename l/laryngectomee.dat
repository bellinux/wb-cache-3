However, many laryngeal cancer cases are now treated only with more conservative surgeries through the mouth or with radiation and/or chemotherapy; laryngectomy is performed when those treatments fail to conserve the larynx or there is sufficient destruction by the cancer that would prevent normal function once it is destroyed. Laryngectomy is also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer or severe swallowing problems.|$|E

Methods: In our prospective analysis in a tertiary-care academic hospital, 25 <b>laryngectomees</b> were divided into 2 groups: 11 speaking individuals with a tracheoesophageal prosthesis and a control group of 14 nonspeaking <b>laryngectomees.</b> All patients were subjected to manometry during voice and speech emission tests.

Objectives: The aim {{of this research is}} to study QOL of the patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent TL, <b>laryngectomees,</b> and to study impact of early speech restoration on QOL of these patients. Subjects and methods: A case-control, hospital-based study design was used. A total number of 90 <b>laryngectomees</b> and a control group of the same number were enrolled in this research. Results: The <b>laryngectomees</b> had a significantly poorer self-reported health-related QOL domain scores than the controls on all eight Short Form (SF) - 36 domains (P= 0. 000). Also, the <b>laryngectomees</b> with primary/secondary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) had significantly poorer self-reported health-related QOL domain scores than the controls on all eight SF- 36 domains (P= 0. 000).

Study Design: Experimental, randomized, crossover trial. Methods: The new sound source consists of a single silicone lip, which performs an oscillatory movement driven by expired pulmonary air flowing along the outward-striking lip through the TE shunt valve. A prototype of this pneumatic sound source is evaluated in vitro and in six <b>laryngectomees,</b> In vivo evaluation includes speech rate, maximal phonation time, perceptual voice evaluation of read-aloud prose by an expert listener, speech intelligibility measurements with 12 listeners, and self-assessment by the patients.

40|$|According to the American Cancer Society, {{there will}} be {{approximately}} 7, 000 people who will need a total laryngectomy operation this year. This operation is the surgical removal of the entire larynx due to cancer. The person who has had his larynx surgically removed is called a <b>laryngectomee.</b> The 7, 000 laryngectomees will need some form of voice to talk with once their vocal cords have been removed. While {{there are a number}} of speech options available after the operation, this paper will deal with only one of these options: the electronic artificial larynx device. The goal of the laryngectomee's speech rehabilitation program is to find an appropriate sound source that can be used for communicative purposes (Prater, 1984). The normal sound source for speech originates from the vocal cords. The laryngectomee's vocal cords have been removed, however, so the new sound source for speech may be provided by a mechanical device known as an electrolarynx. Oliver Bloodstein (1984) states that an electrolarynx "sends sound vibrations into the oral cavity" and with the different articulatory configurations, speech sounds are produced. The electro-larynx, therefore, provides the <b>laryngectomee</b> with a substitute voice for means of communication. There are very few electro-larynxes available with pitch variation capability, so most exhibit monotonous and robot-like sounds. The specific question addressed in this paper will be whether or not there is a difference in the preferences shown by sophisticated versus naive listeners for speech produced by two different artificial electric larynx devices.

Female <b>laryngectomees</b> with an atonic pharyngoesophageal segment gain vocal strength with the SPVP. Exerted tracheal pressure and airflow rate are equivalent to those required for regular tracheoesophageal shunt valves.

40|$|Abstract—As {{one of the}} {{speaking}} aid techniques for laryn-gectomees, an esophageal speech enhancement method based on eigenvoice conversion has been proposed. In this method, conversion models are trained using utterance pairs of esophageal speech uttered by a <b>laryngectomee</b> and normal speech uttered by many normal speakers. Recording of normal speech of which pause positions correspond to those of esophageal speech is effective to develop well-designed training data for building the conversion models but it requires {{an enormous amount of}} time and expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a method capable of effectively using normal speech data including mismatched pause positions as training data by alleviating their impact on the conversion models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvements in both speech quality and conversion accuracy for speaker individuality (i. e., speaker identity).

40|$|In {{order to}} improve voice quality in female <b>laryngectomees</b> and/or <b>laryngectomees</b> with a {{hypotonic}} pharyngo-oesophageal segment, a sound-producing voice prosthesis was designed. The new source of voice consists of either one or two bent silicone lips which perform an oscillatory movement driven by the expired pulmonary air that flows along the outward-striking lips through the tracheo-oesophageal shunt valve. Four different prototypes of this pneumatic sound source were evaluated in vitro and in two female <b>laryngectomees,</b> testing the feasibility and characteristics of this new mechanism for alternative alaryngeal voice production. In vivo evaluation included acoustic analyses of both sustained vowels and read-aloud prose, videofluoroscopy, speech rate, and registration of tracheal phonatory pressure and vocal intensity.

The average pitch of voice increased and clarity improved in female <b>laryngectomees.</b> Pitch regulation of this prosthetic voice is possible with sufficient modulation to avoid monotony. The quality of voice attained through the sound-producing voice prostheses depends on a patient's ability to let pulmonary air flow easily through the pharyngo-oesophageal segment without evoking the low-frequency mucosal vibrations that form the regular tracheo-oesophageal shunt voice. These initial experimental and clinical results provide directions for the future development of sound-producing voice prostheses.

40|$|After total laryngectomy, the {{patients}} often report immediate and marked olfactory deficit.

Ten laryngectomized patients and ten rhinologically normal subjects were subjected to olfactory testing, after which histological examination of biopsied olfactory mucosa was performed. Olfactory testing in <b>laryngectomees</b> revealed a marked reduction in odor perception. Histological examination of olfactory mucosa specimens showed that in <b>laryngectomees</b> some neuroepithelial structural features were comparable with those found in normal subjects. However, additional signs of damage were also observed, consisting mainly of various degrees of epithelial degeneration, above and beyond those that are characteristic of physiological epithelium turnover. These different degenerative features consisted of severe damage to the neuroepithelium, culminating in complete topical loss. Bowman's glands were also observed to be involved in the degenerative process. Laryngectomy-induced hyposmia seems to be correlated with the almost complete loss of nasal airflow due to the disconnection between the upper and lower airways, which prevents odor molecules from reaching the olfactory area, together with degenerative phenomena, which affect the neuroepithelium, and consequent failure in neurosensorial performance...|$|R

Methods: The functioning of a prototype SPVP is described in a female <b>laryngectomee</b> before and after its sound-producing mechanism was impeded by tracheal phlegm. This assessment included: perceptual voice evaluation of read-aloud prose by an expert listener; inspection of the malfunctioning SPVP; and aero-acoustical in vivo registrations using a computer-based data acquisition system. Results: Sound-producing voice prosthesis speech is higher pitched, stronger, contains less aperiodic noise and requires a lower airflow rate than the patient’s regular tracheoesophageal (TE) shunt speech. Tracheal phlegm caused malfunction of the vibrating silicone lip of the SPVP by causing it to stick to its stainless steel container in an opened position, thereby reducing the SPVP to nomore than a regular TE shunt valve from a functional point of view. Tracheal phonatory pressure and dynamic vocal intensity rangewere not affected by the functional status of the SPVP.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{described}} hyposmia after laryngectomy. The most common mechanism invoked is {{a reduction in}} nasal airflow, leading to elevated olfactory detection thresholds. Children with nasal obstruction {{have been shown to}} also have elevated olfactory detection thresholds linked to reduced nasal airflow. A child with a tracheotomy is in some degree similar to a <b>laryngectomee.</b> These patients will have variable amounts of nasal airflow reduction proportional to the degree of suprastomal obstruction. Our concern was that this alteration in nasal airflow may cause hyposmia. Furthermore, if the olfactory system requires adequate early stimulation for normal development [as is the case with vision and hearing], tracheotomy would be suspected to cause persistent hyposmia even after decannulation. Thus decreased olfactory sensitivity, delayed olfactory experience, or both could interfere with a child's ability to recognize and identify odor stimuli. We studied children aged 4 to 16 years with upper airway obstruction requiring tracheotomy and compared their abilities to identify familiar odorants with those of a large group of normal control children. None of the children had intrinsic mucosal or olfactory pathology. Statistical analysis of the early data shows a significant reduction in olfactory identification scores in the patients with tracheotomies, both by Student'...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Aerodynamic {{aspects of}} esophageal voice {{production}} in <b>laryngectomees</b> {{have been studied}} to clarify and compare the physiology of injection (IE) and button-assisted (TE) esophageal voice. Methods: Simultaneous measurements of intratracheal, sub- and suprapseudoglottic pressure, trans-pseudoglottic flow and sound pressure level (SPL) in <b>laryngectomees</b> were carried out. Efficiency of substitute voice production and pressure loss over the prosthesis were calculated. Relationships between the variables were computed by means of regression analysis, and Pearson's product-moment correlations. Results: (1) TE speakers use a higher subpseudoglottic pressure and a higher mean airflow rate during phonation than IE speakers; (2) in TE and IE speakers SPL values are about the same; (3) in assessing voice performance of TE speakers intratracheal air pressure {{is the most important}} aerodynamic variable. Conclusion: The aerodynamic model of button-assisted esophageal voice production presented here provides a basis for future studies in this field. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel method of enhancing esophageal speech based on statistical voice conversion. Esophageal speech {{is one of}} the speaking methods for total <b>laryngectomees.</b> Although it allows <b>laryngectomees</b> to speak by generating a sound source and articulating it to produce audible speech sounds using their esophagus and vocal organs, the generated voices sound unnatural. To improve the naturalness of esophageal speech, we propose a voice conversion method from esophageal speech into normal speech (ES-to-Speech). A spectral parameter and excitation parameters, such as F 0 and aperiodic components, of normal speech are separately estimated from the spectral parameter of the esophageal speech in the sense of maximum likelihood using different Gaussian mixture models. We conduct objective and subjective evaluations of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvements in naturalness of esophageal speech while maintaining its intelligibility. I...|$|R
