Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b>|$|E
40|$|Basic formulations, analyses, and {{numerical}} {{procedures are}} presented to investigate radiative heat interactions in diatomic and polyatomic gases under <b>local</b> and nonlocal <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> conditions. Essential governing equations are presented for both gray and nongray gases. Information is provided on absorption models, relaxation times, and transfer equations. Radiative flux equations are developed which are applicable under <b>local</b> and nonlocal <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> conditions. The problem is solved for fully developed laminar incompressible flows between two parallel plates under the boundary condition of a uniform surface heat flux. For specific applications, three diatomic and three polyatomic gases are considered. The results are obtained numerically by employing {{the method of}} variation of parameters. The results are compared under <b>local</b> and nonlocal <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> conditions at different temperature and pressure conditions. Both gray and nongray studies are conducted extensively for all molecular gases considered. The particular gases selected for this investigation are CO, NO, OH, CO 2, H 2 O, and CH 4. The temperature and pressure range considered are 300 - 2000 K and 0. 1 - 10 atmosphere, respectively. In general, results demonstrate that the gray gas approximation overestimates the effect of radiative interaction for all conditions. The conditions of NLTE, however, result in underestimation of radiative interactions. The method developed for this study can be extended to solve complex problems of radiative heat transfer involving nonequilibrium phenomena...|$|R

At this time, researchers at MIT became interested in fusors for space propulsion and powering space vehicles. Specifically, researchers developed fusors with multiple inner cages. Greg Piefer graduated from Madison and founded Phoenix Nuclear Labs, a company that developed the fusor into a neutron source for the mass production of medical isotopes. Robert Bussard began speaking openly about the Polywell in 2006. He attempted to generate interest in the research, before his death.

25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> while others are not. Even for simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. Glow discharge is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically reactive species, which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The electric discharge process for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E
