40|$|It is {{impossible}} in Indonesian to express narrow-focus meta-linguistic contrasts on subparts of words (whether meaningless syllables or meaningful morphemes). In English and Dutch this possibility exists, as in I meant coffin not coffer or I said meaningful not meaningless. We predict from this circumstance that Indonesian learners of Dutch {{will not be}} sensitive {{to this type of}} prosodic contrast marking at the sub-word level. Native Dutch speakers should be able to make functional use of this type of contrast. We conducted an experiment with thirteen Indonesian learners <b>of</b> Dutch with <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in the Netherlands between 3 weeks and 27 years, and a group of thirteen native Dutch speakers as controls. The results show that the Indonesian learners perform at chance level, and are therefore insensitive to narrow-focus contrasts below the word level. Dutch learners are highly sensitive to these contrasts on average, although three out of thirteen performed at chance level. We argue from these results that Indonesian has no word stress...|$|R

Addressing the place-based views and concerns of residents is necessary for maintaining public support for tourism. This project analyzes place satisfaction among full-time residents living in Southern Shores, North Carolina. The qualitative methods of auto-photography and photo-elicitation interview are used with thirteen residents <b>of</b> varying <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in the Outer Banks community. Participants were supplied with disposable cameras and asked to photograph what they like and dislike about Southern Shores. In reacting to their photographs, participants communicated views, feelings, and a sense of place that allowed researchers to identify positive and negative aspects of the community and tourism development. For some participating residents, the very act of photographing Southern Shores and choosing what to represent visually made them more cognizant of place satisfaction, thus pointing to the method's potential as a public education and extension tool.   M.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{unconventional}} gas developments has created widespread community concerns {{in many parts of}} the world. This study adds to the literature on the psychological impact of related developments by drawing upon Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and the concept of place attachment. In providing a holistic framework, it examines community residents' appraisals of and emotional responses to impacts of an unconventional gas development, and establishes heterogeneity in these appraisals and responses among residents. The findings show that perceived negative impact on resources that encompass personal and communal resources due to the development contributes to negative emotions that can lead to deteriorated psychological well-being. Conversely, perceived positive impact on resources is conducive to positive emotions that in turn can foster residents' psychological well-being. The findings further reveal that perceived impact on place attachment partially mediates the relationship between perceived impact on resources and negative emotions. Importantly, these effects differ in strength for residents characterized by different ages, <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> and distances <b>of</b> their properties from the development. Implications for how this framework can be applied to minimize unwanted impacts and be incorporated into social license that goes beyond the current model of community consultation are discussed...|$|R

50|$|There is a {{discrepancy}} {{in relation to}} race in terms of housing value. On average, the economic value of Black-owned units is 35% less than similar White-owned units. Thus, on average, Black-owned units sell for 35% less than similar White-owned units. Krivo and Kaufman state that while median home value of White Americans is at least $20,000 more than that of African Americans and Hispanics, these differences are not a result of group differences in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>residences</b> because Asians have the most equity on their homes but have lived in them for the shortest average period. African American and Hispanic mortgage holders are 1.5 to 2.5 {{times more likely to}} pay 9% or more on interest. Krivo and Kaufman calculate that the African-American/White gap in mortgage interest rates is 0.39%, which translates to a difference of $5,749 on the median home loan payment of a 30-year mortgage of a $53,882 home. The Hispanic/White gap (0.17%) translates to Hispanics paying $3,441 more on a 30-year mortgage on the median valued Hispanic home loan of $80,000. The authors conclude that the extra money could have been reinvested into wealth accumulation.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships among enculturation, attitudes supporting intimate partner violence (IPV‐supporting attitudes), and gender role attitudes among {{one of the largest}} Asian Indian population groups in the US. Data were collected via computer‐assisted telephone interviews with a random sample of Gujarati men and women aged 18 – 64 in Metropolitan Detroit. Using structural equation modeling, we modeled the effects of three components of enculturation (behavior, values, and community participation) on gender role attitudes and IPV‐supporting attitudes among married respondents (N = 373). Analyses also accounted for the effects of respondent age, education, religious service attendance, perceived financial difficulty, and <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in the US. The second‐order, overall construct of enculturation was the strongest predictor of IPV‐supporting attitudes (standardized B = 0. 61), but not gender role attitudes. Patriarchal gender role attitudes were positively associated with IPV‐supporting attitudes (B = 0. 49). In addition to the overall effect of the enculturation construct, two of the components of enculturation had specific effects. “Enculturation‐values” had a specific positive indirect association with IPV‐supporting attitudes, through its relationship with patriarchal gender role attitudes. However, “enculturation‐community participation” was negatively associated with IPV‐supporting attitudes, suggesting the importance of community‐based prevention of IPV among this immigrant population group...|$|R
