500|$|Nellee Hooper {{produced}} {{another new}} {{addition to the}} compilation, the cover version of Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Want You". After Madonna accepted Hooper's suggestion to collaborate with Massive Attack, the band sent Madonna {{the music of the}} song first. Robert [...] "3D" [...] Del Naja, one of the band members, subsequently went to New York with Hooper and worked in the studio for two days. Del Naja said, [...] "I think the really cool thing about {{it was the fact that}} [...] sang it so beautifully. There was no special effects, no messing around—it was just in there singing it with a lot of passion and soul." [...] The opening track of the compilation, [...] "I Want You" [...] starts with a long introduction featuring a hip-hop drum beat with emphasis on the bass section of the instrumental alongside a semi-tonal string figure. The second verse features a harp and a repeating drum loop accompanied with a telephone style bleeping sound. Madonna's vocals at times are accompanied by spoken passages with her overall vocals dominating the track, with lyrics discussing a man that no longer wants her, while she is determined to change his mind. The compilation closes with the orchestral version of [...] "I Want You" [...] in which the original drum track, bass and percussion are removed. The version starts slower with Madonna's vocals entering with a <b>low</b> <b>string</b> bass line only, gradually more string arrangements are added with harp and brass featured in the background of the mix. A moment towards the end of the track hears her voice with no accompaniment creating a [...] "dramatic" [...] theme, and overall the version features around 20 seconds less than the original.|$|E
2500|$|The {{harpsichord}} {{was most}} probably invented {{in the late}} Middle Ages. [...] By the 16th century, harpsichord makers in Italy were making lightweight instruments with <b>low</b> <b>string</b> tension. [...] A different approach was taken in the Southern Netherlands starting in the late 16th century, notably by the Ruckers family. [...] Their harpsichords used a heavier construction and produced a more powerful and distinctive tone. [...] They included the first harpsichords with two keyboards, used for transposition.|$|E
2500|$|... 1953 Fender Telecaster - The guitar most {{associated}} with Richards, he acquired this butterscotch Telecaster in 1971. Nicknamed [...] "Micawber", after {{a character in}} Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, it is set up for five-string open-G tuning (-GDGBD), and has an aftermarket bridge made of brass, with individual saddles rather than the 3 the original bridge would have had. Richards has removed the saddle for the <b>low</b> <b>string.</b> The neck pick-up {{has been replaced by}} Ted Newman Jones with a Gibson PAF humbucking pick-up, and the bridge pick-up {{has been replaced by a}} Fender lap steel pick-up (similar to a Fender Broadcaster pick-up). [...] "Micawber" [...] is one of Richards' main stage guitars, and is often used to play [...] "Brown Sugar", [...] "Before They Make Me Run", and [...] "Honky Tonk Women".|$|E

2500|$|A dropped tuning {{starts with}} {{standard}} tuning and typically lowers the pitch ("drops") {{of only a}} single string, or (rarely) two strings. [...] This is almost always the lowest pitched (E) string on the guitar, although occasionally the A string may be lowered. [...] The Drop D tuning, for example, is common in classical guitar [...] and heavy metal music. [...] For it, the low E string is tuned down one whole step, to a low D, {{and the rest of}} the guitar remains in standard tuning. This creates an 'open power chord' (three-note fifth) with the low three strings (DAD). Many heavy rock guitarists have adopted a [...] "Low C" [...] tuning by either dropping the <b>low</b> <b>string</b> 2 whole steps to a C, or a Drop D tuning another whole step down across all strings. In most cases, Drop C requires a heavier gauge string to maintain tone and prevent buzzing against the frets.|$|E

5000|$|Instruments using {{reentrant}} tuning (e.g., the charango) {{may have}} a high string before a <b>low</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dobros use a full six-string tuning with {{a bottom}} G: G-B-D-G-B-D, low to high. The two <b>lowest</b> <b>strings</b> are, accordingly, tuned three semitones {{higher for the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> (from E up to G) and two semitones higher for the second-lowest string (from A up to B) while the highest string is tuned two semitones lower (from E down to D), {{relative}} to standard tuning.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{class of}} {{alternative}} tunings are called drop tunings, because the tuning drops down the <b>lowest</b> <b>string.</b> Dropping down the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> a whole tone {{results in the}} [...] "drop-D" [...] (or [...] "dropped D") tuning. Its open-string notes DADGBE (from low to high) allow for a deep bass D note, {{which can be used}} in keys such as D major, d minor and G major. It simplifies the playing of simple fifths (powerchords). Many contemporary rock bands re-tune all strings down, making, for example, Drop-C or Drop-B tunings.|$|R
50|$|The {{dramatic}} slow movement contains {{much in the}} way {{of march}} rhythm and sudden upward violin glides followed by drops to the <b>lowest</b> <b>string,</b> and again much use of tremolo.|$|R
5000|$|Kamelot - on albums 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, {{and half}} of the songs from album 9. In some songs, the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> is dropped a whole step.|$|R
50|$|<b>Low</b> <b>string</b> action (distance between {{string and}} fret wire) {{results from a}} non-elevated zero fret when using same {{fingerboard}} fret wire size. On some guitars {{it may be necessary}} to raise the bridge saddle height for a small amount.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the bow {{as well as the}} stiff outer limbs {{contribute}} to having a <b>low</b> <b>string</b> angle at the tips. This reduces stacking: the exponential increase in draw weight at longer draw lengths. A lower stacking bow is smoother to draw.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} (now called [...] "Classic") tuning {{consists of}} 5 bass strings (6 on the Grand Sticks), tuned upwards in all-fifths tuning, with the <b>low</b> <b>string</b> {{in the middle}} of the fretboard, and 5 melody strings (6 on Grand Stick), tuned upwards in all-fourths tuning, again with the <b>low</b> <b>string</b> {{in the middle of}} the fretboard. The hardware is fully adjustable to accommodate any gauge string at any position. On the 36"-scale instrument notes can range from low C (above B on a 5-string bass) to high D (a whole step below the high E string on guitar). On the two guitar-scale models (Alto Stick and Stick Guitar) the notes range from F below guitar low E to F# above guitar high E.|$|E
50|$|Another dropped A tuning is AGCFAD ("drop perfect {{fourth in}} the key of the D", i.e. whole guitar is tuned down one step, then the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> is dropped to A).|$|R

5000|$|The {{instrument}} is an eight string guitar, adding both a high and a <b>low</b> <b>string</b> {{to the conventional}} six string guitar. The tuning continues in fourths and the frets are fanned {{to allow for the}} different string lengths. The instrument also has an external, box-shaped resonator, increasing its volume.|$|E
5000|$|The rest of {{the song}} minus the double bass breaks {{features}} mixolydian single-note downtempo riffs played on the <b>low</b> <b>string,</b> and an Eb/E power chord progression that adds a major 12th on the first chord that does not move on the second one, which is reminiscent of Around the Fur-era Deftones.|$|E
50|$|The seating {{capacity}} is large (around 2,600 seats) and the sidewalls are too far apart to provide early reflections {{to the center}} seats. The ceiling is high to increase reverberation time but the clouds are too high to reinforce early reflections adequately. The bass is weak because the very large stage does not adequately reinforce the <b>low</b> <b>string</b> instruments.|$|E
50|$|The minuet {{features}} a canon {{between high and}} <b>low</b> <b>strings</b> at the interval of a single bar. Mozart likely learned this technique from Joseph Haydn's 23rd Symphony from 1764 (also in G major).|$|R

5000|$|Stokowski's opening [...] "Promenade" [...] is less showy than Ravel's brass fanfare; it {{is instead}} mainly given to <b>low</b> <b>strings</b> and woodwinds, {{creating}} deep, chorale-like textures. The brass {{do not enter}} until near the end.|$|R
5000|$|Guitarist Dan Donegan has {{mentioned}} that the tuning for the guitar [...] "is drop C-sharp... your bottom five strings are half a step down and your <b>low</b> <b>string</b> will be dropped to C-sharp." [...] This is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "E Drop D", the most common drop tuning for bands who play generally in E standard instead of E standard.|$|E
50|$|A multi-scale {{fingerboard}} or fretboard {{is typically}} {{based on two}} scale lengths, but could potentially incorporate more. The most typical use is one (long) scale length for the <b>low</b> <b>string</b> and a different, usually shorter, scale for the highest string. This could be achieved by angling the nut, and bridge, and fanning the frets. Strings between the highest and lowest would also each have a unique scale length.|$|E
