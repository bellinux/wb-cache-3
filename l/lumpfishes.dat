The prevalence for all coastal fish (n = 4427) pooled was 15 %, and there were great differences between fish species and seasons. <b>Lumpfish</b> Cyclopterus lumpus L. spawners were the most infected fish, with a prevalence of 61 % and a median intensity of 4 lice fish– 1, whereas gadids had a mean prevalence of 19 % and a median infection of 1 to 2 lice fish– 1. Sea trout Salmo trutta L. and herring Clupea harengus L. carried C. elongatus at prevalence values of 29 and 21 %, respectively. The results were compared with infection data for immature North Sea <b>lumpfish.</b> <b>Lumpfish</b> spawners caught on the coast in March to April had fewer lice than North Sea <b>lumpfish</b> in July. Spawners carried mostly adult lice, as did coastal fish hosts in May to June. The low development rates of lice at low spring temperatures and new genetic data suggest that the May to June adult lice could not have been offspring of the March to April lice, indicating transfer of adult lice to coastal fish. Most coastal fish species appeared to acquire new C. elongatus infections between May to June and September.

We have therefore tested and developed protocols for bath immersion for three commonly used anaesthetics metacaine (Finquel, buffered tricaine methanesulfonate, MS- 222 and Tricaine Pharmaq), benzocaine (Benzoak vet) and isoeugenol (Aqui-S), determined concentration for normal and fast anaesthesia and evaluated safety margin for each condition. Also, a behavioral matrix has been developed. We have examined the effect of fish size (10 - 20 g, 200 - 400 g and 600 - 1300 g) and sea water temperature (6 °C and 12 °C). We found that 200 mg L- 1 metacaine is an efficient dose for deep narcosis independently for fish size and temperature due to good safety margins with regards to both exposure times and doses. However, for many tasks lighter anaesthesia is sufficient, and then 100 mg L- 1 metacaine can be used. Benzocaine is less efficient than metacaine, but can be used as anaesthetic of fish 600 g), benzocaine is not suitable.

40|$|The <b>lumpfish,</b> Cyclopterus lumpus L. is an {{emerging}} and most promising aquaculture fish currently {{used for a}} biological control against sea lice in salmonids. However, the <b>lumpfish</b> is prone {{to a number of}} bacterial diseases including vibriosis, atypical furunculosis and pasteurellosis. The use of vaccines in aquaculture {{has been one of the}} best prophylactic measures against fish bacterial diseases; vaccines can protect the <b>lumpfish</b> from bacterial diseases. Thus, it is essential to investigate the adaptive humoral immune response of the <b>lumpfish</b> in order to develop protective vaccines against the bacterial diseases. This work is the first to study the adaptive humoral immune response of the <b>lumpfish</b> in response to immunization with formalin inactivated whole bacteria (WB) antigens and challenge with different Gram-negative bacteria after vaccination or without vaccination. Immunization was conducted against two atypical A. salmonicida, V. anguillarum O 2, Pasteurella spp. and V. ordalii. Analysis of the different <b>lumpfish</b> antisera using sonicated WB antigens by ELISA and western blot revealed the presence of strong specific or cross-reactive antibodies two weeks post immunization. The antisera to both atypical A. salmonicida strains had antibodies that detected common antigenic components directed to ca. 10, 13, 20, 22, 28, 50 and 55 kDa proteins. However, antibodies to one of the atypical strains (8546) did not recognize the 50 -kDa protein from the heterogeneous antigen (AL 20460) on the western blot. The absence of the 50 -kDa protein in one of the atypical A. salmonicida may contribute to differences in the level of specific antibody response. Antibodies to strain AL 122 (V. anguillarum O 2) reacted strongly with a 14 -kDa antigenic component of heterogeneous antigens from strains 8752 (V. anguillarum O 1) and strain 8657 (V. ordalii). The Pasteurella spp. induced the highest level of antibodies directed to 100 and 20 kDa proteins of a homogeneous antigen. Moreover, antibodies to Pasteurella spp. reacted with 100, 73, 37 and 20 kDa protein components of a heterogeneous antigen from P. skyensis. However, V. ordalii induced the lowest antibody response; no specific antibodies were detected in antisera to V. ordalii by the western blot analysis. The <b>lumpfish’s</b> specific humoral immune system showed strong antibody response to vaccination post challenge (i. p.) with strains 8546 (atypical A. salmonicida), AL 20460 (atypical A. salmonicida), 8752 (V. anguillarum) and Pasteurella spp. The trivalent and the commercial AMM 3 vaccines against atypical furunculosis showed higher antibody levels after challenge with strain 8546 (atypical A. salmonicida) than challenge with strain AL 20460 (atypical A. salmonicida). The monovalent vaccines had similar effect on antibody levels after challenging with either of the atypical A. salmonicida strains. The trivalent and monovalent vaccines against Vibriosis induced similar amount of antibodies post challenge with strain 8752 (V. anguillarum). However, the non-vaccinated groups, in general, displayed low antibody levels post challenge with post challenge with strains of the atypical A. salmonicida, 8752 (V. anguillarum O 1), and Pasteurella spp. by any of the challenge exposures (bath, i. p., or cohabitation). These results indicate that the use of the vaccines in the <b>lumpfish</b> may play a protective role against some of the bacterial diseases; however, further studies are needed. Moreover, total serum IgM in the <b>lumpfish</b> was quantified by single radial immunodiffusion assay. The mean total IgM (mg/ml) post immunization for the different groups was estimated at the range of 1. 02 to 0. 41 mg/ml, which is in the range also found in other fish species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Sex ratio {{data can}} provide {{information}} about mortality rates, which may be especially useful for sex-specific fisheries when little other information is available. In this paper, we develop a theory and methods relating sex ratio to mortality rates and apply them to data for <b>lumpfish</b> Cyclopterus lumpus on the southern Newfoundland Shelf. If the sexes have different mortality rates, and the rates as well as recruitment are constant with age and time, the sex ratio of the population provides {{an estimate of the}} ratio of the instantaneous mortality rates of the sexes. If a cohort can be followed over time, changes in the sex ratio provide an estimate of the ratio of the survival rates of the sexes or the difference in the instantaneous mortality rates. With the latter approach, it is not necessary for the sexes to have equal catchabilities in the survey nor for recruitment to be constant over time. This approach involves fewer assumptions and is of greater general interest, but it requires that cohorts be identified either by aging or tagging the fish. For <b>lumpfish,</b> we used sex ratio data from a research survey to estimate the change in the mortality rate of females, which are the subject of a sex-specific roe fishery. Unfortunately, {{it is not possible to}} follow cohorts of <b>lumpfish</b> over time because <b>lumpfish</b> caught in the survey are not aged. Nonetheless, the sex ratio (females: males) decreased progressively from approximately 2. 24 i...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the early}} 2000 s, {{experimental}} rearing of spotted wolffish, Anarhichas minor, {{was started in}} Iceland. Health surveillance, carried out at regular intervals during the rearing period, revealed persistent and highly prevalent Kudoa infections of fish muscles which caused great financial losses due to post mortem myoliquefaction. In addition, during the traditional process of drying and smoking wild Atlantic <b>lumpfish,</b> Cyclopterus lumpus, the muscles from some fish almost completely disappear and the fish have to be discarded. To describe the etiological agent responsible for these conditions, spotted wolffish, Atlantic wolffish Anarhichas lupus, northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus and Atlantic <b>lumpfish</b> were caught off the Icelandic coast and examined {{for the presence of}} Kudoa. We describe a novel myxosporean, Kudoa islandica n. sp., using morphological and molecular data, and show with histopathology that it causes extensive myoliquefaction in three different wild fish hosts, which all are commercially valuable species in Iceland. Although some spore dimensions varied significantly between fish species, the molecular analyses showed that the same parasite was responsible for infection in all fish. The northern wolffish was not found to be infected. Although robustly placed in the Kudoa clade in phylogenetic analyses, K. islandica was phylogenetically distinct from other kudoids. A single myxosporean, K. islandica, is responsible for the infections in the somatic muscles of <b>lumpfish</b> and wolffish, causing extensive post mortem myoliquefaction. This myxosporean is likely to infect other fish species and it is important to study its life cycle in order to evaluate any threat to salmonid culture via the use of <b>lumpfish</b> as a biocontrol for sea lice...|$|R

40|$|This thesis uses {{studies of}} {{physiology}} and behaviour {{to better understand}} the foraging and predator-avoidance tradeoffs experienced by young marine fishes. It has previously been speculated that, due to their small size and high growth rates, larval and juvenile fish may have a limited aerobic capacity compared to adult individuals. This could be an important constraint influencing the behavioural ecology of young fishes, but has been difficult to evaluate because there has been no single study to examine changes in metabolic rate or aerobic scope for any fish species over their entire life history. Thus, an important first step in this thesis was to examine the standard (minimal) metabolism, maximal metabolism, and aerobic scope for three species of north Atlantic marine fish (shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpius, ocean pout Zoarces americanus, and <b>lumpfish</b> Cyclopterus lumpus) from the larval stage until adulthood. This research showed that young fish have a greatly increased mass-specific metabolic demand compared to adults, and that their aerobic scope is vastly diminished. The results also suggest that the relationship between aerobic scope and life history stage is greatly influenced by a species' developmental trajectory. [...] A second group of projects then investigated the effects of increased mass-specific metabolic demand on anti-predator behaviour in young marine fishes. It is known that most animals will reduce foraging while in the presence of predatory threat, but that individuals are often more risky (i. e. they will continue to forage) during times when they are hungry or have increased energetic requirements. However, despite their high mass-specific energy demands, it was observed that young ocean pout and larval shorthorn sculpin both display large foraging reductions when exposed to predators. Due to the high energetic requirements of these fishes, these results suggest that these foraging interruptions could be very costly. To support this view, these studies also found that frequent, prolonged exposures to a predatory threat caused reduced growth, decreased lipid stores, and reduced ability to acquire certain essential dietary fatty acids that are crucial for normal development. [...] A final study then examined how a limited aerobic scope may affect the choice of foraging strategy in young <b>lumpfish</b> - a species that can either actively forage by swimming, or use a "sit-and-wait" foraging strategy while clinging to the substrate using a ventral adhesive disc. Behavioural observations showed that <b>lumpfish</b> predominantly use the 'cling' foraging strategy when prey is abundant, but resort to the more costly 'swim' strategy to seek out food when prey is scarce. The metabolic cost of active foraging was also quantified using swim-tunnel respirometry, and a model was devised to predict the prey density at which <b>lumpfish</b> should switch between foraging modes to maximize energy intake. The results of this model do not agree with previous observations of <b>lumpfish</b> behaviour, and thus it appears that juvenile <b>lumpfish</b> do not try to maximize their net energetic gain. Instead, the data suggest that juvenile <b>lumpfish</b> forage in a manner that reduces activity and conserves space in their limited aerobic scope...|$|R
