2500|$|Zakaria [...] "may {{have more}} {{intellectual}} range and insights {{than any other}} public thinker in the West," [...] wrote David Shribman in The Boston Globe. In 2003, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told New York Magazine that Zakaria “has a first-class mind and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> things that run against conventional wisdom.” However, in 2011, the editors of The New Republic included him in a list of [...] "over-rated thinkers" [...] and commented, [...] "There's something suspicious about a thinker always so perfectly {{in tune with the}} moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Instead, Stevens {{was offered}} {{a job with the}} Fairbanks, Alaska, law firm of Emil Usibelli's Alaska attorney, Charles Clasby, whose firm—Collins and Clasby—had just lost one of its attorneys. Stevens and his wife had met and liked both Usibelli and Clasby, and decided to make the move. Loading up their 1947 Buick and {{traveling}} on a $600 loan from Clasby, they drove across country from Washington, D.C., and up the Alaska Highway in the dead of winter, arriving in Fairbanks in February 1953. Stevens later recalled kidding Gov. Walter Hickel about the loan. [...] "He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he came to Alaska with 38 cents in his pocket," [...] he said of Hickel. [...] "I came $600 in debt." [...] Ann Stevens recalled in 1968 that they made the move to Alaska [...] "on a six-month trial basis." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have accused}} Slaughterhouse-Five {{of being a}} quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim {{believes}} {{that the notion of}} free will is a quaint Earthling illusion. The problem, according to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, is that [...] "Vonnegut's critics seem to think that he is saying the same thing [...] For Anthony Burgess, [...] "Slaughterhouse is a kind of evasion—in a sense, like J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan—in which we’re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy..." [...] For Charles Harris, [...] "The main idea emerging from Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance." [...] For Alfred Kazin, [...] "Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden... He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, 'So it goes.'" [...] For Tanner, [...] "Vonnegut has... total sympathy with such quietistic impulses." [...] The same notion is found throughout The Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut’s most loyal academic fans.|$|E

Mrs. Bhaer {{named him}} because she <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Christopher Columbus, {{and no one}} minds it if she means the dog," [...] {{answered}} Tommy, {{in the tone of}} a show-man displaying his menagerie. [...] "The white pup is Rob's, and the yellow one is Teddy's. A man was going to drown them in our pond, and Pa Bhaer wouldn't let him. They do well enough for the little chaps, I don't think much of 'em myself. Their names are Castor and Pollux." ...|$|E
60|$|Danny Meadow Mouse is timid. Everybody says so, {{and what}} {{everybody}} says {{ought to be}} so. But just as anybody can make a mistake sometimes, so can everybody. Still, in this case, it is quite likely that everybody is right. Danny Meadow Mouse is timid. Ask Peter Rabbit. Ask Sammy Jay. Ask Striped Chipmunk. They will all tell you the same thing. Sammy Jay might even tell you that Danny is afraid of his own shadow, or that he tries {{to run away from}} his own tail. Of course this isn't true. Sammy Jay <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> mean things. It isn't fair to Danny Meadow Mouse to believe what Sammy Jay says.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good; Hawkeye has not a forked tongue, and he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what he thinks. He is an {{acquaintance}} of the Muskrat," [...] this was the name by which all the Indians designated Hutter--"and has lived in his wigwam. But {{he is not a}} friend. He wants no scalps, like a miserable Indian, but fights like a stout-hearted pale-face. The Muskrat is neither white, nor red. Neither a beast nor a fish. He is a water snake; sometimes in the spring and sometimes on the land. He looks for scalps, like an outcast. Hawkeye can go back and tell him how he has outwitted the Hurons, how he has escaped, and when his eyes are in a fog, when he can't see as far as from his cabin to the shore, then Hawkeye can open the door for the Hurons. And how will the plunder be divided? Why, Hawkeye, will carry away the most, and the Hurons will take what he may choose to leave behind him. The scalps can go to Canada, for a pale-face has no satisfaction in them." ...|$|E
