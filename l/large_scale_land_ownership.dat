2500|$|From the 8th century BCE, {{tensions}} grew {{between the}} great landowners and the peasants, who were finding it {{more and more}} difficult to survive. [...] This can probably be explained by population growth brought on by reduced infant mortality, and aggravated by the practice of equally subdividing land amongst several inheritors each generation (attested to by both Homer and Hesiod). [...] In Athens, the crisis was resolved with the arrival of Solon in 594 BCE. He forbade [...] and introduced other measures intended to help the peasants. [...] In the 5th century BCE, the practice of liturgy ( [...] / leitourgia - literally, [...] "public work") placed the responsibility for provision of public services heavily on the shoulders of the rich, and led to a reduction in <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> <b>ownership.</b> [...] It is estimated that most citizens of hoplite rank owned around 5 hectares of land. [...] In Sparta, the reforms of Lycurgus led to a drastic redistribution of land, with 10 to 18 hectare lots (kleroi) distributed to each citizen. Elsewhere, tyrants undertook redistributions of land seized from wealthy political enemies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> {{investments}} {{on the health of}} children. I use household data of the 2005 and 2011 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) for Ethiopia and combine them with information of <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> investment projects provided by the Land Matrix Observatory. This data provides information about the location of the land investments and about the location of children. With this information I develop an index that indicates the level of investment intensity for each child's residential area. Taking advantage of the repeated cross sectional structure of the DHS data, I estimate the effect of an increase in the investment intensity of a child's residential area and how this effect changes over time. The results indicate that the effect is negative for children born between 2000 - 2005, but it rises over time by getting less negative or even positive for children born between 2006 - 2011. The difference-in-differences estimation with Gaussian kernel propensity score matching shows a benefit in the development status of children that are exposed to <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> investments.

40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> {{acquisitions}} {{happen again}} and again. Reasons are in food prices, production of palm oil and bio fuel and carbon offset. Substantial areas are affected, e. g. areas in size comparable with Western Europe. Beneficiaries are local elites, national governments and international companies, harmed are small holders {{who can not}} defend their rights, esp. women. Oxfam (2011) provides analyses {{and a set of}} recommendations on this subject. In the context of those recommendations from Oxfam it can be recognised that there is an urgent need for new approaches in Land Administration and Management. Conventional approaches, often of historical footings, proved to be inadequate in many jurisdictions. Flexibility is needed in relation to the way of recordation 1, the type of spatial units used, the inclusion of customary and informal rights, the data acquisition methodologies and in the accuracy of boundary delineation. It is less important to produce accurate maps. It is more important to have a complete cadastral index map and to know how accurate the map is. For instance, highly rigorous and accurate methodologies as practiced by registered or licensed surveyors are not pro-poor approaches and take very long to cover a whole region. A more flexible approach in Land Administration and Management may result in fast availability of a cadastral map with a related registry of all (formal, informal, customary) in an area. This can then be used as a (more) solid base for <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> acquisitions. The paper investigates up to which level the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) can contribute to a fair approach in <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> acquisition.

40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> {{acquisition}} {{for commercial}} agriculture is a fast-evolving {{type of investment}} in many developing countries. However, such investments entail negative impacts particularly on the local communities, who see their livelihoods hampered by land acquisitions. This study examined the socio-economic and environmental impacts of <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> acquisition on local livelihoods in Bako Tibe woreda of Oromia National Regional State, Ethiopia. The analysis is done {{on the basis of}} the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Approach. Data was collected through household interviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, direct observation and field notes of the researcher. Besides, secondary data have also been drawn from various sources to complement the primary data. After analyzing the data set, the study found that the investment project has no significant social benefits to the local communities, as measured by technological transfer, employment opportunity, crop production and local infrastructure development. It is also determined that the project has negative impacts on local economy in terms of loss of grazing land, crop land, grass land, firewood and water resources; all of which have negatively affected local livelihoods. Moreover, the investment project has negative environmental effects as demonstrated by clearing of vegetation cover, depletion of water resources and soil degradation. Thus, it is concluded that the <b>Large</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Land</b> Acquisition in the study area has adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts on local livelihoods. The study then identified the coping strategies pursued by local communities in response to the impacts of the land acquisition. These strategies include changing land use, sharecropping, tenant farming, changing occupation and migration. Lastly, recommendations have been forwarded to stakeholders in order to enable them address the socio-economic and environmental impacts of land acquisitions on local livelihoods.

Higher spatial resolution remote sensing time series data can improve classification results under these difficult conditions. While most <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>land</b> cover mapping attempts rely on moderate resolution data, PROBA-V provides five-daily time series at 100 m spatial resolution. This improves spatial detail and resilience against high cloud cover, but increases the data load.

We demonstrate this with PROBA-V 100 m time series data from 2014 – 2015, using temporal metrics and cloud filtering in combination with in-situ training data and machine learning, implemented on the ESA (European Space Agency) Cloud Toolbox infrastructure. We apply our approach to two use cases for a large study area over West Africa: land- and forest cover classification. Our land cover classification reaches a 7 % to 21 % higher overall accuracy when compared to four global land cover maps (i. e., Globcover- 2009, Cover-CCI- 2010, MODIS- 2010, and Globeland 30).
