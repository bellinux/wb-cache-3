25|$|Between 1951 and 1969, {{a limited}} number of O gauge train sets were {{manufactured}} in the Soviet Union. Utilizing the same track and voltage as their U.S. counterparts, the colorful locomotives and cars resembled pre-World War II designs from U.S. manufacturers Lionel and American Flyer and the couplers were nearly identical to those of pre-war American Flyer. Some differences in U.S. and Soviet railroading were evident from comparing the Soviet sets with U.S. sets, particularly {{in the design of the}} boxcar, which looked <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> Flyer boxcar with windows added, reflecting the Soviets' use of box cars to haul livestock, as well as merchandise.|$|E
25|$|Personally, Mailer strived to {{seek out}} and trace racial {{stereotypes}} throughout his own personal life. Mailer focused {{on the idea of}} black sexuality, and the challenge that black masculinity created for white masculinity. Mailer focused on Jazz as the ultimate expression of African American bravado, and figures like Miles Davis would become represented in works <b>like</b> <b>An</b> <b>American</b> Dream. To Mailer, African American men reflected a challenge to his own notions of masculinity. And his often-rough understanding of race would be drawn back to his ideas on African American sexuality, and competition. Mailer’s understanding of race was more a curiosity rather than bigotry. But his works stood out to some critics as insensitive and overtly racist, mainly because they were based on a foundation of racist tropes and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|When {{design work}} began in November 1940, the AC1 was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} 2 pounder gun-equipped vehicle, that was intended to be a true Cruiser tank, with a weight of between 16 and 20 tonnes. Due to a lack of home grown experience in tank design a mission was sent to the US to examine the M3 design and Colonel W.D. Watson MC, an artillery officer with many years of tank design experience was provided by the UK. He arrived in December 1940. Like the Canadian Ram, the Australian Cruiser was {{to be based on the}} engine, drive train, and lower hull of the American M3 Medium tank, mated to an upper hull and turret built closely along the lines of a British Crusader. By 1942, attempting to keep pace with German tank developments, the design specification had become more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> medium tank, resulting in a heavier design and a higher silhouette profile.|$|E

500|$|As a dual Canadian and American citizen, Hull was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} either country internationally. While playing at UMD, he was passed over by officials with Team Canada when they selected their roster for the 1986 World Ice Hockey Championships. However, the American national team invited him to join their squad. Hull accepted and led the team in scoring with 7 goals and 11 points for the sixth place Americans. Hull later said the faith shown in him by American officials gave him the confidence to excel in his career. He played with Team USA {{for the rest of}} his career, and at the 1986 Calgary Cup tournament, played a pivotal role in a 5–3 upset of Canada by the Americans. [...] Following the game, he said [...] "I don't feel more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> than a Canadian. [...] I just want to play." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of both teams' supporters reacted negatively to the merger proposal. While many Oxford supporters acknowledged that Maxwell had {{been instrumental in}} saving the club the previous year, most perceived merging with another club as tantamount to killing both Oxford United and professional football in the city. A spokesman for the Oxford United Supporters Club called the idea [...] "crazy and unworkable". Most Reading fans likewise reacted to the scheme with revulsion; Mike Habbits, chairman of the Reading Supporters Club, said [...] "Our fans can't stand Oxford fans and I can't see them travelling to Oxford to watch the new team". Supporters and pressmen alike ridiculed the [...] "Thames Valley Royals" [...] name, which the sports historian John Bale later described as [...] "mid-Atlantic"; observers at the time variously perceived it as sounding more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> football, ice hockey or speedway team than a football club. Some Oxford fans supported Maxwell's proposal, saying that with a new stadium and the pooled financial resources of Oxford and Reading, an amalgamated team might be successful, but these were a minority. One angry fan wrote to the Oxford Mail that [...] "I will not follow Thames Valley Royals or whatever their name is if they played {{at the end of}} my street".|$|E

500|$|The year 1959 was professionally {{disastrous}} for Hordern. He made {{a return to}} stage at the Old Vic in Arthur Wing Pinero's The Magistrate in which he played Mr. Posket. The play was not particularly successful and received mixed reviews: According to the author and theatre critic J. P. Wearing, Hordern was miscast, while a reporter for The Stage, thought he gave a [...] "convincing portrayal". Wearing believed that overall the play was not [...] "played briskly enough", while a critic for The Times thought that it had [...] "durable theatrical quality". [...] The role was followed with a part of Pastor Manders in Ghosts opposite Flora Robson. The Sunday Times published an unenthusiastic notice, and thought Hordern's character had [...] "an anxious air" [...] about him. He received equally critical notices when he took to the stage to play the title character in Macbeth, opposite Beatrix Lehmann. The press wrote of Hordern's [...] "unintended comic interpretation" [...] when characterising the evil king: [...] "Half his time on stage he cringed <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> carpet seller in an ankle-length black dressing gown of fuzzy candlewick" [...] thought one reviewer, {{who went on to}} say [...] "he would make a sinister Shylock, a frightening Fagin.

Birmingham also featured widely in his work. [...] "As I Walked Out One Evening", one of his best-known early poems, moves a ballad constructed {{from a series of}} allusions to folksong and popular culture into the decidedly 20th century context of Bristol Street in Birmingham City Centre. In [...] "Letter to Lord Byron" [...] he rejects the Lake District idyll of William Wordsworth in favour of a decisive if irony-tinged commitment to the contemporary urban landscape of the Midlands, declaring [...] "Clearer the Scafell Pike, my heart has stamped on / The view from Birmingham to Wolverhampton"; before continuing [...] "Tramlines and slagheaps, pieces of machinery / That was, and still is, my ideal scenery". The wider influence of the city on Auden's outlook and work was noted in 1945 by the American critic Edmund Wilson who observed that Auden [...] "in fundamental ways ... doesn't belong in that London literary world – he's more vigorous and more advanced. With his Birmingham background ... he is in some ways more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American.</b> He is really extremely tough – cares nothing about property or money, popularity or social prestige-does everything on his own and alone." ...|$|E

[...] Daniel Rivera of PopMatters cited the album as Robyn's [...] "most honest and infectious outing to date" [...] and noted that [...] "the most impressive thing about Robyn is just how timeless it is proving to be." [...] Stylus Magazine's Jessica Popper wrote that the album [...] "manages to combine several of the currently popular music genres whilst still making a perfect pop album [...] It's {{one of the few}} Europop albums that not only deserves worldwide domination, but also has a really good chance of achieving it." [...] In a review for the Manchester Evening News, Paul Taylor described the album as [...] "undeniably sexy" [...] and dubbed Robyn [...] "a mini-Madonna in the making". Billboards Jill Menze commended the album for its [...] "sassy and sweet dance pop gems". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau commented that he was [...] " [...] disoriented by the hype for 'With Every Heartbeat' [...] But without that add-on, which does grow on you the way pop breakthroughs will sometimes, this 2005 EU release might never have materialized here to prepare the way for Robyn 2010". James Hunter of The Village Voice complimented its [...] "fast electro arrangements tending toward the geometric" [...] and found that [...] " [...] appeal is questionable when she tries to sound <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> rapper, but on tracks where she just sings [...] she gives Europop a swift Swedish energy and presence". Pitchfork reviewer Jess Harvell felt that Robyn's [...] "pop fun is a bit knowing—she's 26 after all. But trust the Swedes. They know what they're doing with this sort of thing." ...|$|E
