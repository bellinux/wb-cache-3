50|$|The {{structuring}} of cemevi as {{into their}} present characteristics and rites owes {{much to the}} Bektashi tradition within various historical currents of Turkey's Alevi culture. Urbanization of many Alevis also brought changes in the conception of cem. In larger towns in Turkey today, cemevi are multifunctional buildings where {{a broad range of}} cultural activities take place. In Turkey, it is always problematic for a cemevi to get off the ground, due to strict state interference in religious matters, and cases of discrimination against the Alevis, which results in the founding of each cemevi acquiring political dimensions and necessitating case-by-case <b>lobbyism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hallin and Mancini {{identify}} {{the distinction between}} rational-legal authority and clientelism as another crucial dimension. Following Max Weber, Hallin and Mancini use the term rational-legal authority in its meaning {{as a form of}} governance whose main influence is maintained through formal and universalistic rules of procedure, i.e. an independent and autonomous administrative apparatus not affected by political and economic interests or <b>lobbyism.</b> This apparatus is the main institution of an efficient rational-legal system. In contrast, the orientation on common interests is much weaker within clientelism systems because individual interests and private relationships are the main forces maintaining the social organization. Consequently, “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for deference and various forms of support”.|$|E

He served in the Swedish army, and in 1697 was promoted major of the Swedish garrison in Riga. During the Great Northern War, he first served Augustus the Strong of Saxe-Poland-Lithuania, and after taking an ambiguous stance towards August and Peter the Great of Russia entered Peter's service after the Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710. He served as Peter the Great's plenipotentiary of Livonia during the same year, and held that office until 1713, when he became hofmeister {{in the service of}} Princess Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, wife of Peter's son Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia.|$|E
5000|$|Major {{challenges}} of the EU concerning WSS are connected with modern pressures to the system. Climate change, demographic developments, urbanization, economic progress, social changes influence the water sector in many ways. The European Union {{is said to be}} very effective concerning water management and policies. However, especially the new member states located in Eastern Europe are in need of enormous investments in the WSS sector [...] The existing and foreseen problems are the lack of investments in the rural and municipal water supply which led to poor services (e.g. lacking water pipes, insufficient water availability during drought, etc.), the limited availability of water resources and simply a lack of time. Technologies are actually available but most of them are too expensive or far too time consuming to implement simultaneously with ongoing progress and changes. Water supply limitation counts as major concern. Research in this direction shows that water reuse and recycling are solutions for that in a long-term. Furthermore, expert's advices say that water supply and waste water treatment systems should be decentralised.Another challenge within the water sector in Europe is privatisation and <b>lobbyism</b> in the water sector. In France, recent problems emerged regarding the privatising of water supply companies.|$|E
40|$|Has the EU Directive Proposal on CO 2 trade been {{influenced}} by <b>lobbyism</b> and can it be improved? After hypothesizing how the EU may be vulnerable to <b>lobbyism</b> and why industrial groups have a strong incentive to lobby for favourable environmental regulation, we turn to empirical evidence concerning design. Here, {{it is possible to}} measure <b>lobbyism</b> as the difference in proposed design between the Green Paper (before <b>lobbyism)</b> and the final Directive Proposal (after <b>lobbyism).</b> Overall we suggest that this <b>lobbyism</b> affected the design of the EU CO 2 market in favour of small-sized and well-organised industrial interest groups {{at the expense of the}} EU tax payers. Most critically, allocation of permits and enforcement issues are to be dealt with at the member state level rather than the supranational level allowing member states to favour their domestic industries. A likely market breakdown means less economic growth in the EU because the gains from free trade of greenhouse gas permits among firms in different member states disappear. Therefore, we discuss, based on the US emission trade experience, how the current design proposal can be improved.

This makes <b>lobbyism</b> more relevant than ever.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of Swedish <b>lobbyism</b> {{is so far}} insufficient and misguided. In order to understand Swedish <b>lobbyism</b> better this thesis calls for a shift to theory testing case studies of actors that are capable to lobby in an organized and recurring way. To do this it offers a theoretical framework developed from three established theories of lobbying strategy adjusted for a Swedish context. The purpose of this framework is to chart strategies for how Swedish lobbyists lobby against Members of Parliament (MPs) and if and how these strategies influence MPs’ attitudes towards a policy. The case is the lobbying campaign for a reduced restaurant sales tax from 2000 to 2014 ending with a reduction from 25 % to 12 %. The study concludes that Swedish <b>lobbyism</b> is built from alliances, trust, perceived seriousity, and public interest, more than actual expertize of a specific topic...|$|E

There will be investigated, {{informed}} through statistics, and further explained from articles. In the project there will take point in globalization, unions and <b>lobbyism.</b> Guy Standing explains how globalization creates an internalization of labor, which helps laying a pressure on companies' competitiveness. An analysis of an investigation by Martin Maximino explains the influence difference between the average citizen and the economic elite. It concludes through the analysis that companies lower their labor cost by changing the jobs to be more part time and flexible. The unions is simultaneously decreasing, which gives the labor less pressure on the companies to give them better wages. <b>Lobbyism</b> is {{a reason for the}} unions decrease in political influence. The companies hire the lobbyist's, which creates the companies more political influence that is used to decrease the unions' possibility in mobilizing and creating an economic pressure on the companies. The labor has then more poor conditions and receives lower wages because the unions cant created influence on companies because of <b>lobbyism...</b>|$|E
40|$|The EU Commission has {{recently}} proposed a new directive establishing {{a framework for}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading within the European Union. The idea is to devalue the emission quotas in circulation by the year 2012 at latest, so that the EU will meet its Kyoto target level of an 8 % GHG reduction. Our main {{question is whether the}} final choice of allocation rule can be explained by potential industrial net winners involved in the policy making process. We answer this question by using rent-seeking theory and by analysing the Green Paper hearing replies from the main industrial groups. In other words, we want to explain and observe how rent-seeking (or <b>lobbyism)</b> affects the de-sign of environmental regulation and energy policy in favour of well-organized industrial interest groups. We argue that some firms are likely to reap a net gain from being regulated by a grandfathered emission trading system. This is so be-cause total costs of emission reduction and <b>lobbyism</b> are likely to be smaller than the total rents from having this type of regulation.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to make a {{comparative}} case study to explain the level of influence the Organic farming organizations have within European Union. The degree of influence is explained through theory on new institutionalism and the concepts of path dependency and policy networks linked to <b>lobbyism</b> applied on the common agricultural policy. The path dependence in the common agricultural policy is strong since the construction of the policy-making system in the agricultural part of EU for many years have been based on consultation policy decision making. Interest representation have massively increased in the last couple of years in the EU. The <b>lobbyism</b> impact on the EU agricultural area is therefore carefully studied to paint a picture of the importance and ability to apply pressure of organic farming within the EU...|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} decades, Sweden has {{transformed}} from a state with strong elements of corporatism, to a governance of pluralistic character. This development has opened up to {{a new form of}} participation – <b>lobbyism</b> – which since has spread and commercialized. Because of this, a report on the state of Swedish democracy – Demokratiutredningen – was issued to examine the phenomenon of <b>lobbyism</b> as it was feared to challenge the functioning of a representative democracy. The report issued a warning of the negative impact on transparency and political equality a professionalization of lobbying could have. Even some forms of regulation were thought to {{have a negative impact on}} the political equality. Since the report was released in 2000, nine bills regarding <b>lobbyism</b> have been presented to the Swedish parliament, but no regulation has yet been implemented. The report identified problems regarding transparency and political equality with both regulated and unregulated lobbying. The aim of this thesis is to examine how the parliamentary bills handle the democratic problems voiced by the report. The bills are analyzed with the ideal types of “transparency” and “political equality”, based on Robert Dahl’s ideal of democracy. The study found that the problem of transparency was of a high priority in the bills, while the problem of political equality was hardly addressed. Three of the bills actually ignored the warning issued by the report, where a regulation in the form of registration was thought to have a negative impact on political equality. The fact that the bills hardly addressed the problem of political equality, and in some cases even worsened it, represents a democratic deficit in the regulation debate. De senaste decennierna har Sverige förvandlats från en stat med starka inslag av korporativism, till ett styrelseskick med pluralistisk prägel. Utvecklingen har öppnat upp för en ny deltagandeform, <b>lobbyism,</b> som sedan dess brett ut sig och kommersialiserats. Med anledning av detta tillkallade regeringen Demokratiutredningen för att analysera lobbningen då den ansågs utmana den representativa demokratins funktionssätt. Demokratiutredningen varnade för att professionaliseringen av lobbying kunde påverka öppenheten och den politiska jämlikheten negativt. Även vissa regleringar ansågs kunna försämra den politiska jämlikheten. Sedan Demokratiutredningen överlämnade sitt slutbetänkande år 2000 har nio motioner gällande <b>lobbyism</b> lagts fram i Sveriges riksdag utan att resultera i en reglering. Demokratiutredningen identifierade demokratiproblem med både öppenhet och politisk jämlikhet i oreglerad, såväl som reglerad, <b>lobbyism.</b> Uppsatsen studerade hur motionerna i ärendet hanterat de demokratiproblem som utredningen framhävde. Studien genomfördes med idealtyper som analysverktyg. Idealtyperna, ”öppenhet” och ”politisk jämlikhet”, byggdes upp med hjälp av Robert Dahls demokratiideal. Studien fann att problemet med öppenhet uppmärksammades i hög grad av motionerna, medan politisk jämlikhet knappt hanterades alls. Tre av motionerna ignorerade till och med den varning som Demokratiutredningen utfärdade, där en reglering i form av registrering skulle påverka den politiska jämlikheten negativt. Att motionerna inte hanterar problemet med politisk jämlikhet, och i flera fall även förvärrar den, innebär ett påtagligt demokratiskt underskott i regleringsdebatten...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} the Obama administration’s “NOW IS THE TIME”-proposal on {{strengthening the}} weapon laws {{in attempt to}} reduce gun violence, focusing on the financial consequences towards the American firearms industry, including how the gun lobby tries to influence the Assault Weapons Ban {{in terms of the}} policy-processes. Foremost, this is examined in a market analysis, with which the purpose is to identify a certain market model. Furthermore the study contains a quantitative analysis of four large-scale gun makers’ assortment of rifles, shotguns and pistols, with which the project seeks to, explain the financial consequences that a passing, of the now defeated bill, would have influenced the market. Moreover the study analyses the activity of the American interest group NRA, seeking to clarify exactly how the organisation attempts to affect the policy-processes in connection with the proposed bill. Through the analysis, this study concludes that the American firearms market is best characterized as a variation of both perfect and imperfect competition, along with the oligopoly. Furthermore the project states that the American firearms industry has a financial interest in the bill not being passed in congress, since the effect of it being passed would involve a ban on many firearms on the market. Finally the study states that the NRA through <b>lobbyism</b> has attempted to influence the outcome of the bill, through different channels.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the causes of}} the incoherent reformprogram in Russia in the last decade. It argues that the slow and partial policies can be attributed to a viscous combination of <b>lobbyism</b> and constitutional design. Because the post-communist transitions after 1989 were non violent “velvet revolutions,” the old state monopolies were not removed. State monopolies have small-group advantages in contrast to the large group of private firms, which are numerous and not yet organized. It leads to an asymmetrical pattern of <b>lobbyism</b> in favor of non-transition, which can only be mitigated by establishing dispersed political institutions, that can raise the price on rent-seeking. In Russia the centralized political institutions of the past were not replaced. Hence, Russia inherited both interest groups and political institutions of the late communist era – an unfortunate starting point for carrying out comprehensive economic reforms. Free trade with the West and potential competition may put pressure on the old state monopolies. However, lobbies in the European Union may oppose free trade to maintain their monopoly. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{globalization}} causes an increasing intensity of institutional competition, i. e. competition among national suppliers of institutional arrangements for mobile factors. This {{often leads to}} the conclusion that the competence of national economic policy actors is decreasing. As a consequence, economists often expect the emergence of more efficient institutions and a diminishing of discriminating interventions caused by <b>lobbyism.</b> Other scientists and politicians suspect a desocialization of the market economy and a regime of global companies. This paper inquires how and to what extent the hope for higher political efficiency and the fear of a race-to-the-bottom concerning standards is justified from the perspective of an evolutionary theory of competition (Hayek, Kerber). Therefore, a model of institutional competition as an institutional search- and discovery process is developped which generates situative institutional knowledge via the process of voice (elections, public opinion etc.) and the process of exit and entry of mobile factors looking for individual satisficing institutional arrangements. The results of the model consist of the fact, that a general decrease of the economic policy competence cannot be stated. There is no convergence to some optimal and efficient type of economic order, too. Instead, the challenges to economic policy change; a process that entails limits to policy competence as well as the emergence of new capabilities. This denies or at least reduces the fears concerning institutional competition. Yet, one cannot exclude the possibility of <b>lobbyism</b> in institutional competition, neither, although the powerful actors may change. Finally the discussion leads to the importance of an order of institutional competition since all processes of competition depend on their institutional conditions in producing the desired effects. This is a consequence of both the ordoliberal tradition and evolutionary economic theory.

40|$|Based on {{institutional}} economics, {{the paper}} develops {{a new model}} pointing at two main reasons why Scandinavia is doing so well in economic terms, namely the level of decentralisation and social capital in its broad sense. The idea in the model is that a political system, which decentralises power, means less <b>lobbyism</b> because access to economically harmful rent seeking is more costly. Consequently, social capital and the trust in other people and the political leadership will increase. This model, suggesting one single social capital measure, is applied to countries in both Western and Eastern Europe. The social capital ranking results indeed show that Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland) is among the seven top ranking countries together with Switzerland, the Netherlands and Iceland.

Corporatist representation in the policy-making process has declined, and changes in executive-legislative relations have increased the power of parliaments. Organized interests are expected to adapt to these changing circumstances to maintain their political influence. This article shows how Danish and Norwegian interest groups have coped with the decline of corporatism and the revival of parliaments. Representation in corporatist policy-making committees and lobbying toward civil servants in government ministries have been supplemented and in some cases substituted by political <b>lobbyism</b> directed toward elected representatives in the parliament and the government.

40|$|Based on the {{political}} support function model by Hillman (1982), we consider the choice of policy instruments in environmental regulation. More specifically, we extend the Hillman model {{so that it can}} incorporate the connection between the relative strength of lobby groups, the chosen level of regulation and the choice of instrument to facilitate the achievement of this level. We apply this model to explain the shift from auction to grandfathered emission trading in the EU. When explaining this shift in policy, we focus on climate change policy and the three main interest groups, namely industry, consumers and environ-mentalists. From a pure economic point of view, taxation or auctions are clearly preferable to grandfathering. However, from our political economy model, the opposite conclusion might emerge, suggesting the counter-intuitive result that grandfathering, compared to taxation and auction, might give a stronger pres-sure to increase the emission target level.

30|$|Whereas the {{effectiveness}} of uninvited participation thus might appear unproblematic, how can we understand and justify its democratic and scientific legitimacy {{given the fact that}} a lot of civil society groups’ interventions are clearly based on particular interests or even self-interests? As is well known, in many variants of democratic theory, especially in theories of deliberative democracy, interest-based politics is seen as close to mere <b>lobbyism</b> and pressure-group politics. It therefore seems to be hardly compatible with processes of deliberation and democratically legitimate politics that usually is held to be oriented around discussing the common good “rather than competing for the promotion of the private good of each” (Young 1996 : 121). However, by closer inspection, this argument proves to be less convincing than it might appear at first sight; in what follows I will briefly argue, mainly using patient associations as an empirical illustration, that the expression of self-interest and deliberative discussion do not necessarily contradict each other and that interest-based activism can indeed be a form of legitimate participation in science and technology.|$|E

CSR discussions that primarily focus on pragmatic and cognitive conceptions of legitimacy reflect “theoretical narrowness, and missing rigor of the CSR debate, and lack of discourse on moral legitimacy” [8]. CSR and legitimacy can be more complicated and challenging for firms with global presence. Palazzo and Scherer [8] assert that current conceptualizations of CSR are built on the assumption that conformity with societal rules is the predictor of legitimacy, but the assumption does not work well in the global business context because there are no globally accepted legal or moral normative standards [72]. Along this line, Palazzo and Scherer [8] further state, “In the current transition from stable industrial society to a globalized postindustrial society, cognitive legitimacy is eroding (e.g., shareholder-value ideology, free and open market narratives, normative homogeneity) while pragmatic legitimacy (e.g., <b>lobbyism,</b> branding, strategic public relations) provokes growing resistance (e.g., anti-globalization movement, no logo movement).

One influence often kept low-key is that of the interest organisation, attempting to set the agenda to the benefit of its members.

This project is set to examine the workings of these interest organisations, and how they practice <b>lobbyism</b> in order to further their own case via closed door meetings - a black box in the legislative process. Our focus, as such, will be on the current case of buffer zones and how these agricultural interest organisations acquire their influence and thusly may enable themselves to affect legislation.
