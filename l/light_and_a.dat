5|$|An inelastic {{collision}} between a photon (<b>light)</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering. This collision {{results in a}} transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{produces}} pigments. For example, Azotobacter chroococcum forms a dark-brown water-soluble pigment melanin. This process {{occurs at}} high levels of metabolism during the fixation of nitrogen, and is thought to protect the nitrogenase system from oxygen. Other Azotobacter species produce pigments from yellow-green to purple colors, including a green pigment which fluoresces with a yellow-green <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pigment with blue-white fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had a <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> heavy attack, {{which could be}} {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E

5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E

25|$|Waveplates {{in general}} {{as well as}} polarizers can be {{described}} using the Jones matrix formalism, which uses a vector to represent the polarization state of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> matrix to represent the linear transformation of a waveplate or polarizer.|$|E
25|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{generally}} a non-invasive treatment {{using a combination}} of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> photosensitive drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, Tookad, WST09, WST11, Photofrin, or Visudyne. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength.|$|E
25|$|Confocal {{microscopy}} uses a scanning {{point of}} <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pinhole to prevent {{out of focus}} light from reaching the detector. Compared to full sample illumination, confocal microscopy gives slightly higher resolution, and significantly improves optical sectioning. Confocal microscopy is, therefore, commonly used where 3D structure is important.|$|E

25|$|Then {{in early}} 1842 an {{intermittent}} (flashing) light replaced the fixed <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lightship was towed to a station of the Knobben, off Anholt. Around {{the mid-19th century}} {{there was also a}} floating light stationed several miles out from the lighthouse, {{near the end of the}} several miles long reef. This floating light operated from May to December.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June 1933 {{occurred}} what {{is later}} called the Go-Stop Incident, {{in which the}} verbal altercation between two young men—an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a traffic <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> policeman who warned the soldier— developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the Home Ministry and the Army.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the Faraday effect or Faraday {{rotation}} is a magneto-optical phenomenon—that is, {{an interaction}} between <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of polarization which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field {{in the direction of}} propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.|$|E

25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used in}} forensics, molecular biology, genetics, microbiology and biochemistry. The {{results can}} be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gel imaging device. The image is recorded with a computer operated camera, {{and the intensity of}} the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.|$|E
25|$|The Liana {{has also}} been {{modified}} on several occasions. David Soul's Liana featured a red police <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white stripe in reference to his Starsky and Hutch role. Johnny Vegas was provided with L-plates as he had not passed his driving test at the time. When Justin Hawkins came on the show, the Liana he drove had flame decals pasted on it. Actor Sanjeev Bhaskar had an ornate tissue box placed in the back, an homage to Indian drivers.|$|E
25|$|The boro taxis {{are various}} car makes and models, {{but they are}} all painted an {{identical}} color of apple green, with standard marking on the vehicles.

25|$|In {{studying}} coin flipping, {{to observe}} the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> coin with one side painted black, the other white, {{so that when the}} speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks {{as part of the}} convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an extendable map <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets {{on the backs of the}} front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} GPS, debit/credit card reader, a meter, a roof <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> camera or a partition {{in the same way}} as in the yellow cabs. The meter fares for street hailed trips are the same rate as in the yellow cabs. Boro taxis are still considered a car service, therefore customers can call their bases for pre-arranged trips in the same way that they normally do with other car services. The pre-arranged trips can pick up passengers in the outer boroughs including the airports and northern Manhattan, but are still prohibited from picking up any passengers below East 96th and West 110th streets.|$|E
