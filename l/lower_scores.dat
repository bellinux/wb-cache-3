5|$|The Drakengard {{series has}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews over the years. So far, the original Drakengard {{has received the}} most positive response.

Drakengard 2 and Drakengard 3 have received <b>lower</b> <b>scores.</b> Each title in the series has received favorable review scores from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu.|$|E

5|$|The game {{retained}} the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed {{at the lack of}} new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.|$|E

30|$|Menopause {{may be a}} {{risk factor}} for sexual dysfunction. All the post-menopausal women with BD {{reported}} impaired sexual function. In line with that, a Spanish study (n =  260) found that menopause was associated with a <b>lower</b> <b>score</b> for CSFQ- 14 (worse sexual function) (Ornat et al. 2013) but in this study no association was found between a <b>lower</b> <b>score</b> of CSFQ- 14 and higher age.|$|R

25|$|The {{aim of this}} {{index is}} to rank {{countries}} according to both their absolute level of human development and relative scores on gender equality. Although this index has increased government attention to gender inequality and development, its three measures have often been criticized for neglecting important aspects. Its relevance, however, continues to be integral {{to the understanding of}} the feminization of poverty, as countries with <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> may then be then stimulated to focus on policies to assess and reduce gender disparities.|$|E

25|$|Determine the {{substitution}} matrix {{and the gap}} penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively <b>lower</b> <b>scores.</b> A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, {{it is also a}} good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties.|$|E

This test reports {{as the final}} score the number of tests a browser failed; hence <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> are better. In this test, Chrome version 37 scored 10 failed/11578 passed. For comparison, Firefox 19 scored 193 failed/11752 passed and Internet Explorer 9 has a score of 600+ failed, while Internet Explorer 10 has a score of 7 failed.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen “autosomal” {{studies of}} {{peoples in the}} Spanish-speaking Caribbean and its {{diaspora}} (mostly Puerto Ricans) have shown that between 10-20% of their DNA is indigenous, with some individuals having slightly higher scores and others having <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> or no indigenous DNA at all. A recent study of a population in eastern Puerto Rico {{where the majority of}} persons tested claimed Taíno ancestry and pedigree showed that they had 61% mtDNA (distant maternal ancestry) and 0% y-chromosome DNA (distant paternal ancestry) demonstrating as expected that this is a hybrid creole population.|$|E

25|$|Students scoring 20 {{points and}} below may be {{admitted}} for either a Science or Arts Course. In addition, a student must also achieve {{at least a}} C6 grade, which is 50% or higher, in the GCE 'O' Level English Language and Mathematics papers to qualify for junior college admission. Pre-university centres that are particularly associated with academic excellence, however, usually expect students to attain points in the single digits, to be admitted. This is because the system is merit-driven, with places given to those with <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> first.|$|E
25|$|To win dive meets, divers {{create a}} dive list {{in advance of}} the meet. To win the meet the diver must {{accumulate}} more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and <b>lower</b> <b>scores.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Atkins's {{case and}} ruling may have saved other mentally {{handicapped}} inmates {{from the death}} penalty, a jury in Virginia decided in July 2005 that Atkins was intelligent enough to be executed {{on the basis that}} the constant contact he had with his lawyers provided intellectual stimulation and raised his IQ above 70, making him competent to be put to death under Virginia law. The prosecution had argued that his poor school performance was caused by his use of alcohol and drugs, and that his <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> in earlier IQ tests were tainted. His execution date was set for December 2, 2005, but was later stayed.|$|E

25|$|Students {{receive their}} online score reports {{approximately}} {{three weeks after}} test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded {{on a scale of}} 200–800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their percentile (the percentage of other test takers with <b>lower</b> <b>scores).</b> The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers is also included. Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially {{over the past}} half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the Raven test), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many {{school districts in the}} United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Gamecube release, Skies of Arcadia Legends, {{despite being}} largely the same game, {{reviewed}} slightly less positively than the Dreamcast release. The aggregate scores were still generally positive, with Metacritic giving it {{an average of}} 85 out of 100, out of 31 critics, and GameRankings giving it an 85%, out of 56 reviews. A common source of the <b>lower</b> <b>scores</b> were the game's graphics, with criticism coming {{from the fact that}} they had not been substantially improved despite more powerful hardware and over two years passing from the Dreamcast's release. Expectations in graphics had changed drastically in between releases - while the Dreamcast release was frequently compared to the weaker original PlayStation and Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and IX, by the time of the Gamecube release, the game was compared against the likes of the much more powerful PlayStation 2 and its games like Final Fantasy X and Xenosaga.|$|E
