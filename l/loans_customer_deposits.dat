40|$|Presumably, {{foreign banks}} open {{subsidiaries}} and branches in Luxembourg to perform different tasks. This paper studies {{the balance sheet}} structure of banks in Luxembourg, testing for differences across groups and across periods. Non-parametric methods yield several findings. First, specialisation and heterogeneity vary across years as well as across different market segments. Second, comparing subsidiaries and branches, estimated distributions across banks have been relatively similar for Interbank Loans but have become rather different for Interbank <b>Deposits.</b> For <b>Customer</b> <b>Loans</b> and <b>Customer</b> <b>Deposits,</b> the differences across groups are generally greater, especially for <b>Customer</b> <b>Deposits.</b> Third, in 2009 the financial crisis generally sharpened the differences between subsidiaries and branches for all variables considered. Fourth, long-term changes between 1995 and 2007 appeared to be (temporarily?) reversed between 2007 and 2009 by the financial crisis.

40|$|We analyze whether, {{and if so}} by how much, stable funding {{would have}} contributed to the {{financial}} soundness of German banks in the time period between 1995 and 2013, before the Basel III liquidity regulation to address excessive maturity mismatches {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis via the Net Stable Funding Ratio can be expected to have been fully implemented. Using a dataset that contains information on critical events of German banks, we find that financing <b>loans</b> using fewer <b>customer</b> <b>deposits</b> would have been associated with a higher probability of financial distress for savings banks and credit cooperatives. A one percent rise in the loanto- deposit ratio from 1995 to 2013 corresponds to an increase in the probability of experiencing a critical event, implying approximately two additional savings banks and two additional credit cooperatives in financial distress. No such effect can be detected for commercial banks (excluding big banks), which are found to be far more heterogeneous with respect to their business models...|$|R

Thus, when the global financial crisis came, it destabilized the expected return of the consolidation exercise of 2005 which seriously affected the operation of Nigerian banks. This study evaluates the causes and implications of the global financial crisis on the performance of Nigerian banks with a view {{to determine the extent of}} this impact and determining various options that could cushion the impact as well as avoiding future reoccurrence. The secondary data used in this study are those relating to <b>loans</b> and advances, <b>customers</b> <b>deposit</b> and investment in securities (independent variable), while the dependent variable is bank performance. Ordinary Least Square method of Multiple Regression Analysis was used to manipulate the time series data into Econometric model of inflation, while F test was used to test the formulated hypotheses. This study reveals that global financial crisis has a negative impact on the performance of Nigerian banks despite in defiance of high liquidity possessed by these banks immediately after the consolidation exercise of 2005. It was recommended that banks should desist from financing other banks’ investment in securities to avoid multiplier effect syndrome while the Nigerian government should find alternative ways to fund their budget deficitBanking policies; Loans and Advances; Securities; Liquidity; Consolidation; Lending rates; Deposit rate. ...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis and {{introduction}} Interest {{income is}} {{the main source of}} income to commercial banks. The assignment of interest income to banking products is called funds transfer pricing. Traditionally, funds transfer pricing systems were tost-based; the transfer rate was based on the average costs of funds. In the seventies the shortcomings of a tost-based transfer rate were recognized and a market-based funds transfer rate was suggested as a solution (Haskins & Sells 1972, 174). At that time a single, short-term market rate was suggested as the funds transfer rate for al 1 funds (ibid). Altbough it was recognized that a single market rate did not reflect differences in maturity and interest rate risk (Tewes 1976, 32), no further efforts were initiated to overcome these shortcomings. In Germany, on the contrary, a lot of effort has been devoted {{to the development of a}} funds transfer pricing system that supports the planning and control of <b>customer</b> <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits.</b> The first publications explicitly articulating the need for a market-oriented funds transfer pricing system date fiom 1982.

40|$|HG 1623. K 4 M 6 nterest rate {{exposure}} {{represents one}} of the key forms of financial risk faced by banks. It has given rise to an extensive body of research, mainly focused on the estimation of sensitivity of bank stock returns to changes in interest rates. However, the analysis of the sources of bank interest rate risk has received much less attention in the literature. Studies that empirically investigate the determinants of bank interest rate exposure have traditionally used asset-liability maturity or duration gap as the key factor explaining banks‟ interest rate exposure. However, this approach presents serious drawbacks given the well-known limitations of static gap indicators, together with the difficulties to obtain precise year-by-year gap measures for most of banks. For this reason, an alternative was to examine the association between each bank‟s estimated interest rate exposure and a set of readily observable specific characteristics that might have a potentially relevant role in explaining that exposure. The aim of this research was to investigate the main determinants of the interest rate exposure of commercial banks by focusing on how total assets, off balance sheet items, bank‟s deposit and loan composition affect interest rate exposure. The research involved use of both primary and secondary data methodology. Secondary data was obtained from CBK. Primary data was collected via questionnaires from ALCO members. The research population comprised the 43 CBs operating in Kenya with a sample size of 65 respondents. The response rate for the questionnaires which were distributed was 77 %. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistical approach. Data analysis was conducted through Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The result was presented using charts and tables. It was established from the research findings that indeed banks total assets, <b>customer</b> <b>deposits</b> and <b>loan</b> composition are key determinants of bank interest rate exposure. However, there was lack of information on the off balance sheet items and thus their effect on interest rate exposure. The research recommends that CBs should in addition to traditional considerations of asset – liability maturity period take into account total assets, <b>loan</b> composition and <b>customer</b> <b>deposits</b> level in determining interest rates exposure. The ALCO should also encourage policies that increase savings deposits that provide cheap financing and shield the bank against interest rate exposure. The banks should ensure information and benefits of the off balance sheet income is disseminated within the banks and increase use of off balance sheet income hedge against the interest rate exposure. The commercial banks should reduce dependency on corporate deposits that attract high interest rates. Kenyatta Universit...|$|R
