5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{and most}} 220-240V territories, the <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{sufficient}} to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> (120V or 100V respectively) may {{not be sufficient to}} start lamps over 20W with a series inductor, so an autotransformer winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough leakage inductance (short-circuit inductance) so that the current is appropriately limited.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors.

40|$|Abstract. Presently, {{with regard}} to the {{research}} in control of three-phase PWM-VSC under unbalanced dips, most of the literatures gain the current commands through the phase voltages based on the PQ power theory and the control flow is complicate too much. This paper, based on the instantaneous power analysis of VSC grid-side, calculate the current commands through <b>line</b> <b>voltages</b> and use the <b>line</b> <b>voltages</b> instead of the phase voltages in the feedforward. Not only the equation of current commands calculation is simplified, but also avoids the transformation of <b>line</b> <b>voltages</b> to phase voltages. In addition, this method adopts neither PLL nor coordinate transformation, and current sequential extraction is eliminated by adopting the PR controller in the current loop. In the end, the simulation results testify the efficiency of the proposed scheme in resisting grid voltage harmonics and nullifying fluctuation of dc-voltage...|$|R

25|$|The Watford DC Line between Queens Park and Harrow & Wealdstone and the North London Line between Richmond and Gunnersbury {{are used}} by London Overground trains {{designed}} for 750V third rail and Bakerloo line trains designed for 630V third and fourth rail.

25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E

25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E
25|$|The primary break rate of {{sparking}} Tesla coils is slow {{compared to}} the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over {{a short period of}} time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input <b>line</b> <b>voltage.</b> At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.|$|E

50|$|In {{power systems}} {{it is often}} desired to {{eliminate}} harmonic content found in line currents. VSIs {{can be used as}} active power filters to provide this compensation.

500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated <b>line</b> <b>voltage</b> for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E
