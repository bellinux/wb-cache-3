5000|$|Week 2 of the 2005 season, the Redskins were at Dallas where Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman, and Michael Irvin were {{inducted}} into the Cowboys' [...] "Ring of Honor" [...] with a pre-game and halftime ceremony. Throughout a poorly played game, Dallas kept the Redskins out of the endzone, and led 13-0 with less than 4 minutes <b>left.</b> <b>It</b> was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point that the Redskins, led by quarterback Mark Brunell, took the lead thanks to two long touchdown passes to Santana Moss to win the game.|$|R

If the man who opens the door asks you who you have brought it from, say from a young woman, a friend of yours, in a place down Chelsea way. I don't suppose that he will ask any other questions, and you had best say 'Good-morning,' and saunter off carelessly, as if, having done your errand, you had nothing else on hand. Of course you won't drive up to the door. Leave the cab round the corner, and come {{straight}} back here in it." ...|$|R

60|$|He <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> and {{together}} they retraced their steps to the hotel.

6000|$|We <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> and I am {{bound to}} say--owing, no doubt, to my not having {{written for the}} booklet of the Memory Training Course advertised on the {{adjoining}} page of the magazine--the matter slipped from my mind.

60|$|He <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> for the time, but {{throughout}} the afternoon Mr. Direck had the gratification of seeing his thought floating round and round in the back-waters of Mr. Britling's mental current. If it didn't itself get into the stream again its reflection at any rate appeared and reappeared. He was taken about with great assiduity throughout the afternoon, and he got no more than occasional glimpses {{of the rest of}} the Dower House circle until six o'clock in the evening.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{tradition}} {{attributes to}} St. Martial {{the foundation of}} the church of Rodez and the sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin at Ceignac, for according to Cardinal Bourret, the church of Rodez honoured St. Martial as early as the sixth century. There were evidently bishops of Rodez before 475, since Sidonius Apollinaris, in a letter of AD 475, mentions that the Goths <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> date without bishops.|$|E

5000|$|As part of {{beautification}} {{planning for}} the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905, Portland's recently established Parks Board invited the Olmsted Brothers in 1903. Besides suggestions for Washington Park, their research of existing city parks resulted in a bold proposal for a loop of interconnected parks around the city, instead of a traditional plan of scattered parks: [...] "A connected system of parks and parkways is manifestly far more complete and useful than a series of isolated parks." [...] As the brothers puzzled over {{a name for the}} system, one asked the other [...] "What would you call a forty-mile loop?" [...] The firm was famous for its straightforward names, so they <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{song was}} written in two sections. Andriano wrote the first part at home, {{when he woke up}} to a [...] "very Florida-style downpour — thick, muggy and {{producing}} the sweet smell of wet greenery". He had the melody to the song stuck in his head, so he wrote the lyrics to the chorus and <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> for the moment.The rest of the song came into being when Dan was on tour, and woke up in [...] "a hotel bed at some shit-hole. was pissing rain outside, and I didn't really want to move". He immediately wrote the rest of the song's lyrics about making decisions and where those decisions can take you. [...] "Sometimes we have the power to make it rain on ourselves, and flood our lives with negativity. Sometimes it's just beautiful to smell the wet grass and go outside and get wet — get clean." ...|$|E
5000|$|DeForte {{had indeed}} been legitimately on the premises, Black wrote, and had the {{majority}} <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> its holding would have been sound despite his problems with Jones. But instead, by continuing, it had further highlighted the problems he had had with that decision. [...] "This reasoning in terms of 'expectations,' however, requires conferring standing without regard to whether the agent happens to be present {{at the time of}} the search or not, a rather remarkable consequence of the statement in Jones". He speculated that the Court was planning to eventually [...] "eliminate entirely the requirement for standing to raise a search and seizure question and to permit a search to be challenged at any time, at any place, and under all circumstances, regardless of the defendant's relationship to the person or place searched or to the things seized." [...] Such a holding, he cautioned, would elevate the Fourth Amendment to an importance far above any other constitutional provisions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theme of}} black exceptionality is {{explored}} in {{the characters of}} Gunnar and Scoby. Both Gunnar and Scoby represent [...] "the talented tenth", in that they escape Hillside {{and go on to}} higher education and promising futures. However, their successes are perceived differently by the white community. Scoby, the perfect Basketball player who is incapable of missing a basketball shot, is vilified and perceived as the pagan African demon with mystical powers. In contrast, Gunnar, a great player but not as good as Scoby, becomes “white society’s mercenary”. He is accepted, tolerated, and claimed by whiteness, because of his lack of apparent blackness. Because Gunnar has never fulfilled the stereotypical [...] "black" [...] role, whites view him as less of a deviance from the hegemonic ideals. This is a larger commentary on where Blacks are allowed to be in the social hierarchy, and the limitations placed on their successes. Gunnar comments of the white community’s treatment of Scoby saying “they would be a lot better off if they simply called Scoby a god and <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> it's no way they’ll proclaim a skinny black man God”.|$|E
5000|$|Mega Man X5 was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} the last game of the Mega Man X series. As stated by producer Keiji Inafune, [...] "I had {{very little to do with}} X5. I just told the team to 'finish off the series with this title,' and <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> That's why the game itself has a real feel of finality to it." [...] However, Capcom decided to publish Mega Man X6 the following year, in which Zero survived his fight from X5, much to the dismay of Inafune. Haruki Suetsugu, an artist for Mega Man X4, designed nearly all of the characters and promotional artwork for Mega Man X5. Suetsugu added various details to set the characters apart from one another. X's new Falcon Armor was designed by Ryuji Higurashi, who wanted it to resemble a bird with beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the Inazuman manga series. The Maverick bosses in the English localization of Mega Man X5 are named after members of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. Capcom voice actress Alyson Court, who was involved in the game's localization, came up with the new names as a tribute to her then-husband's love of the band.|$|E
5000|$|... "Me and Johnny were sat in {{the library}} playing {{acoustic}} guitars and {{they must have been}} miked up as we were probably putting down the acoustic tracks for 'Panic'. I just started playing the chord sequence which would later become 'Ask' in exactly the way it appears on the record. Johnny then joined in playing the same... I then forgot about the idea and <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that...</b> Johnny must have played Morrissey this idea or given him the recording I already mentioned. I was completely surprised as we were now recording this for the next single. The only section of the chord structure that I didn't come up with for 'Ask' was the middle eight section with the chords E-minor, D and C. That was actually what Johnny came up with. All the way through the song there is an overdub with me and Johnny sat around a mike with acoustics, playing a riff that he came up with {{towards the end of the}} recording of the song. That is a great riff and a real hook but it was still just an overdub and I felt the song was nearly complete without it. Up until the release of 'Ask' I still thought I'd be given a writing credit. When I found that I wasn't given a writing credit, it didn't really bother me, but I thought it was pretty bad that no one even acknowledged that it was my idea in the first place." ...|$|E
