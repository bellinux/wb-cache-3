5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E

In 2010, a two-panel stained glass window {{depicting}} {{the work of the}} RAF Search and Rescue units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the RAF's Chaplain-in-Chief, Ray Pentland. The window, which also commemorates the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and the RAF Mountain Rescue Service, was created by Karen Newby– wife of a former RAF Valley station commander– and Lindsey Abbott. Karen Newby also designed a window dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of 208 Squadron at RAF Valley. Another stained glass window was added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of 4Squadron.|$|E
25|$|Older {{color and}} {{monochrome}} CRTs may contain toxic substances, such as cadmium, in the phosphors. The rear glass tube of modern CRTs {{may be made}} from <b>leaded</b> <b>glass,</b> which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly. By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead, though {{the rear of the}} CRT was still produced from <b>leaded</b> <b>glass.</b> Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leache (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> crystalware).|$|E

40|$|The recent {{publication}} of the Euratom Directive 2013 / 59, adopting the reduction of eye lens dose limits from 150 to 20 mSv y- 1, calls {{for the development of}} new tools and methodologies for evaluating the eye lens dose absorbed by the medical staffinvolved in interventional radiology practices. Moreover, the effectiveness of the protective devices, like <b>leaded</b> <b>glasses,</b> which can be employed for radiation protection purposes, must be tested under typical exposure scenarios. In this work, eye lens dose measurements were carried out on an anthropomorphic phantom simulating a physician bound to perform standard interventional neuroradiology angiographic procedures. The correlation between eye lens doses, in terms of Hp(0. 07), and the equivalent dose [again in terms of Hp(0. 07) ] monthly measured with thermoluminescent dosemeters placed above the lead apron at the chest level was studied, in the presence {{and in the absence of}} different types of <b>leaded</b> <b>glasses...</b>|$|R

The house was first owned by Joseph Harris, {{owner of the}} Harris Clothing Store in Iron River, which {{operated}} from about 1910 to about 1925. The house is the purest Prairie-style structure in the county. It has a hipped roof, attic dormers, and is {{laid out in the}} American foursquare style.

25|$|In 1896, Wright {{moved out}} of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly {{completed}} Steinway Hall Building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., Myron Hunt, and Dwight H. Perkins. These young architects, inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what would become known as the Prairie School. They were joined by Perkins apprentice, Marion Mahony, who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his presentation drawings and watercolor renderings. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois {{and one of the first}} licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.|$|E
500|$|Canterbury Castle was {{a private}} , three-story house located in Arlington Heights near Washington Park, {{offering}} views of downtown Portland. Constructed from basalt stone quarried from Rocky Butte, the house featured characteristics of a castle such as a moat, a drawbridge and a copper-topped turret. The wooden drawbridge covered a moat seven feet wide by more than three feet deep. A single-car garage, built into the hillside, was constructed {{during the same time}} as the house. The concrete foundation supported a rectangular ground plan. Canterbury featured [...] "buttressing wing walls, cylindrical corner bays and a crenellated parapet of uncut stone". Round, arched and straight-topped frameless windows were often fitted with steel sashes. Doorways were also frameless, narrow and round or parabolic in shape. Doors had wrought iron hinges, handles and lock plates. The <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> slit window at the stair tower's top level featured a spiderweb pattern, a signature element of castle designer Jeter O. Frye's work. Windmill palms surrounding the property added to its exotic appearance.|$|E

Royal Blue Line... Royal Blue Trains... the Royal Blue all meant different things at different times. But essentially they all symbolized one thing: the B's regal route." [...] Between the 1890s and World War I, the B's six daily Royal Blue trains providing service between New York and Washington were noted for their luxury, elegant appearance, and speed. The car interiors were paneled in mahogany, had fully enclosed vestibules (instead of open platforms, still widely in use at the time on U.S. railroads), then-modern heating and lighting, and <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> windows. The car exteriors were painted a deep [...] "Royal Saxony blue" [...] color with gold leaf trim.|$|E

Once {{west of the}} Pennsy's Newark station in New Jersey, the train used the Lehigh Valley and Reading Railroad as far as Philadelphia, where it reached B's own rails to Chicago. It was designed to compete against the luxury trains of the rival Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad. [...] Although the B's longer route put it at a competitive disadvantage in New York for time-sensitive travelers, [...] the B offered such luxuries in the 1920s as onboard secretaries, barbers, manicures, and valets. The Capitol's [...] "Martha Washington"-series dining cars were particularly noted for their Chesapeake Bay cuisine, served in ornate cars with <b>leaded</b> <b>glass</b> windows, glass chandeliers, and colonial-style furnishings.
