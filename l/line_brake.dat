40|$|Abstract Mechanical Engineering Department of Sebelas Maret University participated on the {{development}} of a national electric car (Molina UNS). One of the main components of this car is the brake system. Molina UNS use disc brakes type for all wheels. In this brake type, squeal can arise in the form of disturbance. Therefore, this study aims to determine the dynamic characteristic of disc brake during braking and the effect of <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> cross-section geometry to brake squeal occurrence. Analysis were performed with the finite element simulation using ANSYS 14. 5 software. Variable that given are pressure 0, 6 MPa on lining, disc rotation at 5 rad/s, and friction coefficient is 0, 405. Geometry variation of this simulation are <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> without slot, single slot, double slot, and chamfered. Eigenvalues of simulation results extracted on the frequency between 0 and 13 kHz. The results show the unstable vibration mode that potentially squeal on the configuration I, II, III, IV sequentially occurs at frequencies 8769 Hz, 8713 Hz, 11737 Hz and 11460 Hz.

50|$|The next {{evolution}} on {{the foil}} kites for traction activities was {{the development of}} the 4-line foil kite. While 2-line kites require sometimes significant push and pull arm movement to fly (especially true the larger the kite), {{the development of the}} 4-line kite required less arm movement. 4-line kites are flown with two lines on each handle: a top line (or power line), and a bottom <b>line</b> (or <b>brake</b> <b>line).</b> 4-line kites can still be flown with push and pull arm movement, but if the bottom <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> is pulled in the bottom edge of the kite stalls and will cause the kite to turn on that bottom edge. This results in tighter turns with less arm movement - this is important if sitting in a kite buggy.|$|R

Suspension geometry and alignment settings, which define characteristic responses such as lateral acceleration, yaw velocity, toe, and caster angles of a vehicle in a transient manoeuvre, are primary to a vehicleÂ¿s directional stability. Any symmetric inconsistencies in these settings will potentially affect a vehicleÂ¿s performance.

40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for so long as {{automobile}} <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> material because of its good physical and chemical properties. However, due to the health hazard associated with its handling, it has lost favour and several alternative materials are being increasingly used. Asbestos-free <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> was developed in this work using pulverized cow hooves along with epoxy resin, barium sulphate, graphite and aluminium oxide. This was with a view to exploiting the characteristics of cow hooves, which are largely discarded as waste materials to replace asbestos which {{has been found to be}} carcinogenic. Samples of brake linings were produced using compressive moulding in which the physical and mechanical properties of the samples were studied. The results obtained showed that proper bonding was achieved as the percentage by weight of epoxy resin increased and percentage by weight of pulverized cow hooves decreased. The hardness, compressive strength, coefficient of friction, water and oil absorption, relative density and wear rate of the brake linings were determined and compared with existing <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> properties.
