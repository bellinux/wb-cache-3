2500|$|Ultraviolet [...] (UV) is an {{electromagnetic}} radiation with a wavelength from 10nm [...] to 400nm, shorter {{than that of}} visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation constitutes about 10% of the total light output of the Sun, and is thus present in sunlight. It is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights, such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although it's not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Consequently, the chemical and biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.|$|E

In order to quantitate the immunological effects of therapeutic concentrations of 8 -methoxypsoralen plus <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> we measured the mixed leukocyte culture reaction in vitro. Leukocytes treated with 8 -methoxypsoralen were exposed to plate glass filtered ultraviolet radiation from a bank of “PUVA“ fluorescent lamps. To evaluate the (two-way) mixed leukocyte reaction, treated leukocytes were mixed with untreated leukocytes from another donor in microtiter wells and tritiated thymidine incorporation was measured after 4 to 6 days. To measure stimulation or proliferation ability (one-way mixed leukocyte reactions), treated or untreated leukocytes were exposed to 2000 R X-radiation prior to mixing. Treatment of leukocytes with 8 -methoxypsoralen (0. 01, 0. 1, or 1. 0 μg/ml) followed by 7, 000 to 87, 000 J/m 2 <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of mixed leukocyte culture reactivity. 0. 1 μg/ml 8 -methoxypsoralen plus 7, 000 J/m 2 ultraviolet radiation resulted in a 48 % reduction (p < 0. 01) in mixed leukocyte reaction-induced tritiated thymidine incorporation in the two-way assay. 1 μg/ml 8 -methoxypsoralen plus 87, 000 J/m 2 ultraviolet radiation virtually abolished reactivity in the two-way mixed leukocyte reaction and in both one-way mixed leukocyte reactions. Exposure to 87, 000 J/m 2 long wavelength ultraviolet radiation alone resulted in 45 % inhibition (p < 0. 01) of stimulation ability. These results indicate that therapeutic concentrations of 8 -methoxypsoralen followed by exposure to <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> inhibited both the stimulating ability and the mixed leukocyte culture reaction-induced proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes in vitro...|$|E

The minimum erythema dose to UVB of animals in the treated group was less than that the main factors influencing the elicitation of persistent light reaction were the amount of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) used to enhance the allergic response in animals, and the UVA dose at the induction stage. Based on these findings, we have developed a method to make animals persistent light reactors with high frequency. This method consists of 1 intradermal injection of 1. 2 ml emulsified FCA, 5 irradiations with 20. 4 J/cm 2 of UVA, and topical applications of 5 % p-aminoethylbenzoate (benzocaine) at the induction stage.

40|$|The {{development}} of therapies which are selective for tumor tissues {{is one of}} the most important goals in anticancer research. Within this framework photochemotherapy can be considered a very promising approach. Its therapeutic effectiveness depends on two connected factors: drug and light. The drug (photosensitizer) is able to exert an antiproliferative effect only after interaction with suitable light. Both the photosensitizing drug and light alone are ineffective at doses used for these treatments. Nowadays, photochemotherapy is used in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and cavitary tumors. In the first case the photosensitizer is a psoralen derivative (P) and <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVA) is used (PUVA therapy). In the second case, the treatment with porphyrins, porphyrin-based and non porphyrin-based photosensitizers is followed by irradiation with 600 - 1000 nm light (photodynamic therapy, PDT). This review is concerned with PUVA and PDT treatments of cancer.

40|$|<b>Long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (UVA- 1) <b>radiation</b> causes {{oxidative}} stress that modifies cellular molecules. To {{defend themselves against}} noxious oxidation products, skin cells produce detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants. We have recently shown that UVA- 1 oxidized the abundant membrane phospholipid 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -arachidonoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphorylcholine (PAPC), which then induced the stress-response protein heme oxygenase 1 (HO- 1) in dermal fibroblasts. Here we {{examined the effects of}} UVA- 1 - and UV-oxidized phospholipids on global gene expression in human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. We identified a cluster of genes that were coinduced by UVA- 1 -oxidized PAPC and UVA- 1 radiation. The cluster included HO- 1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, aldo-keto reductases- 1 -C 1 and -C 2, and IL- 8. These genes are members of the cellular stress response system termed “antioxidant response. ” Accordingly, the regulatory regions of all of these genes contain binding sites for NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (NRF 2), a major regulator of the antioxidant response. Both UVA- 1 irradiation and treatment with oxidized lipids led to increased nuclear accumulation and DNA binding of NRF 2. Silencing and deficiency of NRF 2 suppressed the antioxidant response. Taken together, our data show that UVA- 1 -mediated lipid oxidation induces expression of antioxidant response genes, which is dependent on the redox-regulated transcription factor NRF 2. Our findings suggest a different view on UV-generated lipid mediators that were commonly regarded as detrimental. —Gruber, F., Mayer, H., Lengauer, B., Mlitz, V., Sanders, J.

40|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{is employed}} {{in the treatment of}} a number of hematologic and malignant diseases. A major complication is the induction of graft-versus-host disease. Whereas removal of T lymphocytes from the donor marrow effectively reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease, the incidence of graft failure often increases when T cells are depleted from the transplanted marrow. In the current study, photoinactivation of the donor cells with 8 -methoxypsoralen coupled with exposure to <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (PUVA therapy) was used to inactivate the response of the donor T cells against the host. PUVA therapy suppressed the ability of spleen cells to respond to alloantigen in the in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction. The induction of acute graft-versus-host disease across complete major histocompatibility barriers in lethally X-irradiated mice was significantly suppressed after bone marrow transplantation with photoinactivated bone marrow cells. Long-term survivors demonstrated allogeneic reconstitution and partial restoration of T-cell function. Because PUVA therapy had no inhibitory effect on hematopoiesis, these data suggest that using phototherapy to inactivate the alloreactivity of T cells may provide an alternative to purging T cells from the donor marrow, thus suppressing both the incidence of graft-versus-host disease and the incidence of graft failure...|$|E

Through access to experimental polyethylene horticultural films with novel transmission properties, I exploited new opportunities for exploring separate short- and long-wavelength mechanisms for pest suppression. The early experimental work of the project tested the effect of short- and long-wavelength ultraviolet light on the population growth of the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae, on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) plants. These polytunnel field experiments established new hypotheses for the role of <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> as an environmental cue for damaging short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Through a series of methodological developments, I quantified both the dose-response of environmentally-relevant ultraviolet on M. persicae mortality, and proposed a colour behavioural model for the feeding behaviour of M. persicae under different illumination conditions. Through synthesising these findings into a model of aphid hazard-avoidance, I show that the behaviour of M. persicae may be manipulated to increase its exposure to solar short-wavelength radiation, with consequences for population growth rate. As such, this mechanism may be used in protected agricultural practice as part of a wider integrated pest management strategy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVA) {{can damage}} cells through photo-oxidative stress, leading to harmful photosensitized {{proteins}} and pigments in cyanobacteria.

To understand the dynamics of these genes, their expression was measured following exposure to UVA, UVB, high visible (VIS) irradiance, and oxidative stress for 20, 40, and 60 min. Overall, both genes had statistically similar patterns of expression for all four conditions and were generally up-regulated, except for those exposed to UVB by 60 min and for the cells under oxidative stress. The greatest UVA response was an up-regulation by 20 min, while the response to UVB was the most dramatic and persisted through 40 min. High VIS irradiance resulted in a modest up-regulation, while oxidative stress caused a slight down-regulation. Both genes were also found to occur on the same transcript. These results demonstrate that these genes are positively responding to several light-associated conditions, which suggests that this TCRS may regulate more than just scytonemin biosynthesis under UVA stress...|$|E

Fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis measurements show that the complexation ability of benzoderivatives is remarkably high. Binding is less effective in the case of tetrahydrocongeners. All compounds photoreact quite effectively to DNA. The photoadducts were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of drug-modified DNA and were characterized by high performance liquid chromatographic elution techniques. The 3, 4 position represents the unique photoreactive site for the benzopsoralens. Denaturation-renaturation experiments confirm that the benzoderivatives are purely monofunctional, while the tetrahydrocongeners form interstrand cross-links, even though to a remarkably lesser extent than 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP). The new compounds, in the presence of <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> are very moderately effective in forming reactive oxygen species; they are ineffective in promoting oxidation of tyrosine and 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) alanine to dopachrome and melanin.

40|$|Following {{exposure}} to <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVA), some cyanobacteria produce the indole-alkaloid sunscreen scytonemin. The genomic region associated with scytonemin biosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme includes 18 adjacent co-transcribed genes. A two-component regulatory system (Npun_F 1277 and Npun_F 1278) directly upstream from the biosynthetic gene cluster was identified through comparative genomic analysis {{and is likely}} involved in scytonemin regulation. In this study, the response regulator Npun_F 1278 was evaluated {{for its ability to}} regulate scytonemin biosynthesis using a mutant strain of N. punctiforme deficient in this gene, hereafter strain Δ 1278. Following UVA radiation, the typical stimulus to initiate scytonemin biosynthesis, Δ 1278 was incapable of producing scytonemin. A phenotypic characterization of Δ 1278 suggests that, aside from the ability to produce scytonemin, the deletion of Npun_F 1278 does not affect the cell morphology, cellular differentiation capability, or lipid-soluble pigment complement of Δ 1278 compared to the wild type. The mutant, however, had a slower specific growth rate and the amount of phycocyanin yielded by Δ 1278 differed from the wild type. Given the inability of Δ 1278 to produce scytonemin, this study demonstrates that the response regulator Npun_F 1278 in N. punctiforme is essential for scytonemin biosynthesis. While most of the evaluated effects of this gene appear to be specific for scytonemin, this regulator may also influence the overall health of the cell and specifically, phycobiliprotein synthesis.

Scytonemin is a heterocyclic, dimeric molecule that is produced by some cyanobacteria upon induction by UVA. It is hypothesized that it is regulated by a putative two-component regulatory system (TCRS; NpF 1277 and NpF 1278) that is upstream and adjacent to the scytonemin biosynthetic gene cluster in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. TCRSs are commonly made up of a sensor kinase which senses the environmental stress and a response regulator that is activated by the sensor kinase to initiate gene expression of a cellular response. The expression of the TCRS genes NpF 1277 and NpF 1278 in N. punctiforme have been evaluated in response to several environmental stressors: UVA, short-wavelength UVB, oxidative stress, and high light. Cells were stressed for 20, 40, and 60 minutes and the expression levels of the TCRS genes were compared to unstressed controls using quantitative PCR. Cells under UVA, UVB, and high light stress showed an up-regulation of both TCRS genes by 20 minutes. Aside from an up-regulation for both genes after 40 minutes of UVB and 60 minutes of high light, 40 and 60 minutes of stress generally resulted in either a down-regulation or no significant change for all four stressors. This research shows how regulation occurs for the sunscreen scytonemin in cyanobacteria and how they cope with stress under certain environmental conditions. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Under {{exposure}} to <b>long-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVA), some cyanobacteria can produce scytonemin, a yellow to brown, lipid-soluble, non-fluorescent, stable sunscreen compound. A genomic region associated with scytonemin biosynthesis {{has been identified}} in the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 that contains 18 adjacent genes transcribed in a single direction. Most of the genes in the upstream region of the cluster code for unique proteins involved directly in scytonemin biosynthesis. Further genomic characterization of this gene cluster in N. punctiforme has revealed a conserved putative two-component regulatory system (TCRS; NpF 1277 and NpF 1278) upstream and adjacent to the biosynthetic cluster that is likely involved in scytonemin regulation. In this study, it is hypothesized that if NpF 1278, the putative response regulator, regulates scytonemin biosynthesis in N. punctiforme, {{there will be a}} change in the production of scytonemin following UVA radiation when the NpF 1278 gene is deleted. To knock out NpF 1278 from N. punctiforme, an in-frame marker-less deletion fragment complementary to the 5 ’ and 3 ’ ends of NpF 1278 which lacks the internal sequence of the gene was constructed and inserted into N. punctiforme through conjugation. The mutant strain was found incapable of producing scytonemin following UVA radiation as assessed using spectroscopy. To further study this system, the interaction of the NpF 1278 protein with the promoter region of the scytonemin biosynthetic genes was assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). If the NpF 1278 protein is associated with the production of scytonemin, it is expected to bind to the promoter region of the gene cluster. Thus far, binding has not been observed. However, failure to bind to the promoter region can occur due to various factors. Preliminary {{results of this study suggest}} that the putative response regulator NpF 1278 regulates scytonemin biosynthesis in Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. Understanding these regulatory elements may enable future genetic manipulation to artificially control the amount of sunscreen produced for biomedical and industrial purposes. ...|$|E

Leukocytes in 8 -MOP containing blood receive UV-A exposure when circulating through the dermis during therapy. The present study utilizes an {{in vitro assay}} system to permit quantitation and correlation of multiple biological and physical alterations in human lymphoid cells induced by 8 -MOP plus UV-A treatment. Additive inhibition of lymphoid cell DNA synthesis by 8 -MOP (0. 01 to 1 μg/ml) plus UV-A (1, 000 to 29, 000 J/m 2) {{was accompanied by a}} synergistic potentiation of cell killing in the therapeutic exposure range. Reduction in tritiated thymidine (3 HTdR) incorporation to 65 – 70 % of control value was associated with normal survival; while 3 HTdR incorporation of less than 50 % of control induced by any 8 -MOP plus UV-A combination tested was associated with less than 10 % survival, 8 -MOP-DNA-cross-links were detected by the alkaline elution assay only when 3 HTdR incorporation was reduced to less than 50 % of control. The relative number of crosslinks increased proportionately with further 8 -MOP plus UV-A-induced reduction in 3 HTdR incorporation. 8 -MOP plus UV-A induced at most approximately a 2 -fold increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) per chromosome in lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cells. Increasing 8 -MOP plus UV-A exposure resulted in marked toxicity with few cells progressing to second division metaphases and no further increase in SCE's per chromosome. Addition of 13 -cis retinoic acid (1 μg/ml) to the lymphoblastoid cells prior to 8 -MOP plus UV-A treatment did not significantly alter the 3 HTdR incorporation or cell survival. These studies dermonstrate that in vitro exposure of human lymphoid cells to therapeutic levels of 8 -MOP and UV-A may decrease cellular DNA synthesis, produce DNA 8 -MOP interstrand cross-links, reduce cell viability and induce small increases in sister chromosome exchanges...|$|E

It is found that the integrated counts and the peak height of the photoluminescence emission (PL) bands are strongly correlated with the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength. They are increased at the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength 280 Â nm and have maximum at 290 Â nm, thereafter they decrease and diminish at 360 Â nm of ultraviolet wavelength. The position of the PL emission band peak was red shifted starting from 300 Â nm, which increased with the increase the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength. The PL bandwidth increases linearly with the increase of the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength.
