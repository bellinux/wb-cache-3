60|$|I {{have now}} {{completed}} my literary {{survey of the}} first floor of the palace. At the desire of my noble and gracious patron, the lord of this glorious edifice, I next ascend to the second floor, and continue my catalogue or description of the pictures, decorations, and other treasures of art therein contained. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> the corner room at the western extremity of the palace, called the Room of the Caryatides, from the statues which support the mantel-piece. This work is of comparatively recent execution: it dates from the eighteenth century only, and reveals the corrupt taste of the period in every part of it. Still, there is a certain interest which attaches to the mantel-piece: it conceals a cleverly constructed hiding-place, between the floor of the room and the ceiling of the room beneath, which was made during the last evil days of the Inquisition in Venice, and which is reported to have saved an ancestor of my gracious lord pursued by that terrible tribunal. The machinery of this curious place of concealment has been kept in good order by the present lord, as a species of curiosity. He condescended to show me the method of working it. Approaching the two Caryatides, rest your hand on the forehead (midway between the eyebrows) of the figure which is on your left as you stand opposite to the fireplace, then press the head inwards as if you were pushing it against the wall behind. By doing this, you set in motion the hidden machinery in the wall which turns the hearthstone on a pivot, and discloses the hollow place below. There is room enough in it for a man to lie easily at full length. The method of closing the cavity again is equally simple. Place both your hands on the temples of the figures; pull as if you were pulling it towards you--and the hearthstone will revolve into its proper position again.|$|E

Some time since, a dreadful illness raged among the people in our part of this island; and I was so unfortunate as to catch the infection. When I recovered--no! 'Recovery' is not the right word to use--let me say, when I escaped death, I found myself afflicted by a nervous malady which has defied medical help from that time to this. I am suffering (as the doctors explain it to me) from a morbidly sensitive condition of the nerves near the surface to the action of light. If I were to draw the curtains, and look out of that window, I should feel the acutest pain all over my face. If I covered my face, and drew the curtains with my bare hands, I should feel the same pain in my hands. You can just see, perhaps, that I have a very large and very thick veil on my head. I let it fall over my face and neck and hands, when I have occasion to pass along the corridors or to enter my father's study--and I find it protection enough. Don't be too ready to deplore my sad condition, sir! I have got so used to living in the dark that I can see quite well enough for all the purposes of my poor existence. I can read and write in these shadows--I can see you, and be of use to you in many little ways, if you will let me. There is really nothing to be distressed about. My life will not be a long one--I know and feel that. But I hope to be spared long enough to be my father's companion through the closing years of his life. Beyond that, I have no prospect. In the meanwhile, I have my pleasures; and I mean to add to my scanty little stack the pleasure of attending on you. You are quite an event in my life. I look forward to reading to you and writing for you, as some girls look forward to a new dress, or a first ball. Do you think it very strange of me to tell you so openly just what I have in my mind? I can't help it! I say what I think to my father and to our poor neighbors hereabouts--and I can't alter my ways at a moment's notice. I own it when I like people; and I own it when I don't. I have been looking at you while you were asleep; and I have read your face as I might read a book. There are signs of sorrow on your forehead and your lips which it is strange to see in so young a face as yours. I am afraid I shall trouble you with many questions about yourself when we become better acquainted with each other. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> a question, in my capacity as nurse. Are your pillows comfortable? I can see they want shaking up. Shall I send for Peter to raise you? I am unhappily not strong {{enough to be able to}} help you in that way. No?

It seems clear that the current wave of capital inflows to emerging markets is influenced by the high returns that assets from these countries offer in comparison with those from advanced countries. The low rates of growth and interest rates in advanced countries are most likely a transitory phenomenon. Their real and financial yields will both probably rise in a near future. In any case, I think that the high growth emerging markets have been experiencing since the early 2000 s will last for a long period. This seems to me a more persistent phenomenon. Although growth rates of emerging markets and advanced countries had shown a high correlation since the 1980 s, they started to diverge in the 2000 s {{for the first time in}} the period of financial globalization (WEO, October 2010).

40|$|I. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> this lecture <b>with</b> a methodological assertion: There is a {{between the}} aims of social science and history. A. From {{the vantage point of}} social science much is {{inherently}} unpredictable insofar as patterns of causality may be so complex as to defy systematic analysis, or truly stochastic events exist. B. From the vantage point of history, every historical event is open to explanation, because every event is a direct consequence of particular decisions and circumstances. II. Next <b>let</b> <b>me</b> make a claim about the world, that has methodological implications. A. If the future is not entirely predictable, then much about the future is necessarily unknown to decision makers at the moment of choice. B. In this case, even the best rational decisions reflect both uncertainty and ignorance, and, consequently, mistakes will be made. C. In this case, behavior that is entirely rational will not be entirely predictable. D. And, moreover, exactly how predictable rational political behavior is cannot be known with certainty, thus the title of this lecture. rdc/nuffield ox lectur...|$|R

Yet, {{it seems to be a}} historical fact that countries least concerned with the implementations of modern growth models have done as well if not better for their people as those countries which have embarked upon various planning schemes. In this paper I will argue that to consider the saving-investment relationship as a major determinant of the rate of growth, and an increase in the supply of investible funds as a major determinant of the increase in the rate of growth is at best misleading and at worst nonsensical. For faster rate of growth of wealth is achieved not merely by increased saving but by more effective institutions for organizing, co-ordinating and directing productive activity...|$|R

Israeli snipers were given orders to shoot anyone in the church carrying a gun on sight, seriously wounding an Armenian monk who the IDF said looked armed, and killing the mentally impaired church bell-ringer who was shot as he left to ring the bells as he had done for 3 decades. He was left to die, bleeding in the square for hours. Six other men were killed by the IDF during the siege.
