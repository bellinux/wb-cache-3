5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} problems which affect electric vehicle performance is the power <b>density</b> of their <b>energy</b> storage systems (<b>energy</b> <b>density</b> is a contributing factor too). Batteries and supercapacitors especially have relatively <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> compared to liquid fuels such as gasoline. Associated increases in mass can result in slower acceleration when compared to a gasoline-powered vehicle with similar power and weight characteristics. Increased mass can also increase braking distances and pitching. Offsetting these disadvantages is the benefit that batteries in an electric dragster can be evenly placed along the floor to keep the centre of mass low.|$|R

Therefore, a medium-sized, formvar-coated composite NbTi alloy, Cu-stabilized, has been studied (48 filaments, approximately square cross section about 1 / 5 cm thickness). Thermal quench behavior (caused by heating) was investigated in various fluid states of He 4, including pressurized and superfluid He 4.

50|$|Because of its <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> and {{typically}} high moisture content, brown coal is inefficient to transport {{and is not}} traded extensively {{on the world market}} compared with higher coal grades. It is often burned in power stations near the mines, such as in Australia's Latrobe Valley and Luminant's Monticello plant in Texas. Primarily because of latent high moisture content and <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of brown coal, carbon dioxide emissions from traditional brown-coal-fired plants are generally much higher per megawatt generated than for comparable black-coal plants, with the world's highest-emitting plant being Hazelwood Power Station until its closure in March 2017.

50|$|Within Agrarian {{societies}} {{the primary}} source of energy is plant biomass. This means that like hunter-gatherer societies, agrarian societies are dependent on natural solar energy flows. Thus agrarian societies are characterized by their dependence on outside energy flows, <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> and the limited possibilities of converting one energy form into another. Energy radiating from the sun is primarily caught and chemically fixed by plant photosynthesis. Then it is secondarily converted by animals and, finally, processed for human use. However, unlike hunter-gatherers, agrarianism's basic strategy is to control these flows. For this purpose, agrarians system mainly uses living organism which serve as food, tools, building material. Mechanical devices making use of wind or running water also can be used to convert natural energy flows. The amount of energy an agrarian society can use is restricted due to the <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of solar radiation and the low efficiency of technology.|$|E
