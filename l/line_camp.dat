50|$|Originally, the {{community}} was the Hay Hook <b>Line</b> <b>Camp</b> of the XIT Ranch, and the ranch headquarters {{was one of the}} county's earliest buildings. When the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway was built through the ranch in 1898, a switch was placed at the site to be used by cowboys to unload cottonseed shipped in as feed. Some of this feed was invariably spilled along the tracks, causing XIT cattle to gather at the unfenced right-of-way. Often, they lay down, compelling railroad workers to get off their trains and prod them off the tracks. As a result, the site was labeled Bull Town, a name replaced by the more elegant Bovina when the post office was established on January 31, 1899.|$|E

In 1884 it became the headquarters for a ranch that reached 25000 acre in area. The bad winter of 1886-87 killed half the stock on the ranch, more than 10,000 head., but the M L fared better than most. Mason died in 1892. Lovell died in Oregon in 1903. Lovell, Wyoming was named in his memory. [...] The Lovell family ran the ranch until 1909. In the early 1960s the ranch was purchased by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Bighorn Lake reservoir project.
