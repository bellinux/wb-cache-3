5000|$|... 15 June 1918, 871 Thane of Fife was in {{collision}} with a Caledonian Railway <b>locomotive</b> (<b>running</b> <b>light</b> engine) near Aberdeen joint station. The cause was a signalling error. One passenger, a boy, was killed; eight others were injured.|$|E
50|$|Down trains {{continued}} to run entirely by gravity but faster up journeys and longer trains increased line capacity. A new timetable dated October 1863 shows six departures daily from each terminus at two-hour intervals, starting at 7:00 am and taking 1 hour 50 minutes including stops (totalling 20 minutes) at Tanygrisiau, Hafod-y-Llyn and Penrhyn. Trains passed only at Hafod-y-Llyn (from 1872 Tan-y-Bwlch). When passenger services started, the usual practice was for locomotive-hauled up trains {{to consist of}} loaded general goods and mineral wagons, followed by passenger carriages, followed by empty slate wagons with brakesmen. Down trains were run in up to four separate (uncoupled) portions: loaded slate wagons, goods wagons, passenger carriages and the <b>locomotive</b> <b>running</b> <b>light.</b> This unusual and labour-intensive method of operation was highly dangerous, {{at least as far}} as passengers were concerned; consequently, the down passenger and goods portions were combined into a single train headed by the locomotive.|$|E

50|$|The 1987 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 1:30 pm on January 4, 1987, on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor main {{line in the}} Chase community in eastern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, at Gunpowder Interlocking, about 18 mi northeast of Baltimore. Amtrak train 94, the Colonial (now part of the Northeast Regional, from Washington, D.C., to Boston), crashed into a set of Conrail <b>locomotives</b> <b>running</b> <b>light,</b> and which had fouled the mainline. Train 94's speed {{at the time of}} the collision was estimated at about 108 mph. Fourteen passengers on the Amtrak train were killed, as well as the Amtrak engineer and lounge car attendant.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] {{section of}} rail track was damaged near Kaiapoi {{and there was}} lesser track damage at Rolleston and near Belfast. As a precaution, state rail {{operator}} KiwiRail shut down the entire South Island rail network after the earthquake, halting some 15 trains. Two <b>locomotives</b> <b>running</b> <b>light</b> (i.e. without any carriages or wagons) {{came to a stop}} just 30metres short of a major buckle in the line. After inspection, services south of Dunedin and north of Kaikoura recommenced at 10:30am that day. The Main South Line, linking Christchurch with Dunedin, was given the all-clear and reopened, albeit with a 40km/h speed restriction north of Ashburton, just after 6:00pm to allow emergency aid, including [...] of drinking water, to be railed into Christchurch. By the afternoon of Monday 6 September, the entire South Island rail network had reopened {{with the exception of the}} Main North Line between Rangiora and Addington. Freight was shuttled by road between the two points, while the TranzCoastal was replaced with a coach service.|$|R

5000|$|The {{support plates}} {{fixed to the}} valve spindle also have a piston ring. This slows down {{the closing of the}} movable valve heads.Narrow gauge {{locomotives}} (such as the DR Class 99.23-24) do not have these piston rings. As a result, when the <b>locomotive</b> switches from <b>running</b> <b>light</b> to <b>running</b> under load there is a characteristic clicking noise as the pistons close. This piston ring on the support body was a further refinement by the former Meiningen repair shop.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{operation}} may see {{one or two}} <b>locomotives</b> <b>running</b> {{together with}} a snowplow at either end. This enables a snow clearance train to reverse direction quickly if it gets stuck. Alternatively, a single locomotive with bogie plows {{can act as a}} self-propelled snowplow by <b>running</b> <b>light</b> engine.|$|R
5000|$|Traffic {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} the line was doubled, starting with the section from Bowes to the summit at Stainmore in 1866, followed by the line from Barnard Castle to the Tees Valley Junction. The NER opened the Tees Valley Railway to [...] in 1868. Doubling of the line to Tebay, except for Belah and Kirby Stephen and Kirby Stephen and Sandy Bank had been approved by 1875. The section between Belah to Kirkby Stephen was approved in 1889, and this involved the doubling of the Aitygill, Merrygill and Podgill viaducts. Smardale Gill Viaduct was built wide enough for double track, but single track was laid to ease the curve.At {{the end of the}} 19th century the line would be typically used by twenty freight trains, mostly mineral traffic. Westbound, 'double load' trains of 32 wagons would be assisted on the rising gradient by a locomotive at the rear. At the summit, where there was a reservoir to provide water, trains would be split into two for the descent. Up to 50 empty wagons could be managed on the return journey, the assisting <b>locomotive</b> then <b>running</b> <b>light</b> from the summit to Barnard Castle. Snow could a problem on the line, especially between the summit and Belah, {{and the line}} was closed by the weather in 1942, 1947 and 1955.|$|R
