5|$|In the Late Archaic {{the climate}} became {{more similar to}} modern {{with the end of}} the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites {{increased}} in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, <b>little</b> <b>barley,</b> marsh elder, and barnyard grass. Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville, the Gast Spring Site, and the Sand Run Slough West Site. In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.|$|E

25|$|Watson pottery {{making people}} lived along the upper Ohio Valley from the Kanawha regions through the Northern Panhandle and {{adjoining}} state border area, which also extends into the Eastern Panhandle. Tobacco growing remained important among certain tribes, hunter gathering gardeners, hunter-fishery horticulturalist, and later hunter-fishery farmers of the region. Tobacco seed was extremely small and seldom found in screening results. Tobacco was {{evidenced by the}} many pipes and bowl residues found at certain sites rather than the seed itself. The arrival of the tomato {{in the region is}} thought to be historic, or proto-historic. Both the squashes and gourds long predate maize and beans in the state. The cereal maize surpassed the Woodland's cereals <b>little</b> <b>barley</b> and may grass as well as a wild rye in the genus Elymus.|$|E
25|$|Maize {{was first}} {{grown in the}} eastern United States around 200 BCE, and highly {{productive}} adapted strains became widely used around 900 CE. The spread was so slow because the seeds and knowledge of techniques for tending them had to cross inhospitable deserts and mountains, and more productive varieties of maize had to be developed to compete with indigenous crops and to suit the cooler climates and shorter growing seasons of the northern regions of the continent. Tropical maize does not flower under the long day conditions of summer north of Mexico, requiring genetic adaptation. It seems that maize was adopted first {{as a supplement to}} existing agricultural plants, but gradually came to dominate as its yields increased. Ultimately, the EAC was thoroughly replaced by maize-based agriculture. Most EAC plants are no longer cultivated, and some of them (such as <b>little</b> <b>barley)</b> are regarded as pests by modern farmers.|$|E
25|$|The Adena Indians used {{ceremonial}} pipes {{that were}} exceptional works of art. They lived in round shaped (double post method) wicker sided and bark sheet roofed houses (McMichael 1968:21). Little {{is known about}} the housing of Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods, but Woodland Indians lived in wigwams. They grew sunflowers, tubers, gourds, squash and several seeds such as lambsquarter, may grass, sumpweed, smartweed and <b>little</b> <b>barley</b> cereals. In the Fort Ancient period, Indians lived in much larger poled rectangular shaped houses with walls hide covered (McMichael 1968:38). They were farmers who cultivated large fields around their villages, concentrating on corn, beans, tubers, sunflowers, gourds and many types of squash including the pumpkin. They also raised domestic turkeys and kept dogs as pets. Their neighbors in the northerly of the state, the Monongahelan houses were generally circular in shape often with nook or storage appendage. Their living characteristics were more of a heritage from the Woodland Indians (McMichael 1968:49).|$|E

500|$|The Late Woodland Period {{was once}} {{considered}} to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity. Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. Gone are the complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, {{but this does not}} appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites. [...] Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including maize. Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration. Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, other nuts and fruits, goosefoot, <b>little</b> <b>barley,</b> maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade. [...] The Rainbow and M.A.D. sites provide a glimpse into the Late Archaic of western Iowa. At Rainbow, a large house was excavated, showing evidence of reuse and possible joint occupation by two families. Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period, large groups of mounds appeared including the Slinde Mound Group, and the Fish Farm Mound Group.|$|E

2500|$|The diets of Archaic peoples at many Green River sites {{has been}} {{determined}} largely from incomplete excavation data at better-known sites, such as Carlston Annis. [...] It appears that the inhabitants' floral diets rested almost completely on nuts, with hickory nuts dominating; both Carlston-Annis and the Bowles Site in Ohio County produced evidence suggesting that 80% of identifiable floral remains were hickory nuts, and 85% of the remnant was acorns. [...] Some evidence exists at these sites for plants such as squash, <b>little</b> <b>barley,</b> and wild rice. [...] Analysis of the burials at Carlston-Annis and other Green River sites demonstrates that the inhabitants' demographics {{were similar to those}} of comparable sites elsewhere and to those of modern hunter-gatherer societies. [...] Besides methods of producing fishhooks, Archaic technology can be seen from Carlston Annis in the atlatl components. No direct evidence of specific techniques was apparent from this excavation, but substantial circumstantial evidence was present. [...] Because very few burials were accompanied by stone atlatls, it is believed that many individuals were also buried with wooden atlatls (comparable to modern Eskimo technology) that have not survived to the present. [...] Comparison with Indian Knoll suggests that early inhabitants at Annis used all-wooden atlatls more commonly than the Indian Knoll people.|$|E

40|$|Annual cereal forages are {{resilient}} {{in water}} use (WU), water use efficiency (WUE), and weed control compared with grain crops in dryland systems. The combined influence of tillage and management systems on annual cereal forage productivity and WU {{is not well}} documented. We conducted a field study {{for the effects of}} tillage (no-till and tilled) and management (ecological and conventional) systems on WU and performance of forage barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and weed biomass in two crop rotations (wheat [Triticum aestivum L. ]–forage barley–pea [Pisum sativum L. ] and wheat–forage barley–corn [Zea mays L. ] –pea) from 2004 to 2010 in eastern Montana. Conventional management included recommended seeding rates, broadcast N fertilization, and short stubble height of wheat. Ecological management included 33 % greater seeding rates, banded N fertilization at planting, and taller wheat stubble. Forage barley in ecological management had 28 more plants m– 2, 2 cm greater height, 65 more tillers m– 2, 606 kg ha– 1 greater crop biomass, 3. 5 kg ha– 1 mm– 1 greater WUE, and 47 % reduction in weed biomass at harvest than in conventional management. Pre-plant and post-harvest soil water contents were similar among tillage and management systems, but barley WU was 13 mm greater in 4 -yr than 3 -yr rotation. Tillage had <b>little</b> effect on <b>barley</b> performance and WU.

It was every one's object to get the maximum of money for the minimum of work. The escort took especial care to see that all their belongings were loaded before ours were touched. Each load was felt, and each box was hand-weighed before being accepted: the heaviest, rejected by the rich, were invariably left to the poorest and the lowest clansmen with the weakest and leanest of animals. All at first especially objected to the excellent boxes--a great comfort--made for the Expedition[EN#21] at the Citadel, Cairo; but they ended with bestowing their hatred upon the planks, the tables, and the long tent-poles.

40|$|Alternatives to the {{traditional}} small grain-bare fallow system on the Canadian Prairies are needed to avoid long-term deterioration of soil quality and to stabilize income. Canola (Brassica campestris L.) or pea (Pisum sativum L.) replaced traditional bare fallow in a 3 -year rotation with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on a Mollic Cryoboralf near Beaverlodge, Alberta. Liming (none and 7. 5 Mg haÿ 1 in 1991) and tillage [conventional shallow (CT) and zero tillage (ZT) ] were factorially arranged with crop rotation to assess barley grain and stover production during 1993 – 1995. Barley grain yield was 115 % greater during the first phase following canola or pea than during the second phase. During both phases in the rotation, barley yield was 85 % greater with pea than with canola. Crop rotation had <b>little</b> effect on <b>barley</b> stover production. Liming increased barley grain yield 178 % and stover yield 1313 %, which {{could be attributed to}} the maintenance of soil pH at 6. 20. 1 after liming compared with 5. 00. 1 without liming. Zero tillage produced a grain yield advantage and a stover yield disadvantage in one of three years, but had no detrimental effect on stover or grain yield in other years. Volumetric soil water content of the surface 0 – 0. 2 m under ZT was 0. 030. 02 m 3 mÿ 3 greater than under CT. Highest grain production (barley– barley–pea, limed, ZT) was 4. 350. 34 Mg haÿ 1, while lowest grain production (barley–barley–canola, unlimed, CT) was 2. 880. 53 Mg haÿ 1.
