40|$|A {{new system}} for {{efficiently}} feeding solid fuels to high pressure processes {{has been developed}} {{over the course of}} this PhD study. The system, named the Hydraulic <b>Lock</b> <b>Hopper</b> (HLH), {{takes the form of a}} new <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> that utilises water as an incompressible fluid during the compression stage. It disposes of the need for inert gas or gas compressors as is required by conventional <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> systems, and vastly increases their operational efficiency. The HLH has demonstrated the feeding of a range of fuels including wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets and ground anthracite grains to pressures as high as 25 barg. Two modes of operation have been developed, one whereby the energy requirement to feed is minimised (Mode 1), and another whereby the volume of high pressure gas vented to the atmosphere is reduced to near nil (Mode 2). In addition to this, the HLH has been developed to operate without the forward leakage of air in order to minimise explosive atmospheres...|$|E
40|$|Material {{feeding and}} {{handling}} {{systems have been}} cited {{as one of the}} most common causes of process downtime where thermochemical conversion processes are concerned. New and emerging fuels come in a variety of forms, and if such fuels are to be deployed widely it is imperative that material feeding and handling systems are designed appropriately. This study proposes an approach for designing material feeding and handling systems for use with coarse solid fuels. The data obtained from this study indicates particle size to be one of the key issues affecting the flowability of bulk solids further to the uniformity in particle shape. Coarse bulk solid samples were shown to flow more freely than their milled and pulverised counterparts, generating higher degrees of flowability. The results from this study were also applied to a new feed system used for feeding solid fuels to high pressure processes named the Hydraulic <b>Lock</b> <b>Hopper.</b> In this study the Hydraulic <b>Lock</b> <b>Hopper</b> demonstrated the feeding of wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets, and ground anthracite coal grains against a pressure of 25 barg in two modes of operation. Energy savings compared to conventional <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> systems were recorded in the region of 80 %...|$|E

With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of petrochemical industry, the operation condition of pressure vessels under the alternating load was increasing and {{the probability of}} fatigue failure was also on the rise. As a result, pressure vessel fatigue analysis is gaining the designer's attention.

In this work, a coupled multiscale approach is applied, which combines system-level analysis, component-level modeling, and micron-scale particle phenomena, for the development and assessment of a novel coal feeding system. The proposed Phase Inversion-based Coal-CO₂ Slurry (PHICCOS) feeding system uses supercritical CO₂ with liquid-like density to feed pulverized coal into a high-pressure EFG. The challenge of preparing the coal-CO₂ slurry is addressed using phase inversion: a phenomenon associated with the hydrophobicity of liquid CO₂-coal mixtures. This allows for operation at ambient temperature and without the use of <b>lock</b> <b>hoppers.</b> Furthermore, the PHICCOS feeding system achieves very high feed pressures while reducing the moisture and ash content of the feedstock, which makes it especially attractive for low-rank and high-ash coal. The merits of the PHICCOS feeding system were demonstrated through technoeconomic analysis coupled with particle-level kinetics. The results of this work show the significant advantages of this system over alternative technologies, in particular for low-rank feedstock. Optimization was used to determine the operating conditions required for the best tradeoff between kinetics, thermodynamics, and costs. The effect of the uncertainty in critical design and operating parameters on the overall economics of a PHICCOS-fed plant were examined using Monte Carlo simulations. This work shows that the PHICCOS system can efficiently and economically feed pulverized coal into high-pressure reactors in plants equipped with carbon capture. Overall, the economics of the PHICCOS feeding system are better than those of commercial technologies for low-rank coal and are competitive with other solutions for high-rank coal. Furthermore, PHICCOS has unique operational advantages related to the very high feed pressures it can achieve and to its feedstock flexibility: cheap and widely available high-moisture and high-ash coal can be used to produce high value products.

40|$|Although the {{operating}} principle of the <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> system is extremely simple, valve applications involving this service for coal gasification plants are likewise extremely difficult. The difficulties center on the requirement of handling highly erosive pulverized coal or char (either in dry or slurry form) combined with the requirement of providing tight sealing against high-pressure (possibly very hot) gas. Operating pressures and temperatures in these applications typically range up to 1600 psi (110 bar) and 600 F (316 C), with certain process requirements going even higher. In addition, and of primary concern, {{is the need for}} reliable operation over long service periods with the provision for practical and economical maintenance. Currently available data indicate the requirement for something in the order of 20, 000 to 30, 000 open-close cycles per year and a desire to operate at least that long without valve failure...|$|E
40|$|When DOE {{funds were}} {{exhausted}} in March 1995, all Phase 2 activities {{were placed on}} hold. In February 1996 a detailed cost estimate was submitted to the DOE for completing the two remaining Phase 2 Multi Annular Swirl Burner (MASB) topping combustor test burns; in August 1996 release was received from METC to proceed with these tests. The first test (Test Campaign No. 3) will be conducted to: (1) test the MASB at proposed demonstration plant full to minimum loading operating conditions; (2) identify the lower oxygen limit of the MASB; and (3) demonstrate natural gas to carbonizer fuel gas switching. The Livingston Phase 3 Pilot Plant was last operated under contract DE-AC 21 - 86 MC 21023 in September 1995 for seven days in an integrated carbonizer-CPFBC configuration. In May, 1996, the pilot plant was transferred to Contract DE-AC 22 - 95 PC 95143 to allow testing {{in support of the}} High Performance Power Systems (HIPPS) Program. The HIPPS Program required modifications to the pilot plant and the following changes were incorporated: (1) installation of a dense phase transport system for loading pulverized coal into the feed system <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> directly from a pneumatic transport truck; (2) removal of the char transfer pipe between the char collecting hopper and the CPFBC to allow carbonizer only operation; (3) installation of a <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> directly under the char collecting hopper to facilitate char removal from the process, the hopper vent gases exhaust to the carbonizer baghouse filter and the depressured char is transferred via nitrogen to the CPFBC baghouse for dumping into drums; (4) removal of the carbonizer cyclone and top of bed overflow drain line; all material elutriated from the carbonizer bed will thus be removed by the 22 -element Westinghouse ceramic candle filter; (5) replacement of the carbonizer continuous bottom bed drain (screw feeder) with a batch-type drain removal system; and (6) installation of a mass spectrometer that draws sample gas via a steam jacketed line from the refractory lined piping downstream of the candle filter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{considers}} {{the integration of}} Pd-based H 2 -selective membranes in integrated gasifier combined cycles (IGCC) from both technical and economical point of view. The selected gasification system is based on Shell technology. Two different dry feeding systems are investigated: {{the first is a}} state-of-the- art nitrogen-based <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> charger while the second uses CO 2 as pressurization gas. The net electric efficiency of the two plants is evaluated {{as a function of the}} hydrogen recovery factor (HRF) and the membrane feed pressure in order to minimize the membrane surface area. 90 % HRF and 54 bar feed pressure are the best operating parameters which correspond to a net electric efficiency of 39 % both for N 2 and CO 2 feeding system. The cost of CO 2 avoided is calculated as a function of a parameter named MI which represents the membrane development in terms of performances and costs. Results show that an improvement of membrane technology is necessary to match the state-of-the-art CO 2 capture plant, even though membranes show good potentiality for cost abatement...|$|E
40|$|Gasification of comingled biomass {{and coal}} {{feedstock}} {{is an effective}} means of reducing the net life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the coal gasification process while maintaining its inherent benefits of abundance and high-energy density. However, feeding a comingled biomass and coal feedstock into a pressurized gasification reactor poses a technical problem. Conventional dry feeding systems, such as <b>lock</b> <b>hoppers</b> and pressurized pneumatic transport, are complex and operationally expensive. A slurry formation of comingled biomass and coal feedstock can be easily fed into the gasification reactor but, in normal conditions, only allows for a small portion of biomass in the mixture. This is a consequence of the hydroscopic and hydrophilic nature of the biomass. The College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) at the University of California, Riverside, has developed a process producing high solid content biomass-water slurry using a hydrothermal pretreatment process. In this paper, the systematic investigation of the rheological properties (e. g., shear rate, shear stress, and viscosity) of coal-water slurries, biomass-water slurries, and comingled biomass and coal-water slurries is reported. The solid particle size distribution in the slurry and the initial solid/water ratio were investigated to determine the impact on shear rate and viscosity. This was determined using a rotational rheometer. The experimental results show that larger particle size offers better pumpability. The presence of a high percentage of biomass in solid form significantly decreases slurry pumpability. It is also shown that the solid loading of the biomass-water slurry can be increased to approximately 35 wt%with viscosity of less than 0. 7 Pa 3 s after the pretreatment process. The solid loading increased to approximately 45 wt%when the biomass is comingled with coal...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} program {{is concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} form of feeder, known as the Stamet Posimetric O High Pressure Solids Feeder, to feed dry granular solids continuously and controllably into gas pressure. The device is a rotary mechanical feeder, which utilizes the interlocking and internal friction of the granular solids to drive the solids through into the outlet pressure in a continuous and controllable way, using a continuous solids material seal on the feeder outlet to control gas leakage. Earlier work sponsored under previous SBIR grants has successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of the Stamet machine over pressurized <b>lock</b> <b>hopper</b> or paste feeder methods. The objective of this project was to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter specified granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with next generation pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report encompasses the development of material transport properties testers, methods to predict feeder performance by calculation, and the modification and testing of Stamet feeders to feed the material supplied into pressure. Testers were made to measure material compressibility, bulk density, both internal and wall friction coefficients, and permeability under typical conditions experienced inside a Stamet high pressure feeder. This data is then used in support of ongoing efforts to develop calculations to predict the performance of Stamet pressure feeders with different materials and conditions. Three Stamet pressure feeders were modified to handle the fine granular or pulverized coal, and were tested under various conditions using different outlet arrangements. The initial testing identified difficulties in handling the fine materials, but through a series of calculations and tests, the issues were overcome and the material was successfully fed into pressure. In all cases the performance calculated based on the measured material properties and feeder geometry agreed well with the test results, confirming the ability to predict performance and select geometry required to handle different conditions. However, the maximum pressure achieved was limited by an ineffective auger design, which was unable to effectively control the length of the outlet seal at higher pressures without imposing additional mechanical loads on the surface of the coal seal. This prevented steady state conditions being maintained long enough to reach the target pressure. Though the specified coal was successfully pumped into pressures over 200 psi, and the test results clearly indicate the changes required to provide a fixed outlet geometry that would achieve the 450 psi target, time and funding was not available to pursue this goal further under this project...|$|E
