5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to {{bring out the best in}} herself.|$|E

25|$|The {{events of}} 2011 greatly {{affected}} {{the writing process}} for the song, including the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in March, the death of electronic musician Rei Harakami in July and turmoil in Yamaguchi's personal life. Yamaguchi wanted both the song and Documentaly {{to act as a}} record of what it was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the post-earthquake period of 2011 in Japan, so expressed all of these events while writing the song.

He noted that in YouTube-style commentary, people posted their opinions primarily as reactions to other peoples' opinions, while the majority of people had a third-person view of the entire process.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] was {{released}} as a single, being an outtake from the band's previous release, Leave Home. This period was extremely significant to the punk rock genre, {{as it was the}} initial wave of New York City's underground punk bands receiving recording contracts. New York-based clubs CBGB and Max's Kansas City began to see bigger audiences crowd in to hear these bands. Punk fans commonly believed that this musical style would soon top the market, to which author Tom Carson explains: [...] "To be in New York that summer was to have some sense of what it might have been <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco in 1966 or '67, or in London when the Beatles and the [...] Stones first hit." ...|$|E

By {{the end of the}} decade, she had returned to making films primarily in Italy, accepting a pay cut, turning her back on Hollywood stardom. Cardinale has further said, [...] "I don't like the star system. I'm a normal person. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Europe. I mean, I've been going to Hollywood many, many times, but I didn't want to sign a contract."

The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced.

[...] Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, [...] the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon.
