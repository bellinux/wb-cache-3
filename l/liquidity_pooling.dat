40|$|The large-value {{payment system}} in the United Kingdom (CHAPS) is highly tiered: a few {{settlement}} banks make payments on behalf of many customer banks. This paper makes use of a simulation approach to quantify by how much tiering affects, on the one hand, concentration and credit risk and, on the other, the liquidity needs of CHAPS. We do so by creating scenarios where current settlement banks become customer banks and thus we increase the degree of tiering. The results show that concentration risk would rise substantially in what is already a highly concentrated system. As for credit risk, the size of intraday exposures compared with settlement banks' capital is very small and therefore the likelihood of contagion remote. More importantly, the increase in credit risk brought to the system by settlement banks leaving CHAPS bears little relationship to the values settled by each individual bank. We find that increasing the degree of tiering in CHAPS leads to substantial liquidity savings - although the liquidity saved is {{only a fraction of}} the spare liquidity currently posted in the system. Most of the savings are due to <b>liquidity</b> <b>pooling</b> rather than to internalisation of payments. There is a strong relationship between changes in values settled and liquidity needs. This relationship can be used to forecast the impact on liquidity needs if more banks were to join CHAPS. The quantification of the trade-off between risk and efficiency in different scenarios provides policymakers with a useful analytical framework for analysing the effects of tiering. ...|$|E

In fact we find supporting evidence i. e. negative abnormal returns and beta risk increases for REITs around bank bailout announcements.

40|$|In {{response}} to banking crises, governments often embark on direct credit programs and bank nationalization schemes. A theoretical framework {{is provided in}} this paper {{to examine the effects}} of such policy measures. A crisis of confidence in the banking sector is shown to be associated with a deposit flight that results in a contraction of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>pool</b> from which banks can finance their borrowers. Although banks are assumed to be perfectly competitive, the liquidity shortage indirectly provides them with bargaining power when they negotiate their debt contracts. Credit conditions are worsened both by the lack of liquidity in the form of deposits, but also by the market power enjoyed by banks when loanable funds are scarce. Government intervention in the credit market through state-owned banks can improve the credit terms on which firms borrow, leading to less deadweight losses from firm bankruptcies. The desirability of direct lending to firms via state-owned banks is conditioned on the degree of deposit rationing experienced by the banking sector and the ability of the government itself to access liquid funds. Using a panel dataset of 157 countries over the period 1970 - 2006, I find that a moderate state ownership of banking assets that ranges between 10 % and 50 % is associated with a lower interest rate spread during a banking crisis, as well as with a higher annual growth rate of GDP per capita relative to more privatized and more nationalized banking systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} long {{standing}} {{issue of whether}} markets can supply banks with sufficient liquidity or whether markets should be complemented with a lender of last resort (LOLR). For this purpose, we develop an extended version of the recent model of Holmström and Tirole (1998) on the supply of liquidity to firms. H&Ts original model analyses liquidity supply to firms that are facing solvency shocks. We apply their framework to banking and extend the framework to admit the analysis of problems associated with transitory liquidity outflows, even absent any change in a bank's value. Our premise is that the scope for moral hazard may increase in connection with liquidity outflows. Moral hazard, which we interpret as the possibility of laxity in banks' monitoring of firms, may increase with liquidity outflows because banks need to increase their monitoring efforts in order to safeguard their own interests. The model illustrates many key aspects the classical LOLR debate. The model shows how moral hazard limits of banks’ ability to borrow from markets to cover liquidity outflows. It also predicts banks’ demand for liquid reserves and the economies associated with centralization of reserves in a <b>liquidity</b> <b>pool</b> when the holding of liquid reserves entails opportunity costs. Finally, the model enables discussion of viable lending policies for the LOLR and contrasts these with the ‘Bagehotian principles’, which are still widely used as benchmark criteria in evaluating LOLR operations. liquidity; lender of last resort; banking; central banking...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in the {{discussion}} on banks' liquidity management is the question, why banks which have positive net present value (which are solvent), should {{find it hard to}} obtain finance from the market, ie be illiquid. Current theoretical models propose that liquidity problems by banks may arise due to co-ordination failure by outside investors (sunspot bank runs), or due to solvency shocks. We will argue that, if a bank is characterised by the possibility for moral hazard, liquidity problems may arise also absent any effects on bank solvency in non-panic situations. This happens when moral hazard problems are amplified in connection with the outflows of liquidity. The model suggests for a possibility that pure liquidity shocks can have real effects in banks' behavior and in the completion of investment projects. We will formalise our hypothesis by extending the framework introduced by Holmstöm and Tirole (1998), and use the extended framework to discuss optimal reserve policy in banking under moral hazard. In particular, we will discuss the potential gains achievable in banks' reserve policy when the implementor of the policy is a centralised <b>liquidity</b> <b>pool,</b> a lender of last resort. The implications of the model as regards central bank policy are consistent with empirical regularities observed in the development of LLR activity during the 1900 's. In particular, the model rationalises the observed shift from adherence to strict Bagehotian principles to more supportive LLR assistance. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The world-wide {{consolidation}} in {{the electronic}} trading industry has provided evidence that small exchanges and trading portals need to deliver more than sophisticated technology, streaming quotes and market data. In order to deliver value and survive, they need to provide liquidity. Noteworthy among the most recent industry challenges is the dismal performance of exchanges like the Belgian Stock Exchange that finally caved in to the inevitable merger with the London Stock Exchange. The Italian exchange took similar action and so did {{a number of other}} small exchanges in the European Union. This development has exacerbated the debate over the need for small stock exchanges and portals to exist unless they can provide both superior technology and liquidity. This paper proposes to examine the performance of the Belgian stock exchange and a select group of portals trading Belgian equities through the metric of liquidity access for fostering trade execution and capital flows. Illiquidity and the dislocation of a number of securities traded on the Belgian exchange are examined using transaction costs and the price impact of trading (as opposed to just asset prices) to explain such lack of liquidity. Concurrently, the intervention of aggregators of <b>liquidity</b> <b>pools</b> and the rising influence of noise traders (hedge funds) are analyzed to provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms used to attract liquidity. This serves to determine whether portals may continue to attract large <b>pools</b> of <b>liquidity.</b> In closing, we suggest that capital assets are probably not mispriced in markets served by small exchanges, and thus arbitrage opportunities do not exist. Other factors related to timing, anticipation effects and outliers are more significant in determining whether liquidity providers initiate in those markets. The nature of the economies that these exchanges are designed to support is also a contributing factor to the dislocation and disintermediation of capital demand from local firms and truly large global organizations. by Steven E.

However, exposing rather than hiding order size increases average execution costs. We assess the extent to which non-displayed size is truly hidden and document that the presence and magnitude of hidden orders can be predicted to a significant, but imperfect, degree based on observable order attributes, firm characteristics, and market conditions.

By <b>pooling</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk and reducing inefficient liquidation, a banking system delivers total factor productivity gains that allow a higher level of capital accumulation and growth. However, banks may face liquidity crises associated with severe output losses.
