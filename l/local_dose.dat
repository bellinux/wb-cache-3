40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess patient {{radiation}} exposure in comprehensive stroke imaging using multidetector row CT (MDCT) combining standard CT of the head, cerebral perfusion (CTP), and CT angiography (CTA) studies. METHODS: Examination protocols for CT and CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, {{as well as}} CTP were simulated using a Somatom Sensation Cardiac 64. Effective doses were derived from measurements {{with the use of}} lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF-TLD) at several organ sites using an Alderson-Rando phantom. RESULTS: LiF-TLD measurements resulted in effective doses of 1. 7 mSv for CT, 1. 9 mSv for CTA of intracranial vessels, and 2. 8 mSv for CTA of cervical vessels, respectively. Depending on examination parameters, effective doses varied between 1. 1 and 5. 0 mSv for cerebral CTP. For CTP, <b>local</b> <b>doses</b> {{in the area of the}} primary beam ranged between 114 and 444 mGy. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive stroke imaging may result in up to 9. 5 mSv with possible <b>local</b> <b>doses</b> of 490 mGy.

40|$|The {{induction}} of localized DNA damage {{within a}} discrete nuclear volume {{is an important}} tool in DNA repair studies. Both charged particle irradiation and laser microirradiation (LMI) systems allow for such a localized damage induction, but the results obtained are difficult to compare, as the delivered laser dose cannot be measured directly. Therefore, we revisited {{the idea of a}} biological dosimetry based on the microscopic evaluation of irradiation-induced Replication Protein A (RPA) foci numbers. Considering that <b>local</b> <b>dose</b> deposition is characteristic for both LMI and charged particles, we took advantage of the defined dosimetry of particle irradiation to estimate the locally applied laser dose equivalent. Within the irradiated nuclear sub-volumes, the doses were in the range of several hundreds of Gray. However, <b>local</b> <b>dose</b> estimation is limited by the saturation of the RPA foci numbers with increasing particle doses. Even high-resolution 4 Pi microscopy did not abrogate saturation as it was not able to resolve single lesions within individual RPA foci. Nevertheless, 4 Pi microscopy revealed multiple and distinct 53 BP 1 - and γH 2 AX-stained substructures within the lesion flanking chromatin domains. Monitoring the local recruitment of the telomere repeat-binding factors TRF 1 and TRF 2 showed that both proteins accumulated at damage sites after UVA–LMI but not after densely ionizing charged particle irradiation.

Among 4401 3 -year survivors of a childhood cancer in eight French and British centres and 25 120 patients younger than 20 years old at first malignant neoplasm (FMN) extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, 16 patients developed a melanoma as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). A cohort study of the French and British cohorts was performed. In a nested case-control study, the 16 patients who developed a melanoma as a SMN (cases) were matched with 3 - 5 controls in their respective cohort according to gender, age at the first cancer, the calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer and follow-up. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of melanoma for <b>local</b> <b>doses</b> > 15 Gy, Odds Ratio (OR) = 13 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 0. 94 - 174). Regarding chemotherapy, we observed an increased OR for both alkylating agents and spindle inhibitors, OR 2. 7 (95 % CI: 0. 5 - 14). Children treated for a gonadal tumour as a FMN were found to be at a higher risk of melanoma, OR 8. 7 (95 % CI: 0. 9 - 86). The adjusted OR for the <b>local</b> radiation <b>dose</b> was 1. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 15). In conclusion, radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk of melanoma as a SMN, but only at very high doses of low linear energy transfer radiation.

40|$|Background Epidural {{fibrosis}} (EF) {{is defined}} as nonphysiological scar formation, usually {{at the site of}} neurosurgical access into the spinal canal, in intimate vicinity to and around the origin of the radicular sheath. From the very onset, EF behaves as a reparative inflammation causing, as a rule, symptoms of characteristic nature and clinical course (pain). Treatment of epidural fibrosis causing failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) by neuromadulation technique is very expensive. Finding of suitable parameters for the indication of treatment is therefore very important. Aims The study is based on evidence of the importance of epidural fibrosis for the development of chronic pain. Research is also focused on the comparison of the range fibrosis and the effect of stimulation (spinal cord stimulation - SCS). The goal is to find a suitable selection factor for the indication of neuromodulation. Methods I.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether occurance of early radiation effects in lung tissue depends on local close only. Methods and Materials: Twenty-five percent. 50 %, 66 %, 88 %, or 100 % {{of the rat}} lung was irradiated using single fractions of 150 -MeV protons. For all volumes, in-field and out-of-field dose-response curves were obtained 8 weeks after irradiation. The pathohistology of parenchymal inflammation, infiltrates, fibrosis, and vascular damage and the relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha, transforming growth factor-beta. IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assessed. Results: For all histologic endpoints, irradiated dose- and volume-dependent in-field and out-of-field effects were observed, albeit with different dynamics. Of note, the out-of-field effects for vascular damage were {{very similar to the}} in-field effects. Interestingly, only IL- 6 showed a clear dose-dependent increase in expression both in-field and out-of-field, whereas the expression levels of IL- 1 alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were either very low or without a clear dose-volume relation. As such, none of the radiation effects studied depended only on <b>local</b> <b>dose</b> to the tissue. Conclusion: The effects of radiation to lung tissue do not only depend on <b>local</b> <b>dose</b> to that tissue. Especially at high-volume irradiation, lung damage seems to present globally rather than locally. The accuracy of predictive modeling may be improved by including nonlocal effects.

40|$|Common {{problems}} in inverse radiotherapy planning are localized dose insufficiencies like hot spots in organs at risk or cold spots inside targets. These {{are hard to}} correct since the optimization is based on global evaluations like maximum/minimum doses, equivalent uniform doses or dose-volume constraints for whole structures. In this work, we present {{a new approach to}} locally correct the dose of any given treatment plan. Once a treatment plan has been found that is acceptable in general but requires local corrections, these areas are marked by the planner. Then the system generates new plans that fulfil the <b>local</b> <b>dose</b> goals. Consequently, it is possible to interactively explore all plans between the locally corrected plans and the original treatment plan, allowing one to exactly adjust the degree of local correction and how the plan changes overall.

Additionally, a refinement of the radial dose distribution seems to be appropriate. Radial Dose Distribution In the original dose distribution of the LEM, the radical diffusion was taken into account by using a minimal radius of 10 nm below which the dose is constant. However, recent experiments suggest that the diffusion length is shorter. Therefore, we modified the physical dose distribution by reducing the minimal radius to 0. 3 nm according to experimental data for the dose distribution [2] and convolving the physical dose distribution D(r) with a Gaussian distribution of width σ= 4 nm to account for radical diffusion [5...|$|R

Intrafractional anatomy changes cannot be captured satisfactorily during treatment with hitherto available imaging modalitites. Consequently, dose calculations {{are based on the}} assumption of static anatomy throughout the treatment. However, intra- and interfraction anatomy is dynamic and changes can be significant. In this paper, we investigate the use of an MR-linac as a dose tracking modality for the validation of treatments in abdominal targets where both respiratory and long-term peristaltic and drift motion occur. The on-line MR imaging capability of the modality provides the means to perform respiratory gating of both delivery and acquisition yielding a model-free respiratory motion management under free breathing conditions. In parallel to the treatment, the volumetric patient anatomy was captured and used to calculate the applied dose. Subsequently, the individual doses were warped back to the planning grid to obtain the actual dose accumulated over the entire treatment duration. Ultimately, the planned dose was validated by comparison with the accumulated dose.
