Ibn Ali himself credited Hope with being his main inspiration: [...] "by meeting Mr Hope it was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> to and having acquaintance with {{the mystery of}} music, who explained not by the ruler or lip but with music. So from him I heard how to learn." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Robert Christgau and Rolling Stones David Browne found Flood to be {{unremarkable}} overall. Both critics chastised the band's novelty, {{which they}} {{found to be}} wearing thin as time progressed. In the UK Caroline Sullivan of Melody Maker felt that enjoyment of Flood [...] "hinges upon one's general feelings about similarly zany characters <b>like</b> <b>Talking</b> Heads and Frank Zappa. If their very American, very beatnik, surrealism spells instant yawnorama, forget TMBG—they're the same thing, but minus the good tunes." [...] However, in a 2009 Rolling Stone article revisiting Flood near its twentieth anniversary, DX Ferris praised the album as both the band's most iconic release and one that revolutionized the college radio scene.|$|E

The first reported contact Murray had with anyone on February 9 was at 1:00 pm, when she emailed her boyfriend: [...] "I got your messages, but honestly, I didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> to much of anyone, I promise to call today though." [...] She also made a phone call inquiring about renting a condominium in the same Bartlett, New Hampshire, condo association her family had vacationed at in the past. Telephone records indicate the call lasted three minutes. The owner did not rent the condo to Murray. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons unknown.|$|E
500|$|Women's {{suffrage}} was {{an early}} interest of Douglas, and although she tended {{to shy away from}} polemics in her early work at The Miami Herald, on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions. In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, William Jennings Bryan's wife, and two other women to Tallahassee to speak in support of women's right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: [...] "All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> to graven images. They never paid attention to us at all." [...] Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.|$|E
500|$|A direct {{reaction}} to prog {{came in the}} form of the punk movement, which rejected classical traditions, virtuosity, and textural complexity. Post-punk, which author Doyle Green characterizes [...] "as a kind of progressive punk", was played by bands <b>like</b> <b>Talking</b> Heads, Pere Ubu, Public Image Ltd, and Joy Division. It differs from punk rock by balancing punk's energy and skepticism with a re-engagement with an art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. It was also majorly influenced from world music, especially African and Asian traditions. In the same period, new wave music was more sophisticated in production terms than some contemporaneous progressive music, but was largely perceived as simplistic, and thus had little overt appeal to art music or art-music practice. Musicologist Bill Martin writes; [...] "the [...] Heads created a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate {{on the things that}} did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E
2500|$|Author on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, {{it is also}} {{important}} [...] "to include in this category the so-called 'art rock' musical innovations and mixing of styles associated with groups <b>like</b> <b>Talking</b> Heads, and performers like Laurie Anderson, together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of disco' by the Pet Shop Boys".|$|E

2500|$|A {{southern}} background {{combined with}} a performing style largely associated with African Americans had led to [...] "bitter criticism by those who feel he stole a good thing", as Tan magazine surmised. No wonder that Elvis became [...] "a symbol of all that was oppressive to the black experience in the Western Hemisphere". [...] A black southerner in the late 1980s even captured that sentiment: [...] "To talk to Presley about blacks was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> to Adolf Hitler about the Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 2004 {{interview}} with Adrian Pannett for Comes with a Smile magazine, {{when asked how}} important faith was to his music, he responded, [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> about that stuff in the public forum because, I think, certain themes and convictions are meant for personal conversation." [...] In a 2006 interview, he said, [...] "It’s {{not so much that}} faith influences us as it lives in us. In every circumstance (giving a speech or tying my shoes), I am living and moving and being." [...] In a 2010 interview, Stevens acknowledged that he is a Christian.|$|E

500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence.

2500|$|In the 1970s, {{they were}} paid homage by punk rockers such as Ramones, Patti Smith, and Lester Bangs. Partly due to the Ramones, many acts that Stereogum called [...] "punk or punk-adjacent" [...] showed {{influence}} from the Beach Boys: Slickee Boys, Agent Orange, Bad Religion, Shonen Knife, the Queers, Hi-Standard, the Donnas, M.O.D.. and the Vandals. Heavily reliant on 1970s analog synthesizers, the Beach Boys' album Love You (1977) has been recognized as an early work of synthpop. Adam Theisian wrote: [...] "What’s especially amazing about Love You, though, is its prescience. It totally anticipates new wave experiments, arty bands <b>like</b> <b>Talking</b> Heads and synth-pop in general years before they hit the mainstream." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Leningrad Symphony Orchestra {{announced}} {{the premiere of}} the Seventh Symphony for its 1941–1942 season. The fact this announcement was made before the German invasion would seem to confirm the statement in Testimony. Shostakovich did not <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> about what he called [...] "creative plans," [...] preferring to announce his works once they were completed. He did like to say, [...] "I think slowly but I write fast." [...] In practice this meant that Shostakovich usually had a work completed in his head before he began writing it down. The Leningrad Symphony {{would not have made}} its announcement without the composer's consent, so Shostakovich likely had a clear idea at that time of what his Seventh Symphony would portray.|$|E
2500|$|Many-worlds {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a theory, rather than just an interpretation, by those who propose that many-worlds can make testable predictions (such as David Deutsch) or is falsifiable (such as Everett) or by those who propose that all the other, non-MW interpretations, are inconsistent, illogical or unscientific in their handling of measurements; Hugh Everett argued that his formulation was a metatheory, since it made statements about other interpretations of quantum theory; that it was the [...] "only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world." [...] Deutsch is dismissive that many-worlds is an [...] "interpretation", saying that calling it an interpretation [...] "is <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> about dinosaurs as an 'interpretation' of fossil records." ...|$|E

Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> to salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.|$|E
2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn't they just talk (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's a bad thing to be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E
