50|$|Leptin and ghrelin are {{considered}} to be complementary in their influence on appetite, with ghrelin produced by the stomach modulating short-term appetitive control (i.e. to eat when the stomach is empty and to stop when the stomach is stretched). Leptin is produced by adipose tissue to signal fat storage reserves in the body, and mediates long-term appetitive controls (i.e. to eat more when fat storages are low and less when fat storages are high). Although administration of leptin may be effective in a small subset of obese individuals who are leptin-deficient, most obese individuals are thought to be <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> and have been found to have high levels of leptin. This resistance is thought to explain in part why administration of leptin has not been shown to be effective in suppressing appetite in most obese people.|$|E

Here we report {{a significant increase}} in PTP 1 B protein levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus (P = 0. 003) and a concomitant reduction in leptin sensitivity following 28 days of high-fat (HF) feeding in rats. A significant increase in PTP 1 B mRNA levels was also observed in rats chronically infused with leptin (3 μg/day icv) for 14 days (P = 0. 01) and in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice infused with leptin (5 μg/day sc for 14 days; P = 0. 003). When saline-infused ob/ob mice were placed on a HF diet for 14 days, an increase in hypothalamic PTP 1 B mRNA expression was detected (P = 0. 001) despite the absence of circulating leptin. In addition, although ob/ob mice were much more sensitive to leptin on a low-fat (LF) diet, a reduction in this sensitivity was still observed following exposure to a HF diet. Taken together, these data indicate that hypothalamic PTP 1 B is specifically increased during HF diet-induced leptin resistance. This increase in PTP 1 B {{is due in part to}} chronic hyperleptinemia, suggesting that hyperleptinemia is one mechanism contributing to the development of leptin resistance. However, these data also indicate that leptin is not required for the increase in hypothalamic PTP 1 B or the development of leptin resistance. Therefore, additional, leptin-independent mechanisms must exist that increase hypothalamic PTP 1 B and contribute to leptin resistance...|$|R

Based on current knowledge and previous models developed for body weight dynamics in rodents, the model includes the dynamics of leptin, leptin receptors and the regulation of food intake and body weight. It displays two stable equilibria, one representing a healthy state and the other one an obese and <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> state. We show that a constant leptin injection can lead to leptin resistance and that a temporal variation in some parameter values influencing food intake can induce a change of equilibrium and a pathway to leptin resistance and obesity...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{arcuate nucleus}} of the {{hypothalamus}} (ARH) is {{a key component of}} hypothalamic pathways regulating energy balance, and leptin is required for normal development of ARH projections. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) has a polygenic mode of inheritance, and DIO individuals develop the metabolic syndrome when a moderate amount of fat is added to the diet. Here we demonstrate that rats selectively bred to develop DIO, which are known to be <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> before they become obese, have defective ARH projections that persist into adulthood. Furthermore, the ability of leptin to activate intracellular signaling in ARH neurons in vivo and to promote ARH neurite outgrowth in vitro is significantly reduced in DIO neonates. Thus, animals that are genetically predisposed toward obesity display an abnormal organization of hypothalamic pathways involved in energy homeostasis that {{may be the result of}} diminished responsiveness of ARH neurons to the trophic actions of leptin during postnatal development...|$|E
40|$|Objective—Obese {{individuals}} have {{high levels of}} circulating <b>leptin</b> and are <b>resistant</b> to the weight-reducing effect of leptin administration at physiological doses. Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective weight loss procedure, there is a plateau in weight loss and most individuals remain obese. This plateau may be partly due to the decline in leptin resulting in a state of relative leptin insufficiency. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether leptin administration to post-RYGB patients would promote further weight reduction. Design and Methods—This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 27 women who were at least 18 months post-RYGB and lost on average 30. 8 % of their pre-surgical body weight. Subjects received either leptin or placebo via subcutaneous injection twice daily for 16 weeks, then crossed over to receive the alternate treatment for 16 weeks. Results—Weight change after 16 weeks of placebo was not significantly different from that after 16 weeks of leptin. No changes were observed in percent fat mass, resting energy expenditure, thyroid hormones, or cortisol levels.

40|$|Leptin is a {{peptide hormone}} {{produced}} by adipose tissue which acts centrally to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure. Although leptin increases norepinephrine turnover in thermogenic tissues, {{the effects of}} leptin on directly measured sympathetic nerve activity to thermogenic and other tissues are not known. We {{examined the effects of}} intravenous leptin and vehicle on sympathetic nerve activity to brown adipose tissue, kidney, hindlimb, and adrenal gland in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Intravenous infusion of mouse leptin over 3 h (total dose 10 - 1, 000 microg/kg) increased plasma concentrations of immunoreactive murine leptin up to 50 -fold. Leptin slowly increased sympathetic nerve activity to brown adipose tissue (+ 286 +/- 64 % at 1, 000 microg/kg; P = 0. 002). Surprisingly, leptin infusion also produced gradual increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity (+ 228 +/- 63 % at 1, 000 microg/kg; P = 0. 0008). The effect of leptin on sympathetic nerve activity was dose dependent, with a threshold dose of 100 microg/kg. Leptin also increased sympathetic nerve activity to the hindlimb (+ 287 +/- 60 %) and adrenal gland (388 +/- 171 %). Despite the increase in overall sympathetic nerve activity, leptin did not increase arterial pressure or heart rate. Leptin did not change plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Infusion of vehicle did not alter sympathetic nerve activity. Obese Zucker rats, known to possess a mutation in the gene for the <b>leptin</b> receptor, were <b>resistant</b> to the sympathoexcitatory effects of leptin, despite higher achieved plasma leptin concentrations.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) {{controls}} vital functions, by efficiently coordinating peripheral and central cascades of signals and networks in a coordinated manner. Historically, the brain {{was considered to be}} an insulin-insensitive tissue. But, new findings demonstrating that insulin is present in different regions of themammalian brain, in particular the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Insulin acts through specific receptors and dialogues with numerous peptides, neurotransmitters and adipokines such as leptin. The cross-talk between leptin and insulin signaling pathways at the hypothalamic level is clearly involved in the control of energy homeostasis. Both hormones are anorexigenic through their action on hypothalamic arcuate nucleus by inducing the expression of anorexigenic neuropetides such as POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin, the precursor of aMSH) and reducing the expression of orexigenic neuropeptide such as NPY (Neuropeptide Y). Central defect of insulin and leptin signaling predispose to obesity (leptin-resistant state) and type- 2 diabetes (insulin resistant state). Obesity and type- 2 diabetes are associated to deep alterations in energy homeostasis control but also to other alterations of CNS functions as the predisposition to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by distinct hallmarks within the brain. Postmortem observation of AD brains showed the presence of parenchymal plaques due to the accumulation of the amyloid beta (AB) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles. These accumulations result from the hyperphosphorylation of tau (a mictrotubule-interacting protein). Both insulin and leptin have been described to modulate tau phosphorylation and therefore in <b>leptin</b> and insulin <b>resistant</b> states may contribute to AD. The concentrations of leptin and insulin cerebrospinal fluid are decreased type 2 diabetes and obese patients. In addition, the concentration of insulin in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients is diminished. 				Taken together, these data clearly links deficiency of leptin and insulin signaling to both alterations of energy homeostasis control and predisposition to AD. Furthermore, environment changes leading to insulin and leptin-resistance may promote these defects, such as high fat diet...|$|R

However, it is not known whether, in these animals, the leptin action is altered. Here we studied the effect of ageing on plasma leptin concentration and the ability of hypothalamic nuclei to capture i. c. v. injected digoxigenin-labelled leptin. Our data indicate that 24 -month-old animals are hyperleptinaemic. However, daily food intake was greater in old animals, suggesting that they are <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant.</b> Leptin uptake in the hypothalamus was reduced in old rats. This uptake was a receptor-mediated process as demonstrated by displacement. Leptin accumulation in hypothalamic nuclei was partially colocalized with neuropeptide Y fibres. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed a lower amount of the long form of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus of aged rats. Analysis by RT-PCR also demonstrated a decreased expression of leptin receptor mRNA in old animals. We conclude that the lower leptin uptake may be explained, at least in part, by a decreased amount of receptors in hypothalamic neurones of the aged rats.

Our data indicate that, compared with age-matched controls, MSG rats displayed: (1) enhanced and reduced mineralocorticoid responses to ACTH and AII treatments, respectively, effects observed in both in vivo and in vitro conditions; (2) adrenal refractoriness to the inhibitory effect of exogenous leptin on ACTH-stimulated aldosterone output by isolated adrenocortical cells; and (3) distorted omental adiposity morphology and function. This study supports that the adult hyperleptinemic MSG female rat is characterized by enhanced ACTH-driven mineralocorticoid function, impaired adrenal leptin sensitivity, and disrupted abdominal adiposity function. MSG rats could counteract undesirable effects of glucocorticoid excess, by developing a reduced AII-driven mineralocorticoid function.

40|$|Leptin-resistant rats, {{when given}} a high-fat (HF) diet, have a delayed {{normalization}} of caloric intake and greater weight gain {{than those on}} a chow diet. Because aged, obese rats are <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant,</b> these data predict that they will also have a delayed normalization of caloric intake and exacerbated weight gain when provided a HF diet. To investigate this hypothesis, along {{with the consequences of}} a HF diet on voluntary wheel running, we compared various ages of rats on a HF or chow diet. HF-fed young rats spontaneously divided into diet-induced obese and diet-resistant rats. However, all aged rats were susceptible to the weight-gaining effects of HF feeding. Rate of initial weight gain was proportional to age, and peak caloric intake on the HF diet and the days required to normalize caloric intake to basal levels increased with age. Responsiveness to peripheral leptin before HF feeding revealed a dose-response decrease in food intake and body weight in the young but no responses in the aged to even the highest dose, 0. 5 mg/day. In addition, both age and HF feeding decreased the tendency for wheel running, suggesting the propensity for inactivity with age and HF feeding may contribute to age-related obesity and accelerate the rate of diet-induced obesity. These results demonstrate that aged rats are more susceptible to the detrimental effects of a HF diet...|$|E
40|$|Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) {{is closely}} linked with metabolic diseases, appetite disorders and obesity at adulthood. Leptin, a major adipokine secreted by adipose tissue, circulates {{in direct proportion}} to body fat stores, enters the brain and regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Deficient leptin neuronal signalling favours weight gain by affecting central homeostatic circuitry. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if leptin resistance was programmed by perinatal nutritional environment and to decipher potential cellular mechanisms underneath. We clearly demonstrated that 5 months old IUGR rats develop a decrease of leptin sentivity, characterized by no significant reduction of food intake following an intraperitoneal injection of leptin. Apart from the resistance to leptin injection, results obtained from IUGR rats submitted to rapid catch-up growth differed from those of IUGR rats with no catch-up since we observed, for the first group only, fat accumulation, increased appetite for food rich in fat and increased leptin synthesis. Centrally, the <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> state of both groups was associated with a complex and not always similar changes in leptin receptor signalling steps. Leptin resistance in IUGR rats submitted to rapid catch-up was associated with alteration in AKT and mTOR pathways. Alternatively, in IUGR rats with no catch-up, leptin resistance was associated with low hypothalamic expression of LepRa and LepRb.

These {{changes have been}} recapitulated in <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> obese Zucker rats but were not observed in high-fat fed Wistar rats. Recent data from mouse models suggest that such discrepancies may reflect differences in leptin signalling.

Male ob/ob and db/db mice and their respective littermate controls (n= 10 – 12 /group) were studied {{at the age of}} 12 weeks. Enzyme activities and mRNA expression were quantified in snap-frozen tissues. The patterns of altered pathways of steroid metabolism in obesity were similar in ob/ob and db/db mice.

In visceral adipose depots, 5 β-reductase was not expressed, 11 β-HSD 1 activity was increased and 5 αR 1 mRNA was not altered in obesity. By contrast, in subcutaneous adipose tissue 11 β-HSD 1 and 5 αR 1 mRNA were decreased.

However, the mechanisms by which diabetes confers protection from lung injury are unknown. Objectives: To determine whether leptin resistance, which is seen in humans with diabetes, protects mice from hyperoxic lung injury. Methods: Wild-type (leptin responsive) and db/db (<b>leptin</b> <b>resistant)</b> mice were used in these studies. Mice were exposed to hyperoxia (100 % O 2) for 84 hours to induce lung injury and up to 168 hours for survival studies. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured in vivo. Measurements and Main Results: Lung leptin levels were increased both in wild-type and leptin receptor–defective db/db mice after hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was decreased in db/db compared with wild-type mice. Hyperoxia increased lung permeability in wild-type mice but not in db/db mice. Compared with wild-type control animals, db/db mice were resistant to hyperoxiainduced mortality (lethal dose for 50 % of mice, 152 vs. 108 h). Intratracheal instillation of leptin at a dose that was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during hyperoxia caused lung injury in wild-type but not in db/db mice. Intratracheal pretreatment with a leptin receptor inhibitor attenuated leptin-induced lung edema. The hyperoxia-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines was attenuated in db/db mice. Despite resistance to lung injury, db/db mice had diminished alveolar fluid clearance and reduced Na, K-ATPase function compared with wild-type mice.

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{gastrointestinal}} hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) {{plays an}} important role in regulating meal size and duration by activating CCK 1 receptors on vagal afferent neurons (VAN). Leptin enhances CCK signaling in VAN via an early growth response 1 (EGR 1) dependent pathway thereby increasing their sensitivity to CCK. In response to a chronic ingestion of a high fat diet, VAN develop leptin resistance and the satiating effects of CCK are reduced. We tested the hypothesis that leptin resistance in VAN is responsible for reducing CCK signaling and satiation. Results: Lean Zucker rats sensitive to leptin signaling, significantly reduced their food intake following administration of CCK 8 S (0. 22 nmol/kg, i. p.), while obese Zucker rats, insensitive to leptin, did not. CCK signaling in VAN of obese Zucker rats was reduced, preventing CCK-induced up-regulation of Y 2 receptor and down-regulation of melanin concentrating hormone 1 receptor (MCH 1 R) and cannabinoid receptor (CB 1). In VAN from diet-induced obese (DIO) Sprague Dawley rats, previously shown to become <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant,</b> we demonstrated that the reduction in EGR 1 expression resulted in decreased sensitivity of VAN to CCK and reduced CCK-induced inhibition of food intake. The lowered sensitivity of VAN to CCK in DIO rats resulted in a decrease in Y 2 expression and increased CB 1 and MCH 1 R expression. These effects coincided with the onset of hyperphagia in DIO rats. Conclusions: Leptin signaling in VAN is required for appropriate CCK signaling and satiation. In response to high fat feeding...|$|E

In beta cells HS is characterised by 2 -O, 6 -O and N-sulphated moieties, whereas HS in alpha cells is N-acetylated, N-, and 2 -O sulphated and low in 6 -O groups. Differential expression of three HS modifying genes in alpha and beta cells was observed and {{may account for the}} different HS patterns. Furthermore, we found that FGF 1 and FGF 2 were present in alpha cells, whereas functional FGFRs exist in beta cells, but not in the alpha cell line aTC 1 - 6, or in primary alpha cells in islets. FGF 1 induced signalling was dependent on 2 -O, and 6 -O HS sulphation in beta cells, and HS desulphation reduced beta cell proliferation and potentiated oxidant induced apoptosis. In <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> animals and in islets from streptozotocin treated rats there was a reduction in alpha cell HS expression.

40|$|The {{influence}} of micronutrients on dopamine systems {{is not well}} defined. Using mice, we show a potential role for reduced dietary vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) in promoting diet-induced obesity (DIO), food intake, and drug consumption while on a high fat diet. To complement these deficiency studies, treatments with exogenous fully ctivevitaminD 3 (calcitriol, 10 g/kg,i. p.) were performed. Non deficient mice that were made <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> with a high fat diet displayed reduced food intake and body weight after an acute treatment with exogenous calcitriol. Dopamine neurons in the midbrain and their target neurons in the striatum were found to express vitamin D 3 receptor protein. Acute calcitriol treatment led to transcriptional changes of dopamine-related genes in these regions in naive mice, enhanced amphetamine-induced dopamine release in both naive mice and rats, and increased locomotor activity after acute amphetamine treatment (2. 5 mg/kg, i. p.). Alternatively, mice that were chronically fed either the reduced D 3 high fat or chow diets displayed less activity after acute amphetamine treatment compared with their respective controls. Finally, high fat deficient mice that were trained to orally consume liquid amphetamine (90 mg/L) displayed increased consumption, while nondeficient mice treated with calcitriol showed reduced consumption. Our findings suggest that reduced dietary D 3 may be a contributing environmental factor enhancing DIO as well as drug intake while eating a high fat diet. Moreover, these data demonstrate that dopamine circuits are modulated by D 3 signaling, and may serve as direct or indirect targets for exogenous calcitriol...|$|E

Using phosphorylation of STAT 3 (pSTAT 3) as a surrogate, {{we show that}} reduced DIO ARC leptin signaling develops by postnatal day 7 (P 7) and is reduced within POMC but not NPY/AgRP neurons. Since amylin increases leptin signaling in adult rats, we treated DIO neonates with amylin during postnatal hypothalamic development and assessed leptin signaling, leptin-dependent ARC-PVN pathway development, and metabolic changes. DIO neonates treated with amylin from P 0 - 6 and from P 0 - 16 increased ARC leptin signaling and both AgRP and α-MSH ARC-PVN pathway development, but increased only POMC neuron number. Despite ARC-PVN pathway correction, P 0 - 16 amylin-induced reductions in body weight did not persist beyond treatment cessation. Since amylin enhances adult DIO ARC signaling via an IL- 6 -dependent mechanism, we assessed ARC-PVN pathway competency in IL- 6 knockout mice {{and found that the}} AgRP, but not the α-MSH, ARC-PVN pathway was reduced. These results suggest that both leptin and amylin are important neurotrophic factors for the postnatal development of the ARC-PVN pathway. Amylin might act as a direct neurotrophic factor in DIO rats to enhance both the number of POMC neurons and their α-MSH ARC-PVN pathway development. This suggests important and selective roles for amylin during ARC hypothalamic development...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{selectively}} bred {{to develop}} diet-induced obesity (DIO) have an early onset {{reduction in the}} sensitivity of their ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) neurons to leptin as compared to diet-resistant (DR) rats. This reduced sensitivity includes decreased leptin receptor (Lepr-b) mRNA expression, leptin receptor binding, leptin-induced phosphorylation of STAT 3 (pSTAT 3) and impaired leptin excitation (LepE) of VMN neurons. When administered exogenously, the pancreatic peptide, amylin, acts synergistically to reduce food intake and body weight in obese, <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> DIO rats by increasing VMN leptin signaling, likely by stimulation of microglia IL- 6 which acts on its receptor to increase leptin-induced pSTAT 3. Here we demonstrate that incubation of cultured VMN neurons of outbred rats with IL- 6 increases their leptin sensitivity. Control, dissociated DIO VMN neurons express 66 % less Lepr-b and 75 % less Bardet Biedl Syndrome- 6 (BBS 6) mRNA and have reduced leptin-induced activation of LepE neurons compared to DR neurons. Incubation for 4 d with IL- 6 increased DIO neuron Lepr-b expression by 77 % and BBS 6 by 290 % and corrected their defective leptin activation of LepE neurons to DR levels. Since BBS 6 enhances trafficking of Lepr-b to the cell membrane, the increases in Lepr-b and BBS 6 expression appear to account for correction of the reduced leptin excitation of DIO LepE neurons to that of control DR rats. These data support prior findings suggesting that IL- 6 mediates the leptin sensitizing effects of amylin on VMN neurons and that the inherent leptin resistance of DIO rats can be effectively reversed at a cellular level by IL- 6...|$|E

Mice {{adapted to}} a high-fat diet are {{reported}} to be <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> but we previously reported that mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet and housed at 23 o C remained sensitive to peripheral leptin and specifically lost body fat. This study tested whether leptin action was impaired {{by a combination of}} elevated environmental temperature combined and a HF diet. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were adapted to low-fat (LF) or HF diet from 10 days of age and were housed at 27 o C from 28 days of age. From 35 days of age baseline food intake and body weight were recorded for one week and then mice on each diet were infused with 10 ug leptin/day or PBS from an intraperitoneal miniosmotic pump for 13 days. HF-fed mice had a higher energy intake than LF-fed mice and were heavier, but not fatter. Serum leptin was lower in PBS-infused HF- than LF-fed mice. Leptin significantly inhibited energy intake of both LF-fed and HF-fed mice and this was associated with a significant increase in hypothalamic long-form leptin receptors with no change in short-form leptin receptor or brown fat uncoupling protein- 1 mRNA expression. Leptin significantly inhibited weight gain in both LF- and HF-fed mice but reduced the percent body fat mass only in LF-fed mice. Percent lean and fat tissue in HF-fed mice did not change, implying that overall growth had been inhibited. These results suggest that dietary fat modifies the mechanisms responsible for leptin-induced changes in body fat content and that those in HF-fed mice are sensitive to environmental temperature.

40|$|In rats {{selectively}} bred {{to develop}} diet-induced obesity (DIO) 3 wk of postweaning exercise reduces weight and adipose regain for 10 wk after exercise cessation, despite intake of 31 % fat high-energy (HE) diet. To test {{the hypothesis that}} this effect is due to increased central leptin sensitivity, 4 -wk-old DIO rats were fed the HE diet and left sedentary (Sed), exercised for 3 wk, and then remained sedentary for 10 additional weeks (Ex/Sed) or continued exercise for a full 13 wk (Ex). After 3 wk, leptin (5 mg/kg ip) induced a 36 % decrease in 24 -h food intake in Ex rats, while Sed rats had no change in 24 -h intake. Ex rats also had 23 % more leptin-induced phospho-STAT 3 (pSTAT 3) -expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and 95 % and 68 % higher 125 I-labeled leptin receptor binding in the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei than did Sed rats, respectively. At 7 wk after onset, leptin decreased 24 -h intake by 20 % in Ex and 24 % in Ex/Sed rats without altering Sed intake. After a total of 13 wk, compared with Sed rats, Ex and Ex/Sed rats had 58 % and 38 % less fat, respectively, but leptin failed to decrease food intake in any group. Nevertheless, Ex, but not Ex/Sed rats, still had 32 % more ARC leptin-induced pSTAT 3 -expressing neurons than Sed rats. These data suggest that brief postweaning exercise in DIO rats that are inherently <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> causes a sustained resistance to obesity on HE diet, which is, in part, due to increased central leptin sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) {{plays an}} important role in regulating meal size and duration by activating CCK 1 receptors on vagal afferent neurons (VAN). Leptin enhances CCK signaling in VAN via an early growth response 1 (EGR 1) dependent pathway thereby increasing their sensitivity to CCK. In response to a chronic ingestion of a high fat diet, VAN develop leptin resistance and the satiating effects of CCK are reduced. We tested the hypothesis that leptin resistance in VAN is responsible for reducing CCK signaling and satiation. Lean Zucker rats sensitive to leptin signaling, significantly reduced their food intake following administration of CCK 8 S (0. 22 nmol/kg, i. p.), while obese Zucker rats, insensitive to leptin, did not. CCK signaling in VAN of obese Zucker rats was reduced, preventing CCK-induced up-regulation of Y 2 receptor and down-regulation of melanin concentrating hormone 1 receptor (MCH 1 R) and cannabinoid receptor (CB 1). In VAN from diet-induced obese (DIO) Sprague Dawley rats, previously shown to become <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant,</b> we demonstrated that the reduction in EGR 1 expression resulted in decreased sensitivity of VAN to CCK and reduced CCK-induced inhibition of food intake. The lowered sensitivity of VAN to CCK in DIO rats resulted in a decrease in Y 2 expression and increased CB 1 and MCH 1 R expression. These effects coincided with the onset of hyperphagia in DIO rats. Leptin signaling in VAN is required for appropriate CCK signaling and satiation. In response to high fat feeding, the onset of leptin resistance reduces the sensitivity of VAN to CCK thus reducing the satiating effects of CCK...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Loss of {{function}} FTO mutations significantly impact body composition in humans and mice, with Fto-deficient mice reported {{to resist the}} development of obesity {{in response to a}} high-fat diet (HFD). We aimed to further explore the interactions between FTO and HFD and determine if FTO can influence the adverse metabolic consequence of HFD. Methods: We studied mice deficient in FTO in two well validated models of leptin resistance (HFD feeding and central palmitate injection) to determine how Fto genotype may influence the action of leptin. Using transcriptomic analysis of hypothalamic tissue to identify relevant pathways affected by the loss of Fto, we combined data from co-immunoprecipitation, yeast 2 -hybrid and luciferase reporter assays to identify mechanisms through which FTO can influence the development of <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> states. Results: Mice deficient in Fto significantly increased their fat mass in response to HFD. Fto+/− and Fto−/− mice remained sensitive to the anorexigenic effects of leptin, both after exposure to a HFD or after acute central application of palmitate. Genes encoding components of the NFкB signalling pathway were down-regulated in the hypothalami of Fto-deficient mice following a HFD. When this pathway was reactivated in Fto-deficient mice with a single low central dose of TNFα, the mice became less sensitive to the effect of leptin. We identified a transcriptional coactivator of NFкB, TRIP 4, as a binding partner of FTO and a molecule that is required for TRIP 4 dependent transactivation of NFкB. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that, independent of body weight, Fto influences the metabolic outcomes of a HFD through alteration of hypothalamic NFкB signalling. This supports the notion that pharmacological modulation of FTO activity might have the potential for therapeutic benefit in improving leptin sensitivity, {{in a manner that is}} influenced by the nutritional environment...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of protein {{restriction}} in growing rats. Methods: Rats (approximate weight, 100 g) were maintained with low-protein (LP; 6 %) or normo-proteic (control; 17 %) diets, and at the end of the 15 th day, hormonal and biochemistry parameters and energetic balance were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Student`s t test (with statistical significance set at P <=. 05). Results: LP animals were hyperphagic and showed increased energetic gain (24 %) and energy expenditure (EE) compared with controls. The increase in EE was followed by increased sympathetic activity in brown adipose tissue, evidenced by increased norepinephrine turnover, suggesting increased thermogenesis. In spite of hyperphagia, protein ingestion in LP animals was lower than that of controls (P < 0. 01). The LP diet impaired body growth and caused deep alterations in body chemical composition, with an increase in carcass lipid content (64 %) and reductions of protein and water. In LP animals, postprandial glycemia was unchanged, and insulinemia was lower than in controls (P <=. 01). Reduction in fasting glycemia without changes in insulinemia also was detected (P <. 01), suggesting increased insulin sensitivity. The LP diet caused a 100 % increase in serum leptin (P <. 01). Conclusions: Protein restriction led to an increase in EE, with probable activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, evidenced by an increase in catecholamines levels. Despite the higher EE, energetic gain and lipids increased. The high level of leptin associated with hyperphagia led to the supposition that these animals are <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant,</b> and the increase in insulin sensitivity, suggested by the relation between insulin and glycemia in fasting and fed animals, might contribute to lipid accumulation.

40|$|Obese {{humans are}} often insulin- and <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant.</b> Since leptin can affect glucose metabolism, it is {{conceivable}} that a lack of leptin signal transduction contributes to insulin resistance. It remains unclear whether leptin affects glucose metabolism via peripheral and/or central mechanistic routes. In the present study, we aimed: (i) to determine the relative contributions of lack of leptin signal transduction and adiposity to insulin resistance and (ii) to establish the impact of central leptin action on glucose metabolism. To address the first point, ob/ob mice were subjected to severe calorie restriction, so that their body weight became similar to that of wild-type mice. Insulin sensitivity was measured in obese ob/ob, lean (food restricted) ob/ob and lean, weight-matched wild-type mice. To address the second point, leptin (or vehicle) was i. c. v. infused to the lateral cerebral ventricle of ob/ob mice and insulin sensitivity was determined. Hyperinsulinaemic euglyceamic clamps were used to quantify insulin sensitivity. Food restriction barely affected body composition, although it profoundly curtailed body weight. Insulin suppressed hepatic glucose production (HGP) to a greater extent in lean ob/ob than in obese ob/ob mice, but its impact remained considerably less than in wild-type mice (% suppression: 11. 8 +/- 8. 9 versus 1. 3 +/- 1. 1 versus 56. 6 +/- 13. 0 %/nmol, for lean, obese ob/ob and wild-type mice, respectively; P < 0. 05). The insulin-mediated glucose disposal (GD) of lean ob/ob mice was also in between that of obese ob/ob and wild-type mice (37. 5 +/- 21. 4 versus 25. 1 +/- 14. 6 versus 59. 6 +/- 17. 3 mumol/min/kg/nmol of insulin, respectively; P < 0. 05 wild-type versus obese ob/ob mice). Leptin infusion acutely enhanced both hepatic insulin sensitivity (insulin-induced inhibition of HGP) and insulin-mediated GD (9. 1 +/- 2. 4 versus 5. 0 +/- 2. 7 %/nmol of insulin, and 25. 6 +/- 5. 6 versus 13. 6 +/- 4. 8 mumol/min/kg/nmol of insulin, respectively; P < 0. 05 for both comparisons) in ob/ob mice. Both a lack of leptin signals and adiposity may contribute to insulin resistance in obese individuals. Diminution of central leptin signalling can critically affect glucose metabolism in these individual...|$|E
40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea (OS A) is {{strongly}} associated with obesity and is characterized by endocrine and metabolic changes. The aim {{of the present study}} is to clarify whether there is interrelationship between body fat, serum leptin, glucose-insulin metabolism and OSA. Subjects and measurements: we studied 23 obese subjects with OSA (13 males,& 10 females; age mean 36 ± 4. 4 years; BMI: 31. 7 ± 3. 6 kg/m 2; WHR: 1. 2 ±. 25 in males and 0. 81 +. 5 in females;Apnoea Index "AI"(9. 2 ± 6. 1) event/hour of sleep by means of overnight polysomnography; fasting glucose(109. 8 ± 21. 4 mg/dL); fasting insulin(18. 6 ± 7. 1 uU/L); IR(6. 7 ± 2. 8); fasting leptin(577. 69 ± 201. 6 ng/ml). Results were compared with those of 10 healthy normal weight subjects(6 males, 4 females;age mean 36. 8 ± 4. 4 years; BMI: 25 ± 0. 24 kg/m 2; WHR: 0. 86 ± 0. 01; AI: 2. 1 ± 1. 1 event/hour; fasting glucose(71. 7 ± 2. 8 mg /dL); fasting insulin(15. 3 ±. 48 uU/L); IR(4. 6 ±. 17); fasting leptin (42. 4 ± 11. 5 ng/ml). Results: Anthropometric measurements of OSA subjects were highly significantly greater than controls; body weight (P< 0. 003); BMI (P< 0. 00); waist (P< 0. 000); and WHR (P< 0. 000). Fasting glucose levels; fasting plasma insulin; IR and leptin levels were significantly higher in OSA subjects than controls (P< 0. 000, 0. 03, 0. 002; & 0. 000) respectively. Overnight polysomnography revealed significant difference between OSA subjects and controls as regards AI (P< 0. 001). The major dependent outcome variable was the apnoea index (AI), "the average number of apnoeas per hour of sleep determined by overnight polysomnography". OSA was defined as AI 5. Highly significant correlation between AI and WHR (P< 0. 00); Fasting insulin (P< 0. 04); IR (P< 001) and Leptin (P< 0. 000) were detected. Also leptin concentrations correlated with fasting insulin (P< 0. 02); IR (P< 0. 00) and WHR (P< 0. 000) besides the AI. IN CONCLUSION: There is strong bidirectional, feed-forward pernicious correlation detected between OSA in one side and each of visceral obesity, leptin, and IR; also between leptin, obesity, and IR. This association may contribute to the pathological manifestations and somatic sequale of this condition. Leptin could have major role linking OSA with various metabolic abnormalities detected in obese subjects. High circulating leptin found in this study, suggests that both obesity and OSA may be caused by a <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> state. Among obese subjects, it is visceral fat (WHR), rather than generalized obesity (BMI) that predisposes to OSA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Patients {{with chronic}} renal {{insufficiency}} (CRI), also at its early stages, have an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many well-established risk factors of CVD co-occur in CRI, e. g. dyslipidemia and hypertension. The present studies investigated the association between renal function and selected CVD risk factors. The fractional catabolic rate of low-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B (LDL FCR) has previously {{been found to be}} reduced in patients with severe CRI or on dialysis. This study investigated the LDL FCR in 57 patients with moderate to severe CRI and not on dialysis. Although the mean LDL FCR was comparable between the CRI patients and healthy controls, among the renal patients the LDL FCR was correlated with renal function, whereas it was significantly reduced only in patients with advanced CRI (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2). Leptin is a protein regulating food intake and energy expenditure and it is also involved in lipid metabolism. Hyperleptinaemia is a known feature of CRI patients; they are thought to be <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant.</b> The association between leptin and the lipoprotein profile was studied in 73 CRI patients with moderate to severe CRI and not on dialysis. Leptin was associated with lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in the renal patients, as in the control subjects, pointing towards a poorer lipoprotein profile with higher leptin levels. Hypertensive subjects in whom nocturnal blood pressure (BP) declines by less than 10 % (non-dippers) show more organ damage than those in whom it falls by more than 10 % (dippers). Here, non-dipping was found in 19 % of middle-aged subjects (226 males, 234 females) evaluated with ambulatory BP monitoring. The non-dippers had significantly lower renal function as compared with the dippers, and dipping status {{was a significant predictor of}} the variation in eGFR. Furthermore, an increased risk of non-dipping was observed among subjects with only minor decreases in renal function. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) can be used as a surrogate marker of early atherosclerosis. The present study investigated the association between renal function and cIMT in middle-aged subjects (247 males, 258 females). Renal function was independently associated with cIMT among males and also among postmenopausal women. The increased cIMT was seen in conjunction with mild renal impairment. In conclusion, the catabolism of LDL correlated with the renal function among CRI patients, but it was significantly reduced only in patients with advanced CRI. Leptin concentrations correlated with the lipoprotein profile in CRI patients. Among general middle-aged subjects, even a mild decrease in renal function was associated with derangements in BP regulation and with increased carotid atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of glucose intolerance in pregnancy is increasing worldwide. Both pre-existing Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes have known health implications for offspring yet {{few studies have}} assessed offspring renal development and function. In rodents, offspring exposed to persistent hyperglycaemia have a nephron deficit. However, this model {{does not reflect the}} typical clinical condition and is associated with fetal growth restriction that may confound the effect on nephron endowment. In humans, estimation of total nephron number is only feasible in autopsy tissue. Studies assessing fetal kidney volume, as a proxy of renal sufficiency, in women with glucose intolerance in pregnancy are sparse and report equivocal findings. The studies presented in this thesis investigated offspring kidney development in mouse models of both pre-gestational Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. It was hypothesised that offspring of pregnancies complicated by glucose intolerance would be macrosomic, yet exhibit deficits in nephron endowment. It was further hypothesised that offspring would be overweight and glucose intolerant in adulthood with perturbed renal function and morphology. Additionally, this thesis aimed to further our understanding of how gestational diabetes affects human fetal kidney size. It was hypothesised that fetuses of women with gestational diabetes would have smaller kidney volumes. Three major studies were undertaken. In the first experimental study, C 57 BL 6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD, 21 % fat) prior to and throughout pregnancy to model obesity-associated pre-gestational Type 2 diabetes. Compared with mice fed a normal fat diet (NFD, 6 % fat), mice fed a HFD were overweight and glucose intolerant prior to pregnancy, but unfortunately not in late gestation. Offspring of HFD dams were macrosomic at embryonic day (E) 18. 5 and had a tendency to be heavier at postnatal day (PN) 21. Using unbiased stereology, the kidneys of HFD offspring were found to contain 20 - 25 % more nephrons than kidneys of NFD offspring. Nephron number was increased in HFD offspring regardless of maternal weight and glucose profiles prior to pregnancy. Offspring of HFD dams displayed mild fasting hyperglycaemia at 9 months of age, but surprisingly had normal body weight, glucose tolerance and body composition. Renal function and morphology, measured by transcutaneous clearance of FITC-sinistrin and stereology respectively, were also normal at 9 months of age. In the second experimental study, C 57 BLKS/J leptin receptor deficient mice (Leprdb/+) were characterised to assess their suitability as a model of gestational diabetes. Leptin is a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes that acts on receptors in the hypothalamus to regulate energy balance by decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. Compared with wildtype (+/+) mice, <b>leptin</b> <b>resistant</b> Leprdb/+ mice were overweight and glucose intolerant prior to pregnancy, with glucose profiles exacerbated in late gestation. Leprdb/+ mice were therefore a model of pre-gestational Type 2 diabetes rather than gestational diabetes as anticipated. Offspring of Leprdb/+ dams were of normal body weight at E 18. 5 and PN 21 and exhibited a 15 % nephron deficit which was evident before birth. The opposing effects on nephron endowment in offspring of HFD and Leprdb/+ dams are likely reflective of differences in maternal phenotypes during the period of kidney development. The increased nephron endowment in HFD offspring was not attributable to maternal obesity or glucose intolerance and is possibly be due to constituents of the HFD promoting nephrogenesis. Conversely, the deficit in nephron endowment in Leprdb/+ offspring was best predicted by maternal glucose intolerance in late gestation. Additional studies are required to identify the molecular mechanisms that lead to increased and decreased nephron endowment in these two models. The third study compared fetal biometry and fetal kidney size in a prospective cohort study of women with and without gestational diabetes. Fetal biometry and kidney volume (calculated using the approximation of a prolate ellipsoid) were measured by obstetric ultrasound at 32 - 34 weeks gestation in women identified with (n= 36) and without (n= 42) gestational diabetes by routine testing at 24 - 28 weeks. In this preliminary study, estimated fetal weight and birth weight were lower in women with gestational diabetes. Amniotic fluid index and fetal cerebral vascular resistance were also lower, although values were within the normal clinical range. Despite these outcomes, fetal kidney volume in offspring of women with gestational diabetes was similar to those of normal control pregnancies. As maternal diabetes is typically associated with neonatal macrosomia, it is unclear why lower fetal weight was observed in the human gestational diabetic cohort. However, a possible explanation is low-level placental dysfunction. The preliminary findings from the prospective cohort study suggest that hyperglycaemia does not affect fetal kidney volume. Analysis of fetal kidney volume in a larger population incorporating maternal ethnicity and degree of glucose intolerance, as well as in women with longer periods of hyperglycaemia (such as in women with early gestational diabetes and undiagnosed pre-gestational Type 2 diabetes) is required...|$|E
