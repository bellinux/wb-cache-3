40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} {{represents a}} global health burden. The disease can seriously affect {{quality of life}} and is associated with multiple co-morbidities. Histamine and leukotrienes are important pro-inflammatory mediators in nasal allergic inflammation. Their actions on target cells are mediated through specific receptors and, consequently, molecules that block the binding of histamine and leukotrienes to their receptors have been important areas of pharmacological research. The published literature of the pathophysiology of histamine and leukotrienes, and the effects of histamine H(1) receptor antagonists (H- 1 antihistamines) and <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonists</b> in monotherapy or in combination therapy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis was reviewed. The presented results are based on the best available evidence. The efficacy of H- 1 antihistamines and <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonists</b> (montelukast in particular) in allergic rhinitis has been established in numerous randomised placebo-controlled trials. Results from meta-analyses indicate that H- 1 antihistamines and <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonists</b> are equally effective in improving symptoms of allergic rhinitis and quality of life, but that both drugs are less effective than intranasal corticosteroids. Data on the combination of H- 1 antihistamines and <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonists</b> in allergic rhinitis are limited.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Asthma {{treatment}} {{guidelines were}} introduced in Japan in the 1990 s, insisting as elsewhere, {{on the importance of}} anti-inflammatory therapy. The present study assessed whether use of anti-inflammatory medications was associated with a decrease in asthma mortality in Japan, the first country to use <b>leukotriene</b> receptor <b>antagonists.</b> A population-based ecological study was conducted, spanning the period 1987 – 1999, among people aged 5 – 34 yrs in Japan. The association between the yearly rate of asthma death and sales of inhaled corticosteroids and <b>leukotriene</b> receptor <b>antagonists</b> was estimated using Poisson regression. The yearly asthma death rate was stable at 6 – 7 deaths per million before the introduction of <b>leukotriene</b> receptor <b>antagonists</b> in 1995 and decreased by 23 % thereafter, reaching 3. 5 per million in 1999. The rate of asthma death was found to decrease with increasing use of both <b>leukotriene</b> receptor <b>antagonists</b> and inhaled corticosteroids. The rate ratio of asthma death was 0. 96 per 1 million 25 -day treatment courses of inhaled corticosteroids and 0. 80 for every 1 million 25 -day treatment courses of <b>leukotriene</b> receptor <b>antagonists,</b> consumed per year in Japan.

40|$|Clinical {{studies have}} shown that the {{combination}} of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) for patients with asthma is more effective than the use of ICS alone in equivalent or higher doses, as well as the use of other combinations. However, the relatively higher acquisition costs for the combination therapy require assessment of the value of the incremental costs, especially from a societal perspective. This review provides an overall assessment of the cost effectiveness of ICS plus LABA combination therapy for asthma. A systematic literature research was conducted in MEDLINE to identify studies published between January 1994 and September 2005. Cost-effectiveness studies derived from 11 clinical studies were identified. The ICS plus LABA combination was compared with ICS alone in eight studies, ICS plus a <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> in two studies, and a <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> alone in one study. All studies focused on measuring direct medical costs in a total of six different healthcare systems, and three studies conducted sensitivity analyses, including productivity costs. Outcomes were measured in treatment success (changes in lung function), episode-free days, and symptom-free days by evaluating short-term follow-up. The combination of ICS and LABA was found to be more efficacious and cost effective compared with ICS alone or alternative combinations of controller medications. Further considerations for measuring long-term outcomes and dose-response relationships might be required to provide further evidence on the cost effectiveness of combination therapy with ICS plus LABA.

40|$|BackgroundCapsular {{contracture}} is {{the most}} troublesome complication in breast implant surgery. Although capsule formation {{can be seen as}} a normal reaction to a foreign body, it can induce pain, hardness, deformity, and other pathologic problems. Surgical intervention is required in severe cases, but even surgery cannot guarantee a successful outcome without recurrence. This experimental study confirms that single topical administration of <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> zafirlukast (Accolate, Astrazeneca) reduces peri-implant capsule formation and prevents capsular contracture. MethodsTwelve smooth-surfaced cohesive gel implants were implanted in New Zealand White rabbits. These miniature implants were designed to be identical to currently used products for breast augmentation. The rabbits were divided into 2 groups. In the experimental group (n= 6), the implant and normal saline with zafirlukast were inserted in the submuscular pocket. In the control group (n= 6), the implant and normal saline alone were used. Two months later, the implants with peri-implant capsule were excised. We evaluated capsule thickness and collagen pattern and performed immunohistochemical staining of myofibroblasts, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, 2. ResultsThe thickness of the capsules in the experimental group was reduced in both dorsal and ventral directions. The collagen pattern showed parallel alignment with low density, and the number of myofibroblasts as well as the amounts of TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 2 were reduced in the experimental group. ConclusionsWe suggest that single topical administration of <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> zafirlukast can be helpful in reducing capsule formation and preventing capsular contracture via myofibroblast suppression, modulation of fibroblastic cytokines, and anti-inflammatory effect...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the protective effects of the inhaled cysteinyl <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist,</b> L- 648, 051, on allergen-induced early asthmatic response (EAR) and late asthmatic response (LAR) and the subsequent changes in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine. Ten atopic men with asthma participated in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects had documented EAR and LAR to house dust-mite extract. Responsiveness to methacholine was measured {{the day before and}} the day after a standardized allergen-challenge test. L- 648, 051 was inhaled in two doses of 12 mg 20 minutes before and 3 hours after the allergen challenge. The response was obtained from FEV 1 and flows from maximal (V 40 m) and partial (V 40 p) expiratory flow-volume curves. All subjects had an EAR and LAR during placebo therapy, but only a minority demonstrated an increase in methacholine responsiveness of more than one doubling dose. The ratio of V 40 m to V 40 p during methacholine challenge was higher than during both EAR and LAR (p less than 0. 05). There was no difference between drug- and placebo-therapy periods in baseline function, EAR, LAR, ratio of V 40 m to V 40 p, and the allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness (p greater than 0. 1). These results indicate that an effective aerosolized <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> in man does not protect against allergen-induced airflow obstruction, despite the evidence of an inflammatory response to allergen challenge. This suggests that either the potency or duration of activity of L- 648, 051 is limited or that leukotrienes C 4 and D 4 do not play a causative role in human allergic asthm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Asthma {{management}} guidelines {{recommend a}} stepwise approach to instituting and adjusting anti-inflammatory controller therapy {{for children with}} asthma. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to describe prescribing patterns of asthma controller therapies for children in a primary care setting. Methods Data from the UK General Practice Research Database were examined for children with recorded asthma or recurrent wheezing who, from September 2006 through February 2007, were ≤ 14 {{years old at the}} time of a first asthma controller prescription after ≥ 6 months without a controller prescription. We evaluated demographic characteristics, asthma duration, comorbidities, asthma-related health care resource use, and prescribed daily dose of controller medication. In addition, physicians for 635 randomly selected patients completed a survey retrospectively classifying asthma severity at the prescription date and describing therapy and health care utilization for 6 prior months. Results We identified 10, 004 children, 5942 (59. 4 %) of them boys, of mean (SD) age of 8. 0 (3. 8) years. Asthma controller prescriptions were for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy for 9059 (90. 6 %) children; ICS plus long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) for 698 (7. 0 %); <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> monotherapy for 91 (0. 9 %); ICS plus <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> for 55 (0. 6 %); and other therapy for 101 (1. 0 %), including 45 (0. 45 %) children who were prescribed LABA as monotherapy. High doses of ICS (> 400 μg) were prescribed for 44 / 2140 (2. 1 %) children Conclusions Physician classifications of asthma severity did not always correspond to guideline recommendations, as leukotriene receptor antagonists were rarely used and high-dose ICS or add-on LABA was prescribed even in intermittent and mild disease.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of MS on the early inflammatory phase (histological) of nonsynovial tendon healing. Materials and Methods: Rats were divided randomly into two groups (n = 6 each). MS (Singulair) was administered to one group at 10 mg/kg/day [250 g/day intraperitoneally (i. p.) ]. The control group was administered 250 g/day of 0. 9 % saline i. p. This nonsynovial tendon was longitudinally divided at the midportion, cut transversely and then sutured. In both groups, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation 10 days later. Results: Decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and more properly oriented collagen fibres were observed in the MS group′s histopathological specimens as compared to the control group′s (P < 0. 05).

40|$|In anaesthetized, spontaneously {{breathing}} guinea-pigs, enhanced bronchoconstrictor responses (increases RL) to histamine {{were measured}} following intravenous injection of practolol, (+/-) -propranolol, (+) - and (-) -propranolol. Propranolol enhanced not only histamine- but 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) -induced bronchoconstrictions {{and its effects}} lasted up to 2 h. This increased airway sensitivity was not due to beta-adrenoceptor blockade because: (a) similar effects were produced by racemic propranolol and its two isomers (+) - and (-) -propranolol and (b) whilst equal doses of (+/-) - and (+) -propranolol produced the same potentiation of histamine bronchoconstriction, only (+/-) -propranolol also caused a measurable beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the airways. The enhanced histamine- and 5 -HT-induced bronchoconstrictions were antagonized by the <b>leukotriene</b> <b>antagonist</b> FPL 55712 and by the lipoxygenase/cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor BW 755 c. The results demonstrate that endogenously released leukotrienes can produce not only a direct bronchospasm but may enhance the effects of other bronchoconstrictor agents.

In the isolated perfused heart, dexamethasone (4 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the maximal decreases in coronary flow induced by angiotensin H and vasopressin (reference drug). In the heart, the nonselective lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, IM) markedly suppressed the angiotensin H-induced decreases in coronary flow. NDGA (10 M) inhibited both angiotensin H- and methoxamine-(reference drug) induced contractions in aortic rings with (in the presence of L-NAME) and without endotheHum.
