The stages of meiosis in which the co-localization of the Rad51 and Lim15 proteins occurs are the <b>leptotene</b> and zygotene stages of meiosis, suggesting that meiotic recombination begins at the <b>leptotene</b> stage with the cooperation of these proteins and continues into zygotene.

50|$|The DSB-independent pathway was {{proposed}} when people studied spo11 mutant cells in some species {{and found that}} these Spo11 cells could not process to metaphase I {{even in the absence}} of DSB. The direct purpose of these DSBs is to help with the condensation of chromosomes. Even though the initial homolog paring in early <b>leptotene</b> is just random interactions, the further progression into presynaptic alignment depends on the formation of double strand breaks and single strand transfer complexes. Therefore the unsynapsed chromosomes in Spo11 cells can be a target of checkpoint. An AAA-adenosine triphosphatase (AAA-ATPase) was found to be essential in this pathway. but the mechanism is not yet clear. Some other studies also drew sex body formation into attention, and the signaling could be either structure based or transcription regulation such as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Under this cascade, failure to synapse will maintain the gene expression from sex chromosomes and some products may inhibit cell cycle progression. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation only happens in male, which may partially be the reason why only Spo11 mutant spermatocytes but not oocytes fail to transition from prophase I to metaphase I. However the asynapsis does not happen only within sex chromosomes, and such transcription regulation was suspended until it was further expanded to all the chromosomes as meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin, but the effector gene is not found yet.|$|E

Sponsorship: Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grants 00 - 04 - 48522 / 99 - 04 - 48182) RAE 2008 The nuclear dispositions of subtelomeric and pericentromeric domains in pollen mother cells (PMCs) were tracked during meiosis in wildtype and two asynaptic mutants of rye (Secale cereale L.) {{by means}} of {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). Homozygotes for sy 1 and sy 9 non-allelic mutations form axial elements during <b>leptotene</b> of male meiosis, but fail to form synaptonemal complexes. Consequently, recombination is severely impaired, and high univalency is observed at metaphase I. Simultaneous FISH with pSc 200 subtelomeric tandem repeat and CCS 1 centromeric sequence revealed that at pre-meiotic interphase the two domains are in a bipolar Rabl orientation in both the PMCs and tapetal cells. At the onset of meiotic prophase, the subtelomeric regions in PMCs of wildtype and sy 9 cluster into a typical bouquet conformation. The timing of this event in rye is comparable with that in wheat, and is earlier than that observed in other organisms, such as maize, yeast and mammals. This arrangement is retained until later in <b>leptotene</b> and zygotene when the pericentromeric domains disperse and the subtelomeric clusters fragment. The mutant phenotype of sy 9 manifests itself during <b>leptotene</b> to zygotene, when the pericentromeric regions become distinctly more distended than in wildtype, and largely fail to pair during zygotene. This indicates that difference in the nature or timing of chromosome condensation in this region is the cause or consequence of asynapsis. By contrast, sy 1 fails to form comparable aggregates of subtelomeric regions at <b>leptotene</b> in only half of the nuclei studied. Instead, two to five aggregates are formed that fail to disperse at later stages of meiotic prophase. In addition, the pericentromeric regions disperse prematurely at <b>leptotene</b> and do not associate in pairs at any subsequent stage. It is supposed that the sy 1 mutation could disrupt the nuclear disposition of centromeres and telomeres at the end of pre-meiotic interphase, which could cause, or contribute to, its asynaptic phenotype.

Fixed meiotic cells of maize (Zea mays L.) were subjected to in situ hybridization under conditions that preserved chromosome structure, allowing identification of stage-dependent changes in telomere arrangements. We found that nuclei at the last somatic prophase before meiosis exhibit a nonrandom, polarized chromosome organization resulting in a loose grouping of telomeres. Quantitative measurements on the spatial arrangements of telomeres revealed that, as cells passed through premeiotic interphase and into <b>leptotene,</b> {{there was an increase}} in the frequency of large telomere-to-telomere distances and a decrease in the bias toward peripheral localization of telomeres. By <b>leptotene,</b> there was no obvious evidence of telomere grouping, and the large, singular nucleolus was internally located, nearly concentric with the nucleus. At the end of <b>leptotene,</b> telomeres clustered de novo at the nuclear periphery, coincident with a displacement of the nucleolus to one side. The telomere cluster persisted throughout zygotene and into early pachytene. The nucleolus was adjacent to the cluster at zygotene. At the pachytene stage, telomeres rearranged again by dispersing throughout the nuclear periphery. The stagedependent changes in telomere arrangements are suggestive of specific, active telomere-associated motility processes with meiotic functions. Thus, the formation of the cluster itself is an early event in the nuclear reorganizations associated with meiosis and may reflect a control point in the initiation of synapsis or crossing over...|$|E

Ovaries were maintained in vitro where the factors which might influence the onset of meiotic prophase could be studied in isolation. It was found that if ovaries were explanted prior to day 15 p. c. meiotic prophase began, but was subsequently blocked at the <b>leptotene</b> stage: the remaining oogonia and the oocytes at <b>leptotene</b> degenerated around day 5 p. p. By day 7 p. p. the few remaining oocytes were found at an abnormal stage which resembled <b>leptotene.</b> The addition of gonadotrophic hormones or maternal serum to the culture medium had no effect on the initiation of meiosis, neither had culture with the intact oviduct.

Culture of ovaries removed before day 15 p. c. resulted in abnormal development of the ovarian stroma: only when ovaries were explanted on day 15 or after was the development of 'nests' of oocytes normal.

Here we report that the mammal-specific gene Tex 19. 1 promotes Spo 11 -dependent recombination in mouse spermatocytes. We show that the chromosome asynapsis previously reported in Tex 19. 1 -/- spermatocytes is preceded by reduced numbers of recombination foci in <b>leptotene</b> and zygotene.

40|$|ABSTRACT The testes {{of fully}} mature bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, were studied by light microscope. The germ {{cells in the}} {{developing}} testis can be classified into 12 stages based on nuclear characteristics. Primary(type A) and secondary(type B) spermatogonia are the earliest germ cells, with the former showing large and completely euchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and the latter with small blocks of heterochromatin distributed along the nuclear envelope. Spermatocytes consist of five stages; namely, <b>leptotene,</b> zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis metaphase spermatocytes. Succeeding stages show increasing condensation of chromatin: from the coarse fibers, that are evenly distributed throughout the nucleus in <b>leptotene</b> stage to the highly condensed blocks of heterochromatin in pachytene and diplotene stages. Nucleoli are not detected in any stages. Secondary spermatocytes have blocks of completely condensed heterochromatin attaching to the nuclear envelopes. There are three stages of spermatids: the early stage shows coarse chromatin granules occurs evenly over the nucleus, the middle stage has increased chromatin condensation over the entire oval nucleus while the nuclear size decreases. The late stage exhibits completely condensed chromatin in an elongated nucleus, and its cytoplasm becomes highly vacuolized and starts to degenerate. In fully mature spermatozoa, the nucleus becomes highly elongated and chromatin completely condensed. During development of the testis, sex cords i...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We studied meiosis {{in three}} {{infertile}} patients presenting complete AZFc microdeletion and three controls. METHODS: Primary spermatocytes were immunolabeled with SCP 3, BRCA 1 and gH 2 AX. We quantified the <b>leptotene,</b> zygotene and pachytene stages, and pachytene abnormalities: asynapsis and fragmented and dotted synaptonemal complexes (SCs). RESULTS: SCP 3 level {{was significantly higher}} in <b>leptotene</b> and zygotene (bouquet) stages in patients, suggesting AZFc may have a direct effect on early prophase. SCs were abnormal in 77. 3 % of pachy-tene nuclei of patients versus 30. 8 % of controls. The two groups differed significantly (P < 0. 001) in asynapsed nuclei, fragmented SC and dotted SCs. In patients, asynapsis were short and limited to a few bivalents. Staging of pachytene nuclei based on the morphology of the XY pair with BRCA 1 revealed a prevalence of early pachytene substages (70. 7 %) in patients. H 2 AX was normally phosphorylated. CONCLUSIONS: In {{the absence of the}} AZFc region, the transient zygotene stage is extended, and chromosome condensation is reduced. The low level of limited asynapsis, the normal H 2 AX staining and the incomplete loss of germ cells at the pachytene checkpoint indicate that the AZFc region is not critical for meiotic recombination.

Three meiosis-specific cohesin subunits {{have been reported in}} mammals, REC 8, STAG 3 and SMC 1 beta; their expression in mouse spermatocytes has also been described. Here we studied the localization of different meiotic and mitotic cohesin components during prophase I in human and murine female germ cells. In normal and atretic human fetal oocytes, from <b>leptotene</b> to diplotene stages, REC 8 and STAG 3 colocalize in fibers. In murine oocytes, SMC 1 beta, SMC 3 and STAG 3 are localized along fibers that correspond first to the chromosome axis and then to the synaptonemal complex in pachytene. Mitotic cohesin subunit RAD 21 is also found in fibers that decorate the SC during prophase I in mouse oocytes, suggesting a role for this cohesin in mammalian sister chromatid cohesion in female meiosis. We observed that, unlike human oocytes, murine synaptonemal complex protein SYCP 3 localizes to nucleoli throughout prophase I stages, and centromeres cluster in discrete locations from <b>leptotene</b> to dictyate.

40|$|Variation in {{chromosome}} number due to polyploidy can seriously compromise meiotic stability. In autopolyploids, {{the presence of}} more than two homologous chromosomes may result in complex pairing patterns and subsequent anomalous chromosome segregation. In this context, chromocenter, centromeric, telomeric and ribosomal DNA locus topology and DNA methylation patterns were investigated in the natural autotetraploid, Arabidopsis arenosa. The data show that homologous chromosome recognition and association initiates at telomeric domains in premeiotic interphase, followed by quadrivalent pairing of ribosomal 45 S RNA gene loci (known as NORs) at <b>leptotene.</b> On the other hand, centromeric regions at early <b>leptotene</b> show pairwise associations rather than associations in fours.

In anthers, both cells at somatic interphase as well as at premeiotic interphase show 5 -methylcytosine (5 -mC) dispersed throughout the nucleus, contrasting with a preferential co-localization with chromocenters observed in vegetative nuclei. These results show for the first time that nuclear distribution patterns of 5 -mC are simultaneously reshuffled in meiocytes and anther somatic cells.

Os resultados sugerem que os meiócitos receberam o sinal para entrar em meiose, mas não receberam o sinal para prosseguir além do leptóteno. Apesar da ausência de processo meiótico completo, os meiócitos foram cobertos pela parede do grão de pólen. Estas anormalidades, combinadas com outras causadas pela poliploidia, resultaram em total esterilidade de pólen...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the yield of the {{proliferation}} of the differentiating spermatogonia into spermatocytes was determined in five Chinese hamsters. Large differences of up to a factor 2 {{were found between the}} numbers of A 1 spermatogonia in the various animals. However, the numbers of <b>leptotene</b> spermatocytes varied only by up to a factor 1. 2 between animals. It is concluded that more spermatogonial degeneration takes place in animals with a relatively large number of A 1 spermatogonia than in those with a small number of these cells. In such a way in all animals ultimately about the same number of spermatocytes is formed. An experiment was done in which the number of A 1 spermatogonia was lowered with the S-phase killer cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). It was found that this greatly increased the yield of the spermatogonial proliferation, showing a direct relationship between the number of A 1 spermatogonia in an animal and the extent of the spermatogonial degeneration. In addition to the variation in the number of A 1 spermatogonia found between various animals, an even larger variation of up to a factor 3. 7 was found between the numbers of A 1 spermatogonia in different areas of seminiferous tubules within each animal. Nevertheless the variation in the number of <b>leptotene</b> spermatocytes in different areas within each animal was not larger than a factor 1. 3. It is concluded that in the normal animal the phenomenon of spermatogonial degeneration depends on the local density of these spermatogonia. Apparently, when too many spermatogonia are present the surplus of cells degenerate...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{electron}} microscope studies of nuclei and chromosomes {{have shown that}} a microfibril from 100 to 200 A thick is the basic morphological unit of chromosomes. Chromosome fibrils of this dimension {{have been reported in}} the salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila ~irilis (20, 21), in salivary chromosomes of D. melanogaster (9), in <b>leptotene,</b> pachytene, and metaphase chromosomes of Lilium (13 - 16), in carp erythrocyte nuclei (22), in the somatic interphase nuclei of Lilium, A 1 lium, and Tradescantia, in the nuclei of liver, pancreas, and testis tissues of the rat and in plasma cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes of mice (4), and in the staminal hairs of Tradescantia (12). We know that in somatic nuclei the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} {{has been}} performed in sections through ovaries of Acipenser ruthenus and Acipenser güldenstädti {{in order to}} detect the rDNA sequences. Hybridization resulted in specific labelling of the "caps" of extrachromosomal DNA present in pachytene oocyte nuclei and of the chromatin granules distributed beneath the nuclear envelope in early diplotene nuclei. In the same sections, the nuclei of all ovarian cells in both species (oogonia, <b>leptotene,</b> and zygotene stage oocytes, follicular cells, connective tissue cells) showed a very low, but similar labelling. Amplification of genes for rRNA thus occurs at the pachytene stage in early oogenesis of Acipenseridae. No rDNA amplification could be detected in the previous stages. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Transforming growth factor-βs (TGF-βs) {{are known}} to {{regulate}} multiple physiological functions in the testis, which include spermatogenesis, Leydig cell steroidogenesis, extracellular matrix synthesis and testis development. More {{recent studies have shown}} that TGF-β 3 also regulates Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ) dynamics in vitro via the p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, suggesting that this cytokine plays a crucial role in regulating the opening and closing of the blood-testis barrier (BTB). This in turn regulates the passage of pre-leptotene and <b>leptotene</b> spermatocytes across the BTB at stages VIII-XI of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. This review summarizes recent advances of studies on TGF-βs in the testis, highlighting their regulatory role in TJ dynamics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
