Today, U. S. Soil Taxonomy is {{the most widely used}} system of soil classification worldwide (Yaalon, 1995, 1996; Malcolm et al., 6226 families, and 13 129 series. The analysis of taxonomic structure 2000, p.

This uneven distribution becomes more pronounced in the <b>lower</b> <b>categories</b> of the hierarchy.

50|$|Some cyclists {{have managed}} to win both the general {{classification}} and the mountains classification in the same year.In {{the early years of}} the Tour, only the highest mountains gave points. Cyclists aiming for the Tour win generally did well on those mountains, so the riders high in the general classification were typically also high in the mountains classification, which made the double more likely. Later, the rules of the mountains classification changed, giving more points to mountains of <b>lower</b> <b>category.</b> The cyclists aiming to win the general classification did not spend energy on those <b>lower</b> <b>category</b> mountains, and thus other cyclists could aim for the mountains classification win. In 1969, Eddy Merckx won not only the general classification and the mountains classification, but also the points classification.|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveLittle {{is known}} about the impact of {{preoperative}} renal function stratified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on outcomes of total aortic arch replacement (TAR). The current study addressed this issue and identified a cutoff value of eGFR for the requirement of postoperative renal replacement therapy. MethodsFrom January 2000 to May 2011, 229 consecutive patients who did not require preoperative hemodialysis were retrospectively studied after elective TAR. Patients were grouped into the following categories: those with normal renal function (eGFR > 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; n =  11) and those with mild (eGFR, 60 - 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; n =  86), moderate (eGFR, 30 - 59 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; n =  111), or severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; n =  21) renal dysfunction. Linear trend tests demonstrated that the <b>lower</b> <b>categories</b> of eGFR were associated with a higher age, hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and a higher EuroSCORE II. ResultsThe overall hospital mortality was 2. 2 %. A <b>lower</b> <b>categories</b> of eGFR were an independent risk factor for hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0. 91; P = . 002) and postoperative renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 0. 94; P < . 002). A cutoff value for the requirement of postoperative renal replacement therapy was 26. 0 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Patients in the <b>lower</b> <b>categories</b> of eGFR had significantly higher hospital mortality (P = . 03) and more morbidities, such as renal replacement therapy (P < . 01), postoperative permanent neurologic deficits (P = . 013), and prolonged mechanical ventilatory support (P < . 01). Midterm survival and freedom from major adverse cerebrocardiovascular events were worse across the levels of the <b>lower</b> <b>categories</b> of eGFR. ConclusionsPreoperative eGFR is a strong predictor of short- and midterm outcomes in contemporary TAR...|$|R
