5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin. Joe {{performed}} his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed Sabin in his signature submission hold the Coquina Clutch. Instead of submitting, Sabin instead passed out in storyline, with the referee <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> raising his arm {{three times before}} giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> re-wrapping the Torah {{after it has}} been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began calling women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E
5|$|In poor {{condition}} {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century, the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans were made by William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of the nave, the <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a forward direction, <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of this design is that adjustment of <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> duration is continuous. However, in these systems, lift is proportional to duration, so <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> duration cannot be separately adjusted.|$|R

5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its breath {{for up to five}} minutes, its dives {{typically}} last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E
5|$|The next match {{involved}} four wrestlers {{from the}} Smackdown! brand in {{a match for}} the WWE United States Championship; Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The match began with Guerrero wrestling with Tajiri, while Benoit wrestled with Rhyno. During the encounter Guerrero applied a Lasso From El Passo on Tajiri, while Benoit employed a Crippler Crossface on Rhyno. Afterwards, Tajiri applied a Tarantula on Benoit. The hold distracted the referee, which allowed Guerrero to hit Rhyno with the United States Championship belt. Tajiri then attempted to hit Benoit with a Buzzsaw Kick, but Benoit countered the maneuver by <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> sitting Tajiri onto his shoulders. Tajiri, however, countered by tossing both himself and Benoit over the top rope onto the arena floor. Capitalizing on the situation, Guerrero then performed a Frog splash on Rhyno, after which he scored the pinfall, thus retaining the WWE United States Championship.|$|E
40|$|An {{effort is}} made to clarify the effect of leading-edge sweep on the vortex <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> leading-edge vortex {{strength}} of a slender wing; while it is often assumed that increasing sweep enhances vortex <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> strength, the opposite is the case. The suction analogy is used in association with numerical and experimental data to derive simple formulas yielding the actual relationship for delta wings. The difference between vortex <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> nonlinear <b>lift</b> is highlighted...|$|R
