500|$|Ogg felt Trevor's {{characterisation}} {{developed over}} time. He said, [...] "Nuances and character traits {{that began to}} appearhis walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game". Ogg cites Tom Hardy's portrayal of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic Bronson as a strong stylistic influence. He opined that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic Grand Theft Auto anti-hero archetype, he wanted to evoke player sympathy to Trevor's story. [...] "To elicit other emotions was tough, {{and it was the}} biggest challenge and it's something that meant a lot to me", Ogg explained. Fonteno felt that growing up in South Los Angeles and being exposed to drug trafficking and gang culture authenticated his portrayal of Franklin. [...] "I lived his life before...He's been surrounded by drugs, the crime, living with his auntI <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> grandmotherso {{there was a lot of}} familiarity", Fonteno said. Having not worked as an actor since portraying Face in the 2001 film The Wash, he sought counsel from Luke and Ogg to refine his acting skills.|$|E

Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: 'I had time with my mother but I really <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father.' He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome..." [...] In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was [...] "not a factor" [...] in fans' perception of him: [...] "For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That's how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am." ...|$|E

I have <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father since I came back from Europe, and I know what manner of a man he is.

I <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father for two or three years, and--well--it would be a severe lesson for any one. However, this doesn't matter. And I am not over-sensitive.

60|$|But {{they were}} far from being so. I <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> uncle, but I was not treated {{as one of the}} family.

60|$|During {{the winter}} in which I reached my twenty fifth year I <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mother's brother, Dr. Alfred Morris, in Warburton, a small country town, and I was there {{beginning}} the practice of medicine.

60|$|It wasn't so much {{thinking}} {{at the time}} as a sort of photographic thought that came and grew clear.

60|$|For {{some months}} now I have <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own youth and childhood, not always writing indeed but {{thinking}} of it almost every day, and I am sorrowful and disturbed.

60|$|Being thus able {{to carry}} out my ideas {{concerning}} the comfort and convenience of a bachelor, I had built a wing to my grandmother's house, which was occupied only by myself. It communicated by several doors with the main building, and these doors were nearly always open; but it was satisfactory to me to think that if I chose I might shut and lock them, and thus give my apartment the advantages of a separate house. The ground floor of my establishment consisted of a large and handsome library and study, with a good-sized anteroom opening from it, and above were my sleeping and dressing rooms.
