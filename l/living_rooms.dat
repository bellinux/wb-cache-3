Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E
5|$|Building {{structure}} of Lam Tin Estate's blocks is standardised by the government. As types 3, 4 and 6 buildings, the 23 towers of Lam Tin Estate were shaped as cuboids and resembled candy-boxes {{standing on a}} knoll. Most buildings were 16-storeys high and housed about 800 units. Each building had an estimated capacity of 3,000 residents and an approximate space allocation at 30ft² per person. Bathrooms and kitchens were combined into one compartment, as were <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and bedrooms. Lifts only reached some of the floors. To access the other floors, one needed to exit the lift at a level nearby and hike upstairs or downstairs. On the ground floor beneath the buildings were a variety of shops which served the residents. Although densely packed, the living environment of Lam Tin Estate fostered close relationships in the neighbourhood.|$|E

5|$|Pepsiman is {{an action}} game that {{consists}} of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, and each involving the superhero Pepsiman saving {{a person who is}} in need of a drink, such as a military man {{in the middle of a}} desert, by giving them a can of Pepsi. The stages are all based on real locations, such as San Francisco and New York City. The game is played from a third-person perspective, with Pepsiman automatically running forwards through the stage, sometimes running through people's <b>living</b> <b>rooms.</b> The player aims to dodge obstacles, such as cars, construction cranes, and people, as well as Pepsi-branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck. The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 83 - 86. The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} examining the activities that are performed in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and interior design of the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> In the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> both private and public activities can be performed. Living room serves as a stage where dwellers reflect their identity to the outside world. In this study, the factors that affect the use and interior design of the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> are defined. According to these factors, the group differences in the use and interior design of the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has been examined. A field survey was conducted in “Angora Evleri” which is an upper income suburb in Ankara. Results indicated that the existence of the family room affected the type, number and frequency of activities that were performed in the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> The existence of the family room also affected the intentions for the interior design and the selected interior design elements in the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Moreover, the selected interior design elements in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> varied according to different groups of users. The results of the study indicated that the interior design of the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was related to gender, occupational status and time spent in the house, whereas the use of the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> seemed independent of these factors.

500|$|The Ellwood House <b>living</b> <b>room</b> did {{not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The {{original}} <b>living</b> <b>room</b> space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In the <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and sunroom. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme. The large, Caen stone [...] fireplace was carved in Chicago in 1911. The sunroom was designed in the late 19th century and early 20th century Arts and Crafts style causing it to stand {{in stark contrast to}} the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> The room was originally furnished with Mission style furniture to complement the oak woodwork.|$|R
