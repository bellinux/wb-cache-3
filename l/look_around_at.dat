They <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the same time in which the observers initially appeared and seeing nothing, go back to playing with Etta.|$|E
60|$|Snap {{was within}} {{a hundred yards}} of {{the man with the}} sled when the latter chanced to <b>look</b> <b>around.</b> <b>At</b> once the youth yelled at him.|$|E
60|$|The old madness {{seized on}} him again. I {{made for the}} door, to secure my retreat in case of necessity--and then ventured to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Kim {{cleared his}} throat and <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the village greybeards.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Macallan <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> me quietly {{with her}} sardonic smile.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> her directly, for he {{knew where}} the {{grievance}} lay.|$|R
60|$|Master Plummer {{took the}} {{precaution}} {{to gather up}} such provisions as remained in the cupboard, and, after one long <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the home he might be leaving for ever, shook Joe gently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Up here," [...] he said, [...] "come the masters, {{and down}} there the servants. <b>Look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> these people, monsieur. Look around carefully. Tell me whether {{you do not}} see {{something}} different here from the other places." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is if so be we {{live long}} enough," [...] Silas suggested, {{and for the}} instant I fancied it {{possible}} to detect a tremor in his voice. [...] "Instead of watching yonder curious ones who can do nothing for nor against us, <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the king's ships, and see what a force General Gage has got behind him when he sends the lobster backs to shoot us down." ...|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, Crestwick <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> his {{companion}} {{as they went}} down the corridor.|$|R
60|$|They {{walked on}} {{in silence for}} a while; and then Bland <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked on}} {{a while in}} silence, and then with an effort <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|But he {{had little}} time to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the scene of action. There was a moment only in which to study the river to learn if the unfortunate raftsman's body had appeared. It {{was not to be}} seen. The river ran swiftly and hid all {{evidence}} of the tragedy under its smooth surface. When the brave who had gone back to the raft for the goods joined his companion the two hurried Joe up the bank after the others.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{they all}} rose and shook off the oppressive solemnity, {{and he had}} time to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> all the changes. At last he turned to Mattie and reached out his hand--he had the boldness of a man in the shadow of some mighty event which makes false modesty and {{conventions}} shadowy things of little importance. His sharpened interior sense read her clear soul, and he knew she was his, therefore he reached her his hand, and she came to him with a flush on her face, which died out as she stood proudly by his side, while he said: ...|$|E
60|$|We {{stood and}} laughed until our backs ached, but, as I {{happened}} to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the house, I saw the queen standing on her door-step looking mournfully at the fun. She was alone, for even her good neighbor had rushed {{out to see}} what she could pick up. I was glad to find that the new monarch, who still wore her crown,--which no one would have imagined to have ever been a saucepan,--had sense enough to keep out of such a scrimmage of the populace, and I went back and gave her a shilling. Her face shone, and I could see that she felt that she never could have grabbed that much.|$|E
60|$|I {{took hold}} of the boat, and pulled the bow up on the beach. Mr. Chipperton <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|When the {{stranger}} {{had finished the}} story of his adventures, he <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the attentive faces of the maidens.|$|R
60|$|Sigismund and {{the monk}} <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the vast piles of ragged naked rocks, and they smiled as their eyes met.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{staggered}} aft a pace or two, {{and sitting}} down breathless and dripping gazed about him. The boat looked {{a good deal}} bigger than she had appeared from the steamer, and, {{as a matter of}} fact, she was a half-decked sloop of about twenty-four feet in length. Just then she was slanted well down on one side, with the water foaming along her depressed deck and showers of spray beating into her over her weather bow, while the jib above her bowsprit every now and then plunged into the short, white-topped seas. There seemed to be some water inside her, for it washed up above the floorings at every heave. In a few moments Frank had recovered his breath sufficiently to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> his companions. One was a boy of about his own age who smiled at him. He had a bronzed skin and a kindly expression, and looked lean and wiry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I sat a-waitin' a long time, {{which gave}} me {{a good chance to}} <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> things. The room was real handsome, and I took a peep at the window fastenin's and the lay of the doors, thinkin' the {{knowledge}} might come in handy some time. Right in front of me on a table was a little yellow mouse, and it struck me as I looked at it that that must be gold. I listened if anybody was comin', and then I picked it up to see if it really was. I thought I heard the door-bell ring just then, and shut it up in my hand quick, but nobody went to the door; and then I looked at the little mouse, and if it wasn't pure gold it was the best imitation ever I see, so I slipped it quietly in my pocket to look at it ag'in when I had time.|$|E
6000|$|I {{must leave}} {{the reader to}} pursue this subject for himself; I have not space to suggest to him the tenth part of the {{advantages}} which would follow, both to the painter from such an understanding of his mission, and to the whole people, in {{the results of his}} labor. Consider how the man himself would be elevated: how content he would become, how earnest, how full of all accurate and noble knowledge, how free from envy--knowing creation to be infinite, feeling at once the value of what he did, and yet the nothingness. Consider the advantage to the people; the immeasurably larger interest given to art itself; the easy, pleasurable, and perfect knowledge conveyed by it, in every subject; the far greater number of men who might be healthily and profitably occupied with it as a means of livelihood; the useful direction of myriads of inferior talents, now left fading away in misery. Conceive all this, and then <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> our exhibitions, and behold the [...] "cattle pieces," [...] and [...] "sea pieces," [...] and [...] "fruit pieces," [...] and [...] "family pieces;" [...] the eternal brown cows in ditches, and white sails in squalls, and sliced lemons in saucers, and foolish faces in simpers;--and try to feel what we are, and what we might have been.|$|E

60|$|The Chinese {{ambassador}} <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} circle. His face was emotionless, yet {{he spoke with}} a haste which was unusual.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> his captors, {{pale and}} furious. They were strangers to him. As yet, {{he did not}} realize what had happened.|$|R
60|$|CULPEPPER, VA., Feb. '64.--Here I am FRONT {{pretty well}} {{down toward the}} extreme front. Three or four days ago General S., {{who is now in}} chief command, (I believe Meade is absent, sick,) moved a strong force southward from camp as if {{intending}} business. They went to the Rapidan; there has since been some manoeuvering and a little fighting, but nothing of consequence. The telegraphic accounts given Monday morning last, make entirely too much of it, I should say. What General S. intended we here know not, but we trust in that competent commander. We were somewhat excited, (but not so very much either,) on Sunday, during the day and night, as orders were sent out to pack up and harness, and be ready to evacuate, to fall back towards Washington. But I was very sleepy and went to bed. Some tremendous shouts arousing me during the night, I went forth and found it was from the men above mention'd, who were returning. I talk'd with some of the men; as usual I found them full of gayety, endurance, and many fine little outshows, the signs of the most excellent good manliness of the world. It was a curious sight to see those shadowy columns moving through the night. I stood unobserv'd in the darkness and watch'd them long. The mud was very deep. The men had their usual burdens, overcoats, knapsacks, guns and blankets. Along and along they filed by me, with often a laugh, a song, a cheerful word, but never once a murmur. It may have been odd, but I never before so realized the majesty and reality of the American people en masse. It fell upon me like a great awe. The strong ranks moved neither fast nor slow. They had march'd seven or eight miles already through the slipping unctuous mud. The brave First corps stopt here. The equally brave Third corps moved on to Brandy station. The famous Brooklyn 14th are here, guarding the town. You see their red legs actively moving everywhere. Then they have a theatre of their own here. They give musical performances, nearly everything done capitally. Of course the audience is a jam. It is good sport to attend one of these entertainments of the 14th. I like to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the soldiers, and the general collection in front of the curtain, more than the scene on the stage.|$|E
5000|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for Mr Wolf to be allowed to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the other players, before answering the question; especially if there is a rule involving penalties applied to Mr Wolf if a player reaches him before [...] "Dinner time" [...] is called.|$|E
50|$|A {{telepresence}} robot (also telerobotics) is a robotically {{controlled and}} motorized video conferencing display to help give {{a better sense}} of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in an office, home, school, etc. when one cannot be there in person. The robotic avatar device can move about and <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the command of the remote person it represents.|$|E
60|$|I stood <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> {{them for}} a while; I know that I {{must have been very}} pale, for Mr. McFarland sprang to his feet.|$|R

50|$|The Live Lounge Tour is a tour {{taken by}} BBC Radio 1 since 2006. This {{features}} Jo Wiley/Fearne Cotton {{going to the}} Live Lounge artists' house, houseboat, local pub, mum's house, etc. to have a <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> a place that means something to the artist. In 2010 the Live Lounge Tour was rebranded the 'Radio 1's Student Tour' with Fearne Cotton and Zane Lowe.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of high quality}} video conferencing using mobile devices, tablets and portable computers has enabled a drastic growth in telepresence robots to help give {{a better sense of}} remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in the office, home, school, etc. when one cannot be there in person. The robot avatar can move or <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> the command of the remote person.|$|E
5000|$|Explorers, dubbed [...] "Spades" [...] {{for their}} {{tendency}} to dig around, are players who prefer discovering areas, creating maps and learning about hidden places. They often feel restricted when a game expects them to move on within a certain time, as that does {{not allow them to}} <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> their own pace. They find great joy in discovering an unknown glitch or a hidden easter egg.|$|E
