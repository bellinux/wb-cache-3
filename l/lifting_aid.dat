An advantage {{of the use of}} assistance systems in the field of manual handling is to reduce the loads acting on the human body. At the same time, the working conditions of manual activities can be improved by such a system and the possibility guarantees injury-free work. Thus, older people can work longer in their profession. These advantages can be combined in an ergonomic body-worn <b>lifting</b> <b>aid</b> adapted to the individual anatomy of the human body.

40|$|Lifting {{patients}} is a demanding task for care providers. In addition, {{the number of}} {{patients is}} rising and the number of people with obesity is expanding. Current lifting aids are single purpose and time consuming to use. Exoskeletons can fulfill the demand for a versatile and easy to use <b>lifting</b> <b>aid.</b> A drawback of a typical exoskeleton is that in order to function correctly the axes need to be aligned to the human joints, which is time consuming. Furthermore, an exoskeleton for healthcare must reduce the reaction forces in the user while lifting. It is chosen to design an exoskeleton, which requires no adjustment and can cope with power enhancement. The goal {{of this paper is to}} design an exoskeleton that is fast, easy to use and reduces the reaction forces in the user. A design is proposed which easily fits different sized users. In addition the reaction forces in the human skeleton are eliminated. The model is tested by means of a demonstrator. Elastic tension elements are used as a gravity compensator. By reducing the potential energy fluctuation the required external input is reduced. Optimizing a number of design parameters leads to a calculated moment reduction of 98. 8 % and moment fluctuation reduction of 96. 8 %. This is the first exoskeleton to combine fast to use design with high-energy efficiency gravity compensation. BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The PLAD is an {{effective}} method of preventing muscular fatigue in women over a prolonged period of lifting Summary A personal lift assist device (PLAD) was designed with elastic elements acting in parallel to the lumbar extensor muscles to reduce the extension moment experienced during lifting activities. It {{was found to be}} a suitable on-body <b>lifting</b> <b>aid</b> for manual materials handling and was capable of reducing the L 5 /S 1 moment in addition to substantial decreases in EMG activity. This paper investigates the effect of using the PLAD during a repetitive lifting task of 45 minutes when women lifters were exerting at a rate of 12 lift/lower sequences per minute. Results revealed that RMS amplitude of the EMG signal in the No PLAD lifting trial increased (91 % for TES and 104 % for LES), while minimal increase was observed in the PLAD trial (3 % for TES and 16 % for LES). The MF decreased substantially in the No PLAD condition (22 % for TES and 32 % for LES) while much smaller drops occurred when wearing the PLAD (4 % for TES and 16 % for LES). The PLAD also prolonged the onset of fatigue in women by lowering heart rate and perceived exertion levels. The PLAD appears to be beneficial for women who perform repetitive manual materials handling tasks in industries as it delays the onset of fatigue...|$|E

This is achievable through amongst other methods, {{the analysis of}} operations to identify wasteful activities and eliminate them. Purpose: This paper, through a thorough description {{and understanding of the}} current outbound processes at Company N, seeks to identify any wasteful activity and what might be causing such wastes. Furthermore the paper shall seek to make recommendations for reducing or eliminating wastes identified. Research Questions: What wastes can be identified in Company N’s outbound processes and why do they occur? What recommendations should be made for reducing wastes at Company N? Method: This research is qualitative in nature carried out using a deductive approach. Primary data was gathered mainly through observation and semi-structured and unstructured interviews with the goal of gaining as deep an understanding of the processes as possible. Secondary data was also gotten from multiple sources within the company. Contemporary tools and techniques like Value Stream Mapping and Gemba (observation at the place of work) were useful in identifying wastes; meanwhile the 5 Why’s questioning technique was used for finding the causes of wastes identified. Benchmarking was also used as a means of sourcing ideas and proven standards of performance. Conclusion: The research identified five main wastes including waiting, travelling, unnecessary motion, defects and processing. The main causes of the wastes include the use of manual verification during processes, limited use of batch picking, the absence of <b>lifting</b> <b>aid</b> and dissatisfaction amongst workers. The report makes recommendations including change of handling equipment and operating procedures to accommodate automatic verification of locations and items, as well as better usage of batch picking. It is also recommended to swap the location of certain articles and introduce marketing analysis to reduce travelling. Finally, recommendations are made for counteracting worker dissatisfaction such as a proposed improvement report, an appraisal system, more cross training and internal personnel development...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the independence in everyday life of the elderly population, we have developed a <b>lifting</b> <b>aid</b> for loading in the private car trunk. Independence from outside assistance affects self-esteem in a positive direction and can help increase {{the quality of life}} for a large group of individuals. As people age and experience changes in performance, it is important that aids and support is available, particularly to reduce the experience of aging and it’s increasing physical limitations. The aim was to develop a function prototype characterized by simplicity, which facilitates loading of the private car trunk. The project was conducted at the request of Autoadapt AB, which is one of the leading actors in car adaptations for individuals with disablilities. A function prototype of the product Easy Load has been produced through dynamic product development and its various tools. In an attempt to meet the requirements of simplicity and ease of use, concepts such as universal design and usability affected the project. In order to find a user need that could form the basis of the project, proceedings began with a pre-study that included observations and group interviews of members in a pensioner club in Halmstad. The Product development work continued with several brainstorming sessions with participants from a number of the university's engineering programs. Ideas from the sessions, together with the results from the benchmarking, formed the basis for final product design and function. A key requirement was that the product could be fitted in sedan car models with easy grips and without any permanent fixings. Construction of the prototype was made mostly in the University’s mechanical workshop, using both self-constructed and sourced components. Stress and installation testing and risk analysis pursuant to FMEA highlighted deficiencies that the project group sought to adjust. In cases where this did not happen, the project group made concrete improvement proposals to simplify further development. This project shows that lifting aids products without permanent fixings are possible to develop for use in sedan car models.

To enable the large fixed wing aircrafts {{to take off}} in a shorter distance, we designed a new high <b>lift</b> <b>aided</b> device. The design principle is different from conventional ones. According to formula of lift, lift is proportional to air density. Pressure wave high <b>lift</b> <b>aided</b> de-vice is the lift-promoting system functioning by using pressure wave to increase the air density around wings. This article shows the mechanic design and the lift-promoting efficiency calculation. The calculation {{is based on a}} simplified model of Boeing 747 - 400. Since the take-off process is a variable acceleration motion, it is difficult to confirm the distance an aircraft need to reach take-off speed. We turned to study the extra take-off weight at the original take-off speed. We found that with the help of this device, the maximum take-off weight has increased 2. 62 %. And the take-off weight increment is proportional to the amplitude and frequency of the device. The author's conclusion is that although the increase is not much, the benefit is obvious. It could be more efficient if the amplitude and frequency are enhanced...|$|R

40|$|Robotic <b>lifting</b> <b>aids</b> aim {{to reduce}} the forces on the operator, but may thereby also change the {{experienced}} dynamics of the lifted object. In the case of weight compensation, the experienced ratio between object's weight and inertia is altered, exposing the operator to dynamics different from those experienced in daily life. This may affect execution of fast goal-directed movements, especially during first exposure to the altered dynamics. We hypothesize that the inertia, used in the internal model in the open-loop phase of the movement, must be estimated before movement onset and can {{be based on the}} object's weight. In an experimental study, subjects (n= 18) performed fast vertical lifting movements of virtual objects of different inertia and weight in normal gravity (baseline experiment) and under weight compensation. In the catch trial experiment, the weight was kept constant and in catch trials weight compensation was applied, resulting in an unexpectedly increased inertia. We then fitted a simple open-loop model, based on minimum jerk trajectories, to best match the generated forces for the first $ 75 ms$ of each trial, by varying one parameter: the modelled inertia, i. e. the inertia estimated a priori by the subject. The trajectories in the baseline experiment are minimum jerk like and are independent of inertia, which can only be due to properly applied force profiles. The minimum jerk related force profiles increased with increasing inertia and contained a static force equal to weight. In the catch trial experiment, the force profiles for the weight compensation condition were similar to those in the normal gravity condition up to approximately 80 ms. After that, the force profiles of the catch trials deviated from the normal force profile and the movement in the catch trials was characterised by skewed velocity profiles and consistent overshoots. The Variance Accounted For, a measure for goodness of fit, for all conditions in both experiments were high (with the median around 95 %), implying the model fitting procedure captured the essential open-loop movement behaviour. Weight and modelled inertia were linearly related in the baseline experiment, as was hypothesized, yet a positive offset was found for small inertias. In the catch trials, the modelled inertias were higher than expected purely based on weight information, but remained closely related to inertia as in normal gravity. We conclude that a priori inertia estimation, used in the open-loop phase of fast lifting movements, strongly depends on weight information and the known weight/inertia ratio. This insight can help in designing the control for <b>lifting</b> <b>aids</b> to support the operator more naturally.

Unfortunately, mechanical <b>lifting</b> <b>aids</b> to reduce the physical workload are impractical for this task. Therefore, the effect of smaller plasterboards on productivity, work demands and workload was evaluated in an exploratory study among experienced construction workers (n= 4 - 8) at the worksite. The dimensions and weight of the conventional and smaller plasterboards (PB) were: PB 120 (2440 x 1200 x 15 mm; 33 kg) and PB 90 (2440 x 900 x 12. 5 mm; 20 kg), respectively. Productivity was defined as meters of plasterboard mounted. Work demands were assessed by means of real time observations of tasks and activities. Workload was determined using continuous heart rate monitoring and subjective judgments of perceived workload. Productivity and total work time per working day did not differ between PB 120 and PB 90. Duration of mounting (29 % increase) and anchoring (26 % increase) were longer for PB 90 than PB 120. Duration of lifting, carrying and turning over plasterboards, and percentage of heart rate reserve showed no difference between PB 120 and PB 90. A majority of the workers preferred PB 90.

40|$|Lifting {{restrictions}} postoperatively {{are quite}} common, but {{there appears to}} be little scientific basis for them. Lifting restrictions are inhibitory in terms of return to work and may be a factor in chronicity. The mean functional spinal motion unit stiffness changes with in vitro or computer-simulated discectomies, facetectomies and laminectomies were reviewed from the literature. We modified the NIOSH lifting equation to include another multiplier related to stiffness change post surgery. The new recommended lifts were computed for different lifting conditions seen in industry. The reduction of rotational stiffness ranged from 21 % to 41 % for a discectomy, 1 % to 59 % for a facetectomy and 4 % to 16 % for a partial laminectomy. The recommended lifts based on our modified equation were adjusted accordingly. There is no rational basis for current lifting restrictions. The risk to the spine is a function of many other variables as well as weight (i. e. distance of weight from body). The adjusted NIOSH guidelines provide a reasonable way to estimate weight restrictions and accommodations such as <b>lifting</b> <b>aids.</b> Such restrictions should be as liberal as possible so as to facilitate, not prevent, return to work.

Documented air launcher designs usually incorporate a <b>lift</b> <b>aided</b> trajectory. It is the authors’ intention to present a method for air launching of a low-cost tactical micro-satellite, on demand, for various missions, using a weight economical vehicle via a Gravity Turn Trajectory. The carrier aircraft will be an F- 15 fighter, and the launcher will be a 3 -stage vehicle, assembled from a ducted rocket (ramrocket) 1 st stage and two solid propellant rocket stages. The option of an air-breathing engine for the first stage results from the high initial speed (as high as Mach 1. 6) provided to the launcher by the carrier aircraft. An air-breathing engine provides much higher energetic performance compared to a standard solid rocket motor (higher Isp and lower mass).

Objectives: to investigate which—and to what extent—physical and psychosocial risk factors are associated with neck/back-pain-related disability in nursing, and to assess {{the role of the}} type of health care institution (hospitals, nursing homes and home care institutions) within different countries in this problem. Design: cross-sectional secondary analysis of multinational data of nurses and auxiliary staff in hospitals (n= 16, 770), nursing homes (n= 2140) and home care institutions (n= 2606) in seven countries from the European NEXT-Study. Methods: multinomial logistic regression analysis with raw models for each factor and mutually adjusted with all analysed variables. Results: analysis of the pooled data revealed effort-reward imbalance as the predominant risk factor for disability in all settings (odds ratios for high disability by effort-reward ratio: hospital 5. 05 [4. 30 – 5. 93]; nursing home 6. 52 [4. 04 – 10. 52] and home care 6. 4 [3. 83 – 10. 70] [after mutual adjustment of psychosocial and physical risk factors]). In contrast, physical exposure to lifting and bending showed only limited associations with odds ratios below 1. 6; the availability and use of <b>lifting</b> <b>aids</b> was—after mutual adjustment—not or only marginally associated with disability.

40|$|Studies {{show that}} nurses have high {{incidence}} of low back pain (LBP) due to the physical activities often required to manipulate patients and to the occurrence of sudden awkward lifts in cramped spaces, long hours at the computer terminal, or driving in ambulances. This may lead to lower productivity, high absenteeism and unsatisfactory patient care, and with cost of treating and caring for patients with LBP well over $ 100 billion annually in the USA alone, makes this a public health concern. Epidemiological studies identified numerous biomechanical factors that cause disc degeneration; exposure to vibrations, prolonged sitting and, especially, high compressive loadings that occur on the L 3 disc during lifting, sitting, flexion and hyperextension of the spinal column. This puts certain occupations, {{such as health care}} workers, in higher risk group for developing degenerative problems with intervertebral discs.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that paramedics are exposed to risks in the form of injuries to the musculoskeletal system. In addition, there are studies showing that they are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and psychiatric diseases, which can partly be explained by their constant exposure to stress. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether the use of shoulder straps decreases physical effort in the form of decreased heart rate and cortisol concentration. Methods: A stretcher with a dummy was carried by 20 participants for 400  m on two occasions, one with and one without the shoulder straps. Heart rate was monitored continuously and cortisol samples were taken at intervals of 0 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes. Each participant was her or his own control. Results: A significant decrease in heart rate and cortisol concentration was seen when shoulder straps were used. The median values for men (with shoulder straps) at 0 minutes was 78  bpm/ 21. 1  nmol/L (heart rate/cortisol concentration), at 15 minutes was 85  bpm/ 16. 9  nmol/L, and at 60 minutes was 76 bpm/ 15. 7  nmol/L; for men without shoulder straps, these values were 78 bpm/ 21. 9  nmol/L, 93 bpm/ 21. 9  nmol/L, and 73 bpm/ 20. 5  nmol/L. For women, the values were 85 bpm/ 23. 3  nmol/L, 92 bpm/ 20. 8  nmol/L, and 70 bpm/ 18. 4  nmol/L and 84 bpm/ 32. 4  nmol/L, 100 bpm/ 32. 5  nmol/L, and 75 bpm/ 25. 2  nmol/L, respectively.

Thus, the 12 -month prevalence of pain in the lumbar spine in nursing staff is as high as 76 %. Only a few representative studies have assessed the prevalence rates of back pain and its risk factors among nursing staff in nursing homes in comparison to staff in home-based care facilities. The present study accordingly investigates the prevalence in the lumbar and cervical spine and determines the physical workload to lifting and caring in geriatric care. Methods 1390 health care workers in nursing homes and home care participated in this cross sectional survey. The nursing staff members were examined by occupational physicians according to the principals of the multistep diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders. Occupational exposure to daily care activities with patient transfers was measured by a standardised questionnaire. The lumbar load was calculated with the Mainz-Dortmund dose model. Information on ergonomic conditions were recorded from the management of the nursing homes. Comparisons of all outcome variables were made between both care settings. Results Complete documentation, including the findings from the occupational physicians and the questionnaire, was available for 41 %. Staff in nursing homes had more often positive orthopaedic findings than staff in home care. At the same time the values calculated for lumbar load were found to be significant higher in staff in nursing homes than in home-based care: 45 % vs. 6 % were above the reference value. Nursing homes were well equipped with technical <b>lifting</b> <b>aids,</b> though their provision with assistive advices is unsatisfactory. Situation in home care seems worse, especially as the staff often has to get by without assistance.

5000|$|In 1936 the British {{zoologist}} James Gray posed a conundrum {{which has}} come to be known as Gray's paradox. The problem he posed was how dolphins can swim and accelerate so fast when it seemed their muscles lacked the needed power. If this is a problem with dolphins it is an even greater problem with billfish such as swordfish, which swim and accelerate faster than dolphins. In 2009, Taiwanese researchers from the National Chung Hsing University introduced new concepts of [...] "kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower" [...] to explain the swimming capabilities of swordfish. The researchers claim this analysis also [...] "solves the perplexity of dolphin's Gray paradox". They also assert that swordfish [...] "use sensitive rostrum/lateral-line sensors to detect upcoming/ambient water pressure and attain the best attack angle to capture the body <b>lift</b> power <b>aided</b> by the forward-biased dorsal fin to compensate for most of the water resistance power." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives a poverty-efficient {{allocation}} of aid and compares it with actual aid allocations. The {{allocation of}} aid that has the maximum effect on poverty depends {{on the level of}} poverty and the quality of policies. Using the headcount, poverty-gap, and squared poverty gap measures of poverty, alternatively, all yield similar poverty-efficient allocations. Finally, we find that the actual {{allocation of aid}} is radically different from the poverty-efficient allocation. With the present allocation, <b>aid</b> <b>lifts</b> around 10 million people annually out of poverty in our sample of countries. With a poverty-efficient allocation, the productivity of aid would nearly double...|$|R
40|$|Wearable robotic <b>lifting</b> <b>aids</b> {{compensate}} {{a proportion}} of the gravity during heavy lifting and can thereby reduce {{the burden on the}} operator’s musculoskeletal system. This study investigates the effect of errors in the compensation force of an inaccurate load compensation system on fast reaching movements of an operator. In an experimental study, subjects (n= 18) held a 2. 7 [kg] object while connected to a haptic manipulator that largely compensated the load by a constant force of 23 [N]. Subjects were are asked to perform elbow-flexion movements against gravity towards a target, either 30 or 50 ° away in a Fitts’ like task. The experiment consisted of two parts: In Part A the independent measure was a noise over the compensation force (a filtered Gaussian white noise with variances of either 1 or 1. 5 [N], over a set of trials). In Part B an estimation error was added as a second independent measure (a sudden overestimate or underestimate of the compensation force of 5 [N] added as a step in the middle of catch trials). Dependent metrics used are the rise time, settling time, first peak error and the agonist-antagonist muscle co-activation. It was hypothesized that subjects would show increased settling times for both error types. In Part A it was further hypothesized that subjects would react to the noise by intentionally moving slower (increased rise time) and by stiffening their limb (increased agonist-antagonist muscle co-activation). As hypothesized, the results showed that the settling time significantly increased for both the added noise and the sudden estimation error. Interestingly, contrary to what was hypothesized, the results of Part A generally did not show an increase in rise time and overall a lower muscle activity with noise of both muscles of the agonist-antagonist pair. From these results, it can be concluded that noise and estimation errors lead to longer movement times during fast goal-directed elbow flexion. Contrary to what current literature suggests, a reasonable amount of noise over the compensation force even seemed to cause subjects reducing the amount of co-activation. Apparently unpredictabilities like noise not always cause an increase of co-activation, and it can be concluded that more research is needed on what exactly makes humans choose their limb-impedance strategy in practical situations.
