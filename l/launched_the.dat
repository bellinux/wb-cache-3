50|$|To <b>launch</b> <b>the</b> trains, Storm Runner {{utilizes}} {{a system}} invented by Intamin that <b>launches</b> <b>the</b> trains using hydraulics. This system {{is similar to}} the propulsion on a locomotive wheel except it doesn't spin completely. The inner diameter of the wheel is attached to the hydraulic actuator and the outer radius of the wheel is then attached to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> mechanism. <b>The</b> outer diameter of the wheel amplifies the energy output from the slow actuator stroke creating a high speed launch in a matter of seconds. A pusher car is attached to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> mechanism and <b>the</b> train attaches to this pusher car prior to <b>launch.</b> Once <b>the</b> train reaches the end of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> area, <b>the</b> pusher car disengages and gravity does the rest.|$|R

50|$|Before <b>launch,</b> <b>the</b> TEL {{is moved}} to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> pad where it deploys four {{stabilizing}} jacks which lift the whole vehicle off the ground. Approximately 90 seconds before <b>the</b> <b>launch,</b> <b>the</b> TLC ejects the protective front nose cone, exposing the rocket {{so that it}} can <b>launch.</b> <b>The</b> TLC then is raised to a vertical position. During <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> sequence, <b>the</b> TEL uses compressed gas to force the rocket out of the TLC. Once the rocket reaches a height of approximately 30 meters (the height of the top of the TLC in the vertical position), the first stage ignites. The time from first-stage ignition to spacecraft separation is approximately 15 minutes.|$|R
