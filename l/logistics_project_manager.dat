ISO 9001 is a universally understood and accepted {{quality management system}} which comprises {{of a set of}} tools, when properly implemented; gives customer confidence that the supplier can continuously meet their requirement timely in the required quality. While much attention and much research has been focused on exploring the relationships of external customer satisfaction, researches on internal customer satisfaction is very few in number. Happy satisfied internal customer will improve the bottom line of an organization. So by this case, the paper is to identify the factors that are required to increase Project Manger's satisfaction (most important internal customer) especially on actions that are taken by the management in ISO certified construction companies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to extend the framework for construction material logistics in customer satisfaction from owner to <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> level. This paper examines how construction <b>logistics</b> affect a <b>project</b> <b>manager's</b> level of satisfaction. A survey established the general importance that a <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> must place on the construction logistics. Accordingly, the most significantly correlated factors in customer satisfaction were obtained from a <b>project</b> <b>manager's</b> point of view. Key important factors related to satisfaction were found through interviews with <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> and a literature review. These included project's personnel, material flow, schedule, contractor's organization, and information flow. The study results out of the key logistic factors material flow, information flow, schedule and personal found to be highly significant over total satisfaction of PM on construction logistics in ISO certified Sri Lankan companies. Out of significant factors suggest that material flow, information flow and schedule are worthy of the most attention. Satisfying the above factors will greatly improve the construction logistics that will, greatly increase the <b>project</b> <b>manager's</b> level of satisfaction over construction logistics. This paper also investigates the effect of logistics on, time, cost and quality of a project and also suggested the actions that have been practiced by the management of ISO 9001 certified construction companies in fulfilling their <b>Project</b> <b>manager's</b> satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: Project {{effectiveness}} {{is synonymous with}} project success. It is measured or assessed {{in terms of the}} degree to which project objectives are achieved. This paper presents an approach to evaluating the effectiveness of <b>logistics</b> <b>projects.</b> The starting point is the analysis of the current state of knowledge in the area of assessing <b>project</b> effectiveness, including <b>logistics</b> <b>projects.</b> The purpose of the study was to identify the critical factors determining the success of <b>logistics</b> <b>projects</b> and develop a model of <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> effectiveness. 	Methods: The paper is based on the available recent scientific-theoretical research and publications and on practical studies in 25 enterprises seated in Poland. The study carried out by the authors had the form of questionnaires. The authors used a case study to validate the  model of fuzzy decision-making system dedicated to estimate the level of <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> effectiveness. 	Results: Based on a literature review and research findings, the authors propose the key success factors for <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> effectiveness. In the paper the authors propose an approach to measure the level of <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> effectiveness using their model based on fuzzy logic. This model laid the foundations for a fuzzy decision-making system in MATLAB environmental. The paper describes the implementation of the model via a case study. 	Conclusions: This approach allows for a more detailed description of <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> effectiveness. The proposed model may be implemented by logisticians in an enterprise and/or supply chain. The approach can be useful to assess the level to which  <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> objectives are achieved - <b>logistics</b> <b>project</b> effectiveness...|$|R

On supply chain, food retailers are in the powerful position, communicating both consumers and suppliers. Existing literatures and our findings show that food retailers engage mostly in strategies to prevent and re-use food waste. The methodology used in this thesis is qualitative research through single case study design in order to gain valuable insights from food retailers and develop the existing theories. The empirical date is collected through semi-structured interviews with a store manager, the head of <b>logistics</b> and a <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> and environmental ambassador, Karin Bildsten. The findings had formed several learning points. First, in this case the major barrier is lack of resources in financial and knowledge terms in order to implement strategies. Second, consumers have a strong impact on the implementation of strategies, playing both as drivers and barriers. Lastly, environmental consideration of employees is a strong driver as well as positive response from society toward implementing different strategies. This research intended to give inspiration to other researchers into this new field of research.

Interpersonal competences should be much more developed in the case of social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> because managers make relationships with different people. What is more, social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> need higher competences than other <b>project</b> <b>managers,</b> especially interpersonal competences which are the most important factor to make a project successful.

The research revealed the most important interpersonal competences which have the greatest influence on the effectiveness of social <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> Social <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> should know what interpersonal competences are needed to work effectively on a social project.

This three step selection process has not changed for many years, yet a global online survey conducted {{as part of this}} research shows a low level of stakeholder satisfaction with <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> selected using this process. Considering recent advances in our understanding of <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> effectiveness, improvements in staff selection processes and the impact of the <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> on stakeholder satisfaction, this is unsatisfactory. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that focusing on candidate skills, experience and qualities while conducting a more comprehensive and structured <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> selection process than the conventional three step process of a resume review, candidate interview and reference check results in higher stakeholder satisfaction with the <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> selected. Using a design science approach the author shows that the commonly used three step selection process is unsound due to the incidence of bias in each step and how the low level of satisfaction with current <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> selection processes can be improved. The analysis conducted in this study shows that skills, experience and qualities are the key dimensions that should be examined in order to select a <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> who will meet or exceed stakeholder expectations. This research also shows that a more comprehensive selection process consisting of a role analysis, resume review, personality assessment, structured interview and reference check results in higher stakeholder satisfaction with the selected <b>project</b> <b>manager.</b> These activities were combined into a <b>Project</b> <b>Manager</b> 5 Step Selection Process which was validated using contemporary theory, quantitative techniques and case studies.
