2500|$|When {{the freshmen}} {{arrived in the}} fall of 1969, Schembechler asked Revelli to teach them how to sing [...] "The Victors". [...] Schembechler said, “He didn't just teach them ‘The Victors.’ He taught them Michigan tradition!” [...] Schembechler {{gathered}} the freshmen at Yost Field House, and Revelli entered in full uniform – described by Schembechler as “a lean, short, distinguished-looking older gentleman—a band director right out of central casting.” [...] Revelli rose to the podium, tapped his baton, <b>looked</b> <b>right</b> into their eyes and said, [...] "John Philip Sousa called this the greatest fight song ever written. [...] And you will sing it with respect!" [...] Revelli brought out a pitch pipe and began the instructions. [...] “You sing from down in here, in your diaphragm. [...] You bring it up from down here with feeling.” [...] Then he blew the starting note on his pitch pipe. [...] The players started, [...] "Hail to the Victors, valiant –" [...] Revelli interrupted, “No, No, No! [...] That’s terrible! [...] There’s no enthusiasm [...] You didn’t sing with enthusiasm!” [...] They started again, and Revelli interrupted again. [...] “No, no, no! [...] We’re gonna get this right if I’m here all night!” ...|$|E

2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and <b>looked</b> <b>right</b> into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{voice was}} now heard hailing {{us from the}} entrance.

60|$|He {{managed to}} watch her leaving that afternoon, and he was aware {{for the first time}} that she was well-formed, and that her manner of dress was satisfying.

60|$|She took up her stick and, {{opening the}} door, {{astonished}} Martha by her nimbleness.

60|$|So, {{when no one}} was looking, Tommy Trout {{slipped out}} of the safe little pool where all the other little Trouts were playing. He swam just a little speck of a ways farther still.
