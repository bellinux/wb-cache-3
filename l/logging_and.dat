5|$|As {{with other}} primates, {{one of the}} {{principal}} threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> mining. Both species appear to be very sensitive to <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, {{is a result of the}} need to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and cash crops. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the transistor and integrated circuits in the 1960s made electric logs vastly more reliable. Computerization allowed much faster <b>log</b> processing, <b>and</b> dramatically expanded <b>log</b> data-gathering capacity. The 1970s brought more <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> computers. These included combo type logs where resistivity <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> porosity <b>logs</b> were recorded in one pass in the borehole.|$|R
50|$|Thorius dubitus (common name: Acultzingo pigmy {{salamander}}) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Mexico where it is found in west-central Veracruz and adjacent Puebla. Its natural habitats are pine-oak cloud forests. It occurs under wood chips, <b>logs,</b> <b>and</b> rocks, and under the bark of <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> inside <b>logs.</b> It is threatened by habitat loss caused by <b>logging,</b> livestock, <b>and</b> subsistence agriculture.|$|R
5|$|In the 1850s, European-Americans {{settled in}} the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> {{agricultural}} activities. As more white settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose between them and the Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Training Center for Tropical Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, {{established}} in June 1998 by the UP Board of Regents, {{offers more than}} 300 training programs in forest and land management, <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> related disciplines.

5|$|After the war, Saunders was demobilised and {{returned}} to civilian life. He later served as a company commander with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) during the Korean War, where he fought at the Battle of Kapyong. Saunders left the Army in 1954 {{and worked in the}} <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> metal industries, before joining the Office of Aboriginal Affairs (later the Department of Aboriginal Affairs) as a liaison officer in 1969. In 1971, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his community service. He died in 1990, aged 69.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon {{be made into a}} state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A major factor in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> mining purposes. These included the Yallourn 900mm Railway in the Latrobe Valley open cut coal mines, the Fyansford Cement Works Railway near Geelong, the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw, and the Powelltown Tramway from Yarra Junction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding experienced a revival, and {{the consumption of}} horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> pulling brewery wagons. A few are sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe, but this is quite rare.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
30|$|In Japan, however, squared lumber {{is a major}} sawn {{product used}} for {{building}} members when constructing wooden houses. As {{one example of the}} variation in sawing patterns in large Sugi logs, several squared pieces of lumber without pith could be produced in this study. It is important to clarify the relationship between the wood properties of <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> the quality of the sawn lumber. The purposes of this study include accumulating fundamental data on wood properties within large Sugi <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> taking applicable variations in wood properties into consideration for sorting <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> sawing patterns.|$|R

5|$|The Wilderness Act {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or mining, and <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> also prohibits the use of motorized equipment and bicycles. The ways people may enter wilderness areas are on foot or on horseback.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the Spruce Production Division {{continued}} long after the unit was demobilized. Not only did the division dramatically increase the production of forest products for the war effort, but the transportation network that it built helped open up Pacific Northwest forests to greater use in the decades that followed. In addition, the division's work rules became the standard for <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> sawmill operations throughout the Pacific Northwest well into the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of pristine wilderness that have remained largely untouched by human {{activities such as}} mining, <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent of the forest is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the U.S. state of Minnesota is shaped by its {{original}} Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, {{and the emergence of}} industries made possible by the state's natural resources. Minnesota achieved prominence through fur trading, <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% {{of the horses}} bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for <b>logging,</b> <b>and</b> in recent years, has been increasingly used in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms.
