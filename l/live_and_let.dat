5|$|Savoye, {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die with Casino Royale, believes that the two books have open narratives which allow Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences {{in the structure of}} the endings, with <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Dies promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be more credible than Casino Royales ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} unusual chase {{sequences}} include the gondola sequence from Moonraker, which leaves the canals of Venice {{to continue on}} land, and the cello case chase in The Living Daylights, {{as well as a}} double-decker bus in <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He {{thought it was the}} most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E

5|$|Bond's adventures {{have taken}} him to over sixty countries, as well as outer space, in {{locations}} mostly described as attractive and exotic. These locations are primarily real places, though on occasion—such as San Monique (<b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die) and Isthmus (Licence to Kill)—the destinations have been fictional.|$|E
5|$|Following Hedison's first outing in 1973 in <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, the Leiter role did {{not appear}} again until the 1987 film The Living Daylights, by which time Bond was being played by Timothy Dalton; the role was taken up by John Terry.|$|E

5|$|<b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, a film based loosely on {{the novel}} {{starring}} Roger Moore as Bond, was released in 1973, which played on the cycle of blaxploitation films produced at the time. The film was directed by Guy Hamilton, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and is the eighth in the Eon Productions Bond series. Some scenes from the novel were depicted in later Bond films, including the sequence of Bond and Solitaire being dragged behind Mr Big's boat, which {{was used in the}} film For Your Eyes Only, while Felix Leiter was not fed to a shark until Licence to Kill, which also faithfully adapts <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Dies shoot-out in the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: The head of Q-Branch, he {{supplies}} 007 with {{a modified}} Aston Martin DB5. Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond {{that became a}} hallmark of the series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia With Love and, with the exception of <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E

5000|$|Baron Von Skarin (voiced by Julian Holloway) — This wealthy Bavarian baron {{is also an}} {{international}} terrorist and firearms smuggler. Von Skarin is cold and cruel but never neglects his elegant appearance. He is often seen reporting directly to Scumlord and is apparently one of his more favored agents. Appearances include <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let's</b> Dance, Dance of the Toreadors, Scottish Mist, Catching the Wave, Sherlock IQ, Rubies Aren't Forever and Northern Lights.|$|R
5|$|Friendship {{is another}} {{prominent}} element of <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, where {{the importance of}} male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete characters profiles in the novel clearly showed the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter. In turn this provides a strengthened motive for Bond to chase Mr Big as revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die is {{the second}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series of stories, and is set in London, the US and Jamaica. It was first {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1954. Fleming wrote the novel at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica before his first book, Casino Royale, was published; much of the background came from Fleming's travel in the US and knowledge of Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|<b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die {{was adapted}} as a daily comic strip which was {{published}} in The Daily Express newspaper and syndicated around the world. The adaptation ran from 15 December 1958 to 28 March 1959. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky, whose drawings of Bond had a resemblance to Sean Connery, the actor who portrayed Bond in Dr. No three years later.|$|E

5|$|On television, the American Broadcasting Company aired it for {{the first}} time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. {{broadcast}} attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second highest televised movie share at the time behind Gone with the Wind. In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second biggest TV audience ever for a feature film behind <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die.|$|E
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 1952 the {{journalist}} Ian Fleming wrote Casino Royale, his first novel, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, and completed the novel before Casino Royale {{was published in}} January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E
50|$|Jaws, a {{recurring}} villain from the films The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, made regular appearances, usually partnered with Nick Nack, a villain from The Man with the Golden Gun, forming a bickering comical duo. Auric Goldfinger also appears, alongside his assistant, Oddjob, from the Goldfinger film. It is revealed Goldfinger has a teenage daughter named Goldie Finger with equally expensive tastes. Several episode titles parodied {{the titles of}} Bond films such as <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let’s</b> Dance <b>and</b> Rubies Aren't Forever.|$|R

5|$|Bond {{occasionally}} supplements his {{alcohol consumption}} {{with the use}} of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{then decided}} to start {{production}} on The Man with the Golden Gun after <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die. This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, for three years.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1954 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} two novels—Casino Royale (1953) and <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> Die (1954)—and had a third, Moonraker, being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That year he read a story in The Sunday Times about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, then working in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company De Beers. The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers, a non-fiction book published in 1957.|$|E

40|$|In this essay, I {{take up the}} {{question}} of the time of medicine in relation to two events in the U. S. from 2005 —the Terri Schiavo case and Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. I consider both cases as “mediatized medical events,” that is, as events in which the practices of medicine received considerable media attention at a particular historical moment; or, we might say, as events that brought a convergence between media and medical practices. I juxtapose these two events because, placed side by side, they help make visible two stories of catastrophe, as well as the many difficulties of telling stories of catastrophe. Bringing together these seemingly divergent events allows me to draw connections that I hope will expand our bioethical imaginary beyond the reductive approaches that tend to dominate the practice of bioethics today. I also juxtapose them to signal a bioethical tension {{at the heart of the}} neoliberal state’s response to catastrophe in general, what Foucault might have diagnosed as the difference between making <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> die. In these two events, we glimpsed—if only fleetingly—the state’s operation of making <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> die, <b>and</b> medicine’s central role in that operation, as well as the re-assertion of medical sovereignty in crisis events...|$|R
