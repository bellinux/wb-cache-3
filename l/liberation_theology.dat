5|$|In 1848, Ciudad de San Cristóbal, {{the capital}} of the Mexican state of Chiapas, was renamed San Cristóbal de Las Casas, in honor of its first bishop. His work is a {{particular}} inspiration behind the work of the Las Casas Institute at Blackfriars Hall, Oxford. He is also often cited as a predecessor of the <b>liberation</b> <b>theology</b> movement. He is commemorated by the Church of England in the Calendar of Saints on July 20, The Episcopal Church (USA) on July 18, and at the Evangelical Lutheran Church on July 17. In the Catholic Church, the Dominicans introduced his cause for canonization in 1976. In 2002 the Church began the process for his beatification.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>liberation</b> <b>theology</b> {{has grown}} into an {{international}} and inter-denominational movement, {{it began as a}} movement within the Roman Catholic church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. <b>Liberation</b> <b>theology</b> arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutiérrez, who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, A Theology of Liberation. Other noted exponents are Leonardo Boff of Brazil, Jon Sobrino of El Salvador, and Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay.|$|E

40|$|The Christian {{tradition}} normally portrays disability as {{a divine}} punishment {{for an individual}} sin or as a chance for God to reveal his omnipotence, through miraculous healings. Since the Nineties of the Twentieth Century, however, <b>Liberation</b> <b>theologies</b> of disability have challenged this narration, which has justified a long-lasting neglect of disabled people in the theological reflection {{as well as their}} oppression in religious communities. Therefore, related to disability, ‘liberation’ means breaking the connection between sin and disability, in order to achieve the disabled people’s theoretical and practical inclusion. After a brief analysis of the Christian theological reflection concerning disability, the paper focuses on the key elements of two of the most important Christian <b>liberation</b> <b>theologies</b> of disability (Eiesland’s ‘Disabled God’ and Creamer’s ‘God with limits’), briefly addressing their relationship with Disability and Feminist Studies and their revolutionary potential...|$|R
