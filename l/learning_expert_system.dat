40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} the {{different approach to}} solve the complex problems in real-world by a great diversity of intelligent techniques including traditional hard computing techniques such as expert systems and soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. The paper has a discussion of possibility to integrate several technologies into one basic structure. Intelligent hybrid Systems are defined as models and computational programs based {{on more than one}} artificial Intelligence technology. The integration of different learning and adaptation techniques to overcome individual limitations and to achieve synergetic effects through the hybridisation. Most of these hybridization approaches, however, follow an adhoc design methodology, justified by success in certain application domains. To build a complete model of an environment (complex system) that corresponds to the listed features is either impossible or very expensive. In this case the intelligent system will have incomplete model of environment or will not have it at all. In complex environments usually it is impossible to describe the environment completely. This is caused by a huge space of possible states of environment (or even infinite), expanses or other intelligence concerned with the development of the next generation of intelligent systems Keywords—Machine <b>learning,</b> <b>expert</b> <b>system,</b> neural network, inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, intuitive reasoning.

40|$|Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is {{the process}} of solving a given problem based on the {{knowledge}} gained from solving precedents. It is an effective technique in the area of customer services or helpdesks. That is, a CBR system is used to solve most of the commonly occurring customer problems. While the implementation techniques may vary, most CBR systems include the following five steps: case representation and storage, precedent matching and retrieval, adaptation of the retrieved solution, validation of the solution, and finally, casebase update to include the information gained from the new problem. This paper details the various implementation techniques for these five steps, while focusing on a particular helpdesk system, namely SmartUSA, developed for the Union Camp Corporation. This system solves a customer’s problem by filtering the problem description through an alias table to generate a brief description and then matching the brief description with the cases in the database. It has proved to be an effective and user-friendly system that has successfully handled different descriptions of the same problem and allowed for the casebase to be built in free-format (plain) text.

40|$|Digital {{educational}} technology {{is capable of}} contributing supplementary strategies {{that can be used}} to address various educational challenges faced by higher education. Foremost among these challenges is the widespread lack of academic preparedness of students who enter South African higher education institutions. The legacy of Apartheid, teachers' poor domain knowledge and command of the language of instruction, together with a lack of commitment to the cognitive development of learners are some of the reasons why students have not developed the cognitive skills required to engage in meaningful learning. Meaningful learning requires a high level of conceptual engagement and development. To assist in the learning process, educators must focus on student learning rather than on the instructor and the technology used in the instruction. A powerful means of supporting meaningful learning is through a process of model building. Computer technology can effectively be used to facilitate the building of conceptual models. By encouraging students to use computer technology to build models that represent their personal understanding, the students are performing the role of designer and the technology is used as a cognitive tool. Using digital technology as a cognitive tool allows students to engage in critical thinking and higher-order <b>learning.</b> An <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shell is one way in which technology can be used as a cognitive tool. When students build <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> they are required to demonstrate the reasoning of an expert and to exhibit an understanding of causal relationships and procedural knowledge. There is very little evidence of research concerning the application of <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> as a cognitive tool in education. The primary aim of this study is to formulate design principles in the form of conjectures and principles related to a learning environment that uses technology as a cognitive tool in the form of an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shell to promote higher-order thinking skills. The second aim of this study is to explore the experiences of students who are exposed to a learning environment based on the conjectures and principles formulated during the design phase of the research. The conjectures and principles formulated during this study are expressed in terms of the characteristics, procedures and arguments associated with a learning environment that uses technology in the form of an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shell to facilitate higher-order thinking. These conjectures and principles were separated into seven interrelated clusters that can be summarised as follows: initial exposure; guided discovery learning; designing the <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> on paper; creating domain awareness; linking conceptual understanding to a representation of that understanding; hands-on development; and problem engagement.

40|$|The XML <b>Expert</b> <b>System</b> Shell (XESS) was {{designed}} to alleviate some of the difficulties associated with translating a knowledge base from one <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> to another. The major goal of XESS is to allow programmers to model an <b>expert</b> <b>system,</b> complete with traditional facts and rules, in an XML-based language that leverages the universally understood terms used when teaching artificial intelligence to students. XML, the extensible markup language, is a text-based standard for information interchange between disparate systems 1; it was originally designed to represent data in an easily parsable, human readable format 2. While some extensions of the XML specification, particularly the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), have long since abandoned human readability, the core XML specification is still used frequently to produce documents that can easily be exchanged between computational platforms and created or understood by human beings. The XESS-XML language inherits all of the usability of XML; it can be edited by hand in any text editor, is human readable, and can be parsed using XML parsers commonly available in any modern programming language. The XML Schema specification provides a mechanism for explicitly defining the content of an XML document so that a document can be validated 3, 4, 5. XML schemas specify the make-up of an XML document in exacting detail 6, using a pseudo-object-oriented syntax to specify exactly which entities are allowed in the document, the attributes of those entities, where they are allowed in the document, and how often they may occur. The XESS-XML language {{is defined as a}} fully extensible XML Schema, which can be used to validate any knowledge base written in the language. The Schema provides entities for common facts (e. g. predictes, structs) and a robust syntax for expressing rules in an if-then-else format, as well as the actions that should be taken in the event that a rule is fired. Additionally, because XML schemas are fully extensible, the XESS schema may be extended to add additional functionality such as support for fuzzy logic, new clause types, or new actions to be taken when rules are fired. In addition to the XML language, XESS also includes an object oriented interpreter specification that defines a robust set of language independent APIs for interacting with the <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> This interpreter specification is meant to set expectations, both for XESS developers and users, as to the features provided by the XESS API regardless of the language in which the interpreter has been implemented. As part of the specification, the XESS API also provides object oriented definitions for XESS plug-ins; a plug-in is capable of translating from an XESS document to the native language of a specific <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shell in a generic way (i. e. not specific to any one rule set) and back again. This allows users to express custom <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shells in the XESS-XML language, parse them using an XESS interpreter written in any language, and translate them to a specific <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shell through the use of an XESS plug-in without needing to <b>learn</b> the specific <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> shell language or rewriting the knowledge base once for each shell tested...|$|R

Practitioners also claim that adaptive Bayesian networks have advantages in their own right as a non-parametric method for density estimation, data analysis, pattern classification, and modeling. Among the reasons cited we find: their semantic clarity and understandability by humans, the ease of acquisition and incorporation of prior knowledge, the ease of integration with optimal decision-making methods, the possibility of causal interpretation of learned models, and the automatic handling of noisy and missing data. In spite of these claims, and the initial success reported recently, methods that learn Bayesian networks have yet to make the impact that other techniques such as neural networks and hidden Markov models have made in applications such as pattern and speech recognition. In this paper, we challenge the research community to identify and characterize domains where induction of Bayesian networks makes the critical difference, and to quantify the factors that are responsible for that difference. In addition to formalizing the challenge, we identify research problems whose solution is, in our view, crucial for meeting this challenge. ...|$|R

These alternate views enhance {{the usefulness of the}} original system by facilitating introduction of connectionist learning methods into the symbolic domain. The connectionist representation learns and stores metaknowledge in highly connected subnetworks and domain knowledge in a sparsely connected expert network superstructure. The total connectivity of the neural network representation approximates that of real neural systems and hence avoids scaling and memory stability problems associated with other connectionist models.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in indoor positioning systems {{led to a}} business interest in those applications and services where a precise localization is crucial. Wi-Fi fingerprinting based on machine <b>learning</b> and <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> are commonly used in the literature. They compare a current fingerprint to a database of fingerprints, and then return the most similar one/ones according to: 1) a distance function, 2) a data representation method for received signal strength values, and 3) a thresholding strategy. However, most of the previous works simply use the Euclidean distance with the raw unprocessed data. There is not any previous work that studies {{which is the best}} distance function, which is the best way of representing the data and which is the effect of applying thresholding. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study using 51 distance metrics, 4 alternatives to represent the raw data (2 of them proposed by us), a thresholding based on the RSS values and the public UJIIndoorLoc database. The results shown in this paper demonstrate that researchers and developers should take into account the conclusions arisen in this work in order to improve the accuracy of their systems. The IPSs based on k-NN are improved by just selecting the appropriate configuration (mainly distance function and data representation). In the best case, 13 -NN with Sørensen distance and the powed data representation, the error in determining the place (building and floor) has been reduced in more than a 50 % and the positioning accuracy has been increased in 1. 7 m with respect to the 1 -NN with Euclidean distance and raw data commonly used in the literature. Moreover, our experiments also demonstrate that thresholding should not be applied in multi-building and multi-floor environments...|$|R
