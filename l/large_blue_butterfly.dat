5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album). The <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Maculinea arion) became extinct {{in the hills}} in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E

5|$|Between 2011 and 2013 {{a project}} was {{undertaken}} {{to increase the}} population of <b>Large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> on the Polden Hills. This included planting Wild Thyme and managing the grazing on Walton Hill.|$|R
50|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} shown that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> predate the <b>largest</b> of the ant larvae first. This evolved tactic maximizes {{efficiency}} not only because the largest larvae provide the most substance by volume, but also because it prevents the larvae pupating and becoming inaccessible prey. Furthermore, it allows more newly hatched larvae time to grow bigger. While in the nest, <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> caterpillars acquire 99% of their final biomass, growing from an average of 1.3 mg to 173 mg. Results from laboratories estimate that 230 large larvae and a minimum of 354 Myrmica workers are needed to ensure the survival of one butterfly, however such a large nest is very rarely found in the wild. This supports findings that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> are extremely capable of withstanding starvation. This becomes extremely beneficial in situations when the ants desert the colony and leave the caterpillar behind. <b>Large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> have been known to be capable of migrating to new nests once the original is deserted. In many cases, a nearby colony with a fresh brood will populate the nest allowing the surviving <b>large</b> <b>blues</b> to parasitize multiple Myrmica colonies.|$|R
25|$|Social parasites take {{advantage}} of interactions between members of social organisms such as ants, termites, and bumblebees. Examples include the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Phengaris arion. Its larvae employ mimicry to parasitize certain species of ants, Bombus bohemicus, a bumblebee which invades the hives of other species of bee and takes over reproduction, their young raised by host workers, and Melipona scutellaris, a eusocial bee whose virgin queens escape killer workers and invade another colony without a queen. An extreme example of social parasitism is the ant species Tetramorium inquilinum of the Alps, which lives exclusively {{on the backs of}} other species of Tetramorium host ants. With tiny and weakened bodies, they have evolved for a single task: holding on to their host, since if they fall off, they will die.|$|E

It is {{adjacent}} to the East Polden Grasslands which has typical examples of species-rich, unimproved, calcareous grassland with scrub and amongst the many plant species found in this habitat is the early gentian (Gentianella anglica), which is endemic to Britain. Its other main interest lies in its suitability as a habitat for the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Phengaris arion), which has been successfully reintroduced onto the site. There are two nationally scarce grasshopper species present; rufous grasshopper (Gomphocerippus rufus) and woodland grasshopper (Omocestus rufipes).

40|$|Land-use {{change that}} took place in the second half of the 20 th century {{affected}} population sizes and viabilities of many species adapted to extensive land use. Dusky and Scarce <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> are ones of these species. Both number of their populations and population sizes declined all over Europe. During the last decade, many protected areas of the Natura 2000 network have been established to preserve these butterfly species. Protected areas are managed specifically to support viability of the Maculinea populations. This thesis investigates a current status set of the Natura 2000 sites in southwest Bohemia protecting one or both Maculinea butterfly species. Implementation of the specific management was found to be a crucial factor for successful protection of the Dusky and Scarce <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies.</b> We found that there are significant differences in managements applied in different locations. Almost half of protected areas are managed in inappropriate ways, their butterfly population sizes were very small or already extinct. Other sites are managed well and stable Maculinea populations live there. An assumption that a specific Maculinea management could also support another rare or endangered species has been tested in this thesis too.

50|$|Recent {{findings}} have {{also shown that}} there is a positive correlation between <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> conservation success and that of other endangered species. One specific example is the relationship between Myrmica ants, the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly,</b> violet seeds, and the violet-feeding butterfly (Boloria euphrosyne). The ants will bring the violet seeds into the nest. The seeds will often germinate in the nest, and their potential for germination increases as the nest becomes deserted. Since <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> predation of ant larvae can lead to desertion of the nest and B. euphrosyne tend to prefer violets growing on deserted ant nests, the fitness of B. euphrosyne appears to be indirectly affected by the presence of the large blue.|$|E

50|$|Early {{ideas of}} the Phengaris-Myrmica {{relationship}} resulted {{in the construction of}} a linear relationship between one predator and one host. It was proposed that each species of Phengaris had evolutionary adapted to prey on one specific species of Myrmica with the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> focusing on M. sabuleti. More recent reports indicate that while each Phengaris species can prey on more than one Myrmica species, that ability varies between species and each butterfly species still prefers a specific ant species. While results are not conclusive, {{it has been shown that}} the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> strongly favours M. sabuleti but has been documented to also prey on M. scabrinodis. Studies have also shown that species of butterfly may exhibit different host preferences depending on the location. For example, in Finland, <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> exclusively fed off M. lonae nests. Due to differing reports and the difficulties involved in these types of studies, the nature of the host-parasite relationship is still inconclusive.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} found that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> are three times less likely to survive in nests that have queen ants present. This {{discovery}} has been explained with a theory called the [...] "queen effect". In most Myrmica nests, the queen ant will lay two main batches of eggs, and the females that hatch from these eggs will either become workers or virgin queens. Whether these females become workers or virgin queens is dependent on the status of the queen in the nest. If the queen dies, worker ants will have the largest of the female larvae transition into virgin queens. If the queen is present and healthy, she will influence the nurse workers to neglect, starve and bite the female larvae which results in restricted growth and aids in the transition to workers. This indicates that Phengaris butterflies must maintain a strict balance between mimicking the queen in the presence of workers and appearing to be a worker to avoid the queen.|$|R
50|$|This {{traditional}} form {{of farming}} {{has produced a}} High Nature Value landscape and in 2008 the European Union declared 250,000 ha of the Carpathian valleys as the Tarnava Mare Natura 2000 site with the whole area receiving protection as a Site of Community Importance (SCI) under the Birds Directive and 85,000 ha as a Special Conservation Area (SCA) under the Habitats Directive. The objective of these designations {{is to protect the}} traditional uses of the landscape that have produced this species-rich mosaic of habitats and species. The valleys contain the last lowland population of European Brown Bears (closely related to the American grizzly and more than 4000 animals remaining) as well as Wolves and threatened bird species, such as the Lesser Spotted Eagle, Corncrake and Woodlark, whilst the mainly oak and hornbeam forest areas contain 9 species of woodpecker as well as the spectacular Ural Owl. The upland hay meadows, which have not been fertilised for centuries, contain a very diverse grassland flora and associated butterfly species whilst the wet grass areas contain Great Burnet, the host plant for the Scarce <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> and Dusky <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>butterflies.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> is largely {{influenced}} by location of its food sources. The species requires {{a combination of}} abundant amounts of its larval food plant, Thymus drucei {{and the presence of}} Myrmica sabuleti ants in order to survive.|$|E

40|$|Jeremy Thomas {{discusses}} how {{his efforts}} {{led to the}} successful revival of <b>large</b> British <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> which played a great role in insect conservation. Limited to south-west England, the butterflies' number declined throughout the 20 th century, and particularly since the 1950 s. Jeremy started locating ant nests by leaving trails of cake crumbs across Dartmoor and discovered that the <b>large</b> <b>blue's</b> larvae only survived in the nests of one ant species, 'Myrmica sabuleti,' and that species was extinguishing too. Alterations in grazing {{made it difficult for}} heat-loving ants to survive, resulting in consequent extinction of the <b>large</b> <b>blue.</b> Jeremy eventually found a population on the Swedish island of Öland and brought back 250 caterpillars. Twenty-five years on, <b>large</b> <b>blues</b> reside in about 30 colonies in south-west England. The project turned out to be successful as it also has helped conservationists understand that other threatened insect species can also be conserved...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} in designing agri-environmental schemes targeted at conservation is {{the determination of the}} amount of financial resources that should be allocated towards a particular aim such as the conservation of an endangered species.

In a case study we estimated the optimal conservation level of <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> (protected by the EU Habitats Directive) in the region of Landau, Germany.

50|$|The <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly</b> is {{well known}} among the {{behavioural}} ecology field as it exhibits a unique parasitic relationship with a single species of red ant, Myrmica sabuleti.

50|$|Coextinction {{may also}} occur {{on a local}} level: for example, {{the decline in the}} red ant Myrmica sabuleti in {{southern}} England, caused by habitat loss, resulted in the local extinction of the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterfly,</b> which is dependent on the ant as a host for the larvae. In this case the ant avoided local extinction, and the butterfly has been reintroduced.|$|E

50|$|Even once Phengaris {{butterflies}} have infiltrated {{the host}} nest, {{they continue to}} hide their identity as caterpillars and will go further in their act of deception. There have been many studies documenting the use of acoustic communication in ants, {{and it has been}} found that members of the Phengaris genus exploit this behaviour. For example, P. rebeli is able to mimic the unique sound of the queen in order to elevate its status in the nest. It has been shown that this mimicry can be so effective, that worker ants will rescue the P. rebeli over their own pupae in times of danger.Previously it had been thought that only the species that displayed the cuckoo strategy utilized acoustic mimicry. In studies, it was proven that the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> also uses acoustic mimicry and is capable of replicating the queen's sound as well as P. rebeli. The sound was so similar, that the sounds of the two caterpillars differed more than each did compared {{to the sound of the}} queen. It has been shown that the different Myrmica species utilize distinct semiochemicals to distinguish themselves, but they use very similar acoustic commands once in the nest. Members of the Phengaris genus including <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> employ an extremely effective combination of mimicries. <b>Large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> first utilize chemical mimicry to gain access to the nest and then use acoustic mimicry to elevate their status among the ants.|$|R

50|$|Some animals, in both {{terrestrial}} {{and aquatic}} environments, appear to camouflage their odor, which might otherwise attract predators.

40|$|Semi-natural wet meadows are {{threatened}} by drainage, the abandonment of traditional management and climate change. The <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> <b>butterflies</b> Maculinea teleius and M. nausithous are flagship species associated with wet meadows and are the targets of many conservation programmes. However, there is little knowledge {{on the impact of}} natural catastrophes, such as floods, on the persistence of these butterflies. In our study we tested how a flood that resulted in the temporary inundation of meadows affected populations of M. teleius and M. nausithous. Studies were conducted in two consecutive seasons of 2009 (with ‘normal’ weather) and 2010 (with extreme rainfall and a consequent flood in May) in a wet meadow complex located in the Vistula River valley in southern Poland. In both years the abundance of adults was estimated for each local habitat patch (n = 55) within sympatric metapopulations of both species. Additionally, in June 2010, i. e. directly after the flood and shortly before the flight period, a total of 754 Myrmica ant nests in 10 habitat patches (6 inundated vs. 4 not inundated) were checked for the presence of Maculinea larvae and pupae. We found no impact of inundation on year-to-year changes in adult population sizes. The probability of occurrence of Maculinea larvae and pupae in ant nests was higher in temporarily inundated meadows. Our results indicate that temporary inundation occurring after long-term downpours does not negatively affect the investigated species even during the larval period in ant nests at ground level. This provides an argument against drainage works in wet meadows with Maculinea butterflies...|$|R
