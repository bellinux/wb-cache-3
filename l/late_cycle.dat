Before the initiation of ventricular fibrillation, <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> ventricular extrasystoles were recorded in 38 patients (79 %) and R on T extrasystoles in 27 patients (56 %). R on T extrasystoles were relatively infrequent [...] an average of three occurred during a mean monitoring time of 27 minutes.

Ventricular extrasystoles occurring at more than five a minute were uncommon during this phase. The time from "warning arrhythmias" to the development of ventricular fibrillation in many patients was short, thus limiting the administration of antiarrhythmic agents.

40|$|AbstractIn Drosophila {{embryonic}} development, the Bicoid (Bcd) protein establishes positional {{information of}} downstream developmental genes like hunchback (hb), {{which has a}} strong anterior expression and a sharp on-off boundary in the mid-embryo. The role of Bcd cooperative binding in the positioning of the Hb pattern has been previously demonstrated. However, there are discrepancies in the reported results {{about the role of}} this mechanism in the sharp Hb border. Here, we determined the Hill coefficient (nH) required for Bcd to generate the sharp border of Hb in wild-type (WT) embryos. We found that an nH of approximately 6. 3 (s. d. 1. 4) and 10. 8 (s. d. 4. 0) is required to account for Hb sharpness at early and <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> 14 A, respectively. Additional mechanisms are possibly required because the high nH is likely unachievable for Bcd binding to the hb promoter. To test this idea, we determined the nH required to pattern the Hb profile of 15 embryos expressing an hb 14 F allele that is defective in self-activation and found nH to be 3. 0 (s. d. 1. 0). This result indicates that in WT embryos, the hb self-activation is important for Hb sharpness. Corroborating our results, we also found a progressive increase in the required value of nH spanning from 4. 0 to 9. 2 by determining this coefficient from averaged profiles of eight temporal classes at cycle 14 A (T 1 to T 8). Our results indicate that there is a transition in the mechanisms responsible for the sharp Hb border during cycle 14 A: in early stages of this cycle, Bcd cooperative binding is primarily responsible for Hb sharpness; in <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> 14 A, hb self-activation becomes the dominant mechanism...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{scholars}} {{have begun to}} re-evaluate the works, writings, and life of Robert Schumann (1810 - 1856). One of the primary issues in this ongoing re-evaluation is a reassessment of the composer's late works (roughly defined as those written after 1845). Until recently, {{the last eight years}} of Schumann's creative life and the works he composed at that time either have been ignored or critiqued under an image of an illness that had caused periodic breakdowns. Schumann's late works show how his culture and the artists communicating within that culture were transformed from the beginning {{to the middle of the}} nineteenth century. These late works, therefore, should be viewed in the context of Schumann's output as a whole and in regard to their contributions to nineteenth-century society. Schumann's contributions, specifically to the genre of the song cycle from 1849 to 1852, are among his late compositional works that still await full reconsideration. A topical study, focusing on three themes of selections from his twenty-three <b>late</b> <b>cycles,</b> will provide a critical evaluation of Schumann's compositional output in the genre of the song cycle. First, Schumann's political voice will be examined. The political events that led to the mid-nineteenth-century revolutions inspired crucial changes in European life and the art produced at that time. Schumann took an active role through his artistic contributions in which he exercised his political voice in responding to these changing events. Second, Schumann's storytelling voice will be explored. In the nineteenth century, storytellers remembered past events in order to comment on social and political issues of their own day. Schumann's storytelling voice allowed him to embrace a change in his own musical style and message in several <b>late</b> <b>cycles.</b> ird, Schumann's (relational) feminist voice will be considered. In two <b>late</b> <b>cycles</b> Schumann featured historical women: Elisabeth Kulmann (1808 - 1825), a Russian poet, and Mary, Queen of Scots (1542 - 1587). In both of these cycles, Schumann closely associated these women's lives with their work and appreciated their strength and their abilities to transcend their earthly burdens. These <b>late</b> song <b>cycles</b> not only allow us to fully appreciate a large part of Schumann's late-compositional oeuvre, but they also provide us a better understanding of the mid-century German culture from this artist's perspective. The method by which Schumann communicated with his audiencesone so different from that of the 1840 -songsis as significant as the messages he hoped to communicate. Schumann's experiences leading up to 1848 had changed him as a man and as a musician.

40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} the most common engine {{technology}} used in transportation. Its widespread use comes from its inherent high efficiency and its relative low cost. It suffers from pollutant emission issues, however, that need detailed understanding of their origins to meet the strictest current and upcoming emission standards. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the study of the mechanism at the origin of soot particle emissions and gives indications on which parameters can effectively reduce them. There are two competing in-cylinder processes, soot formation and soot oxidation, governing soot emissions from conventional combustion in diesel engines. To this day, it is still often believed that inhibiting the formation of soot reduces its emissions, despite several studies showing poor relationship between soot formation and emission in most conditions encountered in diesel engines. The results presented in this thesis aims at highlighting the importance of soot oxidation in the <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> over the soot formation process. An effort was realized to identify the parameters governing its oxidation and how it results in lower emission levels. The study of those parameters has been realised through the use of in-cylinder sampling of gases and optical measurements. The optical measurements were realised in a heavy-duty diesel engine using a Bowditch design with a specifically designed three-valve cylinder head. This cylinder head had an optical access located {{at the top of the}} combustion chamber, allowing the study of processes occurring in the <b>late</b> <b>cycle,</b> when the piston is moving down into the cylinder. The diagnostic chosen for this study is called laser extinction, a line of sight technique based on the absorption of light by the soot particles present in the flame. The data collected gave information on the evolution of the soot concentration and could be used to characterise the soot oxidation rate in the <b>late</b> <b>cycle.</b> The in-cylinder sampling measurements were realized in order to gather information on the soot particle characteristics. The results showed a strong correlation between the soot oxidation rates and the emission levels, underlining the importance of improving the oxidation rate rather than the soot formation in order to reduce soot emissions. It was shown that increasing the mixing of gases in the cylinder by means of increased turbulences could lead to a negative impact on the soot oxidation rates that were passed on to the soot levels in the exhaust. A variation of temperature of gases showed little to no impact on the soot oxidation rates and did not seem to effectively impact the emission levels. An increase of the gas density in the cylinder of gases lead to improved oxidation rate that also reduced emission levels. Of the injection related parameters studied, the injection pressure and the injector hole size had a strong impact on the soot oxidation rates even long after the end of the injection process. The most important parameter identified that affected the soot oxidation rates was the oxygen concentration. This parameter was studied in detail and it showed that a reduction of oxygen concentration lead to a slower maturation of soot during the combustion. While this feature produced more reactive soot particles prone to be more easily oxidized, it was revealed to be concerning a limited amount of particles in the cylinder. Moreover, it was largely overruled by the reduction of OH produced in the flame. Using simulation tools, it was shown that lowering the oxygen concentration reduced the flame temperature, which in turn reduced the OH concentration. The reduction of OH correlated strongly with the reduction in oxidation rates observed in the optical measurements, to a greater extent than just the drop of oxygen concentration...|$|E
