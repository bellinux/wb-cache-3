5|$|The {{album was}} not {{promoted}} well, no radio singles were issued, {{and it did}} not chart. Despite no commercial and sales success, Soul Food Taqueria was mostly well received by music critics, who commended its diverse style, production quality, and viewed it as a progression for Guerrero from his 2000 album A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>of</b> Somethin.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage. There was a certain moment in the '90s when, if you were headed downtown and turned left, every girl looked like Bettie Page. But {{they did not do}} what Winehouse did, mixing Bettie Page with Brigitte Bardot and adding that <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> Ronnie Spector.|$|E
5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>of</b> Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E

5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

25|$|Daily Double – {{similar to}} the McDouble, however, the {{toppings}} are slightly different. The Daily Double is made with a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> lettuce, tomato, slivered onions, and mayonnaise.

25|$|In {{addition}} to her European language skills, Alexandra speaks a bit of Cantonese.

25|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Merlot grape is the propensity to quickly overripen once it hits its initial ripeness level, sometimes {{in a matter of}} a few days. There are two schools of thought on the right time to harvest Merlot. The wine makers of Château Pétrus favor early picking to best maintain the wine's acidity and finesse as well as its potential for aging. Others, such as Rolland, favor late picking and the added fruit body that comes with a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> over-ripeness.|$|E

Project based, the Foundation seeks to help where the need is – they have renovated kitchens, gardens, and living areas in women's refuges, provided sleeper beds to hospitals to allow families to stay together through treatment and countless other ways {{to make a difference in}} some of Australia's most vulnerable lives.|$|E
25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that even a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

25|$|Alam {{was picked}} {{to play against}} England in 2010 and {{wanted to make the}} most of his {{opportunity}} to get picked for the two upcoming tours and then be selected for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He also stated that he had played a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> club cricket in England to help him get used to the english conditions and to train for the tour. Alam scored well in the first two matches but his major break came in the third One-Day International when he increased his top score to 64. He then retained his place for the ODI series against South Africa in the UAE. After scoring 123 runs in the 5 match series, he was subsequently dropped from the ODI team and later that year, lost his place in the T20 team after the tour to New Zealand.|$|E

We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a wild child.

25|$|First, the {{movement}} system (and turn structure with it) departs {{from the traditional}} 'everyone takes a turn in order' structure used {{in the vast majority}} of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the total movement (termed an impulse, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can see what is happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind that everything is moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: on impulse #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and on impulse #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, and targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make a move on the turn's final impulse.|$|E
