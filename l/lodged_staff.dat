5000|$|Funding for section 81 healing lodges is unstable. In addition, CSC healing lodges {{and section}} 81 healing lodges are {{unevenly}} funded. In 2009-2010, CSC allocated $21,555,037 for CSC lodges and $4,819,479 for section 81 lodges. This discrepancy in funding means that Section 81 lodges must pay their employees 50% less {{and may be}} unable to provide adequate training. According to the Office of the Correctional Investigator, the original intent was for CSC lodges to eventually be transferred to the control of Aboriginal communities. Presently there are no negotiations in place to transfer the control of CSC healing lodges.

Using a set of international ecotourism principles, I interviewed and surveyed participants from the locality of Yanamono. I also inquired whether lodge administration had adopted any ecotourism labels or standards. From the perspective of participants all three lodges succeed in 1) providing positive learning experiences and hospitality and 2) conserving the environment - with few compromises. Both of the two older lodges provide some jobs and help to construct utilities, but the oldest has an exemplary Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) to assist with education, conservation, and sustainable business projects. The newer lodge has strong intentions to employ more indigenous people and help more in the community in the future. All lodges might improve by 1) increasing economic linkages between lodges and local villages 2) conducting environmental impact assessments with local communities 3) including staff and villagers in lodge management 4) teaching tourists about poverty, degradation, and lack of representation 5) providing guests with ongoing information on sustainable projects and 6) using lodge income to support acquisition of land rights and advocacy. The adoption of a specific set of certification standards and a lodge coalition would unify the community to achieve environmental and economic goals...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionRabies is a fatal viral infection, {{resulting}} in > 55, 000 deaths globally each year. In August 2011, a young orphaned zebra at a Kenyan safari lodge acquired rabies and potentially exposed > 150 tourists and local staff. An investigation was initiated to determine exposures among the local staff, and to describe animal bite surveillance {{in the affected}} district. MethodsWe interviewed <b>lodge</b> <b>staff</b> on circumstances surrounding the zebra's illness and assessed their exposure status. We reviewed animal bite report forms from the outpatient department at the district hospital. ResultsThe zebra was reported bitten by a dog on 31 st July 2011, became ill on 23 rdAugust, and died three days later. There were 22 employees working at the lodge during that time. Six (27 %) had high exposure due to contact with saliva (bottle feeding, veterinary care) and received four doses of rabies vaccine and one of immune-globulin, and 16 (73 %) had low exposure due to casual contact and received only four doses of rabies vaccine. From January 2010 to September 2011, 118 cases of animal bites were reported in the district; 67 (57 %) occurred among males, 65 (57 %) in children < 15 years old, and 61 (52 %) were inflicted in a lower extremity. Domestic and stray dogs accounted for 98 % of reported bites. ConclusionDog bites remains {{the main source of}} rabies exposure in the district, but exposure can result from wildlife. This highlights the importance of a one health approach with strong communication between wildlife, veterinary, and human health sectors to improve rabies prevention and control...|$|R
