5000|$|<b>Low</b> <b>floor</b> <b>wagons</b> for {{the rolling}} road (Class Saad…) are {{suitable}} for loading entire articulated lorries including their tractor units. The necessary <b>low</b> <b>floors</b> required are achieved by using especially small wheel diameters {{in each of the}} four-axle bogies. These make the wagons relatively expensive to build and maintain.|$|R
50|$|The CFC {{operated}} the following freight stock.Four wheeled open wagons and closed vans, with {{a capacity of}} 10 tonnes, but restricted to 7 tonnes on the lines laid with the lighter rails. also ten bogie lowside wagons by Decauville. There were some unsprung, dumb buffered ballast wagons and some bogie flat wagons. There were two couverts surbaissés, which were <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> bogie <b>wagons</b> for conveying cattle or horses. For mineral traffic four wheeled steel sided dropside open wagons were used. Some had brake-huts. There were also ten bogie opens. Another fifty bogie wagons were ordered by the Mines de Barbery in 1914, {{but it is not}} known if these were delivered.|$|R

50|$|In 1996, super <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> single-deckers were {{introduced}} in Hong Kong, Citybus introduced ten Volvo B6LE, then KMB followed by introducing 12 Dennis Dart SLF buses. Later in 1997, the first super <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> double-deckers (Dennis Trident) were also introduced by KMB and Citybus; in the following two years, different models of super <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> buses were being introduced.|$|R
50|$|The Dennis Dart SLF (Super <b>Low</b> <b>Floor)</b> {{marked the}} {{wholesale}} introduction of single-deck <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> buses in the United Kingdom in 1995, after many small-scale demonstrator usages. <b>Low</b> <b>floor</b> buses were rapidly introduced on high-profile routes, notably becoming {{a requirement for}} London Buses contracts. The Optare Solo introduced in 1997 marked another step change with inroads into smaller usages traditionally served by minibuses. The final phase came with <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> double-deckers the Dennis Trident 2 and Volvo B7TL entering the mass market, {{even though they were}} introduced after the Optare Spectra.|$|R
50|$|On September 19, 2013, 12 new 40-foot Gillig <b>Low</b> <b>Floor</b> clean diesel buses (5759-5770) {{went into}} service. A week later (September 26, 2013), 28 new 29-foot Gillig <b>Low</b> <b>Floor</b> clean diesel buses (5032-5059) also went into service. Also, the 2013 29-foot Gillig <b>Low</b> <b>Floor</b> clean diesel buses {{replaced}} {{all of the}} 2003 model shuttle transit vehicles (STV) that were formerly operated by Pittsburgh's Port Authority of Allegheny County.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{development}} of low-floor technology, some low-floor purpose built minibuses have been created. Some offer a <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> access through a centre door. Some short versions of <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> midibuses are sometimes also called minibuses.|$|R

50|$|Beside {{the station}} is Ballina Freight yard. The yard is a major freight Hub for Iarnród Éireann. Bulk (Timber) and Intermodal freight train {{movements}} go from the yard to Dublin and Waterford ports. The new rail spur recently opened in Dublin Port and rail line clearance to carry 9 ft 6 in high cube containers on standard <b>floor</b> <b>wagons</b> have increased the competitiveness of rail freight.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2006, Ride On's first 5 hybrid-electric buses, the 2006 40-foot Gillig <b>Low</b> <b>Floor</b> aka Gillig Advantage buses (5300-5304), {{went into}} service.

50|$|A {{low-floor bus}} is a bus or {{trolleybus}} {{that has no}} steps between one or more entrances, and <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> for part {{or all of the}} passenger cabin. Buses with partial <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> may also refer as low-entry bus in some locations.|$|R

50|$|In the 2000s, the {{franchised}} bus companies {{continued to}} introduce new super <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> double-deckers. In 2003, KMB introduced {{the first new}} generation super <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> double-decker (TransBus Enviro500) with wider (with the width of 2550mm instead of 2500mm) bodywork and straight staircase.|$|R

50|$|Lucknow Mahanagar Parivahan Sewa {{operates}} {{a large number}} of A/C and non A/C <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> buses under the title UPSRTC JNNURM: <b>Low</b> <b>Floor</b> Bus Service.

All <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> buses in Lucknow are of TATA Marcopolo. These buses are well designed and equipped with all needed security measures though security measures are rarely followed by commuters.

50|$|Many <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> trams have fixed bogies which {{increase}} track {{wear and}} tear, while decreasing {{the speed at}} which a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4-15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The Škoda ForCity and the newest Alstom Citadis X04 try to counter the effect with <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> pivoting bogies while maintaining 100% <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> design. Prior to the new design, pivoting bogies could only be used under high floors, hence such trams could only be part low-floor, with high-floor sections over the pivoting bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} design of 100% <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> {{vehicles}} uses short carbody sections for the wheels and longer suspended sections. Examples {{of this are}} the Citadis and Combino. A similar, but somewhat older technique {{is one that has}} been developed by MAN. In 1990, it was the first 100% <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> tram. These trams are found in ten German cities (such as Bremen and Munich) and in the Swedish city Norrköping. In many other German cities there are trams with <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> between the outer bogies and single axle bogies under the centre section.|$|R
50|$|The high floor Pyoneer was {{launched}} around 1997, {{to complement the}} earlier Cityzen. However, the model was very short lived due to the <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> bus revolution, with the first double decker example (a DAF/VDL DB250) appearing in 1998. <b>Low</b> <b>floor</b> buses took hold in 1999, and orders of the Pyoneer slowed. This led East Lancs to introduce the Lolyne series. The Pyoneer's biggest operator was Nottingham City Transport, on Volvo Olympian and B10M chassis, who withdrew their final examples in 2009, making their fleet fully <b>low</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The pagodas are {{the tallest}} set of twin pagodas in China. They are both eight-cornered, with the <b>lowest</b> <b>floor</b> being {{comparatively}} {{taller than the}} rest, {{the size of the}} upper floors progressively decreasing. The West Pagoda is 54.78 meters tall, with the <b>lowest</b> <b>floor’s</b> circumference being 4.16 meters. The pagoda’s eaves are painted with emerald green glaze. The East Pagoda is 53.3 meters high, and the <b>lowest</b> <b>floor’s</b> circumference is 4.36 meters. On top of the East pagoda are three magic gourds (宝葫芦), with the upper two parts being made of copper.|$|R
50|$|While {{the company}} have {{traditionally}} maintained a uniform livery for all buses, deliveries of <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> vehicles {{has seen a}} new standard livery introduced. Route branding has been increasingly used by Lothian since the introduction of <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> vehicles. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Lothian. Since May 2010 the Harlequin livery used to identify <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> buses has started to be phased out, as the company is now a full <b>low</b> <b>floor</b> operation, with {{a return to the}} traditional madder and white livery although the style has been altered slightly to suit the lines of modern buses. Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type painted in the new livery.|$|R
