50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the building is clearly discernible. Approached from the footpath, the centred main entrance opens from the arcade into the spacious banking chamber. The manager's office and accountant's alcove are located to the left along its eastern side and strong room, toilet and stationery room along the rear to the south. A door {{in the rear of}} the western wall leads out to the lane. The dining room is located in the south-east corner. Adjacent, at rear of the bank, is an impressive stair hall which provides separate external access to the first floor manager's apartment together with through access from the service wing to the dining room. There is a storage room under the stair and <b>linen</b> <b>store</b> on the first floor. Opening off the stair hall, the apartment has an L-shaped hall leading to the western verandah where there are bathrooms clad with chamferboards located on the south-western corner. Two large principal rooms across the front (originally the drawing room and principal bedroom) and four smaller rooms (dressing room and three bedrooms) toward the rear open off the hall. The former, connected by bi-folding doors, have substantial joinery and all rooms opening onto the front and side verandahs have French doors.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{their wedding}} on 6 May 1960, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, sister of Queen Elizabeth II, and the Earl of Snowdon, moved into Apartment 10, that Princess Margaret termed [...] "the doll's house," [...] {{which had been}} vacated by the recent death of the Marquess of Carisbrooke, eldest son of Princess Beatrice, Queen Victoria's {{youngest}} daughter, while they set about transforming the much larger Apartment 1A to new designs. In 1960, Kensington Palace was {{under the auspices of}} the Department of the Environment, and the renovation had to be carried out under the strictest of budgets, with the eventual costs coming in at £85,000 (approximately £1.5 million today). By 1962, the whole interior had been gutted and all the floors, except the attic floor, had been removed to deal with rising damp. The resulting modern apartment consisted of the main reception rooms, three principal bedrooms and dressing rooms, three principal bathrooms, the nursery accommodation, nine staff bedrooms, four staff bathrooms, two staff kitchens and two staff sitting rooms. Twenty ancillary rooms included a <b>linen</b> <b>store,</b> a luggage room, a drying room, a glass pantry and a photographic dark room for Lord Snowdon. The house in 18th century style, had a modern color palette with the bold use of colours including Margaret's favorites, pink and kingfisher blue. The house was largely designed by Snowdon and Princess Margaret with the assistance of the theatre designer Carl Toms, one-time assistant to Oliver Messel, Lord Snowdon’s uncle, and a close friend of the royal couple. The royal couple moved into Apartment 1A on 4 March 1963, prior to the birth of their daughter, Lady Sarah, who was born at the palace the following year.|$|E
40|$|The mite fauna of {{dust from}} cloth-covered seats of four {{passenger}} trains and bedding from a British Rail <b>linen</b> <b>store</b> in Glasgow was investigated; 22 samples containing 4488 mg of dust from a {{total surface area}} of 5. 5 m 2 were taken. Sixteen samples were positive for mites and 33 specimens belonging to 10 species were found. The most common species were Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Trouessart), Glycyphagus domesticus (De Geer), G. destructor (Schrank) and Euroglyphus maynei (Cooreman). The species composition bore considerable resemblance to that of house dust (although the density of mites was far lower) and the mites have probably been transported from homes via clothing and pets. Only five intact specimens, {{which may have been}} alive at the time of sampling, were found. The dust from trains consisted mostly of particles of soot. Very few skin scales, the food source of house dust mites, were detected. The small numbers of intact mites found and the absence of an identifiable food source make it unlikely that permanent populations of mites survive in upholstered seats on trains...|$|E

40|$|AbstractZygomycosis {{refers to}} a group of {{uncommon}} and frequently fatal mycoses caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, the organisms of which are usually found in decaying organic matter. Disease can be transmitted by the inhalation of spores or by direct inoculation on disrupted skin or mucosa. For rare diseases such as zygomycosis, two or more cases occurring in a short time should be investigated as a probable epidemic. Twelve hospital outbreaks and two pseudoepidemics caused by Zygomycetes have been cited in the English literature. The first epidemic was recorded in 1977 and the last in 2008. Outbreaks {{have been reported in the}} USA, the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Cases have included cutaneous, disseminated, pulmonary and rhinocerebral disease. Species identified have included Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus rhizopodiformis, Rhizopus microsporus, Rhizopus spp., Absidia corymbifera and Rhizomucor pusillius. Sources of infection have included Elastoplast adhesive bandage rolls, ventilation systems, wooden tongue depressors, karaya (plant-derived adhesive) ostomy bags, and water damage to a <b>linen</b> <b>store</b> and patient shower room. Patients have included cardiosurgery patients, renal transplant recipients, orthopaedic patients, adult leukaemia patients, intensive care unit neonates, immunocompromised haematology patients, and burn unit patients. Although zygomycosis outbreaks in the hospital environment are infrequent, a high index of suspicion should exist if necrotic lesions appear in proximity to a postoperative wound. Direct tissue examination and tissue culture and histopathology must be routinely performed...|$|E

50|$|Household <b>linens</b> are <b>stored</b> {{near the}} area where they are used, when possible, for convenience. Otherwise, bed and kitchen and dining <b>linens</b> may be <b>stored</b> {{together}} in a linen closet or cupboard. There are many methods of folding linens for storage. For formal occasions, table linens may be ironed before use. Traditionally, table linens could be starched while ironing, to decrease wrinkling and retain a smooth, pristine appearance. Seasonal storage of linens {{led to the development}} of natural pest control methods in Europe to prevent moth larvae and other insects or rodents from eating the cloth. Sachets made of dried Margosa (neem), cloves, lavender, and other herbs are traditional, as are cedar wood chips.|$|R

It was found that the linen introduced into the washing machine had a high B. cereus spore content and that this was still present after the wash process. The spores were not killed by either the heat disinfection stage of the wash or the addition of chemical disinfectants and were not removed by the dilution in the process. The multiplication of B. cereus was thought to have occurred on used, damp <b>linen</b> <b>stored</b> in plastic bags, particularly when ambient temperatures were high.
