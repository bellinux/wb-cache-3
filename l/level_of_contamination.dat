5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E

These teams interview people who were exposed to the hazardous substances and collect samples to test the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> in the environment and in people.|$|E
40|$|Background: Current {{priorities}} for diarrhoeal disease prevention include use of sanitation and safe water. There {{have been few}} attempts to quantify the importance of animal faeces in drinking-water contamination, {{despite the presence of}} potentially water-borne zoonotic pathogens in animal faeces. Objectives: This study aimed to quantify the relationship between livestock ownership and point-of-consumption drinking-water contamination. Methods: Data from nationally representative household surveys in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Ghana, each with associated water quality assessments, were used. Multinomial regression adjusting for confounders was applied to assess the relationship between livestock ownership and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> drinking-water <b>contamination</b> with E. coli. Results: Ownership of five or more large livestock (e. g. cattle) was significantly associated with drinking-water contamination in Ghana (RRR = 7. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 6 to 38. 9 for medium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> with 1 - 31 cfu/ 100 ml; RRR = 5. 2, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 24. 5 for high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> with > 31 cfu/ 100 ml) and Bangladesh (RRR = 2. 4, 95 % CI = 1. 3 – 4. 5 for medium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> contamination; non-significant for high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination).</b> Ownership <b>of</b> eight or more poultry (chickens, guinea fowl, ducks or turkeys) was associated with drinking-water contamination in Bangladesh (RRR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 2. 0 for medium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination,</b> non-significant for high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination).</b> Conclusions: These results suggest that livestock ownership is a significant risk factor for the <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> drinking-water at the point of consumption. This indicates that addressing human sanitation without consideration <b>of</b> faecal <b>contamination</b> from livestock sources will not be sufficient to prevent drinking-water contamination...|$|R

25|$|The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> of the {{feedstock}} {{material is}} a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|E
25|$|Of the 17 RBMKs built (one {{was still}} under {{construction}} at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant), all three surviving reactors at the Chernobyl plant have now been closed (the fourth having been destroyed in the accident). Chernobyl 5 and 6 were under construction {{at the time of}} the mishap at Chernobyl, but further construction was stopped due to the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> at the site limiting its longer term future. Both reactors at Ignalina in Lithuania were also shut down. Russia is the only country to still operate reactors of this design: Saint Petersburg (4 RBMK-1000), Smolensk (3 RBMK-1000) and Kursk (4 RBMK-1000).|$|E
25|$|A {{cleanroom}} {{or clean}} room is an environment, typically used in manufacturing, including of pharmaceutical products or scientific research, {{as well as}} aerospace semiconductor engineering applications with {{a low level of}} environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles, and chemical vapors. More accurately, a cleanroom has a controlled <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> that is specified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a specified particle size. To give perspective, the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains 35,000,000 particles per cubic meter in the size range 0.5μm and larger in diameter, corresponding to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while an ISO 1 cleanroom allows no particles in that size range and only 12 particles per cubic meter of 0.3μm and smaller.|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis or {{combustion}} {{of waste}} wood {{can provide a}} renewable source of energy and produce byproducts which can be recycled back to land. To be sustainable requires that these byproducts pose minimal threat to the environment or human health. Frequently, reclaimed waste wood is contaminated by preservative-treated timber containing high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals. We investigated the effect <b>of</b> feedstock <b>contamination</b> from copper-preservative treated wood on the behaviour of pyrolysis-derived biochar and combustion-derived ash in plant-soil systems. Biochar and wood ash were applied to soil at typical agronomic rates. The presence of preservative treated timber in the feedstock increased available soil Cu; however, critical Cu guidance limits were only exceeded at high rates <b>of</b> feedstock <b>contamination.</b> Negative effects on plant growth and soil quality were only seen at high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> biochar <b>contamination</b> (> 50 % derived from preservative-treated wood). Negative effects <b>of</b> wood ash <b>contamination</b> were apparent at lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> (> 10 % derived from preservative treated wood). Complete removal of preservative treated timber from wood recycling facilities is notoriously difficult and low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> are commonplace. We conclude that low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> from Cu-treated wood should pose minimal environmental risk to biochar and ash destined for land application...|$|R

25|$|In {{the same}} second 2010 paper, the authors {{reported}} the isolation and sequencing of nuclear DNA from the Denisova finger bone. This specimen showed an unusual degree of DNA preservation and low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination.</b> They {{were able to}} achieve near-complete genomic sequencing, allowing a detailed comparison with Neanderthal and modern humans. From this analysis, they concluded, {{in spite of the}} apparent divergence of their mitochondrial sequence, that the Denisova population shared a common branch with Neanderthals from the lineage leading to modern African humans. The estimated average time of divergence between Denisovan and Neanderthal sequences is 640,000 years ago, and the time between both of these and the sequences of modern Africans is 804,000 years ago. They suggest that the divergence of the Denisova mtDNA results either from the persistence of a lineage purged from the other branches of humanity through genetic drift or else an introgression from an older hominin lineage.|$|E
