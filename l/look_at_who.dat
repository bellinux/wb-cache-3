Heather Phares wrote for AllMusic the song [...] "flirts with satire" [...] in its usage {{in the film}} because [...] " [...] threatened by these upstarts from other cliques invading their territory", in reference of Troy and Gabriella's performance. Phares considered its medoly [...] "so bright" [...] and Tisdale and Grabeel's vocals [...] "so relentlessly cheery, {{it sounds like a}} parody of a show tune". A writer for Talkin' Broadway echoed this view, describing the song as [...] "a clever parody of Broadway styles". Chris Willman, for Entertainment Weekly, compared the song with [...] "You Are The Music In Me", a song included in the sequel High School Musical 2. He wrote [...] "both an earnest Troy/Gabriella duet and an insincere (but more fun) showstopper for self-absorbed Sharpay". A reviewer for Common Sense Media highlighted the track. Commenting on the reprise, DVD Verdict said it [...] "is a little soft". The Christian Broadcasting Network offered a spiritual analysis of the song: [...] " [...] a great opportunity to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> God is and His character, including the fact that He's always with us." ...|$|E

60|$|The Honourable Captain Fitz-Whisker Fiercy, {{attended}} by his livery servant Do'em--a most respectable servant to <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> <b>who</b> has grown grey {{in the service}} of the captain's family--views, treats for, and ultimately obtains possession of, the unfurnished house, such a number, such a street. All the tradesmen in the neighbourhood are in agonies of competition for the captain's custom; the captain is a good-natured, kind-hearted, easy man, and, to avoid being the cause of disappointment to any, he most handsomely gives orders to all. Hampers of wine, baskets of provisions, cart-loads of furniture, boxes of jewellery, supplies of luxuries of the costliest description, flock to the house of the Honourable Captain Fitz-Whisker Fiercy, where they are received with the utmost readiness by the highly respectable Do'em; while the captain himself struts and swaggers about with that compound air of conscious superiority and general blood-thirstiness which a military captain should always, and does most times, wear, to the admiration and terror of plebeian men. But the tradesmen's backs are no sooner turned, than the captain, with all the eccentricity of a mighty mind, and assisted by the faithful Do'em, whose devoted fidelity is not the least touching part of his character, disposes of everything to great advantage; for, although the articles fetch small sums, still they are sold considerably above cost price, the cost to the captain having been nothing at all. After various manoeuvres, the imposture is discovered, Fitz-Fiercy and Do'em are recognized as confederates, and the police office to which they are both taken is thronged with their dupes.|$|E

Counter-narrative has been coined as the term regarding the stories and lived experiences of those not in the dominant narrative or not allowed {{to be a part of}} it. Counter-narrative are used as a way to share minorities stories excluded and combat the dominant narrative.|$|E

5000|$|The Bird in Hand Principle. Entrepreneurs {{start with}} what they have. They will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> they are, what they know and who they know. Their education, tastes and {{experience}} are examples of factors which are important in this stage. Besides these examples, {{this is also the}} stage where entrepreneurs look at their 3Fs, better known as friends, family and fools. From this point, they will look at their abilities. So an entrepreneur does not start with a given goal, but with the tools he or she has.|$|E
50|$|Charles Lindbergh was admired in Germany {{and allowed}} to see the buildup of the German air force, the Luftwaffe, in 1937. He was {{impressed}} with its strength and secretly reported his findings to the General Staff of the U.S. Army, warning that the U.S. had fallen behind and must urgently build up its aviation. He had feuded with the Roosevelt administration for years. His first radio speech was broadcast on September 15, 1939, over {{all three of the}} major radio networks. He urged listeners to look beyond the speeches and propaganda they were being fed and instead <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> was writing the speeches and reports, who owned the papers and who influenced the speakers.|$|E

A major consideration of the transfer was to enable the rationalisation of the two websites in order to provide one point of access to all UK legislation and in doing so reduce duplication in effort, increase efficiency (for example taking advantage of technological developments to streamline processes) and provide a more user friendly and accessible service across the board. Since December 2008 a considerable amount of work has taken place to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> the customers of the joint services are and look carefully at their requirements.|$|E
50|$|Well, it's just {{helped me}} as an individual. I {{understand}} life much better and when you understand life, you {{have an easier time}} understanding other aspects of it, skateboarding included. I don't claim to be perfect, far from it in fact, but I at least have the self awareness to know that and see upon where I can improve, see where I've been the architect of my doom. Scientology has enabled me to really <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> I am, what I am doing and put myself in check if it I get too crazed. The best way I can further help people understand it is by telling them to actually go and buy a book. It's what I did.|$|E

In 2015, his opening message of the newly published Academic Annual Report, he wrote that “The purpose of this report {{is to provide a}} picture of the institution today and to outline areas for progress tomorrow,” said University of Phoenix President Tim Slottow. “It describes our vision and approach to higher education. It outlines our challenges. It defines some of the characteristics of our students, our academic programs, and our faculty.

5000|$|Some {{scientists}} have voiced concerns that ACPeds mischaracterized or misused {{their work to}} advance its political agenda. Gary Remafedi, a pediatrician at the University of Minnesota, wrote ACPeds a public letter accusing them of fundamentally mischaracterizing his research in their publications to argue that schools should deny support to gay teenagers. Francis Collins, a geneticist {{and director of the}} U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), issued a statement through the NIH accusing the ACPeds of misleading children and parents on its Facts About Youth website. Warren Throckmorton, a therapist who specializes in sexual orientation issues, similarly stated that his research had been misused, saying of ACPeds: [...] "They say they're impartial and not motivated by political or religious concerns, but if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> they're affiliated with and how they're using the research, that's just obviously not true." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy speaking of Duncan's friendship with fellow teenager Ricky Campbell (Ashley Margolis), Lucy Allan said, [...] "Ahh, Duncan and Ricky! I love them. If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) and O.B. (Darren Jeffries) were when they were teenagers... They had an innocence and a naïvety to them that the show was lacking at the time. I actually wrote Max and O.B.'s storylines when they were youngsters and they spent about six months trying to get Chloe Bruce (Mikyla Dodd) into bed in a burger van! There's a joy in Ricky and Duncan that shouldn't be ignored. They're {{just trying to get}} laid - Duncan in particular, by whatever means necessary. Even if that means suggesting that his sexuality isn't what it is. And Ricky has a secret, so we'll meet elements of his family..." ...|$|E

[...] Producer - Steven Zanoski described his decision to bring the Jeffries back as; [...] "When we began to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> could return for the birthday week we debated long and hard on who would work.
