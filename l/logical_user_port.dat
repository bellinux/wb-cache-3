40|$|With the FUSE (Formal User {{interface}} Specification Environment) [...] System {{we present}} a methodology {{and a set of}} integrated tools for the automatic generation of graphical user interfaces. FUSE provides tool [...] based support for all phases (task-, user-, problem domain analysis, design of the <b>logical</b> <b>user</b> interface, design of user interface in a particular layout style) of the user interface development process. Based on a formal specification of dialogue [...] and layout guidelines, FUSE allows the automatic generation of user interfaces out of specifications of the task-, problem domain- and user-model. Moreover, the FUSE-System incorporates a component for the automatic generation of powerful help- and user guidance components. In this paper, we describe the FUSE-methodology by modeling user interfaces of an ISDN phone simulation. Furthermore, the two major components of FUSE (BOSS, PLUG [...] IN) are presented: The BOSS-System supports the design of the <b>logical</b> <b>user</b> interface and the formal specification of layout guidelines. PLUG-IN (PLan-based User Guidance for Intelligent Navigation) generates task- based help- and user guidance components...|$|R
40|$|While user {{interface}} design {{is generally considered}} important {{to the success of}} an information system, in both design and practice traditional methodologies it is often left to the last when {{most of the rest of}} the information system design has been finalized.

This paper presents how two tools, personas and use-cases, were used together to specify the <b>logical</b> <b>user</b> interaction requirements in the actual design of a small information system. While these tools would not be appropriate for large projects, they worked very well in this case and provided the client with a successfully implemented product...|$|R

It is worth noting that potential semantic conflicts from different stakeholders’ policies can also be reconciled [23]. In this paper, we assume there is no conflict among different policies.|$|R

5000|$|Some of {{the oldest}} {{adapters}} are the C64 <b>user</b> <b>port</b> to RS232 converters. Those were standardized and originally designed to connect printers and other 3rd party hardware, including modems. Later, those adapters have also been adopted for disk drive emulation and even Internet connections. However, the most widespread adapters were probably the different disk drive and printer plug C64 serial bus to Parallel port adapter that evolved for transferring data between disk drives and parallel port supplied computers. Because of hard timing requirements on the C64 side, those are unfortunately not applicable to laptops or multitasking operation systems. There also exist a more limited number of adapters for the C64 tape interface. While the data transfer over the <b>user</b> <b>port</b> is usually limited to 2.4 kbit/s, the C64 expansion port cartridge interface supports transfer rates of one to two magnitudes higher through proprietary protocols. There exist C64 expansion port adapters that support both hard disks, memory cards, USB-disks and Ethernet connections.|$|R
