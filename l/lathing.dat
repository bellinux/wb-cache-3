Within the superstructure were berthing spaces, cabins, galley, and other living spaces all constructed to emulate realistic living conditions on American battleships. As a result of the attention to detail, Illinois was a faithful reproduction of a coastal battleship.|$|E
25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as <b>lathing</b> for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E
500|$|As {{managing}} director of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, Romney became good friends with then-president George W. Mason. When Mason became chairman of the manufacturing firm Nash-Kelvinator in 1948, he invited Romney along [...] "to learn the business from the ground up" [...] as his roving assistant, and the new executive spent a year working {{in different parts of the}} company. At an inefficient Detroit refrigerator plant of the Kelvinator appliance division, Romney battled the Mechanics Educational Society of America union to institute a new industrial–labor relations program that forestalled the whole facility being shut down. He appealed to the workers by saying, [...] "I am no college man. I've laid floors, I've done <b>lathing.</b> I've thinned beets and shocked wheat." [...] As Mason's protégé, Romney assumed executive assignment for the development of the Rambler.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} on opening day, 4 April 1904, the {{architect}} F.W.J. Palmer detailed the building's construction. To prevent subsidence on this steep clay slope, {{so close to the}} sea: [...] " [...] had to be removed, [...] by [...] pitch pine piles ranging from [...] to [...] long were driven at stated distances down into the clay, on the north, east and west sides of the site, and connected together by means of [...] wrought iron tie rods passed through the piles, and interlaced one with the other, and connected together by means of [...] by [...] by [...] iron rings, through which the tie rods were passed, and nuts placed in position, thus enabling the tie rods to be adjusted and tightened to a nicety. The whole of the site was then covered with a solid mass of Portland cement concrete [...] thick, which when finished left the ironwork completely embedded in the same. Upon this foundation the superstructure was erected." [...] From a speech by F.W.J. Palmer at the opening of The Pavilion, 4 April 1904 Under all walls there was a damp course of fibrous asphalt. [...] The outer walls were of red and hard stock bricks with dressings of Victoria stone and facing bricks of Whiting's best reds The roof was made of rolled steel joists covered with sheets of expanded steel <b>lathing,</b> supplied and fixed by the New Expanded Metal Company, and the <b>lathing</b> for the ceilings was of sheets of this expanded metal <b>lathing</b> but of a smaller gauge. [...] of coke breezed concrete was laid over these sheets, then [...] of Val de Travers Mastic Asphalt was laid on top in two [...] layers.|$|E

60|$|Edwin Booth's {{performance}} of Hamlet had another effect. It brought {{to my mind}} the many stories of Boston which my father had so often related to his children. I recalled his enthusiastic accounts of the elder Booth and Edwin Forrest, and especially his descriptions of the wonderful scenic effects in Old Put and The Gold Seekers, wherein actors rode down mimic stone steps or debarked from theatrical ships which sailed into pictured wharves, and {{one day in the}} midst of my <b>lathing</b> and sawing, I evolved a daring plan--I decided to visit Boston and explore New England.|$|E
60|$|I did not plaster till it was {{freezing}} weather. I brought over some whiter and cleaner sand {{for this purpose}} from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat, a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary. My house had in the meanwhile been shingled {{down to the ground}} on every side. In <b>lathing</b> I was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly. I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine clothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to workmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up his cuffs, seized a plasterer's board, and having loaded his trowel without mishap, with a complacent look toward the <b>lathing</b> overhead, made a bold gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete discomfiture, received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom. I admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering, which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable. I was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth. I had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the Unio fluviatilis, which our river affords, {{for the sake of the}} experiment; so that I knew where my materials came from. I might have got good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself, if I had cared to do so.|$|E

It was now remarked, by all the educated and the thoughtful except the clergy that Sheol was to pay. This was most justly and comprehensively descriptive. The indignant British lion rose, with a roar that was heard across the Atlantic, and stood there on his little isle, gazing, red-eyed, out over the glooming seas, snow-flecked with driving spindrift, and <b>lathing</b> his tail--a most scary spectacle to see.|$|E

5000|$|Classics Custom Dark - These B10 cymbals result {{darker and}} more complex in tone {{compared}} to the regular Classics Customs due to their finishing, deep hammering and additional <b>lathing.</b> The peculiar finish gives this cymbal a unique dark look.|$|E
5000|$|The cymbals were {{redesigned}} {{and sold}} as the K Custom Dry Complex II Rides since 2008 in sizes of 20, 22 and 24-inch. These custom ride cymbals feature a wider bell {{with a much}} lower profile to promote more control while offering a smooth array of rich overtones. Weight specifications are slightly heavier (medium-thin) than {{the first generation of}} Complex Rides, to make the cymbals more versatile, providing ride patterns that can be heard clearly from within an airy wash of overtones.All the sizes continue to display the unique high profile of their predecessors with the help of four extensive hammering processes that facilitate an exceptional expression of sound. Each cymbal employs traditional <b>lathing</b> with no tonal grooves on top, and a scratch <b>lathing</b> method underneath except at the outer edge to assist with a loose but easily contained set of overtones. Unlike the 24 and 22-inch models, the 20-inch Ride features full scratch <b>lathing</b> on the bottom. Bill commented: [...] "These new cymbals are knocking me out! All three sizes offer multiple sound colors...from ride to crash, and many subtle types of shading in between. They have much of the trashy, wild side of the original Dry Complex line, but with a warmer and darker expression of sound, a lower pitch, heavier weight, and easier playability." ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "New Dimension" [...] were {{introduced}} in 1985, with different hammering patterns and <b>lathing.</b> Contrary to the old heavy and random hammering pattern in the Dark models, the hammering becomes more evenly spaced, except in the China, where the hammering turned very heavy and random, while in the former Dark China models the hammering was very light and regularly spread all over the cymbal.|$|E
5000|$|This <b>lathing</b> step could {{decrease}} {{the weight of}} the cymbal by two-thirds or more, and resulted in further uneven hardening which produces much of the tone of a traditionally made cymbal. This effect was deliberately enhanced by use of a coarse lathe tool, and sometimes by a very limited final polishing, leaving the lathe tool marks as [...] "tone grooves". Traditional cymbals are lathed over the entire surface top and bottom.|$|E
