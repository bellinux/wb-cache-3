40|$|Characterizing {{the waste}} in {{underground}} storage tanks at the Hanford Site {{is accomplished by}} obtaining a representative core sample for analysis. Core sampling {{is one of the}} numerous techniques that have been developed for use given the environmental and field conditions at the Hanford Site. Core sampling is currently accomplished using either Push Mode Core Sample Truck No. 1 or; Rotary Mode Core Sample Trucks No. 2, 3 or 4. Past analysis (WHC 1994) has indicated that the Core Sample Truck (CST) leveling jacks are structurally inadequate when lateral loads are applied. WHC 1994 identifies many areas where failure could occur. All these failures are based on exceeding the allowable stresses listed in the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) code. The mode of failure is for the outrigger attachments to the truck frame to fail resulting in dropping of the CST and possible overturning (Ref. Ziada and Hundal, 1996). Out of level deployment of the truck can exceed the code allowable stresses in the structure. Calculations have been performed to establish limits for maintaining the truck level when lifting. The calculations and the associated limits are included in appendix A. The need for future operations of the CSTS is limited. Sampling is expected to be complete in FY- 2001. Since there is limited time at risk for continued use of the CSTS with the <b>leveling</b> <b>controls</b> without correcting the structural problems, there are several design changes that could give incremental improvements to the operational safety of the CSTS with limited impact on available operating time.

30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is that a novel control approach is proposed by combining the merits of SMC and FLC to address the vehicle height and <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> problem of a full-car EAS system. The FSMC is designed by defining a switching sliding surface for the system, whose slope is modified by a FLC system. On this basis, the switching surface is also used as an input to FLC, thus the continuous term of SMC can be computed by using equivalent method. One advantage of the proposed approach is that the chattering control phenomenon is attenuated. Another advantage of the method is that the system controller has higher adaptive ability for the external disturbances. As far as we know, this approach is efficiently applied for the vehicle height and <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> problem of an EAS system for the first time.|$|E

30|$|The {{difficulties}} in controlling the vehicle height and leveling of an EAS system arise from several aspects. In general, the controller needs {{to adjust the}} air mass flow rates flowing into or flowing out of the four air springs synchronously with several on-off solenoid valves. Furthermore, the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the air spring will also give some troubles to the derivation of the system control law. In particular, the vehicle height and <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> problem is further complicated by the real-time variations of the payloads and the system parameters [12]. In that case, only robust control methods could be effective. In Ref. [13], Kim and Lee proposed a sliding mode control (SMC) strategy for solving the height and <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> problem of a closed-loop EAS system. Although the control method is robust and the system performance is improved, the controller may be sensitive to external disturbances due to the fixed control parameters. Xu et al. [14] proposed a variable structure vehicle height control method for single-wheel air suspension system, and on this basis, by calculating the deviations of the pitch and roll angles of the vehicle body, a leveling controller is also designed based on the fuzzy logic control (FLC) algorithm. However, due to the separated design of the vehicle height and leveling controller, the overall control system design procedure is lack of systematic character and fault tolerance.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Automatic {{guidance}} of tractors in the mechanized farming practice {{has taken the}} attention of agricultural engineers {{in the last two}} decades. For this to be truly practical on the farm, it should be economical, simple to operate and entirely contained on the vehicle. Different types of steering systems such as leader- cable, laser- controlled, radio- operated and contactor- type have been developed for automatic guidance. The automatic leveling system is used on hillside machines to keep the separator level when operating on hillsides. This system has three parts: fluid level system, electrical system and hydraulic system. The fluid level system consists of fluid reservoir and a <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> switch box. The fluid level system actuates the electrical system of the leveling unit. The electrical system which actuated by the fluid system consist of four micro switches in the <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> switch box, two micro switches in the limit control box, a solenoid in the hydraulic control level, manual <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> switch, and a leveling limit warning light. The hydraulic system maintains the level of the separator when the machine is operating on a hillside. The present study was aimed to develop a reliable, versatile and easy to maintain system to fit our economy and low technology level of farmers for hillside- range development or fallow farming. The automatic guidance system has been implemented successfully on agricultural vehicles on the basis of three components, i. e. sensors, processors and actuator elements. The study site (N, latitude; E, longitude; and 1810 m above sea level) was located at the Agricultural Research Center, Shiraz University, 15 km northwest of Shiraz, Fars Province, Iran. MF- 399 agricultural tractor manufactured by ITMCO, Tabriz, Iran was used for doing the experiments. Materials and Methods:The Level Sensing System: The biaxial tilt industrial sensor (ZCT 245 AL- China) with digital output can be connected to the computer and received angular position in x and y coordinates. An assumed degree could be considered as basis degree and the measured frequency was adjustable. The tilt sensor located along the axial length of tractor and leads the angles which are created by longitudinal axle transverse axle of the tractor in related to horizontal level. It was used for contour lines detecting. The potentiometer located on the steering wheel of the tractor and pressure sensor which used with goniometer sensor used keeping uniformly of leveling points in tractor motion. The pressure sensor (SN-SCP 1000 - South Korea) which is used in leveling system can detect the elevation changes. In this way, by defining a limitation of altitude for system, it would be able to stop steering turning motor which was coupled to tractor steering rod automatically. By resetting, the tractor could be able to live in a new level position. To avoid excessive left and right steering wheels deviation and interfering with other lines of travel, potentiometer was used. The deviation degree for steering rod from center to left or right was selected 120 degrees. Accordingly, the wheels {{would not be able to}} move more than 10 degrees to each direction. The Processing System: The electrical circuit graphically designed and simulated by software (Altium Designer, 2009) and installed on the tractor. The components of this circuit are as follows: Electrical board, two relays which control the electrical pathway in both directions, a battery with 12 volts of electric potential as electrical power supply, ATmeGA 32 microcontroller which was made by Atmel company as main core for information processing, RS 232 protocol was used for making correlation between serial port (COM) and the microcontroller and two capacitors for reducing noises. The Actuator System: The output signals from the a processing system, were lead in the actuator system would order and indicative of left- turn or right- turn command, were introduced to actuator- units include an electric- gearbox motor that stimulate the steering wheel shaft of the tractor by chain and sprocket and conduct the tractor in leveling traces at the desired speed.

This final article addresses some specific T&M requirements and possible solutions. T&M Synthesizer Considerations Broadband operation, very fine frequency resolution, low spurious and low phase noise are the key specifications for T&M applications. More recently a lot of interest has been focused on fast frequency switching. This has been motivated by a need for increased data throughput of ATE systems, and the frequency agility demands of wide bandwidth receivers and transmitters [2, 3]. Besides the spectral purity and switching characteristics, the T&M applications require extended functionality that include output power <b>leveling</b> and <b>control,</b> frequency and power sweep, modulation, etc. These options can be realized by adding additional separate modules or can be incorporated into the synthesizer core module.

Test and measurement applications are Figure 49 · Adding modulation capabilities. usually associated with big bench-top instruments, which can be found in every engineering lab.

40|$|Proton Exchange Membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most attractive candidates for transportation applications due to its inherently high efficiency and high power density. However, the fuel cell system efficiency can suffer because of the need for forced air supply and water-cooling systems. Hence the operating strategy of the fuel cell system can have a significant impact on the fuel cell system efficiency and thus vehicle fuel economy. The key issues are how the fuel cell back pressure and air flow through the fuel cell are controlled. One approach is fixed back pressure control. The other is optimum varying back pressure control. In both cases, the air flow stoichiometry is optimized. In this paper, a dynamic forward-looking vehicle model with a dynamic fuel cell system model is employed. The effects of different fuel cell system operation modes and different power split strategies on fuel economy of fuel cell hybrid vehicles are simulated. The simulation results of light duty vehicles on various driving cycles indicate a significant improvement in fuel economy for optimum varying back pressure operation compared to high fixed back pressure operation. For various fuel cell system operation modes, the load <b>leveling</b> <b>control</b> can significantly improve fuel economy on some aggressive driving cycles such as US 06.

30|$|The {{accurate}} {{control for}} the vehicle height and leveling adjustment system of an electronic air suspension (EAS) still is a challenging problem {{that has not been}} effectively solved in prior researches. This paper proposes a new adaptive controller to control the vehicle height and to adjust the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body (<b>leveling</b> <b>control)</b> during the vehicle height adjustment procedures by an EAS system. A nonlinear mechanism model of the full-car vehicle height adjustment system is established to reflect the system dynamic behaviors and to derive the system optimal control law. To deal with the nonlinear characters in the vehicle height and leveling adjustment processes, the nonlinear system model is globally linearized through the state feedback method. On this basis, a fuzzy sliding mode controller (FSMC) is designed to improve the control accuracy of the vehicle height adjustment and to reduce the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method more accurately, the full-car EAS system model programmed using AMESim is also given. Then, the co-simulation study of the FSMC performance can be conducted. Finally, actual vehicle tests are performed with a city bus, and the test results illustrate that the vehicle height adjustment performance is effectively guaranteed by the FSMC, and the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body during the vehicle height adjustment procedures are also reduced significantly. This research proposes an effective control methodology for the vehicle height and leveling adjustment system of an EAS, which provides a favorable control performance for the system.|$|E
30|$|The {{leveling}} {{process has}} received considerable {{attention in the}} literature, although not {{in the context of}} the industrial paints used in the automotive industry. In 1961, Orchard [1] was the first to note that the <b>leveling</b> dynamics is <b>controlled</b> by an interplay between surface tension, with capillary forces tending to reduce surface irregularities, and the fluid viscosity limiting the flow induced by that leveling. Orchard’s model is mainly based on two assumptions: the paint exhibits a Newtonian behavior and evaporation effects are negligible. To take into account the effects of evaporation, Overdiep [2] considered a fluid made of a resin and a solvent, where only the solvent can evaporate, demonstrating the potential importance of the surface tension spatial variations. Surface tension indeed depends on the paint composition, in particular on the respective proportions of resin and solvent. In the presence of evaporation, thinner regions tend to dry faster, and therefore to have lower solvent concentrations, which causes surface tension gradients, a physical phenomenon known as Marangoni effect, hence a shearing effect at the film surface, understood as the main physical effect involved in the leveling of the paint film by Overdiep. This approach was taken up and developed in several subsequent articles. Wilson [3] and later Howison et al. [4] analyzed and generalized Overdiep’s model, performing numerical simulations that showed good agreement with experimental data collected for simple deposit geometries.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper aims {{to present}} a case study and later {{simulation}} analysis on a kanban system that incorporating milk-run operation to draw in raw material to the process. Design/methodology/approach: Data collection at the case study company for ten weeks followed by a process study called value stream mapping. The proposed kanban model is simulated to test its various performances including total output, average flow time, average work-in-process, SME utilization, and average waiting time. Response surface methodology is adopted to generate suitable representative regression models. Findings: For all performance measures, simulation {{results showed that the}} proposed system consistently outperforms the push system currently practiced. Second, the system indicates the advantages of leveling, particularly in the event of machine failure and blockage. Third, operator in the proposed kanban system has a lower utilization, even with the additional material handling task. Research limitations/implications: This study only begins to reveal the implication of <b>leveling</b> for production <b>control</b> on multi-machine scenario. The simulation of the system is solely based only the case study. The control parameters critical to the case study, were naturally used. The furtherance of the research should include generalizing the system and devising the respective methodology to facilitate wider applications. Practical implications: Originality/value: The kanban system is proposed in the light of conflicting interests in handling the surface mounting and the related upstream processes. Such aspect is common to electronics assembly industry. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An {{electric}} propulsion thrust stand capable of supporting testing of thrusters having a total mass {{of up to}} 125 kg and producing thrust levels between 100 microN to 1 N has been developed and tested. The design features a conventional hanging pendulum arm attached to a balance mechanism that converts horizontal deflections produced by the operating thruster into amplified vertical motion of a secondary arm. The level of amplification is changed through adjustment of the location {{of one of the}} pivot points linking the system. Response of the system depends on the relative magnitudes of the restoring moments applied by the displaced thruster mass and the twisting torsional pivots connecting the members of the balance mechanism. Displacement is measured using a non-contact, optical linear gap displacement transducer and balance oscillatory motion is attenuated using a passive, eddy-current damper. The thrust stand employs an automated <b>leveling</b> and thermal <b>control</b> system. Pools of liquid gallium are used to deliver power to the thruster without using solid wire connections, which can exert undesirable time-varying forces on the balance. These systems serve to eliminate sources of zero-drift that can occur as the stand thermally or mechanically shifts during the course of an experiment. An in-situ calibration rig allows for steady-state calibration before, during and after thruster operation. Thrust measurements were carried out on a cylindrical Hall thruster that produces mN-level thrust. The measurements were very repeatable, producing results that compare favorably with previously published performance data, but with considerably smaller uncertainty...|$|R
