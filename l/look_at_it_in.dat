25|$|The fairest {{solution}} would be to replay the game {{but it is not}} in my control...Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa...I have said at the time and I will say again that 'yes' I handled the ball. I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of ?, Minister of Culture and Tourism Jero Wacik expressed that the film would be best titled Bhinneka Tunggal Ika ("Unity in Diversity", the Indonesian national motto), and that its depiction of inter-ethnic and interfaith tolerance reflected Indonesia's [...] "national character". Yenny Wahid, a religious activist and daughter of former president and noted pluralist Abdurrahman Wahid, said that ? had [...] "succeeded in conveying the ideas of pluralism in Indonesia", and that critics should not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> fragments. Although initially tweeting that the protests were free promotion, Bramantyo later entered discussions with the MUI and agreed to cut some scenes to avoid protests. In an October 2011 interview, {{he said he was}} [...] "bewildered" [...] that the film was poorly received by Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|The bridge {{has become}} a symbol of the {{transition}} from Devon to Cornwall. In the Great Western Railway's The Cornish Riviera travel guide, SPB Mais regarded it as an almost magic means of transporting travellers from a county, which, if richer than others, is yet unmistakingly an English county, to a Duchy which is in every respect un-English. You shut your eyes going over the Saltash Bridge only to open them again on a foreign scene. However, Cornish people <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the other way; in the song [...] "Cousin Jack", English folk duo Show of Hands sing I dream of a bridge on the Tamar, It opens us up to the East.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 April, the FA handed Suárez a 10-match ban, after a three-man {{independent}} committee {{agreed that}} the standard three match ban was insufficient. In their written reasons, the FA pointed to Suárez's lackadaisical attitude to the whole incident, citing that he [...] "had not fully appreciated the gravity and seriousness of this truly exceptional incident". They also argued that [...] "these unsavoury pictures would have given a bad image of English football domestically and across the world alike", {{and that it would}} act as a deterrent to further behaviour. Suárez ruled out an appeal, citing recognition of his actions being unacceptable and that it would give [...] "the wrong impression" [...] if he did so. Rodgers launched a strong defence of his player stating that [...] "when you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the cold light of day then it was violent conduct... he made a mistake and he's got a sanction which I don't believe fits with what he did". Rodgers also launched a broadside on the FA and their handling of the case, claiming [...] "prejudices" [...] against the FA led to the lengthy ban, and also pointed out alleged inconsistencies in the prior punishment of players who have bitten another human being, giving the lack of punishment Jermain Defoe received for biting Javier Mascherano in 2006 as an example. After the ban was imposed, Ivanović finally accepted Suárez's apology. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reminded of Eric Cantona's suspension in 1995 for kicking a racist Crystal Palace spectator, and showed empathy toward the situation, saying [...] "I think back to Cantona and I have to say that a nine-month ban doesn't equate to a 10-match, does it? I can understand how Liverpool are aggrieved at it, I must say that".|$|E
