In this work, niosomes made up of surfactants (Tween 85 and Span 20) and cholesterol at various concentrations were prepared to investigate the potential application of niosomes for the delivery of ammonium glycyrrhizinate (AG), useful for the treatment of various inflammatory based diseases. Vesicles were characterized evaluating dimensions, ζ potential, anisotropy, drug entrapment efficiency, stability, cytotoxicity evaluation and skin tolerability. Release profiles of ammonium glycyrrhizinate/niosomes were evaluated in vitro using cellulose membranes. The best formulation was used to evaluate the in vitro/in vivo efficacy of the ammonium glycyrrhizinate/niosomes in murine and human models of inflammation. The AG-loaded non-ionic surfactant vesicles showed no toxicity, good skin tolerability and were able to improve the drug anti-inflammatory activity in mice.

40|$|Background: <b>Liquorice</b> <b>extracts</b> {{demonstrate}} therapeutic efficacy {{in treating}} dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis {{when compared with}} corticosteroids. In this work, nonionic surfactant vesicles (niosomes, NSVs) containing polysorbate 20 (Tween 20), cholesterol, and cholesteryl hemisuccinate at different molar concentrations were used to prepare monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (AG) -loaded NSVs. The anti-inflammatory properties of AG-loaded NSVs were investigated in murine models. Methods: The physicochemical properties of the NSVs were characterized using dynamic light scattering. The fluidity of the lipid bilayer was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of diphenylhexatriene. The drug entrapment efficiency of AG was assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The physicochemical stability of the NSVs was evaluated {{as a function of}} time using dynamic light scattering combined with Turbiscan Lab(R) Expert analysis. Serum stability was determined by incubating the NSVs with 10 % v/v fetal bovine serum. The cytotoxic effects of the NSVs were investigated in human dermal fibroblasts using the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay (for cell mortality) and an MTT assay (for cell viability). Release profiles for the AG-loaded NSVs were studied in vitro using cellulose membranes. NSVs showing the most desirable physicochemical properties were selected to test for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in murine models. The anti-inflammatory activity of the NSVs was investigated by measuring edema and nociception in mice stimulated with chemical agents. Results: NSVs showed favorable physicochemical properties for in vitro and in vivo administration. In addition, they demonstrated long-term stability based on Turbiscan Lab Expert analysis. The membrane fluidity of the NSVs was not affected by self-assembling of the surfactants into colloidal structures. Fluorescence anisotropy was found to be independent of the molar ratios of cholesteryl hemisuccinate and/or cholesterol during preparation of the NSVs. The anti-inflammatory AG drug showed no effect on the stability of the NSVs. In vivo experiments demonstrated that AG-loaded NSVs decreased edema and nociceptive responses when compared with AG alone and empty NSVs. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that pH sensitive and neutral NSVs show no statistical significant difference. Conclusion: NSVs were nontoxic and showed features favorable for potential administration in vivo. In addition, neutral NSVs showed signs of increased anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive responses when compared with AG...|$|R

The test groups were pre-treated for 3 h with various concentrations of LPE, 3 days before CCl 4 exposure. The control and sham groups received normal saline before and after CCl 4 exposure. To induce hepatotoxicity, animals in the sham and test groups were exposed against 100 µl L- 1 CCl 4 for 45 min. The fish in all groups 1 h after CCl 4 exposure were anesthetized and the blood samples were collected. Immediately the liver specimens were dissected out and were stored in 10 % formalin for further pathological studies. Determination of serum level of ALP and SGOT revealed that acute form of CCl 4 exposure elevated significantly (P < 0. 05) the serum level of either tested hepatic marker enzymes.

40|$|The major {{component}} of <b>liquorice</b> root <b>extract,</b> glycyrrhizinate (GZ), has been formulated as an injection {{for the treatment of}} hepatitis. If given orally, GZ has poor bioavailability and is catalysed to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) by intestinal bacteria. GA is subsequently responsible for significant side effects. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between GZ and GA absorption and bioavailability. GZ and GA absorption were investigated using the in situ single pass isolated perfused intestine (IPI). Hepatic disposition was investigated using isolated perfused liver (IPL) and in vivo biliary excretion models. The apparent permeability and absorption rate constants in the IPI for GZ were 0. 36 ± 0. 31 cm/ min and 0. 35 ± 0. 33 min- 1, while those for GA were 5. 73 ± 0. 11 cm/min and 1. 53 ± 0. 05 min - 1, re spectively. The hepatic extraction ratios of unbound GZ and GA in the IPL were 0. 22 ± 0. 01 and 0. 44 ± 0. 15, respectively. Seven hours after intraportal venous injection in vivo, the cumulative biliary excretion ratio for GZ was 96 %. There was negligible biliary excretion of unchanged GA during the same period. It was apparent in all models used that in the absence of intestinal bacteria GZ was not metabolised to GA, or vice versa. Hence, GZ can be absorbed unchanged from the intestine provided it has sufficient time and is protected from intestinal bacteria. This opens up the possibility that the use of pharmaceutical carrier systems or similar formulation approaches may allow effective oral administration of therapeutic levels of GZ without the side effects associated with GA. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG...|$|R

The major aim of the present research was in vitro assessment of possible anti-herpetic activity of glycyrrhiza gla-bra (<b>liquorices</b> root) methanolic <b>extract</b> in more details by performing Tissue Culture Infec-tive Dose fifty percent (TCID 50) method. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study Vero cells were incubated with different con-centrations of methanolic extracts of glycyrrhiza glabra. Neutral red assay was performed in order to consider the appropriate concentration of the extract. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with glycyrrhiza glabra extract before viral infection, incubation of HSV- 1 with glycyrrhiza glabra extract and treatment of vero cells with extract 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after viral in-fection, were exerted. TCID 50 was performed {{in order to assess}} the antiviral activity of the extract. The results were analyzed after performing the experiments at least three times. Results: Pre-treatment of Vero cells with methanolic extract for two hours and incubation of virus with extract for one and two hours prior to viral infection resulted in remarkable drop in TCID 50 amount by significant difference (P < 0. 001). Treatment of Vero cells with extract 1, 8 and 12 hours post-infection demonstrated significant changes in TCID 50. We observed significant fluctuations and different efficacy of the extract between different incubation time at 1 h & 4 h, 1 h & 24 h, 4 h & 8 h, 4 h & 12 h, 8 h & 24 h, 12 h & 24 h.

40|$|SUMMARY Carbenoxolone (Biogastrone, Berk) {{has been}} shown to reduce the peptic {{activity}} and total acidity of gastric juice obtained from anaesthetized pylorus-ligated rats without affecting significantly the volume of gastric juice secreted or the K+ concentration. Glycyr-rhetinic acid was less potent in reducing peptic activity and caused no reduction in total acidity. Antipeptic activity of carbenoxolone has also been demonstrated in vitro using the pepsin plate technique and the haemoglobin pepsin assay. It is suggested that these actions of carbenoxolone may contribute to the increased rate of healing of peptic ulcer in patients treated with the drug. <b>Liquorice</b> <b>extract</b> has been used in the treatment of peptic ulcers for centuries without any parti-cular rationale. Its activity is believed {{to be associated with the}} glycoside, glycyrrhizinic acid, hydrolysis of which yields glycyrrhetinic acid (1) [3,hydroxy- 1 1 -oxo- 18 / 8 olean- 12 -en- 30 -oic acid]. Carbenoxolone sodium (2) is the disodium salt of glycyrrhetinic acid hemisuccinate, and 'Present address: Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Dundee, DDI 4 HN is marketed as Biogastrone (Berk). It is claimed to be of value in the treatment of gastric ulcer but is of little value in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.

40|$|Melasma is {{a common}} {{acquired}} cutaneous hyperpigmentation involving sunexposed areas of face predominantly in women: several treatment modalities including topical depigmenting agents are being used in management of this condition with varying results. Hydroquinon is the gold standard in treatment of melasma. <b>Liquorice</b> <b>extract</b> contains natural ingredients such as glabridin and Liquiritin which collectively have multiple effects on skin including skin lightening effect. This {{study was conducted to}} compare the clinical efficacy of 4 % Hydroquinon and 4 % Licorice extract creams in the treatment of melasma. Material and methods: This clinical trial study was carried out on 38 women who had melasma with bilateral symmetrical hyperpigmentation of malar areas. The hydroquinone and licorice extract creams were applied to the opposite sides of the face once a day at night for 8 weeks. Mmasi scores were separately measured for each side of the face at the base line and every 2 weeks thereafter. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software and Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results: 27 of the patients used the drugs regularly {{until the end of the}} study. The mmasi score decreased from 10. 59 ± 6. 10 to 2. 59 ± 2. 17 in the treatment (licorice) group and from 0. 81 ± 6. 34 to 1. 63 ± 1. 55 in the control (hydroquinone) group after 8 wks. The data showed that a significant decrease in mmasi occurred on the side treated with liquorice after the 8 weeks (P< 0. 001), while the decrease in mmasi was significantly higher on the side treated with hydroquinone(P= 0. 002). Conclusion: Although a significant decrease in mmasi from the baseline occurred on the side treated with 4 % liqurice extract cream at the end of the study (P< 0. 001), 4 % hydroquinone cream was significantly more effective in this respect than 4 % licorice cream (P= 0. 002) ...|$|E
40|$|Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has {{diverse in}} vitro effects as an {{inhibitor}} of 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 HSD), 5 alpha reductase and hormone receptor binding. However, in vivo GA studies have focussed on the hypertensive effects {{associated with the}} syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME) in which 11 HSD inhibition allows glucocorticoid hormones to bind inappropriately to MR and subsequent decreased aldosterone synthesis. Here we consider whether GA’s other in vitro effects are reflected in altered steroid hormone profiles in vivo. The effect of liquorice (containing GA) has been assessed by measuring steroid hormone levels in healthy individuals. Ten men and 10 women (18 – 30 years) were given 100 g liquorice sweets (3 % <b>liquorice</b> <b>extract)</b> or non-liquorice containing confectionary for 7 days in a crossover study. Saliva was collected 30 min after waking, at 1100 – 1300 h and at 1800 – 2100 h for cortisol, cortisone, aldosterone (Aldo), deoxycorticosterone (DOC), DHEA and testosterone measurements by in-house, sensitive and specific ELISA methods. Systolic blood pressure measured {{at the end of}} the two periods of treatment showed non-significant increases (P= 0. 127) in response to liquorice consumption. Cortisol was significantly higher (P= 0. 003) and cortisone and aldo were reduced by liquorice (P< 0. 001) consistent with the SAME. DHEA, testosterone and DOC were increased (P< 0. 001) possibly because of reduced hepatic clearance. However, these steroids are not 11 HSD type 2 substrates indicating liquorice might also have inhibited hepatic 5 alpha reductase. Recent studies also implicate the bi-directional 11 HSD type 1 enzyme in DHEA metabolism. GA is equipotent as an inhibitor of 11 HSD type 1 and type 2 oxidase activity. 7 -Hydroxy-DHEA, a major metabolite of DHEA is inter-converted with 7 -keto-DHEA by 11 HSD type 1 and could, therefore, secondarily interfere with DHEA metabolism. We conclude that in addition to cortisol, other biologically active steroid hormones are affected by liquorice. Increased salivary levels of DHEA and testosterone suggest that liquorice modulates their bioavailability...|$|E
