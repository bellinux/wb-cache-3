40|$|In {{this study}} the {{petrographic}} analysis results of Ptolemais and Servia Neogene <b>lignites,</b> Northern Greece, are presented. The geological position, lithotype, and maceral content of these <b>lignites,</b> {{as well as}} some chemical parameters and changes in the reflection of different macerals, are described. The interdependence between maceral content and environmental conditions in the process of peat formation is traced. Petrographic analysis shows that coals are represented by different kinds of <b>lignites</b> from dark brown to black, sem ibright <b>lignites,</b> consisting mainly of the coal lithotype humoclarain, rare strips and bands of bright humovitrain, and dull humodurain. The sample from the Lava deposit in the Serv ia Basin is composed of grayish to black, dark humoclarain. The predom inance of humodetrinite macerals () densinite and attrinite and the low contents of inertinite show that the <b>lignites</b> in the Ptolemais and Serv ia Basins are formed in limno-telmatic conditions and in different m ire types, being sim ilar to herbaceous swamp, fen, or marsh...|$|R

5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and <b>lignite</b> combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, <b>lignite</b> 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E

5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as <b>lignite,</b> and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).|$|E
5|$|While it is {{produced}} mainly from sphalerite, {{it is also}} found in silver, lead, and copper ores. Another source of germanium is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium. Russia and China used this as a source for germanium. Russia's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island, and northeast of Vladivostok. The deposits in China are located mainly in the <b>lignite</b> mines near Lincang, Yunnan; coal is also mined near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{negative}} correlation between depth and the sulphur content and 634 S ratio in organic matter is used to study diagenesis in the freshwater <b>lignites</b> of the Hula Basin, The samples were taken along a 2450 m thick sequence ranging from Miocene to Recent. A between six and ninefold enrichment in organic sulphur in these <b>lignites</b> compared to that in their living precursors suggests diagenetic control. Since all the water sources of the basin are low in sulphate, oxidation of organic matter must be the main source for this secondary enrichment. The released sulphur reacts with mark interlayered with the <b>lignites,</b> to form gypsum and is taken into the remaining organic matter, probably as ester sulphate. Heavy sulphur isotope composition of the plant material, the gypsum, the humic acids of the <b>lignites</b> at relatively shallow depths and the water sources feeding the basin support this supposition. Negative 634 S in the 1 owe:most samples indicate, on the other hand, that further enrichment in sulphur through bacterial sulphate reduction occurs also. The parallel trend of decrease in sulphur content and 634 S is explained by the breakdown of ester sulphate-containing compounds with increased maturation and the sulphur derived through bacterial reduction of the ester sulphates and the gypsum is taken into the organic matter, The transformation of humic acids into kerogens {{at the very beginning}} of the maturation stage (u...|$|R

25|$|Plants {{designed}} for <b>lignite</b> (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. <b>Lignite</b> is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{foundation}} of East Germany in 1949 Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the Socialist government of East Germany, doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several Bezirke or districts. (See Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic). Most of Brandenburg lay within the Bezirke of Cottbus, Frankfurt, or Potsdam, but parts of the former province passed to the Schwerin, Neubrandenburg and Magdeburg districts (town Havelberg). East Germany relied heavily on <b>lignite</b> (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and <b>lignite</b> strip mines marred areas of southeastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{comes in}} four main types or ranks: <b>lignite</b> or brown coal, {{bituminous}} coal or black coal, anthracite and graphite.
