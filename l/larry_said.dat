500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{lived on}} East 26th Street in Midwood, Brooklyn. He {{attended}} elementary school at P.S. 197 in Brooklyn, where {{he won a}} borough championship on the basketball team. He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons, and celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1954. Sanders's older brother, <b>Larry,</b> <b>said</b> that during their childhood, the family never lacked for food or clothing, but major purchases, [...] "like curtains or a rug," [...] were difficult to afford.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lettering}} of {{the middle}} two lines was in reverse {{so that it could}} be read in the mirror. [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> that it was his way to remind himself not to judge others and that revenge was not his job. [...] When asked about its meaning during the Motorcycle Mania II program in 2001, Larry explained with a big grin on his face, “...it’s my philosophy. Go through life see what’s up. Try not to kill nobody!” [...] Larry often expressed his belief that life is [...] "a really precious, short gift." ...|$|E
50|$|Marlins {{general manager}} <b>Larry</b> Beinfest <b>said</b> that the team's goal {{from the start}} of the season was to compete in the playoffs.|$|R
50|$|On July 10, 2007, Winona State's Athletic Director <b>Larry</b> Holstad <b>said</b> {{that due}} to Alltel Wireless' {{purchase}} of Midwest Wireless, the stadium would be renamed.|$|R
50|$|Hayden {{sometimes}} accompanies {{his father}} when filming TV shows, including America's Most Wanted. On {{the show of}} July 27, 2006 of Larry King Live, <b>Larry</b> King <b>said</b> that Hayden resembled Adam.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Indian Larry {{was living}} in the East Village with Bambi, working at his shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and was {{appearing}} at bike shows and rallies around the United States. [...] He was regularly being recognized and approached by fans. When interviewed for the Discovery Channel in July 2004, <b>Larry</b> <b>said,</b> “I just feel like that I’m maybe slightly starting to fit in somewhere and slightly starting to be accepted.” [...] His friend Timothy White said: [...] "It was finally making sense to him – [...] all his turmoil, all his craziness...everything was just all coming together into this one moment of recognition that he was coming to..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indian Larry {{built the}} Chain of Mystery bike during this final challenge. [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> that the {{original}} idea for the bike's frame came {{to him in a}} flash of inspiration. [...] He explained that his most creative ideas for a new build would flash across his mind {{in the form of an}} image, and then it would be his job to relentlessly chase that vision during a build until the image materialized in the finished product. [...] Chain of Mystery utilized a frame concept that had never been done before. Using a jig as a guide, the heavy links of a chain, normally used for towing heavy vehicles, were welded together until the frame took shape (the shop's Eddie Mcgarry was the project welder). Since the frame is essentially the spine of the bike, any weaknesses in the welds could prove fatal, especially considering that Larry really pushed his bikes to perform when riding them. [...] As it turned out, the bike held up, and Larry rode the chopper to what would be his final bike show.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's made in Germany," [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said.</b> After {{a moment}} he added, [...] "Carl got it for me wholesale. He knows some guy in the clock business. Otherwise I wouldn't have--" [...] He stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what Aleck Pop calls 'em, <b>Larry.</b> He <b>said</b> it was {{a wonder}} the 'cannonballs' hadn't eaten us up," [...] and then came another laugh, during which Hans was as mute as ever.|$|R
5000|$|Larry Flick, Host of Out Q In the Morning with <b>Larry</b> Flick <b>said,</b> [...] "A slammin' {{blend of}} banging beats and Sandra's astute view of pop culture. Equally nutritious {{to the brain}} and booty." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Orman donated {{money to}} the Democratic Party [...] and in an {{interview}} with <b>Larry</b> King <b>said</b> she favors the policies of the Democratic Party and Barack Obama, especially regarding people in same-sex relationships.|$|R
60|$|The {{water was}} {{coming into the}} opening from the little stream overhead, and Dick readily {{procured}} a hatful of the fluid and the ankle was bathed with this. After this it was bound up, and <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> it felt somewhat better.|$|E
6000|$|Crows were {{excluded}} from their bill of fare, because the whole party had an unconquerable antipathy to them; and <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> he had [...] "aiten many pies in his lifetime, but he had niver aiten magpies, and he'd be shot av he wos goin' to begin now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{vote that}} Sam makes a clean breast of it," [...] said Frank, and <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> the same. This {{was just before}} dinner, and {{immediately}} after the midday meal had been finished the youngest Rover {{went up to the}} master of the Hall and touched him on the arm.|$|E
50|$|Director <b>Larry</b> Auerbach <b>said</b> that he {{lamented the}} {{networks}} 4:00/3:00 slot choice on the CBS Evening News the day Love of Life finished airing, {{feeling that the}} slot was better suited to airing shows that appealed to kids after school.|$|R
50|$|In September, 2009 McLennan County, Texas Sheriff <b>Larry</b> Lynch <b>said</b> {{he would}} no longer accept {{payments}} from CEC. Private prisons need the permission of the local sheriff to operate, so the payments presented the appearance of a conflict of interest.|$|R
5000|$|In Game 3, the Lakers {{raced to}} an easy 137-104 victory as Magic Johnson dished out 21 assists. After the game, <b>Larry</b> Bird <b>said</b> his team played like [...] "sissies" [...] {{in an attempt}} to light a fire under his teammates.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure yer honour," [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> with an {{innocent}} look, [...] "when a gentleman like yourself is for ever walking and riding with a purty colleen, it don't need much guessing {{to suppose that}} you would be worrying after her, with such creatures as the Northerners and the furreners in her neighbourhood." ...|$|E
60|$|It distressed Neale greatly that Larry {{had shot}} up a man--and a {{railroad}} man at that. No matter what <b>Larry</b> <b>said,</b> Neale knew the shooting {{was on his}} account. This deed made the cowboy a marked man. It changed him, also, toward Neale, inasmuch as that he saw his wildness, was making small Neale's chances of returning to work. Larry never ceased importuning Neale {{to go back to}} his job. After shooting Smith the cowboy made one more eloquent appeal to Neale and then left for Cheyenne. Neale followed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's meself {{would not}} answer for them," [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said,</b> shaking his head. [...] "The boys are just disperate, and would care {{nothing for the}} protection, unless there were force to back it. They think that, as all the Catholics have been robbed by the Protestants, it's only fair that they should get their turn now; and, if I were your honour, I would lay all my plans out tonight, how to get away {{and the rest of}} it, just as if you were assured they would come before the morning." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was {{certainly}} {{difficult for us}} to come to the decision that {{if we were going to}} be economically viable we had to move", club President <b>Larry</b> Breskin <b>said.</b> [...] "If we could have found a way to stay in Detroit, we would have." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{race was}} the place where <b>Larry</b> McReynolds <b>said</b> one of his famed phrases that has been {{repeated}} many times in commercials and in media [...] "They touch! They touch!". He shouted that to Craven's contact with Busch down the frontstretch on the last lap.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Larry</b> David later <b>said,</b> [...] "I {{saw this}} show recently, and I can't believe that I killed this girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} {{afterwards}} Larry met Bean, {{and told him}} that Goarly had been in the wood. [...] "If I catch him, Mr. Twentyman, I'll give him sore bones," [...] said Bean. [...] "I wonder how he ever got back to his own place alive that day." [...] Then Bean asked Larry whether he meant to be at the meet to-morrow, and <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> that he thought he should. [...] "Tony's almost afraid to bring them in even yet," [...] said Bean; [...] "but if there's a herring left in this wood, I'll eat it myself--strychnine and all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are too big," [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I {{should want}} {{half a dozen}} men to launch them, and then {{you would want to}} go with me, and the bare sight of you would be enough to frighten away all the fish in the Shannon. But I will {{have a look at the}} boats. The captain might want a party to cross the river, and it's as well to see that they are in good order, and have got the oars and thole pins handy. I will see to them myself, for there are not half a dozen of ye know one end of the boat from the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure and I did," [...] <b>Larry</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I {{was sitting}} on a doorstep, {{watching}} the house, when I saw the sodgers coming along. They turned up from a side street, and were so close that I saw I could not get across and get the door opened in time to give you the alarm. Then they began to knock at the door, and for a bit I felt so wake that I could not move. Then the crowd began to gather, and then I said to myself, The master will try to shlip out {{at the back of the}} house. So I went round, but I found the thieves of the world waiting for ye there. But I was sure ye weren't the one to let them take ye widout a struggle for it. So I moved a bit away, and jist waited.|$|E
50|$|In November 1993, Rosauers was {{assessed}} $50,450 in civil fines for violating federal child labor laws at eight of its Spokane-area stores. Rosauers president <b>Larry</b> Geller <b>said</b> {{most of the}} violations involved one or two hours over the 18-hour weekly limit set for employees under age 16.|$|R
60|$|Much chagrined, man and boy {{stood on}} the brink of the chasm before them and gazed at the other side. It was sloping, as <b>Larry</b> had <b>said,</b> and wet, which was worse. A jump, even for a trained athlete, would have been perilous in the extreme.|$|R
50|$|On 13 January, The United States {{embassy in}} Suva issued {{a warning to}} its {{citizens}} in Fiji to take greater precautions. Following the truce brokered on the 16th by Vice-President Madraiwiwi, United States Ambassador <b>Larry</b> Dinger <b>said</b> he {{was pleased with the}} way the crisis had been defused peacefully.|$|R
6000|$|When Ben {{spoke of}} trying for a commission, and <b>Larry</b> <b>said</b> he {{should remain in}} the navy, both thought that {{fighting}} for the American army and navy was at an end. This supposition was correct so far as Spain was concerned, but the insurgents in the Philippines under General Aguinaldo refused to recognize Uncle Sam's authority, {{and it was not}} long before a large army had to be sent to Manila and other points, to coöperate with Dewey in restoring peace and order. Ben could not resist the temptation to join these soldiers in a distant clime, and with more fighting in view, Larry hastened to rejoin the Olympia. In another volume, to be entitled, [...] "Under Otis in the Philippines; Or, A Young Officer in the Tropics," [...] we shall follow the future adventures of these two brothers, and shall also see more of Gilbert Pennington, Luke Striker, and several others of our old acquaintances.|$|E
60|$|There {{are times}} in the career of a man--especially of one who leads a {{wandering}} and adventurous life--when {{it seems as though}} the events of a lifetime were compressed into the period of a few months, or weeks, or even days. Such, at least, was the experience of our hero while he travelled in the equatorial regions of South America. Events succeeded each other with such rapidity, and accumulated on each other to such an extent, that when he looked back it appeared utterly incredible that he and his companions had landed on the coast of Peru only a few months before. It was natural, indeed, that in such a region, where the phenomena and the forces of nature are so wild and vast, one incident or adventure should follow quickly on the heels of another, but it {{did not seem to be}} altogether natural that each incident should be more singular or tremendous than its predecessor. In short, there seemed to be neither rhyme nor reason, as <b>Larry</b> <b>said,</b> in the fact that they should be continually getting out of the frying-pan into the fire. Yet so it was, and, now that they had left the low country and plunged into the magnificent recesses of the great Andes, the metaphor was still applicable, though not, perhaps, equally appropriate, for, whereas the valleys they had quitted were sweltering in tropical heat, the mountains they had now ascended were clothed in wintry snow.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>Larry</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "That {{has three}} letters," [...] he was {{referring}} to the word 'bee'.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faix, it's a quare town," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Larry</b> O'Neil to Ned, who {{was gazing}} in wrapt, astonishment and admiration ever the stern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good night, Mr. Runciman," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Larry</b> as he {{made his}} way down-stairs to the yard. [...] "We've had an {{uncommon}} pleasant evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} was the deck-swabbing that gave him the stomach ache," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Larry,</b> and this made the captain and Grandon smile.|$|R
