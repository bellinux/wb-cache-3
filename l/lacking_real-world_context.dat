40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{teenagers}} perceive computing to be boring, antisocial, and irrelevant to their lives. We interviewed 13 teenagers from local Atlanta schools and observed over 40 teenagers in after-school technology programs {{to learn more}} about their perceptions of computing. We then interviewed 22 graduate students in the Human-Centered Computing and Human-Computer Interaction programs at Georgia Tech in order to learn about the factors that motivated them to pursue degrees in computing. We found that teenagers perceived computing to be boring, solitary, and <b>lacking</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>context,</b> yet graduate students described their research as exciting, social, and having a direct and meaningful impact on the world around them. Our results suggest that there is an opportunity to increase interest in computing among teenagers by bridging the gap between their perceptions of computing and the actual opportunities that are offered in computing disciplines. In this paper, we first describe our interview results. We then discuss our findings and propose a design-based curriculum to teach teenagers core computing principles. The goal of this curriculum is to prepare and motivate them for careers in today’s expanding, Internet-based, global economy. We suggest that by portraying computing as an innovative, creative, and challenging field with authentic, real-world applications, {{we may be able to}} motivate teenagers to become more excited to pursue careers in computing...|$|E

40|$|With {{the current}} {{curriculum}} focus on correlating classroom problem solving lessons to <b>real-world</b> <b>contexts,</b> are LEGO robotics an effective problem solving tool? This {{present study was}} designed to investigate this question and to ascertain what problem solving strategies primary students engaged with when working with LEGO robotics and whether the students were able to effectively relate their problem solving strategies to <b>real-world</b> <b>contexts.</b> The qualitative study involved 23 Grade 6 students participating in robotics activities at a Brisbane primary school. The study included data collected from researcher observations of student problem solving discussions, collected software programs, and data from a student completed questionnaire. Results from the study indicated that the robotic activities assisted students to reflect on the problem solving decisions they made. The study also highlighted that the students were able to relate their problem solving strategies to <b>real-world</b> <b>contexts.</b> The study demonstrated that while LEGO robotics can be considered useful problem solving tools in the classroom, careful teacher scaffolding needs to be implemented in regards to correlating LEGO with authentic problem solving. Further research in regards to how teachers can best embed <b>real-world</b> <b>contexts</b> into effective robotics lessons is recommended.

After, they were given a recall test to assess the number of stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent descriptors correctly recalled. Results were expected to show that participants recalled more stereotype-consistent information when cognitively busy, even more so for male targets. Conversely, participants were expected to recall more stereotype-inconsistent information when cognitively unbusy, even more so for male targets. Neither cognitive busyness nor the interaction between cognitive busyness and target gender affected the type of information participants recalled. Both results were inconsistent with previous research. Future research should find ways to strengthen the construct validity of measures as they operate in <b>real-world</b> <b>contexts</b> such as Facebook...|$|R

30|$|Not all math {{problems}} involve spatial thinking, {{but those}} that do should, to a greater extent, be impacted by embodied spatial training. First, we examined performance on targeted math problem types, using our math categorization that identified problems by type (defined by its representational nature), <b>context</b> (<b>real-world</b> versus abstract), and whether the solution involved spatial thinking. Problems targeted for embodied spatial training improvement included visual representation problems, <b>real-world</b> <b>context</b> problems, and problems involving spatial thinking.
