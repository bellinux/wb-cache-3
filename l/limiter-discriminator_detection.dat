Noncoherent FQPSK systems {{are suitable for}} fast fading and cochannel interference channels and channels with strong phase noise, and they can offer faster synchronization and reduce outage events compared with conventional coherent systems. In this paper, both differential detection and <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> of FQPSK are discussed. We use MLSE with lookup tables to exploit the memory in noncoherently detected FQPSK signals and thus significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel...|$|E

40|$|A coding {{technique}} for limiter-discriminator based CPM transceivers is proposed {{for use in}} Rayleigh, fast fading environments. The proposed technique maintains the same bandwidth to information rate ratio as the uncoded system and therefore does not cause bandwidth expansion. The performance of the proposed coding scheme is compared to trellis coded modulation (TCM) and found to be better. It is {{also found that the}} increase in performance as the code complexity is increased is larger for the proposed scheme than for TCM. I. Introduction <b>Limiter-Discriminator</b> (L-D) <b>detection</b> is a simple, robust demodulation technique that has received much interest, e. g., [1] [...] [8]. This technique has the advantage of being very robust, which is necessary in fading environments, and very simple, which makes it attractive for portable and hand-held devices. Portable communication systems all suffer from the effects of fading. In order to improve the performance of communication systems, channel coding [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} whose {{aim is to}} evaluate the behaviour of CPFSK systems with modulation pulse shaping and <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> {{in the presence of}} multipath fading and nonlinearity in the transmitter. This work, which completes a previous one where nonlinearities are absent, confirms the possibility to effectively control the lower bound of the system outage probability Pout (i. e. the asymptotic value of Pout when the transmitted power tends to infinity) by varying the maximum frequency deviation of the signa...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} theoretical analysis, {{based upon}} Rice's theory of clicks, {{for evaluating the}} error performance of heterodyne optical FSK receivers with <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> and pre- and integrate-and-dump (I&D) post-detection filtering is developed, accounting for laser phase noise, intersymbol interference (ISI) and intermediate-frequency (IF) filtered carrier envelope fluctuation effects. From the analysis {{it turns out that}} the envelope fluctuations induced by phase noise may produce, for operating IF bandwidths, a much smoother transition to the bit error rate floor than expected when considering IF infinite bandwidth, thereby generating performance degradation right in the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The contribution to this degradation due to a change in the click statistics generated by the envelope fluctuations is found to be negligible. From the analysis, it is also found that the floor gets lower and approached more rapidly as the modulation index and the bandwidth get larger, until the known floor for infinite IF bandwidth is reached. Finally, general curves are presented for system performance relating bit error probability to optimum IF bandwidth, optimum modulation index, laser linewidth and receiver sensitivity. These curves represent the ultimate limit to performance of a heterodyne optical FSK receiver with <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> and pre- and I&D post-detection filtering...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> of a {{frequency}} shift keyed (FSK) carrier is reviewed and this theory {{is used to}} predict the bit error probability performance of Manchester coded and nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) coded data. A major result {{of the study is}} that the predetection time bandwidth product BT and the deviation ratio h needed to give optimum performance for Manchester coding are seen to be larger than optimum NRZ FSK. Specifically, BT of about 2 and h of about 1 will result in Manchester performance about 2 dB worse than optimum NRZ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of continuous-phase FSK (frequency-shift keying) systems with rectangular modulation pulse shaping and <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> is analytically evaluated {{in the presence}} of transmission nonlinearities as well as adjacent channel and cochannel interference. Consideration of modulation pulses with length τ, shorter than symbol time, T, is investigated. The algorithm developed to evaluate bit-error probability shows that the choice τ/T< 1 is more convenient than the conventional one, τ/T= 1, and even moreso {{in the presence of}} adjacent channel interference. Moreover, for τ/T= 0. 5, numerical results are reported that describe system performance under different working conditions (type and bandwidth of the filters, frequency deviations of the signals, channel spacing, [...] .) and can be used to develop design criteri...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{characteristics}} of signals and bit error probability of transmission systems are analytically evaluated {{with reference to}} full response CPFSK systems with rectangular modulation pulse shaping and <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection,</b> applied on a typical cellular radio network. The analysis is {{carried out in the}} case of four-level signals, in the presence of transmission nonlinearities and cochannel and adjacent channel interferences. The results obtained show that the spectral compactness cannot be assumed as a good index of a bandwidth-efficient modulation system. Moreover, in some significant cases, which differ because of vehicular locations, channel spacing and modulation parameters, they indicate the signal-to-noise ratios necessary at the receiver input to guarantee a fixed bit error probability, in both the base-to-mobile and mobile-to-base transmissions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we study a binary or {{multilevel}} continuous-phase FSK system with <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection,</b> {{in which the}} modulation pulses are rectangular with length τ admitting of any value not higher than the symbol time T. As an application example of the general treatment, we report numerical results in the binary case which, according to expectations, show the considerable τ influence on system performance, other conditions being fixed. In particolar, in the best operation condition of the system for Pe = 10 - 6 that takes place for the non-critical value τ = 0. 6 T, the transmission canne frequency band and the transmitting power are both smaller than those corresponding to the analogous best condition with the constraint τ = T. Besides, the transmitting power advantages which derive from the opportune choice of τ increase little by little with channel frequency band reduction. With reference to multilevel systems, we have then point out some research development lines which we think interesting...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of CPFSK systems with modulation pulse shaping and <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> is {{tested in the}} presence of multipath fading. With the aim of determining the eye-closure domain, a theoretical analysis is presented for a generic number of modulation levels. It is shown that, by suitably varying the maximum angular frequency deviation ωd, control of outage probabilty Pout is possible. Moreover, the choice of duty-cycle in the modulation pulse τ/T < 1 leads to a lower value of Pout with respect to the conventional case τ/T = 1, if we fix, as happens in practice, an upper bound in the transmitted power. This promising characteristic deeply differentiates the CPFSK from the PSK, DCPSK, and QAM systems: CPFSK systems, with a fixed number of modulation levels, allow us to obtain decreasing values of Pout at the cost of increasing transmission power by suitably varying the set of signal parameters, {{even in the absence of}} diversity techniques and/or adaptive equalization...|$|E
40|$|The use of Per Survivor Processing (PSP) is {{considered}} in the detection of a Continuous Phase Frequency Shifl keying (CPFSK) signal. It is shown that PSP can enable {{the use of a}} trellis structure for the demodulation that is different from the trellis structure used to generate the CPFSK signal. This allows one to select a receive trellis structure with fewer phases, resulting in a reduced state sequence estimation algorithm. Results are presented using a receive trellis of 3 states to receive binary CPFSK signal with a modulation index, h, of 7 / 10. The complexity of the receiver is reduced by a factor of 3. 3 with minimal performance degradation. An application of this PSP technique is also discussed which enables one to pe~orm Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) of a digital FM signal, where the modulation index is only approximately known. Results presented for the binary case show this technique to provide a significant detection eficiency advantage over conventional techniques such as <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> or non-coherent detection...|$|E
40|$|The {{multilevel}} CP-FSK transmission {{systems with}} <b>limiter-discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> {{in which the}} modulation pulses are rectangular with a length τ admitting of any value not higher than symbol time T, are here considered. First, a procedure is presented {{in order to determine}} the optimum values of the modulation levels and of the decision thresholds, which are strictly correlated with τ. Next, the optimization of four-level CP-FSK systems with reference to different types of transmission channels is carried out by determining for each the value of τ, the modulation and threshold levels and the equivalent noise bandwidth, which guarantee the error probability Pe = 10 - 6 with the minimum transmitting power. For comparison, the same evaluation is made for the conventional system, for which τ = T and the distribution of the modulation and threshold levels is uniform. The results obtained, experimentally verified, show that: -the optimum choice of the modulation and thresholds levels is important even if τ = T;-the optimum system performance takes place, in all the considered cases, for non-critical value τ = 0. 2 T, for which the improvement compared to the conventional case is always very great. The experiments, carried out at the Telettra laboratories, have also shown that the considered modulation method allows the use of highly non linear power amplifiers in the transmitter, without any practical effect on system performance...|$|E
