40|$|Net {{investment}} in inventories {{is one of}} the more volatile components of GDP, giving it an important role in short-run variation in the growth of GDP and in the timing and duration of economic downturns. Its most distinctive feature may, however, be the number of conceptual and practical difficulties that arise in its measurement both in nominal terms and in real terms. Net {{investment in}} inventories is also known as change in inventories (CII). The first part of this paper concerns the measurement of nominal CII at the annual frequency. The principle that the economic value of production is measured at the prices existing when the production occurred means that the definition of nominal CII must keep holding gains and <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>inventories</b> out of the measure of GDP. Yet, however clear this requirement may be in the realm of theory, it does not translate literally into practice because the data are generally not precise enough to justify complete faith in the raw estimate of holding gains or <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>inventories.</b> If the estimate of holding gains or <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>inventories</b> is large, the implicit price for the annual CII it is likely to be extreme or negative. We wish to avoid the inconvenience that this causes unless we have some assurance that the large estimate is not a result of an unlucky draw of random errors in the underlying data...|$|R

The level of <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>inventories</b> has been increased significantly by 20 % {{from one year to}} another.

To assess whether or not profitable economically investing in this project, was necessary develop the financial study, which checks whether it is economically feasible to invest in implementation of the safe system, considering criteria such as CAUE, IRR, NPV, and the dynamic analysis of risk CRYSTAL BALL to help us decide whether to accept or not the project...|$|R

The HFT incurs a <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> its <b>inventory</b> but earns a profit on the bid-ask spread. Sharpe ratio calculations show that performance is very sensitive to cost of capital assumptions. The HFT employs a cross-market strategy as half of its trades materialize on the incumbent market {{and the other half}} on a small, high-growth entrant market. Its trade participation rate in these markets is 8. 1 % and 64. 4 %, respectively. In both markets, four out of five of its trades are passive i. e., its price quote was consumed by others. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

50|$|Accounting Statement FAS 157 defines fair value, which {{under the}} new guideline, is {{typically}} referred to as “mark to market” accounting. With Auction Rate Securities no longer being liquid, public companies began to write down their ARS holdings starting {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Through May 31, 2008, 402 publicly traded companies had reported Auction Rate Securities on their books. Of those 402, 185 had taken some level of impairment. However, there had been no ascertainable trend in the amount of writedowns taken. Firms have reported discounts ranging from 0-73% of par value. IncrediMail, Ltd. proved the most extreme example of this as it booked an impairment of 98% off face value for its ARS holdings, while Berkshire Hathaway took no impairment on its more than $3.5 billion of these securities. Some of the higher-profile firms taking writedowns include Bristol-Myers Squibb, 3M and US Airways.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} - The paper explores and {{describes}} the impact of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy within a production and assembly plant, and proposes a model for assessing {{the impact of the}} technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical investigation, based on case study research, focuses on an RFID implementation at a supplier of injection-moulded, surface-treated plastic to the automotive industry. This implementation {{is one of the few}} item-level, open-loop RFID implementations in the automotive industry. Findings - The empirical study provides insights into how inventory accuracy has been improved and made attainable in practice by implementing RFID, and indicates that the technology ensures inventory inaccuracy will be kept at minimum. As a result, an analytical model is presented which identifies the impact of RFID technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Research limitations/implications - The case study and context need to be considered when generalising upon the findings. Furthermore, it is hoped future research could further develop the model presented and test it against implementation practice. Practical implications - RFID technology provides practitioners with the opportunity to eliminate waste, and improve production and assembly performance. The research provides practitioners with experience of, and insights into how a production and assembly plant has improved inventory accuracy by implementing RFID technology. In particular, practitioners are provided with a model which enables them to assess the impact of RFID <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Original/value of paper - This paper contributes to the RFID community by providing empirical insights into the impact of RFID technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy, but also more broadly into logistics and operations management research...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we empirically {{estimate}} the effect of local market conditions <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> performance of U. S. automobile dealerships. We show that the influence of competition <b>on</b> a retailer’s <b>inventory</b> holdings can be separated into two mechanisms. First, the entry or exit of a competitor can change a retailer’s demand (a sales effect). Second, the entry or exit of a competitor can change the amount of buffer stock a retailer chooses to hold, which influences the probability a consumer …nds a desired product in stock (a service level effect). The sales effect can influence inventory through the presence of economies of scale. Theoretical arguments of inventory competition are ambiguous on the expected sign of the service level effect: there are models suggesting that service level increases, decreases or remains constant with entry. We obtained data (via a web crawler) <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> and sales of auto dealerships of a large manufacturer. Using cross-sectional variation of dealers in isolated markets, we estimated the effect of market structure (number and type of competitors), local demographics and sales <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> levels. We used market population as an instrumental variable to control for the endogeneity of market structure. Our results suggest a strong positive nonlinear effect {{of the number of}} rivals on service levels. Furthermore, we find that the impact of competition <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> via the service level effect is comparable to the impact via the sales effect. Counterfactual experiments indicate that reducing the dealership network of this manufacturer (thereby reducing competition) could reduce the remaining dealers’ days-of-supply (inventory divided by average sale rate) from 13 % to 24 %...|$|R
