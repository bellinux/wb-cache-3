40|$|Abstract — Holding {{an object}} and {{manipulating}} it in 6 D {{is a key}} application for multifingered robot hands. In the past many algo-rithms were proposed based on a weighted pseudoinverse of the grasp map combined with an internal force control. The majority of these algorithms require robust contact detection/tracking and switching controllers. Employing the virtual object introduced by Stramigioli we present an object-level control law. We define a novel virtual object frame based on the robot hand configuration. Our control law takes a desired object frame and desired grasping forces as input, it is passive, has an intuitive physical meaning, and stability is even given in case a finger <b>looses</b> <b>contact</b> with the object. A damping design {{as a function of}} the desired object stiffness and the combined hand-object inertia is presented. The performance of the controller is proven in two experiments implemented on the DLR Hand II. I...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) is an RNA binding {{protein that}} {{normally}} {{functions as a}} regulator of alternative splicing but can also be recruited to stimulate translation initiation by certain picornaviruses. High-resolution structures of the four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that make up PTB have previously been determined by NMR. Here, we have used small-angle X-ray scattering to determine the low-resolution structure of the entire protein. Scattering patterns from full-length PTB and deletion mutants containing all possible sequential combinations of the RRMs were collected. All constructs {{were found to be}} monomeric in solution. Ab initio analysis and rigid-body modeling utilizing the high-resolution models of the RRMs yielded a consistent low-resolution model of the spatial organization of domains in PTB.

40|$|Abstract:- In most of {{wireless}} sensor networks a single externally-powered coordinator collects data from several battery-powered nodes using a simple star topology. This paper presents an innovative approach, based on an adaptive channel selection method, to reduce sensor power consumption in heavy RF-noise condition. While managing the network, the coordinator can scan the spectrum looking for free available channels; then the coordinator chooses a “backup channel ” and communicates it to sensors. If a sensor <b>looses</b> <b>contact</b> with coordinator on the main channel the proposed method furnishes the “backup channel ” for a faster reconnection. Despite a complexity and consumption increase of coordinator, sensor battery life can sensibly increase (more than twice). A simple real network, based on WirelessUSBTM technology by Cypress, has been developed to experimentally evaluate performance, especially as regard RF power measurement capability of low-cost 2. 4 GHz RF-transceivers.

40|$|Contemporary {{intellectual}} critique, seeing multiculturalism as {{a threat}} to liberal core values and social cohesion, tells us more about paradoxes of a contemporary Western ‘liberalism’, which is <b>loosing</b> <b>contact</b> with its founding premises, than about actual multicultural policies. The article sets out to review the Swedish trajectory between a unique liberal multicultural agenda and generous policies of asylum and naturalisation towards an alignment with a currently rising wave of retrogressive identity politics, securitisation of integration policy and the institutionalisation of heavily monitored processes of ‘circular migration’ in the EU. This development is seen as propelled by a political merger of a neo-liberal concern for economic growth and a neo-conservative focus on needs for reinforcing moral duty, family responsibility, cultural homogeneity and community cohesion, but with a rich body of established civil, political, social and cultural rights of citizenship exposed to erosion.  In the electronic version the ISSN is changed to the correct one...|$|R

40|$|A model which {{describes}} {{the movement of}} a powder bed subjected to vibration and aeration through a porous support plate is proposed and solved. The calculated bed movement is shown graphically both {{as a function of}} time and - taking discrete Fourier transforms - of frequency. To validate the model experimentally, a new experimental technique was developed. This involved measuring the movement of a porous disc inserted in the bed and following the bed movement. The methodology and the difficulties involved are discussed. The experimental results are presented as Fourier transforms of the bed movement. Both model and experiment show that at the higher vibration intensities, where the bed <b>looses</b> <b>contact</b> with the support plate, bed movement with a period of more than one vibration cycle causes the appearance of a peak in the Fourier spectrum at half the plate excitation frequency. The intensity at which this first occurs is acceptably well predicted by the model.

40|$|In a parallel-connected battery group (PCBG), {{capacity}} degradation is usually {{caused by the}} inconsistency between a faulty cell and other normal cells, and the inconsistency occurs due to two potential causes: an aging inconsistency fault or a <b>loose</b> <b>contacting</b> fault.

On one hand, the faulty PCBG can be identified by comparing the PCBG resistance among PCBGs; on the other hand, two fault causes can be distinguished by comparing the variance of the PCBG resistances. Furthermore, for online applications, a novel recursive-least-squares algorithm with restricted memory and constraint (RLSRMC), in which the constraint is added to eliminate the “imaginary number” phenomena of parameters, is developed and used in PCBG resistance identification. Lastly, fault simulation and validation results demonstrate that the proposed methods have good accuracy and reliability...|$|R
