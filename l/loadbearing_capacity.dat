40|$|In {{this paper}} an easy-to-use design model for timber-concrete {{composite}} beams is discussed. The model is applicable for computer simulations {{as well as}} for hand calculations. A research programme was started in 1992 in co-operation with the University of Karlsruhe, to study the <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of timber-concrete composite beams that are subject to bending. This research programme also included shear tests, creep tests, Monte Carlo simulations on floor systems and short term tests on a platelike timber-concrete structure, that are not included in this publication. The load-slip characteristics of three different connector types were determined and thirty bending tests, ten for each connector type, were carried out on beams constructed with these connectors. The bending test-specimens failed due to combined bending and tensile failure of the timber, that is near knots or at a fingerjoint. Depending on the configuration of the beam and behaviour of the connectors, other phenomena could occur first. These phenomena however never initiated total collapse of the beam. Although timber beams normally exhibit brittle failure in the tensile zone, the composite beams showed a plastic behaviour before total collapse occurred. This behaviour was caused by plasticity of the connectors. Hardly any plasticity was observed at the 5 -percentile characteristic strength values for single T-beams and systems, when timber representing the Dutch strength class K 17 was modelled. An elastic calculation model thus proves to be correct for most timber-concrete composite beam configurations, provided that timber beams of ordinary strength classes have been installed. This observation is no longer valid if gIulam or timber from the highest strength classes is used. It shifts the characteristic strength values upwards and plasticity of the concrete compression zone or plasticity of the connectors occurs before the timber beam with characteristic strength collapses.

40|$|Because of the {{transition}} to a common standard for building regulations in Europe called Eurocodes, {{there is a need to}} update old reports that was written when old national standards were in use. A pile foundation is needed if the ground beneath a building does not have enough <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The function of the pile cap is to distribute the load from the above construction on to the piles in the ground. The goal of this thesis is to create design tables with a number of type caps that can be use to quickly get a grip of the size, quantity of reinforcement steel and <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the cap without the need to do any calculations. To create the values for the design tables the cantilever truss model was used.

40|$|In the past, {{presented}} design-methods for {{the determining}} of the transverse force load-bearing capacity of reinforced concrete beams were only developed for single-span girders. For continuous beams {{the influence of}} the bending moment which occurs at the location of the greatest transverse force demand, has been previously insufficiently considered. A parameter study shows that infact most of these models underestimate the <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> while some models overestimate them. The aim of the presented publication is the developing of a model for the determination of the transverse force <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of statically undetermined reinforced concrete beams. It is based on the model for single-span beams as published by Specht/Scholz, which describes the transverse force <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> with the help of three elements: that of the conrete cross-section, the element of shear reinforcement and the element resulting from longitudinal prestressing. For the element of the concrete cross-section a new framework model has been derived, increasing the inclination of the strut to 35 angle at the intermediate support based on figures taken from crack patterns. After a new definition of the slenderness ratio, the resistance of the separate transverse force will be derived. The results of 86 shear tests taken from pre-published material have allowed the calibration of the formulae. Compared to models published up until now the new model shows a clear improvement of the accuracy of the prediction. The use of 5 untensioned reinforced or unbonded prestressed two-span beams made of microconcrete and tested at the TU Berlin served for checking the modified model. Finally, a design-method for the transverse force proof will be derived, based on the safety concept as stipulated in EC 2. A practical simplification allows the determination of the element of the concrete cross-section at intermediate supports by using the formulae from Specht/Scholz for single-span beams through multiplication with correction factors taken from diagrams.

The generally {{description of the}} {{transverse force}} <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> in the ultimate state for normal- and high-strength-concrete is the intention of this work. Therefore the model from Specht, developed for normal-strength-concrete {{will be used as}} basic model. This model describes the transverse force <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> with three elements: that of the concrete cross-section, the element of shear reinforcement and the element resulting from longitudinal prestressing. That is why only the element of the concrete cross-section is to study. The influences of longitudinal reinforcement ratio and load position over the ultimate load has been tested at twelve high-strength-concrete girders without shear reinforcement, the crack pattern has been evaluated. From the test results follows a new definition of the model structure, valid for normal- and high-strength-concrete. This modified model has been developed to a design-model with partial safety factors for actions and material properties. The design-model confirmes essentially the design-rules from MC 1990 and EC 2.

The reducing effect of a trapezoidal metal decking to the ultimate <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> is considered with empirically derived reduction factors and equations that were developed between the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. The RFCS research project ”DISCCO“ investigated the shear stud resistance with novel types of steel decking. In many cases, the shear resistance predicted by EN 1994 - 1 - 1 was not reached in tests.

However, it is a very brittle, making it difficult to use as a common building material. Laminated glass significantly improves the strength through a layer of resin called polyvinyl butyral (PVB). Laminated glass is typically used for buildings in which human impact is vulnerable, such as hurricane prone areas or important government buildings. However, laminated glass still lacks the residual <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> that one would find in reinforced steel, for instance. Residual <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> is important to ensure the safety and reliability of glass as a structural material. This thesis will provide an overview of the common glass treatments, fixings, structural systems, and design methods used today. Additionally, two research studies investigating the effects of reinforced glass will be examined. Finally, the author will provide a simulation of a three-layer laminated glass stair tread with an applied design load. The simulation compares the stresses and displacements of the unreinforced glass tread with a glass tread reinforced with a 4 mm thick steel plate. The results from the simulation are inconclusive. However, experimental results from the two research studies show promise for the use of reinforcement in glass to improve load bearing capacity. by Bridget I. Navarro. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to adopt the Johansen’s {{yielding}} theory as a possibility to predict the ultimate load for timber-to-concrete joints using self-tapping threaded connectors screwed at an angle into the wood. The ultimate <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of a single connector is predicted to be when either the stresses in the wood reach the plastic failure stress level or when a combination of plastic failure in wood and dowel is attained. K. W. Johansen assumed that no axial tension occurred in the dowel and, thus no frictional contribution affected the lateral load-bearing capacity. However, the joints with inclined fasteners are first affected by tension load, so the withdrawal capacity of the screws has to be taken into account. In order to determine the load bearing capacity for specific connector geometry, the kinematical possible failure modes are determined. The screw in the concrete part of connection was taken as rigidly embedded and thus no deformations appeared. The study showed that the load-bearing capacity for connections with inclined high tensile strength screws can be predicted using the yielding theory, but this theory was unable to predict precisely the failure mode. Possible reasons for that include limited fastener ductility and influence of the screw inclination on the strength properties of timber...|$|E

The test have been carried out on masonry walls made of vertically perforated bricks, sadlime bricks and aerated concrete blocks. The test results obtained from 188 masonry specimens under axial compression verify the values of the characteristic compressive strength of masonry given in Eurocode 6 (June 1994).

The fracture properties of the material are determined through three-point bending tests on notched beams and through double edge wedge splitting (DEWS) tests carried out on cylinders cored in the full-size test structure. As a case study, an FRC elevated flat slab 0. 2 m thick is considered which consists of nine bays (panels) measuring 6 × 6 m (overall size 18. 3 × 18. 3 m) and is supported by 16 circular concrete columns.

40|$|The in-situ {{assessment}} of timber structures has gained considerable attention {{in recent years}} due to some unexpected failures of public buildings. The {{assessment of}} timber, however, {{has been used in}} the evaluation of historic structures {{for a number of years}} and methods employed have enveloped from visual observation (which is still one of the most effective ways of evaluating in-situ timber) to more sophisticated methods that use various physical phenomena such as stress wave or x-ray energy attenuation. In the health assessment of timber, effects of biotic elements such as insects and fungi are of interest, which of course is always connected with the presence of water in wood. The structural assessment encompasses questions related to the structural integrity of in-situ members and the performance of components and the system. The structural health assessment not only focuses on biotic elements but also attempts to quantify engineering properties of the material such as strength degradation, modulus of elasticity, loss of cross section, extent of check and other quantitative parameters needed for subsequent evaluation of the structural system, frequently expressed as <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Service life planning of a structure is a complex issue that is complex issue that is related not only on the materials, but also the environment and use of the structure. Assessment of the health and properties of existing timber elements yields a piece of information that is necessary but not sufficient for the service life estimate. In the evaluation of structural timber, a mere use of various assessment techniques is not sufficient and usually an involvement of disciplines such as wood anatomy, wood physics and statistics is needed. A reliable estimate of the parameters of in-situ timber requires careful planning of measurements (experiments) since the material is highly variable and any statement about the properties of an element or even the entire system must reflect the random character of the wood properties.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly necessary to investigate the strength of reinforced concrete structures subjected to dynamic loading. Experience and knowledge relating to the non-linear dynamic behaviour of such structures is still limited, however. Attempts to solve this type of problems with the aid ofa finite element approach soon encounter difficulties. An example of this consists in the correct representation of the appropriate collapse mechanism and more particularly in {{the problem of the}} numerical stability for the integration process required for solving the equations of motion with respect to time and made additionally awkward by the non-linear behaviour. These problems are associated with mathematical algorithms and are not relevant to the structural problem under investigation. The authors anticipate considerable improvement in this sphere in the future, but at present they prefer an approximation which provides direct insight into the response of structures without involving too many difficulties with numerical problems. For this reason a simple well-tried beam model is applied. This discrete beam model consists of a number of indeformable segments (the elements) with hinges (the nodes) at their ends andjoined to one another by means of flexural springs. The mass of each segment is conceived as concentrated in the hinges, as is also the dynamic load. The material properties are assumed to be elasto-plastic. The effect of loading rate on the material properties has also been taken into account. Two failure criteria are applied in the discrete mathematical model. Thus, in the elastic range (M < Mp) the concrete section is checked for strength, and in the plastic range the rotational capacity is not allowed to be exc~eded. In other words, the shear strength (<b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> in shear) is calculated {{as a function of the}} moment-shear combination that occurs. The treatment of the subject starts from formulae derived for static moment-shear combinations. It emerges that the (static) formula given by Rafla can be modified and suited to dynamically loaded structures (M < Mp). The effect of shear on the permissible rotational capacity can be expressed in a simple relation. Thus, the rotational capacity will have its maximum value if the shear force is zero; but the presence of shear force will reduce the rotational capacity. The discrete model described here has been applied to analysing the elasto-plastic response of a beam subjected to an impulsive load. Two different examples are presented. The first example is concerned with the response ofa simply-supported beam under a uniformly distributed impulsive load. It appears that the distributions of the bending moments and shear forces are very different from those obtained for a comparable static load. Presupposing that no shear failure will occur (adequate shear reinforcement), plastic moments will be formed at some distance from mid-span. From here the plastic hinges will then move towards the middle of the span. The second example considers a beam with fixed (fully restrained) ends. It approximately represents a strip of the roof of a road tunnel. The situation where a gas explosion occurs in the tunnel is investigated. The distribution of the bending moments which is then produced bears a closer similarity to that associated with a static load, but the shear forces are still different, though less so than in the case ofthe simply-supported beam. Ifno stirrups are provided, a shear failure criterion must be introduced. This will very greatly reduce the permissible explosion load, so that in most cases no plastic hinges will even be formed.

40|$|Up {{until today}} {{reinforced}} concrete {{has been used}} in most cases for the manufacturing of bridge decks. Depending {{on the quality of the}} work carried out, defects can already occur after only a few years. These defects mostly appear in the form of corrosion of the steel reinforcement due to concrete's sensitivity to de-icing salts and water. To reduce maintenance costs, which are mainly caused by corrosion of the steel reinforcement, attempts were made to eliminate the steel reinforcement in the bridge deck. This was achieved for example by replacing the whole concrete bridge deck with an FRP 1 bridge deck. FRP bridge decks, besides the advantage of the absence of steel reinforcement, exhibit the advantage of a low dead load (approx. 20 % of a comparable concrete deck) combined with high strength. These properties resulted in the fact that today more than 200 bridges with FRP decks are in service worldwide. Most of them need steel or concrete main girders to bridge the required span. Despite the many bridges already in service, assessment of their load-bearing capacity or deflections still remains difficult. Some of the reasons for this this are as follows: Geometry and material properties vary considerably between different FRP bridge-deck types. The problem of the connection between main girders and bridge decks has only been partially solved. No design method exists which allows determination of the stresses and deflections of composite girders, and takes the degree of composite action of the bridge deck into account. This thesis contributes to solve these problems. Experiments with two different bridge decks were carried out in order to determine the necessary system properties (in-plane compression and shear resistance and in-plane compression and shear stiffness) for the calculation of the load-bearing behavior of steel/FRP composite girders. The method developed to determine the system properties can also be applied to other FRP bridge decks (e. g. sandwich decks). In a second step, four composite girders (two with each bridge deck) were manufactured by bonding the bridge decks onto conventional steel girders. Local failure of the bridge deck, as occurs in girders with stud or bolt connections, is therefore prevented and a clear load transfer in the joint is assured. One of the two girders, with each bridge deck system, was tested statically and the other statically and under fatigue loads. The results of the girder experiments showed that adhesive bonding is a reliable connection technique, since failure always occurred first in the bridge deck and then in the adhesive layer. The stiffness and failure load of the composite girders could be increased considerably in comparison with the pure steel girder. The determined system properties concerning in-plane shear and compression stiffness were confirmed with the girder experiments. The results of the experiments with the composite girders were compared with results of an analytical design method for concrete/wood girders adapted for steel/FRP composite girders. It was shown that the load-bearing behavior of composite girders consisting of steel main girders and adhesively- bonded FRP bridge decks can be determined with good accuracy in the linear-elastic region. Furthermore a design method was developed which allows the <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the steel/FRP composite girders investigated in this thesis to be determined with very good accuracy. Subsequently a parameter study was carried out in order to verify the assumption of full composite action in the adhesively- bonded joint. This is one of the requirements for application of the developed design methods. The study showed that the assumption is applicable for different adhesives and even for thicknesses up to 50 mm.

40|$|The 316 L {{austenitic}} stainless steels, Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V and Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWP) are very attractive and well known materials for diverse engineering applications {{due to their}} many superior properties. More specifically, these materials have acquired much attention in biomedical applications due to their excellent biocompatibility. However, the practical use of these materials are limited in many cases {{by the need to}} attain specific tribological (that means, low 2 ̆ 7 friction and wear rate) and mechanical (that means, high hardness, high <b>loadbearing</b> <b>capacity)</b> properties. The long-term outcome of the total joint replacement is currently limited by the breakdown of the implant by wear processes. Therefore, much research has been carried out in this area to reduce the incidence of wear. The goal of this project was to enhance the mechanical and tribological properties of the biocompatible surface by the plasma nitriding and duplex coating process. The works consisted of three phases. In the first phase, in order to acquire a preliminary approximation of the different process parameters, finite volume and finite element methods have been employed to determine (i) the gas mixture pattern inside the sputtering chamber and (ii) the thermal stress inside the coating, with and without considering graded interlaycr respectively. In {{the second phase of the}} work, a new plasma nitriding process has been used using an existing carbon based coating system. Plasma nitriding was performed on biomaterials substrates where a Saddle field neutral fast atom beam source and an auxiliary heater was used for substrate heating. It has been observed that low temperature plasma nitriding of the stainless steel samples produced a precipitation and black layer free, hard, thick and load supporting nitridcd layer within a short processing time which was suitable for subsequent coating deposition as well. Plasma nitriding has also been carried out on Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V and non-conductivc UHMWP biomaterials. In both cases plasma nitriding treatment increased the untreated substrate hardness and wear properties substantially. In the third phase o f the w 2 ̆ 7 ork, the additional improvement of mechanical and tribological properties of the solid lubricant based coatings (MoS 2 and DLC), a continuous and discontinuous duplex coating system has been investigated. The main focus has been on the improvement of the load bearing capacity of the coating-substratc system. For the first time a continuous duplex process is being introduced consisting of the plasma nitriding followed by in situ deposition of the DLC biomedical coating. The process has been successfully carried out in a single process chamber (PECVD based Saddle field neutral fast atom beam source) without any interlaycr or post nitriding treatment. Rockwell C indention results confirmed the improvement of the adhesion in the duplex treated coating samples compared to the non-duplex treated sample. Duplex treatment significantly increased the composite hardness and reduced the plastic deformation of the substrate. The Pin on disk tests showed that the duplex treatment increase the overall wear properties of the coating compared to the non-duplex coating. In addition, a discontinuous duplex treatment consisting of plasma nitriding and TiN+MoS, coatings with and without a graded interlaycr on the stainless steel substrate were investigated. Low-temperature plasma nitriding was performed with the newly developed process (Saddle field fast atom beam source) and coatings were deposited by closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering. Results showed that the graded interlaycr and plasma nitnding had a great influence on the load bearing and overall tribological properties of the coating-substratc system...|$|E
