To determine whether increases in tyrosine kinase activity {{are part of this}} pathway, we microinjected tyrosine kinase inhibitors into unfertilized eggs. Upon fertilization, signs of activation were monitored, such as fertilization envelope liftoff and the Ca 2 +wave (for eggs microinjected with <b>lavendustin</b> A). Various concentrations of <b>lavendustin</b> A and tyrphostin B 46 were microinjected, as well as inactive forms of these compounds (<b>lavendustin</b> B and tyrphostin A 1) to provide negative controls. Peptide A, a 20 -amino-acid peptide derived from the SH 2 region of pp 60 v-srctyrosine kinase, was also microinjected. Peptide A inhibits tyrosine kinase activity but not PKA or PKG activity. Dose–response curves for <b>lavendustin</b> A, tyrphostin B 46, and peptide A show clear inhibition of vitelline envelope liftoff by these three compounds. Confocal imaging of eggs coinjected with <b>lavendustin</b> A and Oregon Green–dextran showed that the Ca 2 +wave was inhibited under normal insemination conditions but that the block of the Ca 2 +wave could be overcome with very high sperm densities. A phenomenon of small local Ca 2 +increases termed “hot spots” seen in <b>lavendustin</b> A containing eggs is also described. Since this inhibition of egg activation by tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be overcome by Ca 2 +microinjection, the inhibitors must act on a step in the signal transduction cascade that is upstream of the Ca 2 +wave...|$|E
40|$|The voltage-dependent and Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel (MaxiK, BK) and the {{cellular}} proto-oncogene pp 60 c-Src (c-Src) are abundant proteins in vascular smooth muscle. The role of MaxiK channels as a vasorelaxing force is well established, but {{their role in}} vasoconstriction is unclear. Because Src participates in regulating vasoconstriction, we investigated whether c-Src inhibits MaxiK as a mechanism for agonist-induced vasoconstriction. Functional experiments in human and rat show that inhibitors of Src (<b>Lavendustin</b> A, PP 2) but not inactive compounds (<b>Lavendustin</b> B, PP 3) induce a pronounced relaxation of coronary or aortic smooth muscle precontracted with 5 -hydroxytriptamine, phenylephrine, or Angiotensin II. Iberiotoxin, a MaxiK blocker, antagonizes the relaxation induced by <b>Lavendustin</b> A or PP 2, indicating that c-Src inhibits the Iberiotoxin-sensitive component, likely MaxiK channels. In agreement, coronary muscle MaxiK currents were enhanced by <b>Lavendustin</b> A. To investigate the molecular mechanism of c-Src action on MaxiK channels, we transiently expressed its α subunit, hSlo, with or without c-Src in HEK 293 T cells. The voltage sensitivity of hSlo was right-shifted by ≈ 16 mV. hSlo inhibition by c-Src is due to channel direct phosphorylation because: (i) excised patches exposed to protein tyrosine phosphatase (CD 45) resulted in a partial reversal of the inhibitory effect by ≈ 10 mV, and (ii) immunoprecipitated hSlo channels were recognized by an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. Furthermore, coexpression of hSlo and c-Src demonstrate a striking colocalization in HEK 293 T cells. We propose that MaxiK channels via direct c-Src-dependent phosphorylation {{play a significant role}} supporting vasoconstriction after activation of G protein-coupled receptors by vasoactive substances and neurotransmitters...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, we have {{investigated}} the role of tyrosine kinase activity during early retinal development in Xenopus laevis. The protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors <b>lavendustin</b> A and genistein {{were used to determine}} the possible role of tyrosine kinase activity during retinal development in vivo and in vitro. Application of the inhibitors to early embryonic retina disrupted the pattern of lamination in the developing retina. The plexiform layers were severely disorganized or were no longer apparent, and photoreceptor morphogenesis was disrupted. Immunocytochemical analysis verified the presence of focal adhesions in dissociated retinal neuroepithelial cells isolated from St 25 embryos. Application of the PTK inhibitors blocked focal adhesion assembly in these primary cultured cells. To further investigate the regulation of focal adhesions by PTK activity, we examined the effect of <b>lavendustin</b> A on cultured XR 1 glial cells. <b>Lavendustin</b> A produced a dose-dependent decrease in the proportion of XR 1 cells displaying focal adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that tyrosine kinase activity is essential for regulating neuroepithelial cell adhesion, migration and morphogenesis during retinal development. Furthermore, the disruption of retinal development may, in part, be due to the inhibition of integrin-mediated signaling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Endogenous slow sodium {{channels}} {{have been}} described in the mem-brane of immature Xenopus laevis oocytes. The opening of these channels is a complex process comprising an induction phase leading the channels from a state of electrical inexcitability into a voltage-dependent state. The mechanism by which the depolarization of the membrane causes the induction is dependent upon an en-zymatic cascade implying a phospholipase C (PLC) and a protein kinase C (PKC). The existence of different isoforms of PLC has been described in the oocytes, each isoform being activated by distinct membrane receptors upon ligand binding. The present work investigated the effects of insulin known to bind to membrane recep-tor tyrosine kinases and to activate PLC-γ isoforms. Our results in current and voltage clamp experiments showed that insulin facilitated the induction of the slow Na+ channels in a dose-dependent way. The current/voltage relationships indi-cated that the gating properties of the channels were not altered by the hormone. <b>Lavendustins</b> and tyrphostin, inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor signaling pathway, failed to block insulin effect as well as induction of the sodium channels.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{developing}} rat hippocampus, GABAergic synapses undergo a Ca 2 +-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP(GABA-A)); {{this form of}} synaptic plasticity is induced in CA 3 pyramidal neurons by delivering repetitive depolarizing pulses (DPs) to the recorded neuron, and it is expressed as a long-lasting increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABA(A) receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents. In the present study, we examined the role of endogenous tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptor ligands and associated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in the induction of LTP(GABA-A). The application of <b>Lavendustin</b> A, a broad spectrum PTK inhibitor, blocked the induction of LTP(GABA-A), whereas <b>Lavendustin</b> B, its inactive form, had no effect. Moreover, k- 252 a and k- 252 b, two alkaloids that inhibit the kinase activity of the Trk receptor family, also prevented the induction of LTP(GABA-A).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Short {{administration}} of volatile anesthetics preconditions myocardium and protects the heart against {{the consequences of}} subsequent ischemia. Activation of tyrosine kinase is implicated in ischemic preconditioning. The authors investigated whether desflurane-induced preconditioning depends on activation of tyrosine kinase. METHODS: Sixty-four rabbits were instrumented for measurement of left ventricular pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial infarct size (IS). All rabbits were subjected to 30 min of occlusion of a major coronary artery and 2 h of subsequent reperfusion. Rabbits underwent a treatment period consisting of either no intervention for 35 min (control group, n = 12) or 15 min of 1 minimum alveolar concentration desflurane inhalation followed by a 10 -min washout period (desflurane group, n = 12). Four additional groups received the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (5 mg/kg) or <b>lavendustin</b> A (1. 3 mg/kg) {{at the beginning of}} the treatment period with (desflurane-genistein group, n = 11; desflurane-lavendustin A group, n = 12) or without desflurane inhalation (genistein group, n = 9; <b>lavendustin</b> A group, n = 8). RESULTS: Hemodynamic values were similar in all groups during baseline (left ventricular pressure, 87 +/- 14 mmHg (mean +/- SD]; cardiac output, 198 +/- 47 ml/min), during coronary artery occlusion (left ventricular pressure, 78 +/- 12 mmHg; cardiac output, 173 +/- 39 ml/min), and after 2 h of reperfusion (left ventricular pressure, 59 +/- 17; cardiac output, 154 +/- 43 ml/min). IS in the control group was 55 +/- 10 % of the area at risk. The tyrosine inhibitors had no effect on IS (genistein group, 56 +/- 13 %; <b>lavendustin</b> A group, 49 +/- 13 %; each P = 1. 0 vs. control group). Desflurane preconditioning reduced IS to 40 +/- 15 % (P = 0. 04 vs. control group).

We studied the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) by C. burnetii in THP- 1 monocytes. Virulent organisms induced early PTK activation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of several endogenous substrates, including Hck and Lyn, two Src-related kinases. PTK activation reflects C. burnetii virulence since avirulent variants were unable to stimulate PTK. We also investigated the role of PTK activation in C. burnetii-stimulated F-actin reorganization. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were colocalized with F-actin inside cell protrusions induced by C. burnetii, and PTK activity was increased in Triton X- 100 -insoluble fractions.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{doctoral}} thesis was the development of salicylic and bioisosteric quinazoline compounds as potential drugs for the therapy for several types of cancer. The purpose of the first part was the synthesis of salicyloylindoles and claryifying their pharmacological mechanism of action. Using a new method of preparation (Grignard-reagent induced acylation) {{it was possible to}} gain different substituted salicyloylindoles which showed a cytotoxic activity on human MCF- 7 -cells. To examine an EGFR-TK-inhibition one chloro substituted salicyloylindole compound was tested representatively. However, it only showed a poor inhibition. In the second section the active compounds <b>Lavendustin</b> A and its pharmacophore served as leading structures for the design of new EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. <b>Lavendustin</b> A was isolated from Streptomyces griseolavendus. To create new <b>Lavendustin</b> A-derivatives the structure of the pharmacophore should be modified {{in a way that the}} dihydroxybenzylamino-moiety remained and should be combined with a 3 -chloro- 4 -fluoro-aniline. Furthermore, we tried to examine if the substitution pattern 3 -, 4 - or 5 -amino side chain has any influence on the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. The obtained isomeric compounds showed significant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activities. In addition the three isomeres have been submitted to the NCI for evaluation of their anticancer activity. They maintained high antiproliferative activity with GI 50 -values of 10 - 5 and 10 - 6 respectively in all cell lines. The 5 -aminosalicylic derivative was selected for an in-vivo hollow fiber assay and afterwards for a special EGFR + hollow fiber assay. Using the same synthesis by applying 2, 5 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde instead of 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde two methoxy-derivatives were designed to examine a tubulin inhibition. The result of the tubulin-test was a stimulation of 1 % instead of an inhibition. According to Gefitinib (Iressa®) and Erlotinib (Tarceva®) the ring-open salicylic moiety was inserted into the bioisosteric quinazoline part in the third part of this thesis. A 4 -(indole- 3 -yl) quinazoline was designed which was substituted with the 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzylamino-moiety of the <b>Lavendustin</b> pharmacophore in the position 6 of the quinazoline part. This side chain should be necessary for an EGFR-TK-inhibition. The inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase should be supported by a change of the aniline into an indole so a potent inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase was estimated. In spite of several trials, the desired compound could not be gained. In the last section a quinazoline with a methoxy and morpholinopropoxy moitey was synthesized which inhibits the EGFR-TK. Thereupon we designed another 4 -(indole- 3 -yl) quinazoline without a substituent of the quinazoline part.

40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation {{is thought to}} play an important role in the regulation of neuronal function. Previous work has shown that protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors can inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a candidate synaptic mechanism involved in memory formation. However, how PTK activity might contribute to LTP induction remains elusive. To understand the role of PTK pathways in the development of LTP better, a set of studies was implemented in area CA 1 of rat hippocampal slices using both intra- and extracellular recordings. We show here that bath application or injection into postsynaptic cells of the PTK inhibitors genistein and <b>lavendustin</b> A blocked the induction of LTP produced by high-frequency tetanic stimulation. Application of <b>lavendustin</b> A 10 min before or 3 min after induction effectively blocked LTP. However, application at 10 or 30 min after induction had no detectable effect on potentiation. PTK inhibitor pretreatment did not affect the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic response produced by phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu), forskolin plus 3 -isobutyl-L-methylxanthine (IBMX), or tetraethylammonium (TEA). In contrast, PTK inhibitors significantly blocked postanoxic LTP. EPQ(pY) EEIPIA, an activator of Src family PTKs, produced a gradual and robust increase in the synaptic response and occluded LTP. These results suggest that Src family kinases are potential candidates for the PTKs contributing to the molecular mechanism of LTP induction at Schaffer collateral-CA 1 synapses...|$|E

Among these, protein kinase C {{has been demonstrated}} both to mediate respiratory burst and to suppress an alternative pathway of activation of respiratory burst and arachidonic acid metabolism in eosinophils. We utilized inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) to elucidate the role of PTK in PAF-induced activation of eosinophils. Eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood of atopic donors and stimulated with PAF in the absence or presence of broad-spectrum PTK inhibitors – genistein or <b>lavendustin</b> A; an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation – tyrphostin AG 126; or an inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (Jak 2) – tyrphostin B 42 (AG 490). PAF induced superoxide anion (O 2 −·.) generation, leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) release, intracellular calcium ion mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple eosinophil proteins in a concentration-dependent manner. All of these responses were concentrationdependently inhibited by genistein; <b>lavendustin</b> A also exhibited potent inhibition of PAF-induced LTC 4 release. AG 126 {{had no effect on}} either O 2 −·. generation or LTC 4 release, while AG 490 inhibited both responses, albeit less effectively than genistein.

We studied {{the effects of}} three CD 43 antibodies (6 E 5, 6 F 5 and 10 G 7) on human neutrophils and found that all three monoclonal antibodies (mAb) induced significant homotypic adhesion involving more than 50 % of cells. Monovalent Fab fragments of CD 43 mAb had no such effect but became equally effective upon cross-linkage with F(ab') 2 sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies. The homotypic adhesion induced by CD 43 antibodies was dependent on divalent cations, energy, temperature and an intact cytoskeleton, but not on de novo protein synthesis. Homotypic adhesion could be inhibited by mAb to CD 11 b, CD 18 and CD 54, indicating an involvement of the beta 2 integrin cyto-adhesion pathway. Additionally, oxidative burst formation was observed with intact CD 43 mAb. No such effect was seen with monomeric or cross-linked Fab fragments. This, together with the observation that burst formation unlike adhesion induction could be completely abolished with Fc gamma RII, but not with Fc gamma RIII antibody fragments, suggests that in burst induction, heterologous cross-linkage with Fc gamma RII is involved.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the hypothesis that tyrosine kinase activity contributes to α 1 -adrenergic inhibition of β-adrenergic responses in cardiac myocytes. We addressed this question by studying the pharmacological regulation of the L-type Ca 2 + current in acutely isolated adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The selective α 1 -adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine had no effect on the basal L-type Ca 2 + current. Methoxamine also had no effect on cAMP-dependent stimulation of the Ca 2 + current mediated by H 2 histamine receptor activation. However, methoxamine did inhibit cAMP-dependent stimulation of the Ca 2 + current mediated by β-adrenergic receptor activation. The ability of methoxamine to inhibit β-adrenergic regulation of the Ca 2 + current was significantly antagonized by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and <b>lavendustin</b> A. The inhibitory effect of methoxamine was also mimicked by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (PVN). PVN had no effect on basal Ca 2 + current or Ca 2 + current stimulated by histamine, but it did inhibit Ca 2 + current stimulated by β-adrenergic receptor activation. Furthermore, the ability of PVN to inhibit β-adrenergic stimulation of the Ca 2 + current was antagonized by <b>lavendustin</b> A. These results are consistent with the conclusion that in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes α-adrenergic inhibition of β-adrenergic responses involves a tyrosine kinase-dependent signalling pathway.

We have recently demonstrated a role of endonuclease activation, considered a feature of apoptosis, in DNA damage and cell death in chemical hypoxic injury to renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK 1 cells). Tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated to be involved in cell signaling pathway leading to cell growth, proliferation, and apoptotic death. However, a role of tyrosine phosphorylation as a signal transduction pathway involved in DNA damage and cell death has not been previously examined in hypoxic injury in any tissue. In the present study, we have demonstrated that chemical hypoxia with a combination of antimycin A, a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, and substrate deprivation resulted in rapid increase in protein tyrosine kinases activity and protein tyrosine phosphorylation prior to any evidence of cell death in LLC-PK 1 cells. The inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, genistein, <b>lavendustin</b> A, tyrphostin, and herbimycin A provided a marked protection against chemical hypoxia-induced DNA damage (as measured by alkaline unwinding assay) and cell death (as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay). In a separate study, we confirmed the ability of the inhibitors, <b>lavendustin</b> A and herbimycin A to prevent chemical hypoxia-induced increase in protein tyrosine kinases activity and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, the inhibitors used did not affect ATP depletion induced by antimycin A, suggesting that the inhibitors do not alter cellular uptake of antimycin A.

Furthermore, the identity of the tyrosine kinase(s) involved in the genesis of ischemic preconditioning (PC) remains obscure. Here, we present the first evidence that ischemic PC (6 cycles of 4 -minute coronary occlusion and 4 -minute reperfusion) induces selective activation of 2 members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, Src and Lck, in the heart of conscious rabbits. The activation of Src in the particulate fraction was not evident at 5 minutes after ischemic PC but became apparent at 30 minutes (� 119 % versus control), whereas the activation of Lck in the particulate fraction was apparent both at 5 minutes (� 103 % versus control) and at 30 minutes (� 89 %) after ischemic PC. The activity of the other 5 members of the Src tyrosine kinases expressed in the rabbit heart (Fyn, Fgr, Yes, Lyn, and Blk) was not affected by ischemic PC.

The influence of various polymeric additives on the {{stability of}} the supersaturated solutions showed that only sodium carboxymethyl cellulose had a stabilizing effect; however, the solution was very viscous and {{it is not clear whether}} the stabilizing effect was due to this high viscosity or to a specific interaction between drug and polymer...|$|E

Propylene glycol-water mixtures, which permitted the formulation of LAP {{at different levels of}} saturation, were prepared and tested for stability prior to conducting membrane permeation studies. The transport of LAP across silicone membrane from donor solutions containing the drug at different degrees of saturation (DS = 1 - 5) was evaluated by two independent experimental methods: (i) using attenuated total-reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and (ii) using standard vertical diffusion cells followed by quantification with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both methods demonstrated a linear relationship between the DS of the applied solution and the flux through the membrane, yielding similar values for the diffusion coefficients of LAP [diffusion cells, D = 1. 75 (+/- 0. 16) x 10 (- 7) cm(2) s(- 1) and ATR-FTIR, D = 1. 42 (+/- 0. 26) x 10 (- 7) cm(2) s(- 1)).

In this study, {{we find that}} both the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and genetic knockout of p 56 lck, a src-like tyrosine kinase, block regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in a human T cell line. Activation of a swelling-activated chloride current (ICl-swell) by osmotic swelling in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments is blocked by herbimycin A and <b>lavendustin.</b> Osmotic activation of ICl-swell is defective in p 56 lck-deficient cells. Retransfection of p 56 lck restores osmotic current activation. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase activity is sufficient for activation of ICl-swell. Addition of purified p 56 lck to excised patches activates an outwardly rectifying chloride channel with 31 pS unitary conductance. Purified p 56 lck washed into the cytoplasm activates ICl-swell in native and p 56 lck-deficient cells even when hypotonic intracellular solutions lead to cell shrinkage. When whole-cell currents are activated either by swelling or by p 56 lck, slow single-channel gating events can be observed revealing a unitary conductance of 25 - 28 pS. In accordance with our patch-clamp data, osmotic swelling increases activity of immunoprecipitated p 56 lck. We conclude that osmotic swelling activates ICl-swell in lymphocytes via the tyrosine kinase p 56 lck...|$|E
40|$|Several cytokines have {{short-term}} {{effects on}} synaptic transmission and plasticity that {{are thought to}} be mediated by the activation of intracellular protein kinases. We have studied the effects of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) on the expression of paired pulse facilitation (PPF), posttetanic potentiation (PTP), and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus {{as well as on the}} activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription- 3 (STAT 3), the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK (MAPK/ERK), and the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH(2) -terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). IL- 6 induced a marked and dose-dependent decrease in the expression of PTP and LTP that could be counteracted by the simultaneous treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor <b>lavendustin</b> A (LavA) but did not significantly affect PPF. The IL- 6 -induced inhibition of PTP and LTP was accompanied by a simulation of STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and an inhibition of MAPK/ERK dual phosphorylation, in the absence of changes in the state of activation of SAPK/JNK. Both effects of IL- 6 on STAT 3 and MAPK/ERK activation were effectively counteracted by LavA treatment. The results indicate the tyrosine kinases and MAPK/ERK are involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and may represent preferential intracellular targets for the actions of IL- 6 in the adult nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Within basal ganglia, group I metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptor subtypes (mGluR 1 and 5) frequently co-localize in {{the same}} neuron. However, {{little is known about}} how these receptors functionally interact. We addressed this issue by means of electrophysiological recordings of striatal cholinergic interneurons, a neuronal subtype that co-express both group I mGluRs. The group I non-selective agonist 3, 5 -DHPG induced a membrane depolarization/inward current that was prevented by co-application of LY 367385, a selective mGluR 1 antagonist, and SIB 1757 or MPEP, blockers of mGluR 5 subtype. The reversal potential for the response to 3, 5 -DHPG was close to the equilibrium potential for potassium channels. Repeated bath or focal applications of 3, 5 -DHPG induced a progressive decline in the amplitude of the membrane depolarization, suggesting that group I mGluRs undergo receptor desensitization. Interestingly, {{in the presence of the}} mGluR 5 blocker, SIB 1757, this event was not observed, whereas it occurred in LY 367385. PKC blockers chelerythrine and calphostin C mimicked the inhibitory effect of SIB 1757. In a subset of interneurons, in MPEP or SIB 1757, 3, 5 -DHPG induced a 0. 5 - 1 Hz oscillatory response, that was prevented by L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers, and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and <b>lavendustin.</b> Together, these data suggest that mGluR 5 modulates mGluR 1 activity to shape cell excitability...|$|E

To elucidate whether a G-protein and/or a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) are involved in signal transduction leading {{to the production of}} such a defensive response, we studied the HR in this plant system after treatment with G-protein activators alone and PTK inhibitors in the presence of fungal conidia. No changes in the level of IP 3 were detected in response to the treatment with the G-protein activators cholera toxin or mastoparan, although the HR was observed in response to these compounds as determined by the scoparone synthesis. On the contrary, the PTK inhibitors <b>lavendustin</b> A and 2, 5 -dihidroxy methyl cinnamate (DHMC) not only prevented the IP 3 changes observed in response to the fungal inoculation of lemon seedlings but also blocked the development of the HR. These results suggest that the IP 3 changes observed in response to A. alternata require a PTK activity and are the result of a G-protein independent Phospholipase C activity, even though the activation of a G-protein can also lead {{to the development of a}} HR. Therefore, it appears that more than one signaling pathway may be activated for the development of HR in lemon seedlings: one involving a G-protein and the other involving a PTK-dependent PLC...|$|E
40|$|An {{impressive}} body {{of evidence}} has been accumulated indicating that local protein synthesis is implicated in navigation of neurite extension induced by guidance cues, such as semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A). We found previously that a Src type tyrosine kinase Fyn and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk 5) mediate Sema 3 A-signaling. We also showed that Sema 3 A elicits axonal transport through neuropilin- 1, a receptor for Sema 3 A, located at the growth cones. Here, we investigate the relationship between Sema 3 A-induced local signaling, protein synthesis, and axonal transport. <b>Lavendustin</b> A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and olomoucine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, suppressed Sema 3 A-induced facilitation of anterograde and retrograde axonal transport in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron with and without the cell body. Sema 3 A-induced facilitation of axonal transport was attenuated in DRG neurons of fyn- (fyn �/ �) and a Cdk 5 activator, p 35 (p 35 �/ �) -deficient mice when {{compared with those of}} wild-type or heterozygous mice. Inhibition of protein synthesis suppressed Sema 3 A-induced facilitation of axonal transport in the DRG neuron with and without the cell body.

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) {{is known}} to be an {{extremely}} aggressive and malignant form of anaplastic arythrocytoma affecting the central nervous system in humans. Due to its worse prognosis leading to high mortality rate over the years, there is an urgent need to deviate from conventional surgical and radiation therapeutic treatments and delve into molecular targeted drug therapy techniques. Epiderma Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR) and its mutant version of EGFRvIII are known to be overexpressed case of GBM resulting in high rate of proliferation and failure in cell cycle arrest. EGFRvIII is expressed in about 62 % of GBM cases and are self-activating receptors independent of ligands. This project is undertaken for the study of potential inhibitors for EGFRvIII mutant using bioinformatics tool. Thirteen of commercially available EGFR inhibitors were docked against EGFRvIII protein and stability of the docked results was based on their free binding energy values. The result was compared with that of Gefitinib and Erlotinib, the established inhibitors of EGFR. PD 153035, <b>Lavendustin</b> A and BIBX- 1328 BS were found to be the most suitable inhibitor for EGFRvIII, which can be proposed for wet-lab testing as molecular targeted drug therapy for GBM. Further, few structural modifications on two of these ligands were performed and in-silico docking analysis was repeated to check for more potential alternatives which can prove to be favourable inhibitors...|$|E

At high toxin concentrations (500 ng/ 10 (7) cells), Luk-PV and Alv led to a decreased IL- 8 generation from LMBs within the first 30 min; with PMNs, a slight increase in IL- 8 release was observed. Under these conditions, stimulation with ETA did not lead to an altered cellular IL- 8 release. At lower concentrations (5 and 0. 5 ng/ 10 (7) cells), all three toxins led to a continuous increase (over 16 h) in IL- 8 release and IL- 8 mRNA expression of PMNs and LMBs. Preincubation of the cells with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors <b>lavendustin</b> A and tyrphostin 25 led to a reduction of the toxin-mediated effects on IL- 8 release and IL- 8 mRNA expression when Luk-PV and Alv were used as stimuli. In contrast, IL- 8 synthesis in cells which were stimulated with ETA was not influenced by protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. From our data, one may suggest that multiple pathways for IL- 8 production are operative in human leukocytes...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of protein}} {{tyrosine}} kinases on glutamate release was investigated by determining {{the effect of}} broad range inhibitors of tyrosine kinases on the release of glutamate from rat hippocampal synaptosomes. We found that <b>lavendustin</b> A and herbimycin A did not inhibit glutamate release stimulated by 15  mM KCl, but genistein, also a broad range inhibitor of tyrosine kinases did inhibit the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration response to KCl and, concomitantly, decreased glutamate release evoked by the same stimulus, in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were not observed with the inactive analogue genistin. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism whereby genistein modulates Ca 2 + influx and glutamate release. Studies with voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel inhibitors showed that [omega]-conotoxin GVIA did not further inhibit glutamate release or the Ca 2 + influx stimulated by KCl {{in the presence of}} genistein. This tyrosine kinase inhibitor and [omega]-agatoxin IVA had a partially additive effect on those events. Nitrendipine did not reduce significantly the KCl-induced responses. Genistein further reduced Ca 2 + influx in response to KCl in the presence of nitrendipine, [omega]-conotoxin GVIA and [omega]-agatoxin IVA, simultaneously. The effect of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors was also tested on the influx of Ca 2 + and on glutamate release stimulated by KCl-depolarization.

Transcript abundance of Ppc 1, a gene encoding the CAM-specific isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, increased rapidly in response to osmotic stress (dehydration and mannitol), ionic stress (NaCl), and exogenous abscisic acid treatment, but failed to accumulate in response to exogenous cytokinin or methyl jasmonate. Stress-induced accumulation of Ppc 1, GapC 1, and Mdh 1 transcripts was inhibited by pretreating leaves with the calcium chelator ethyleneglycol-bis(aminoethyl ether) -N,N′-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that extracellular calcium participates in signaling events leading to CAM induction. Treatment of unstressed detached leaves with ionomycin, a Ca 2 + ionophore, and thapsigargin, a Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitor, enhanced Ppc 1 transcript accumulation, indicating that elevations in cytosolic [Ca 2 +] are likely to participate in signaling CAM induction. Inhibitors of Ca 2 +- or calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (N-[6 -aminohexyl]- 5 -chloro- 1 -napthalenesulfonamide, <b>Lavendustin</b> C) and protein phosphatase 1 and 2 A (okadaic acid) activity suppressed Ppc 1 transcript accumulation in response to ionic and osmotic stresses, as well as abscisic acid treatment.

These data suggest that activation of an erbstatin sensitive tyrosine kinase is an important step upstream of calcium channel activation in the second messenger pathway underlying the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by a variety of CAMs, and that this kinase is not required for integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth...|$|E
