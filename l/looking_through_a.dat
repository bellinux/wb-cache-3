5|$|I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} I Can See the Whole Room!) is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is {{a painting of}} a man <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> hole in a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E

5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults {{to have their own}} casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse and skirt ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar sweater, blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E

25|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) depicts a man <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{hole in a}} door. It was sold by {{collector}} Courtney Sale Ross for $43 million, double its estimate, at Christie's in New York City in 2011; the seller's husband, Steve Ross had acquired it at auction in 1988 for $2.1 million. The painting measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil.|$|E
25|$|Another subject given 4mg {{complained of}} “chest oppression” and that “a load is {{pressing}} {{down from above}} and my body feels heavy.” The subject also reported “numbness of the entire body” and “a pleasant Martini feeling-my body is taking charge of my mind”. The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, {{as if he were}} <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> lens filter.|$|E

25|$|Whenever a ray {{of light}} moves from one medium to another (for example, when light enters a sheet of glass after {{travelling}} through air), some portion of the light is reflected from the surface (known as the interface) between the two media. This can be observed when <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> window, for instance, where a (weak) reflection from {{the front and back}} surfaces of the window glass can be seen. The strength of the reflection depends on the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media, as well as the angle of the surface to the beam of light. The exact value can be calculated using the Fresnel equations.|$|E
25|$|In the Spiderwick universe, faeries usually remain {{invisible}} or disguised {{to human}} eyes, who {{are generally not}} aware of their presence. However, {{a small percentage of}} humans have the ability to see faeries, commonly called the 'Sight', acquired naturally (for example, by being the seventh son of a seventh son or having red hair) or artificially (by <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> holed stone or possessing a four-leafed clover). In the series, the Grace children receive the Sight when the hobgoblin Hogsqueal spits in their eyes, and the Vargas kids receive it when they are held under the water that a nixie had been soaking in.|$|E
25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties that glass and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E

25|$|Live {{cells in}} {{particular}} generally lack sufficient contrast {{to be studied}} successfully, since the internal structures of the cell are colorless and transparent. The most common way to increase contrast is to stain the different structures with selective dyes, but this often involves killing and fixing the sample. Staining may also introduce artifacts, which are apparent structural details that are caused by the processing of the specimen and are thus not legitimate features of the specimen. In general, these techniques make use of differences in the refractive index of cell structures. It is comparable to <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> glass window: you (bright field microscopy) don't see the glass but merely the dirt on the glass. There is a difference, as glass is a denser material, and this creates a difference in phase of the light passing through. The human eye is not sensitive to this difference in phase, but clever optical solutions have been devised to change this difference in phase into a difference in amplitude (light intensity).|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens as if it were an object at that location, so that second lens could again focus that light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This is exactly what the eye does when <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> magnifying glass. The magnifying glass creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the magnifying glass, but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E
25|$|Its story {{focuses on}} the trials of a young cop named Charlie, played by Geoffrey Kennedy, who at the {{beginning}} receives a phone call summoning him for what is presumably his first job. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of him standing next to his older brother Brian, played by Brian Krause, {{who is also a}} cop. The film then begins playing the song “Spore” as Charlie joins his brother and a third cop as they enter a residence where they find a dead girl and arrest two thugs, one played by Todd La Torre, as they return to the scene with a bag full of money. The second thug lunges at Brian when he pilfers some of the cash but Charlie restrains him. Later, the chief of police, played by R.J. Adams, is seen <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> window as the second thug is telling a detective to just ask Charlie about what Brian did during the bust. The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief to remind him that his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well and picks up the phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged at his brother for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E

500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was lost}} until Cristina Dazzi discovered {{it in the}} summer of 1997 in the home of the Dazzi family, Casa Cini, in San Marcello Pistoiese. She was <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> box of old papers, searching for [...] "something interesting" [...] to add to an exhibit about the winter of 182728 when the poet Giacomo Leopardi had visited and met Lady Mountcashell and her daughter. Excerpts were first published in an Italian book about Lady Mountcashell by Mario Curreli in 1997. One year later, Percy Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft biographer Claire Tomalin published the entire story, along with a lengthy introduction and a typescript of the manuscript.|$|E
500|$|The DVD boxset for season eight was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on August 15, 2006, nine years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, Animatics, and commentaries for every episode. As with the previous season, the set {{was released}} in two different packagings: a [...] "Collector's Edition" [...] plastic packaging molded to look like Maggie's head, and a standard rectangular cardboard box featuring Maggie <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> photo album {{while the rest of}} the Simpsons family are taking a picture. The menus continue the same format from the previous three seasons, and the overall theme is various characters posing for photographs.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Robert Shelton {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s, Dylan was {{frequently}} criticized for [...] "selling out" [...] and that people were pressuring him {{to go back to his}} earlier trend of composing protest songs. For Shelton, who noted the promotional photo for [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] depicting Dylan <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> camera, the track expressed Dylan's wish just to be an observer, and not a political activist. Author Seth Rogovoy similarly interpreted the song as Dylan's desire to ignore politics and avoid getting involved in people's disputes. The line [...] " [...] keeps on rollin', though/No matter ... which way the wind does blow" [...] has been heard by writers Peter Vernezze and Carl J. Porter as evidence of Dylan's conviction that [...] "the river of time, the flow of facts, in reality remains unaffected by winds of beliefs, the flow of changing opinions." ...|$|E
