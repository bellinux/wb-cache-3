40|$|Responses of {{cortical}} neurons to sensory stimuli {{within their}} receptive fields can be profoundly altered by the stimulus context. In visual and somatosensory cortex, contextual interactions {{have been shown}} to change sign from facilitation to suppression depending on stimulus strength. Contextual modulation of high contrast stimuli tends to be suppressive, but for low contrast stimuli tends to be facilitative. This trade-off may optimize contextual integration by cortical cells, and has been suggested to be a general feature of cortical processing, but it remains unknown whether a similar phenomenon occurs in auditory cortex. Here we used whole cell and single unit recordings to investigate how contextual interactions in auditory cortical neurons depend on the relative intensity of masker and probe stimuli in a two-tone stimulus paradigm. We tested the hypothesis that relatively low <b>level</b> <b>probes</b> should show facilitation, whereas relatively high <b>level</b> <b>probes</b> should show suppression. We found that contextual interactions were primarily suppressive across all <b>probe</b> <b>levels,</b> and that relatively low <b>level</b> <b>probes</b> were subject to stronger suppression than high <b>level</b> <b>probes.</b> These results were virtually identical for spiking and subthreshold responses. This suggests that, unlike visual cortical neurons, auditory cortical neurons show maximal suppression rather than facilitation for relatively weak stimuli...|$|R

50|$|Dominion {{operates}} {{the project in}} a run-of-river mode whereby flows through the turbines and/or over the spillway crest (elevation 656 feet msl) equal inflow to the project reservoir, as follows. Through use of a <b>level</b> <b>probe</b> equipped with an alarm and a video camera, Dominion ensures that a continuous veil of flow occurs over the 1,500-foot-long spillway. When river flows are between the maximum and minimum hydraulic capacity of the powerhouse cubic feet per second (cfs) maximum and 700 cfs minimum, plant operators increase or decrease flows through the turbines to maintain spill over the spillway. When river flow reaches 7,000 cfs, the units are taken off line and all inflow passes over the spillway because the head is insufficient to generate energy due to the increased tailrace elevation. Similarly, when inflow is less than 700 cfs, all inflow passes over the spillway.|$|E

Humic acid at concentrations of up to 100 mg/liter caused only insignificant decreases in test sensitivity.

The outcome of a control experiment ruled out the possibility of accounting for these results in terms of the specific stimuli used in each fade or in terms of the sequential exposure to the three discriminations.

40|$|International audiencePurpose To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} transabdominal probe pressure on prostate positioning with an intramodality ultrasound (US) image-guided-radiotherapy system and to quantify pressure variability over the treatment course. Material and methods 8 prostate cancer patients (group A) and 17 healthy volunteers underwent 3 consecutive US images with increasing probe pressure levels, and 1 CT acquisition for the group A only. Prostate positions were compared after manual registration of the first US image contour projected on 2 others. Group A's pressure levels were quantified by measuring skin-to-skin distances between corresponding CT-US images. The same methodology was used on paired CT/CBCT-US images acquired during treatments of 18 prostate cancer patients {{to determine whether the}} different pressure levels applied to the group A were close to the clinical practices and to quantify pressure variability along the treatment course. Results 84 % of 3 D prostate displacements were above 2 mm for at least one pressure <b>level.</b> <b>Probe</b> pressures deliberately applied were similar to the ones observed clinically. The latter drastically varied between sessions. Conclusion Even with an intramodality system, probe pressure can impact prostate localization because of the pressure variability along the treatment course.

40|$|We {{recorded}} {{responses of}} the gerbil basilar membrane (BM) to wideband tone complexes. The intensity of one component was varied and the effects on the amplitude and phase of the others were assessed. This suppression paradigm enabled us to vary probe frequency and suppressor frequency independently, allowing the use of simple scaling arguments to analyze the spatial buildup of the nonlinear interaction between traveling waves. Most suppressors had the same effects on probe amplitude and phase as did wideband intensity in-crements. The main exception were suppressors above the characteristic frequency (CF) of the recording location, for which the frequency range of most affected probes was not constant, but shifted upward with suppressor frequency. BM displacement reliably pre-dicted the effectiveness of low-side suppressors, but not high-side suppressors. We found “anti-suppression ” of probes well below CF, i. e., suppressor-induced enhance-ment of probe response amplitude. Large (91 cycle) phase effects occurred for above-CF probes. Phase shifts varied nonmonotonically, but systematically, with sup-pressor <b>level,</b> <b>probe</b> frequency, and suppressor frequen-cy, reconciling apparent discrepancies in the literature. The analysis of spatial buildup revealed an accumulation of local effects on the propagation of the traveling wave, with larger BM displacement reducing the local forward gain. The propagation speed of the wave was also affected. With larger BM displacement, the basal portion of the wave slowed down, while the apical part sped up. This framework of spatial buildup of local effects unifies the widely different effects of overall intensity, low-side suppressors, and high-side suppressors on BM responses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Affymetrix GeneChip is {{a widely}} used gene {{expression}} profiling platform. Since the chips were originally designed, the genome databases and gene definitions have been considerably updated. Thus, more accurate interpretation of microarray data requires parallel updating of the specificity of GeneChip probes. We propose a new probe remapping protocol, using the zebrafish GeneChips as an example, by removing nonspecific probes, and grouping the probes into transcript <b>level</b> <b>probe</b> sets using an integrated zebrafish genome annotation. This genome annotation is based on combining transcript information from multiple databases. This new remapping protocol, especially the new genome annotation, is shown here {{to be an important}} factor in improving the interpretation of gene expression microarray data. Results Transcript data from the RefSeq, GenBank and Ensembl databases were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser, and integrated to generate a combined zebrafish genome annotation. Affymetrix probes were filtered and remapped according to the new annotation. The influence of transcript collection and gene definition methods was tested using two microarray data sets. Compared to remapping using a single database, this new remapping protocol results in up to 20 % more probes being retained in the remapping, leading to approximately 1, 000 more genes being detected. The differentially expressed gene lists are consequently increased by up to 30 %. We are also able to detect up to three times more alternative splicing events. A small number of the bioinformatics predictions were confirmed using real-time PCR validation. Conclusions By combining gene definitions from multiple databases, it is possible to greatly increase the numbers of genes and splice variants that can be detected in microarray gene expression experiments. </p...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{cochlear}} implants utilize interleaved {{presentation of}} pulses on different electrodes to avoid physical interference among multiple current fields, yet neural interaction still exists. In the present study, masking was examined with four Nucleus 24 users with the banded electrode array in an interleaved masking paradigm, where a probe stimulus was interleaved with a masker stimulus. Spatial and temporal aspects of masking were addressed by fixing the masker {{at the middle}} of the electrode array and changing the location of the probe and by testing various stimulation rates: 125, 500, 2, 000, and 6, 410  Hz. In addition, growth of masking (GOM) was assessed by changing the masker level in six steps. Results indicated that masking patterns were generally much wider, regardless of stimulation rate, than those in acoustic hearing. The amount of masking decreased from the peak at the rate of approximately 0. 5  dB/mm even at the highest masker level. The pattern of GOM with the rates higher than 500  Hz was different from that observed in previous masking studies, characterized by markedly shallow growth at low masker levels or overall shallow growth. A facilitating effect of the masker (lowering the threshold) was suspected, except for the 125 -Hz condition, due to the fibers that were subliminally excited, but not discharged, by the masker with local perturbations of membrane potentials, and were subsequently discharged easily by a lower <b>level</b> <b>probe</b> when the temporal gap between masker and probe was sufficiently short. These results suggest that both refractory characteristics of neurons and neural summation be considered in interleaved stimulation of pulses at high, but clinically relevant, stimulation rates. Overall, the present masking study might provide a basis for models in psychophysics and speech understanding in current cochlear implant systems utilizing high-rate interleaved stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The North endcap {{calorimeter}} {{vessel was}} recieved on July 1, 1990. A cooldown {{of the pressure}} vessel with liquid nitrogen was performed on July 10 - 11 to check the vessel's integrity. With the pressure vessel cold, the insulating vacuum was monitored for leaks. Through out the testing, the insulating vacuum remained good and the vessel passed the test. The cold test was carried out per the procedures of D-Zero engineering note 3740. 220 -EN- 250. The test was {{very similar to the}} cold test performed on the Central Calorimeter in October of 1987. Reference D-Zero engineering notes 3740. 210 -EN- 122, 3740. 000 -EN 107, and 3740. 210 -EN- 110 for information about the CC cold test. The insulating vacuum space was pumped on while equipment was being connected to the pressure vessel. Two hours after starting to pump with the blower the vacuum space pressure was at about 210 microns. Pumping on the vacuum space for the next 15 hours showed no progress and a leak detector was connected to the pumping line. A leak check showed a leak in a thermocouple feedthru on the vacuum space relief plate. After fixing the leak, the pressure dropped to 16 microns in less than one hour. A rate of rise test was performed starting at a pressure of 13 microns. The pressure rose to 39 microns within 8 minutes and then only rose to 43 microns in 2. 5 hours (1. 6 microns/hour). After all connections were made to the pressure vessel, a vacuum pump with an estimated effective pumping speed of about 70 scfm was valved on. The lowest pressure achieved after 2 days of pumping was 80 microns. Valving out the pump for 30 minutes resulted in a 5 micron per minute rate of rise. The rate of rise was considered acceptable since there were known leak paths through the bolts of the signal ports. The EC North vessel was rolled outside of Lab A in preparation for a 5000 gallon liquid nitrogen trailer which arrived July, 10 at 8 : 00 am. Before filling the vessel, the vacuum space pump was valved off. The pressure in the vacuum space was 12 microns at that point. During the next 24 hours of the test, the vacuum space pressure decreased to 5 microns. A plot of the vacuum space pressure with time is included {{at the end of this}} note. The liquid nitrogen was pressure transferred from the trailer at 29 psig to the pressure vessel at 1 psig for ten hours. At that time there was sufficient (16 -inch) of liquid nitrogen in the vessel to turn the LN 2 trailer delivery pump on. Thirteen and one half hours after starting the fill, the vessel had 50 -inch of LN 2 collected. During the latter part of the filling, about twelve loud metallic bangs were heard. The noises came at random intervals with sometimes five minutes between and other times an hour between. The best way to describe the sound is to imagine the sound made if someone was trapped inside the vessel with a baseball bat and took a good swing. The trailer was disconnected and the the vessel was left overnight for ten hours. Due to the slow LN 2 fill rate, the temperature gradient in the pressure vessel shell was not very large, only about 25 kelvin difference was found from a RTD in the warm-up nozzle of the vessel and the resistors of the liquid <b>level</b> <b>probe.</b> A temperature versus time graph is included at the end of this note...|$|E
