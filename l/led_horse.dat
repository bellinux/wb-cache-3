25|$|Over the 20-year {{period during}} which the horse murders took place, several {{different}} motivations <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> owners and trainers, often affluent and well-respected people, {{to become involved in}} what ultimately became a widespread conspiracy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take him out," [...] said Grant. [...] "Put him {{on to the}} <b>led</b> <b>horse.</b> If you'll come {{round to}} my place for breakfast, I'll be glad to see you, Muller." ...|$|E
60|$|And he caused {{one of his}} attendants {{to mount}} his own <b>led</b> <b>horse,</b> and give that upon which he had {{hitherto}} ridden to the stranger, who was to serve for a guide.|$|E

60|$|Wrayson {{glanced down}} towards the valley. A couple of wagons and several Kaffir boys with <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> were just {{entering}} the valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you shall. You {{shall have}} proper armor, and shall go on {{teaching}} your art. Take {{one of those}} <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> there, and follow the staff when we move." ...|$|R
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning Sydney Oliphant rode up to the door, {{followed}} by two grooms, one of whom had a <b>led</b> <b>horse,</b> {{and the other a}} sumpter-mule, which was partly laden. Captain Dave went down with Cyril to the door.|$|E
60|$|Jack, rather {{ashamed of}} his suspicions on the {{previous}} night, thanked the mayor warmly. Eight of the troopers took each a <b>led</b> <b>horse.</b> The four countrymen {{in charge of the}} wagons shouted to their oxen, and the party moved out from Estrella.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are undone, Bucklaw! The Master's <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> {{has cast}} himself over his halter in the stable, and is dead lame. His hackney {{will be set}} up with the day's work, {{and now he has}} no fresh horse; he will never get off." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{this time}} Ayesha stood silent, for {{she also had}} dismounted, that the mare she rode and her two <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> might graze with the others. Indeed, she spoke but once, saying--"Thou thinkest this {{adventure}} mad, my Holly? Say, art afraid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the gloom}} {{we came to}} a place, where was an old Arab among some trees, and with him two <b>led</b> <b>horses.</b> The soldier spoke to the Arab, and I gave him Masouda's letter, which he read. Then he put me on one of the <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> and the soldier mounted the other, and we {{departed}} at a gallop. All that evening and last night we rode hard, but in the darkness the soldier left us, and I do not know whither he went. At length we came to that mountain shoulder and waited there, resting the horses and eating food which the Arab had with him, till we saw the embassy, and among them two tall knights.|$|R

60|$|An {{hour later}} {{darkness}} had fallen upon the little city of Lustadt, {{and from a}} small gateway {{in the rear of}} the palace grounds two horsemen rode out into the ill-paved street and turned their mounts' heads toward the north. At the side of one trotted a <b>led</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that is so, Osgod, and heartily glad am I that you showed no genius for smith's work. Nature evidently {{intended}} you to damage casques and armour rather than to repair them. You have not got all my clothes with you," [...] he added, as he looked round at the <b>led</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Tottie {{with the}} <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> {{followed}} his master. I followed the Tottie--close in his steps, {{so as to}} get the benefit of his experience, either by imitating or avoiding his example. We gained the opposite side. I saw the Hottentot's horse rise before me as if mounting a staircase. He slipped, and floundered on his nose and knees. The <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> disconcerted him. Just then my own horse made a bound up the bank, and pawed the mud for a moment. [...] "Slack the reins! give him his head!" [...] shouted Edwards. I did so. With a mighty plunge and a groan the sturdy animal bore me {{to the top of}} the bank in safety. I turned and saw the Tottie's horse throw up its head and fore legs, as if imploringly, to the skies, and fall backwards. The Tottie himself appeared for a moment in the form of a spread-eagle, and then horse and man went back with a sounding splash into the river.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile the sultry heat {{of which}} Joe had {{formerly}} spoken increased considerably, and a rumbling noise, as if of distant thunder, was heard; but the flying hunters {{paid no attention}} to it, for the <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> gave them so much trouble, and retarded their flight so much, that the Indians were gradually and visibly gaining on them.|$|R
60|$|They parted with a long, {{lingering}} {{pressure of}} the hand, which haunted her young palm all night in dreams. Argemone got into the carriage, Lancelot jumped into the dog-cart, took the reins, and relieved his heart by galloping Sandy up the hill, and frightening the returning coachman down one bank and his <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> up the other.|$|R
60|$|She {{managed the}} thing at last, however, and <b>led</b> the <b>horse</b> up towards the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "In this embarrassment the {{deceased}} Feldmarschall found me, {{and noticed that}} the blood was flowing stream-wise from my neck. As I was on foot, and none of my people now near, he bade give me his <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> which he still had [and sent me home for surgery? Winterfeld, handsomely effacing himself when no longer good for anything, hurries on to the Catastrophe, leaving us to guess that he was NOT an eye-witness farther]--bade give me the <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> which he still had; AND [as if that had happened directly after, which surely it did not? AND] snatched the flag from Captain Rohr, who had taken it up to make the Bursche turn, and rode forward with it himself.' But before he could succeed in the attempt, this excellent man, almost in a minute, was hit with five case-shot balls, and fell dead on the ground; as also his brave Adjutant von Platen was so wounded that he died next day.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{scarcely}} {{finished the}} note when, with a clatter of hoofs and a <b>led</b> <b>horse,</b> Breckenridge reappeared {{at the door}} elate and triumphant. [...] "You're in nigger luck, Mad! I found that stole hoss of Judge Boompointer's had got away and strayed among your stock in the corral. Take him and you're safe; he can't be outrun {{this side of the}} state line." ...|$|E
60|$|Washington {{had for a}} {{companion}} in this expedition his friend and neighbor, Dr. Craik, and it was with strong community of feeling they looked forward peaceably to revisit the scenes of their military experience. They {{set out on the}} 5th of October with three negro attendants, two belonging to Washington, and one to the doctor. The whole party was mounted, and there was a <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> for the baggage.|$|E
60|$|Billy dismounted, {{took the}} three bars down, <b>led</b> his <b>horse</b> through, then {{put up the}} bars.|$|R
60|$|Fergus {{walked by}} the side of the soldier as he <b>led</b> the <b>horse</b> round to the stable.|$|R
60|$|Yellow Elk had <b>led</b> the <b>horses</b> {{into the}} water, but the trail {{did not extend}} across the stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "The count's messenger, sir. He reached me at Erfurt, where I {{was with}} Captain Lindsay, four days ago; and I started with him {{half an hour}} later. He had set out from here with a <b>led</b> <b>horse,</b> and had ridden through with but one night in bed; and we had changes of horses, coming back. And Tartar is in good condition, major. I led {{him all the way}} down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's my {{business}} {{to know these}} things. Think we can't {{tell the difference between}} the tracks of a <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> and a ridden one? The only times two horses trot close together at an even distance is when one's rider has both bridles, or when they're yoked to a wagon pole. However, I've come to ask if you can throw any light on the matter? You and Jernyngham were partners, in a way, weren't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was early}} in the {{afternoon}} when the Archibald party took up the line of march for Camp Rob. The two ladies, supplied by Mrs. Sadler with coarse riding-skirts, sat each upon a farm-horse, and Mr. Archibald held the bridle of the one that carried his wife. Matlack and Martin Sanders, {{the young man who}} was to assist him, led the way, while a <b>led</b> <b>horse,</b> loaded with the personal baggage of the travellers, brought up the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man is old and feeble," [...] {{she said}} to her guardian, [...] "the maiden young and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life--Jews though they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity. Let them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the serfs. The mules may {{transport}} the litter, and we have <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> for the old man and his daughter." ...|$|R
60|$|Early {{every morning}} he <b>led</b> the <b>horses</b> {{out to the}} fields, and brought them home safe and sound in the evening.|$|R
60|$|We {{could find}} nothing wrong, however, {{and at last}} I passed over a fifty dollar bill and <b>led</b> the <b>horse</b> away.|$|R
60|$|The master cast a rapid glance around him. In his quickness of {{perception}} {{he had already}} noted that the <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> among the cavalcade was fastened by a lariat {{to one of the}} riders so that escape by flight was impossible, and that he had not a single weapon to defend himself with or even provoke, in his desperation, the struggle that could forestall ignominy by death. Nothing was left him but his voice, clear and trenchant as he faced them.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} he was on Charlie's back, the line {{of one of the}} best horses was in his hand, and almost before Cameron knew what he was about he was flying down the valley like the wind. Charlie often {{stretched}} out at full speed to please his young master, but seldom had he been urged forward as he was upon this occasion. The <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> being light and wild, kept well up, and, in a marvellously short space of time, they were at Ten-mile Creek.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he heard}} a distant angry shout. To his first hurried glance the plain had seemed empty, but, looking up, he saw two {{horsemen}} rapidly advancing with a <b>led</b> <b>horse</b> behind them--his own. With the blessed sense of relief that overtook him now came the fevered desire for sympathy and to tell them all. But as they came nearer he {{saw that they were}} Gildersleeve, the scout, and Henry Benham, and that, far from sharing any delight in his deliverance, their faces only exhibited irascible impatience. Overcome by this new defeat, the boy stopped, again dumb and dogged.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh!' cried Nuttie, with a {{prolonged}} intonation. 'Is it?--Oh, Mark! {{did you do}} it that night when you <b>led</b> the <b>horse</b> home?' ...|$|R
60|$|Without further ado Captain Moore {{was forced}} to march along, {{between two of the}} red men, while a third <b>led</b> his <b>horse.</b>|$|R
60|$|Two minutes later, {{the party}} rode off. Jim was, like the rest, mounted, {{as they would}} travel fast. Four <b>led</b> <b>horses</b> carried provisions; for they would not, as before, find food by the way. It was {{two o'clock in the}} day when they started, and they rode thirty miles before they halted, for the night, at a water hole. They had seen no signs of natives during the day, but Reuben at once posted four men as sentries.|$|R
