60|$|Six months' residence, and a {{whole year}} before the divorce could be granted! Honora looked at the plush rocking-chair, the yellow-and-red carpet, the {{inevitable}} ice-water on the marble-topped table, and {{the picture of a}} lady the shape of a <b>liqueur</b> <b>bottle</b> playing tennis in the late eighties, and sighed. For one who is sensitive to surroundings, that room was a torture chamber.|$|E
6000|$|There are rooms which {{refuse to}} give away their owners, and rooms which seem to say: 'They really are like this.' Of such was Rosamund Larne's--a sort of {{permanent}} confession, seeming to remark to anyone who entered: 'Her taste? Well, you can see--cheerful and exuberant; her habits--yes, she sits here all the morning in a dressing-gown, smoking cigarettes and dropping ink; kindly observe my carpet. Notice the piano--it has a look of coming and going, according to the exchequer. This very deep-cushioned sofa is permanent, however; the water-colours on the walls are safe, too--they're by herself. Mark the scent of mimosa--she likes flowers, and likes them strong. No clock, of course. Examine the bureau--she is obviously always ringing for [...] "the drumstick," [...] and saying: [...] "Where's this, Ellen, and where's that? You naughty gairl, you've been tidying." [...] Cast an eye on that pile of manuscript--she has evidently a genius for composition; it flows off her pen--like Shakespeare, she never blots a line. See how she's had the electric light put in, instead of that horrid gas; but try and turn either of them on--you can't; last quarter isn't paid, of course; and she uses an oil lamp, {{you can tell that}} by the ceiling: The dog over there, who will not answer to the name of 'Carmen,' a Pekinese spaniel like a little Djin, all prominent eyes rolling their blacks, and no nose between--yes, Carmen looks as if she didn't know what was coming next; she's right--it's a pet-and-slap-again life! Consider, too, the fittings of the tea-tray, rather soiled, though not quite tin, but I say unto you that no millionaire's in all its glory ever had a <b>liqueur</b> <b>bottle</b> on it.' ...|$|E
50|$|Ramazzotti is an Italian digestivo bitter <b>liqueur</b> Amaro, <b>bottled</b> at 30% alcohol by volume. It is bottled in Milan by Pernod Ricard.|$|R
5000|$|Crème de banane (...) is a sweet, banana-flavored <b>liqueur,</b> usually <b>bottled</b> at 17%-25% ABV. It {{is mostly}} used in {{alcoholic}} drinks {{but also in}} cooking; it is an ingredient of various cocktails and desserts.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin helped {{himself to}} a <b>liqueur</b> from the <b>bottle</b> by his side.|$|R
5000|$|Maple <b>liqueur</b> — sold <b>bottled</b> as Sortilege, this drink {{combines}} Canadian whisky {{and maple}} syrup ...|$|R
50|$|Rock and Rye {{is a term}} (both generically {{and brand}} names) for a <b>bottled</b> <b>liqueur</b> or mixed {{cocktail}} composed of rye whiskey and rock candy (crystallized sugar).|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the bottles}} {{came from his}} {{bottling}} plant as {{the bottom of the}} bottles reveal. There is a large variety of bottles that were used for many products, including drinks, wine, beer, and <b>liqueur.</b> The <b>bottles</b> were not only round, but oblong in shape as well. The bottles are arranged with clear bottles and brown color bottles {{on the front of the}} house to spell [...] "HAPPY HOME." ...|$|R
60|$|There is no solid {{furniture}} {{except a}} sideboard which stands {{against the wall}} between the vestibule door and the pavilion, a small writing table with a blotter, a rack for telegram forms and stationery, and a wastepaper basket, standing {{out in the hall}} near the sideboard, and a lady's worktable, with two chairs at it, towards {{the other side of the}} lounge. The writing table has also two chairs at it. On the sideboard there is a tantalus, <b>liqueur</b> <b>bottles,</b> a syphon, a glass jug of lemonade, tumblers, and every convenience for casual drinking. Also a plate of sponge cakes, and a highly ornate punchbowl in the same style as the keramic display in the pavilion. Wicker chairs and little bamboo tables with ash trays and boxes of matches on them are scattered in all directions. In the pavilion, which is flooded with sunshine, is the elaborate patent swing seat and awning in which Johnny reclines with his novel. There are two wicker chairs right and left of him.|$|R
60|$|There {{were others}} who took Peter Ruff {{by the hand}} then. The {{servants}} were handing round coffee in little Sevres cups. On the sideboard was a choice of <b>liqueurs</b> and <b>bottles</b> of wine. Peter Ruff found himself hospitably entertained with both small talk and refreshments. But {{every now and then}} his eyes wandered back to where Madame sat in her chair, her hair as white as snow--beautiful still, in spite of the cruel mouth and the narrow eyes.|$|R
60|$|They {{were sitting}} {{out on the}} great stone balcony behind the palace--Ughtred, Reist, and Marie, Mr. Van Decht and Sara. A servant in spotless white livery had silently {{arranged}} coffee and <b>liqueur</b> in strange-looking <b>bottles</b> upon a table already laden with fruit. Below them were the terraced lawns leading to the river, dotted with dark fir-trees and flowering shrubs--beyond the red roofs and white fronts of many villas, in the distance the blue mountains. The King and Sara Van Decht were sitting side by side. Marie, unusually taciturn, {{leaned back in her}} chair, listening and watching with half-closed eyes.|$|R
60|$|Wingate {{took his}} place, and the {{conversation}} merged into those indefinite channels necessitated {{by the presence of}} servants. The dinner, simple though it was, was perfect,--iced consomme, a lobster mayonnaise, cold cutlets and asparagus. Presently the little movable sideboard, with its dainty collection of cold dishes and salads, was wheeled outside by the solitary maid who waited upon them, and nothing was left upon the table but a delicately-shaped Venetian decanter of Château Yquem, <b>liqueurs</b> in tiny <b>bottles,</b> the coffee served in a jug of beaten copper, and an ivory box of cigarettes. With the closing of the door, a different atmosphere seemed immediately created. They smiled into one another's eyes in mutual appreciation.|$|R
