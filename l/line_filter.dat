5|$|An atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> (ALF) is an {{advanced}} optical band-pass filter {{used in the}} physical sciences for filtering electromagnetic radiation with precision, accuracy, and minimal signal strength loss. Atomic line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of atomic vapors and so may also be designated an atomic resonance filter (ARF).|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> {{may be a}} collimator, which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used here to block light.|$|E
5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the vapor cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
40|$|Charts {{relating}} the capacitance to the width, spacing, thickness and height {{above the ground}} plane of coupled microstrips have been obtained. These are used to design hairpin line and hybrid hairpin <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> as well as multiplexers using microstrip comb <b>line</b> <b>filters.</b> The experimental results agree reasonably well with the design specifications. Getsinger's original charts for parallel coupled bars between parallel plates have been formulated for the microstrip case. Corresponding charts {{relating the}} capacitances to the width, spacing, thickness and height above the ground plane of coupled microstrips have been obtained. Examples {{of the use of}} these charts are shown in the design of hairpin lines and hybrid hairpin <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> as well as multiplexers using comb <b>line</b> <b>filters.</b> The hairpin line/hybrid hairpin <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> were designed to operate at a central frequency of 9 ÃÂ· 5 GHz with 11 per cent bandwidth and 0 ÃÂ· 5 dB ripple. The three filters constituting the comb <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> have center frequencies of 2 ÃÂ· 4, 3 ÃÂ· 0 and 3 ÃÂ· 6 GHz. The components so designed were fabricated and tested. The dielectric used for the microstrip was teflon. Experimental curves for the attenuation (insertion loss) and VSWR are given. The design specifications arc satisfied quite well...|$|R

5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> {{absorbs the}} desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|The next {{component}} in an atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> is the vapor cell; this {{is common to}} all atomic line filters. It either absorbs and re-emits the incident light, or rotates its polarization by the Faraday or Voigt effect. Following the vapor cell is a low-pass filter, designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not, except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence. In Faraday and Voigt filters, a second polarizing plate is used here.|$|E

5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled <b>line</b> <b>filter,</b> {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E
500|$|Radiation {{trapping}} in {{an atomic}} <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> may seriously affect {{the performance and}} therefore tuning of an ALF. In the original studies of atomic line filters in the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a [...] "large overestimation of the [...] ". Later, radiation trapping was studied, analyzed and ALFs were optimized to account for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{predecessor}} of {{the atomic}} <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> was the infrared quantum counter, designed in the 1950s by Nicolaas Bloembergen. This was a quantum mechanical amplifier theorized by Joseph Weber to detect infrared radiation with very little noise. Zero spontaneous emission was already possible for x-ray and gamma ray amplifiers and Weber thought to bring this technology to the infrared spectrum. Bloembergen described such a device in detail and dubbed it the [...] "infrared quantum counter".|$|E
40|$|For the {{switched}} mode power supply (SMPS) power <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> are invariably used {{to meet the}} conducted emission limits of various standards. Most SMPS units generate excessive noise emission in the low frequency region up to 1 MHz where the <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> should have good insertion loss. The large differential mode choke is not an ideal solution from the storage charge discharge noise point of view. An analysis is made and experimental results are presented...|$|R

50|$|SAW devices use SAWs in {{electronic}} components {{to provide a}} number of different functions, including delay <b>lines,</b> <b>filters,</b> correlators and DC to DC converters.|$|R
500|$|The {{principles}} hitherto {{employed in}} infrared amplification were put {{together into a}} passive sodium ALF. This design and those that immediately followed it were primitive and suffered from low quantum efficiency and slow response time. As this was the original design for ALFs, many references use only the designation [...] "atomic line filter" [...] to describe specifically the absorption-re-emission construction. In 1977, Gelbwachs, Klein and Wessel created the first active atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{technical}} {{definition of an}} atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> is as an [...] "ultra-narrow-band, large-acceptance-angle, isotropic optical filter". [...] "Ultra-narrow-band" [...] defines the thin range of frequencies that an ALF may accept; an ALF generally has a passband {{on the order of}} 0.001nanometer. That atomic line filters also have wide acceptance angles (near 180°) is another important characteristic of the devices; conventional dielectric filters based on the spacing of reflective or refractive layers change their effective spacing when light enters at an angle.|$|E
500|$|The {{response}} time of an absorption-re-emission atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> directly affects the rate information {{is transmitted from}} the light source to the receiver. Therefore, a minimal {{response time}} is an important property of these ALFs. The response time of such an ALF, is largely dependent on the spontaneous decay of the excited atoms in the vapor cell. In 1988, Jerry Gelbwachs cited, [...] "typical rapid spontaneous emission times are ~ 30ns, {{which suggests that the}} upper limit on the information rate is approximately 30 MHz".|$|E
50|$|Coupling {{elements}} {{together with}} impedance transformer lines {{is not the}} most compact design. Other methods of coupling have been developed, especially for band-pass filters that are far more compact. These include parallel <b>lines</b> <b>filters,</b> interdigital filters, hairpin filters, and the semi-lumped design combline filters.|$|R
500|$|The {{three major}} types of atomic <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> are absorption-re-emission ALFs, Faraday filters and Voigt filters. Absorption-re-emission filters {{were the first}} type developed, and so are {{commonly}} called simply [...] "atomic line filters"; the other two types are usually referred to specifically as [...] "Faraday filters" [...] or [...] "Voigt filters". [...] Atomic <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> use different mechanisms and designs for different applications, but the same basic strategy is always employed: {{by taking advantage of}} the narrow lines of absorption or resonance in a metallic vapor, a specific frequency of light bypasses a series of filters that block all other light.|$|R
50|$|Etherloop uses {{half-duplex}} transmission, and as such, is {{less susceptible}} to interference caused by poor line quality, bridge taps, etc. Also, etherloop modems can train up through <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> (although it is not recommended to do this).|$|R
500|$|Other {{systems may}} be used in {{conjunction}} with the rest of an atomic <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> for practicality. For instance, the polarizers used in the actual Faraday filter don't block most radiation, [...] "because these polarizers only work over a limited wavelength region ... a broad band interference filter is used in conjunction with the Faraday filter". The passband of the interference filter may be 200 times that of the actual filter. Photomultiplier tubes, too, are often used for increasing the intensity of the output signal to a usable level. Avalanche photomultipliers, which are more efficient, {{may be used}} instead of a PMT.|$|E
500|$|Without {{an atomic}} <b>line</b> <b>filter,</b> laser {{tracking}} and communication may be difficult. Usually, intensified charge-coupled device cameras {{must be used}} in conjunction with simple dielectric optical filters (e.g. interference filters) to detect laser emissions at a distance. Intensified CCDs are inefficient and necessitate the use of a pulsed laser transmission within the visible spectrum. With the superior filtering system of an ALF, a non-intensified CCD may be used with a continuous wave laser more efficiently. [...] " [...] with passbands of about 0.001nm have been developed to improve the background rejection of conventionally filtered laser receivers". The total energy consumption of the latter system is [...] "30 to 35 times less" [...] than that of the former, so space-based, underwater and agile laser communications with ALFs have been proposed and developed.|$|E
2500|$|Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) or Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) {{suppression}} film capacitors, {{also known}} as [...] "AC <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> safety capacitors" [...] or [...] "Safety capacitors", are used as crucial components to reduce or suppress electrical noise caused by the operation of electrical or electronic equipment, while also limited providing protection against electrical shocks.|$|E
500|$|Active atomic <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> {{are more}} likely to produce noise than passive ones because actives have no [...] "state selectivity"; the pumping source may accidentally excite atoms hit by the wrong light up to the {{critical}} energy level, emitting radiation spontaneously.|$|R

500|$|Atomic <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> can be {{considered}} the optical equivalent of lock-in amplifiers; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal (almost always laser light) {{that would otherwise be}} obscured by broadband sources, such as daylight. [...] They are used regularly in Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems. Atomic <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as interference filters and Lyot filters, but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background-limited detection, where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background. [...] Compared to etalons, another high-end optical filter, Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around US$15,000 per unit.|$|R
