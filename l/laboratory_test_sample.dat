40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{whether there is a}} relationship between the total BP dose administered and the variations in serum CTX concentration. Study design: The study included 50 patients requiring dental implant surgery and treated with oral BPs, seen in an Oral Surgery and Implantology Unit between January 2007 and June 2009. The patients were divided into two groups: those in which the medication was not suspended before obtaining the <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>sample,</b> and those patients referred from other dental clinics in which BPs was suspended before reporting to our Unit. The total drug dosage administered and the total dose per kilogram body weight were evaluated for comparison with serum CTX. The data obtained were correlated to the osteonecrosis risk table developed by Marx et al. in 2007. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups in relation to the total administered dose and the dose in mg/kg b. w. Likewise, in both groups no relationship was observed between the serum CTX value and the total administered dose or the dose in mg/kg b. w. No differences were found between the two patien...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} drivers aged 50 - 90 {{was carried out}} to assess which, if any, {{of a range of}} {{measures}} were useful in predicting on-road performance. The study had three phases. In Phase One almost 2000 drivers completed an extensive self-report questionnaire, the Aging Driver Questionnaire, or ADQ. In the ADQ they described their personal and driving history, their driving behaviour and their attitudes and opinions on a variety of driving issues. Measures of general health, personality and intelligence were also taken. In Phase Two a subsample of those completing the ADQ (N= 600) completed an extensive battery of laboratory tests of their cognitive and physiological capacities. In Phase Three 200 of this <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> completed two assessed on-road drives. The key results were that a) scores on the Manchester Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) showed that relatively high levels of errors and lapses behind the wheel were predictive of involvement in active accidents, while passive accident involvement was associated with a relatively high number of lapses, b) lapses were also associated with some indices of onroad performance, c) in general, performance on the cognitive and physiological laboratory tests was not associated with on-road performance and c) the best predictor of on-road performance was a relatively good score on a multiple choice test of driving knowledge, an assessment of driving knowledge offered in multiple choice format...|$|E
40|$|WhisperGenTM {{heater head}} {{components}} are currently machined from the {{austenitic stainless steel}} Sandvik 253 MA. The inner surface of the heater heads is subjected to the working gas of the engine, which is a high-pressure, high-temperature nitrogen-based environment with carbonaceous impurities. As {{a result of this}} exposure, a scale forms during operation and eventually spalls. This spalled scale causes abrasive damage to piston seals and guides, which leads to pressure loss and eventual failure of the engine. The aim of the present work was to compare the performance of the austenitic alloy 253 MA with two alternative alloys, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310, thereby enabling a material recommendation. A literature review provided information about many general aspects of high temperature corrosion in similar alloys. However, little was found about the application of these alloys in environments similar to those experienced by a WhisperGenTM heater head. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to indicate the relative performance characteristics of the three potential alloys (253 MA, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310). To overcome the difficulties with testing at high temperatures and pressures, Thermo-Calc™ was used to calculate gas mixtures at 1 bar that approximated the chemical potentials of carbon and nitrogen in the working gas at 24 bar. Comparisons of the different materials were made via weight loss/gain measurements and metallographic analysis, which included optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray mapping and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). The <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> results were also compared with results from heater heads of the same materials that were run in an actual WhisperGenTM engine. The experimental results taken in total indicate that 253 MA is the least suitable alloy for the heater head application because it exhibited poor spalling performance, internal oxidation and formation of a large amount of Cr 23 C 6. AISI 310 was shown in all cases to develop the detrimental sigma phase, although this alloy was the least susceptible to internal oxidation. Incoloy 800 H was the most resistant alloy to all forms of degradation and is thus recommended for the heater head application...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the several}} types of induced {{polarization}} effects, electro-osmosis and membrane polarization by constrictivity of pores my result in non-linear behaviour, i. e. chargeability is not constant with supplied dc current. A new model, based on the second Fick’s equation succeeded in predicting, on laboratory samples, this behaviour. In fact, The non-linear behaviour was shown to correlate well with Pore Size Distribution (PSD) of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tested</b> <b>samples</b> whose PSD distribution was measured experimentally using a mercury injection capillary pressure test method. The model predicts also the non-linearity of the electrical resistivity for sufficiently high current densities. In this paper, we show that non-linear behaviour of resistivity and chargeability vs. supplied current density can be met in field measurements, provided they are carefully planned. In a site located in Northern Apennines, where a saturated sandstone outcrops, different values of resistivity and chargeability were obtained at different supplied electric current whose achieved results agree with the forward model. Moreover, the non-linearity can also perturb TEM data as being affected by this IP effect, as the model predicts a dependence of non-linearity also on the current supply length. An example of anomalous TEM data collected in Northern Apennines is also presented and discussed...|$|R

In addition, the reference samples in Lake Baikal have no marked differences in the soil properties of the sediments obtained from other sea-bottom grounds. On the other hands, the strengths of the mud volcano samples were lower than those of the reference samples.

As a supplement, an accurate reliability theory can be applied in design. This investigation {{is a part of}} a research effort to develop a probabilistic model of composite reliability capable of using data produced in small <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> to predict the behavior of large structures with respect to their actual dimensions. This work included testing of composite strength which was then used in exploring the methodology of predicting composite reliability from the parent single filament fiber strength statistics. This required testing of a coordinate set of <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> which consisted of a composite and its parent fibers. Previously collected fiber strength statistics from two different production spools were used in conjunction with the current effort. This investigation established that, for a well made composite, the Local Load Sharing Model of reliability prediction exhibited outstanding correlation with experimental data and was sufficiently sensitive to predict deficient composite strength due to a specific fiber spool with an abnormally weak lower tail. In addition, it provided an upper bound on the composite reliability. This investigation is unique in that is used a coordinate set of data with an unambiguous genesis of parent fiber and subsequent composite. The findings of this investigation are also definitive in that six orders of extrapolation of size in reliability prediction has been verified. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

The test detected antibodies in 32 of 36 samples (91 %) from people with Brugian filariasis and in 96 of 98 samples (98 %) from people with Bancroftian filariasis. Specificity testing showed that many serum or plasma samples from patients with other filarial infections such as onchocerciasis had positive antibody tests. Specificity was otherwise excellent, although 3 of 30 samples from patients with ascariasis and 4 of 51 with strongyloidiasis had positive antibody tests; it is likely that some or all of these people had previously lived in filariasis-endemic areas.
