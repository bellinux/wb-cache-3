50|$|By design, Torx <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Whereas Phillips <b>heads</b> were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{are limited}} {{information}} and inconclusive results for dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nails for trochanteric fractures. Therefore, {{we performed a}} prospective study to evaluate the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients operated with this implant. 				 					Methods: We prospectively studied 79 patients (61 women and 18 men; mean age: 84. 7  years; range: 65 – 96  years) with a low-energy trochanteric fracture, treated with a dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail from 2013 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 2. 1  years (range: 1 – 3  years); seven patients were lost to follow up. This left 72 patients for further analysis. We evaluated the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients. 				 					Results: Fracture healing was evident in 70 patients (97. 2 %) at 2 – 3 months postoperatively. One patient experienced cut-out and z-effect phenomenon of the <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Another patient experienced a periprosthetic femoral diaphysis fracture at the distal tip of the nail. A third patient experienced an acute postoperative superficial skin infection that was treated successfully with wound dressing changes and a course of antibiotics. Sixteen patients (22. 2 %) deceased within 12  months postoperatively. In the remaining patients, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12  months postoperatively was excellent in 16 (28. 6 %), good in 23 (41. 1 %), fair in 10 (17. 8 %), and poor in 7 patients (12. 5 %). The function declined after the patients’ fracture. Fair and poor results were related to age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types. 				 					Conclusion: The dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail is associated with high healing and low complication rates for intertrochanteric fractures. The function of the patients is good or excellent in most cases; however, it declines, especially for those patients with age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Z-effect {{and reverse}} Z-effect are {{complications}} {{that arise from}} the surgical treatment of pertrochanteric fractures of the femur with proximal femoral nails (PFN) comprising two interlocking <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Such complications are induced by the migration of screws in opposite directions, which may lead to failure of the osteosynthesis. Findings The paper describes three cases of pertrochanteric fractures that were treated with PFN with two interlocking screws that evolved to either Z-effect or reverse Z-effect. Literature-based explanations for this phenomenon are provided together with recommendations of how to avoid such complications. Conclusions Although intramedullary fixation is an established method of treatment of femoral intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures, {{the evolution of the}} procedure may include complications associated with the migration of the interlocking <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> The occurrence of Z-effect and reverse Z-effect has not been completely elucidated, but the main causes of such complications are probably fracture fixation in varus position, severe medial comminution, inappropriate entry point of the nail and poor bone quality. </p...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cut out of locking <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> is {{the most}} common {{complication}} of locking plates in fracture fixation of the proximal humerus with potentially disastrous consequences. Aim {{of the study was to}} find the single best and combination of radiographic projections to reliably detect screw cut outs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The locking plate was fixed to six cadaveric proximal humeri. Six different radiographs were performed: anteriorposterior in internal (apIR), in neutral (ap 0) and in 30 ° external rotation (apER); axial in 30 ° (ax 30) and 60 ° (ax 60) abduction and an outlet view. Each <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> (n= 9) was sequentially exchanged to perforate the humeral head with the tip and all radiographs were repeated for each cut out. Randomized image reading by two blinded examiners for cut out was done for single projection and combinations. RESULTS: Interrater agreement was 0. 72 - 0. 93.

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R

40|$|Calcaneal {{osteotomy}} {{is often}} performed {{to correct the}} align-ment of the hindfoot and the weight-bearing axis of the lower limb. It is commonly undertaken {{in combination with other}} bony or soft tissue procedures in correction of a more global foot deformity. The operative approach, the position of the osteotomy, the direction of the shift, and the mode of fixation are all subject to considerable variation. Historically, fixation of a calcaneal osteotomy with a <b>headed</b> <b>screw</b> has been associated with high rates of compli-cations due to posterior heel pain from prominent <b>screw</b> <b>heads,</b> requiring secondary surgery for screw removal. In our unit, the method of fixation has changed over time and according to surgeon preference while the operative approach and the technique utilized have remained rela-tively unchanged, which provided a good opportunity to compare the outcome of calcaneal osteotomy with respect to fixation methods utilized. These included fixation using a <b>headed</b> <b>screw,</b> a headless conical screw, or a laterally applied stepped locking plate.
