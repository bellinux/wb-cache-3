500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is {{difficult for me to}} admit. But, yes, it's true. Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… and believe me, she had a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell earned preseason first-team All-Pac-10 honors from The Sporting News and Lindy's Sports {{before the}} 2000 season as he {{prepared}} to take over the starting wide receiver job following Farmer's graduation. Mitchell, along with teammate Poli-Dixon, was named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award watchlist for the best wide receiver in college football during the preseason. In the season-opener against third-ranked Alabama, Mitchell threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon on a trick play in the first quarter and made a 46-yard touchdown reception from McCann in the third quarter. He finished the game with four catches for 91yards in the upset win. In the 24–21 win over Fresno State on September 9, Mitchell led the team in receiving with six receptions for 58yards and a 20-yard touchdown pass from McCann. Mitchell's catches went into the double-digits against third-ranked Michigan, as he had ten receptions for 137yards in the 23–20 upset win on September 16. On September 23, {{in the third quarter of}} a 29–10 loss against Oregon, Mitchell caught what appeared to be a touchdown in the corner of the end zone, but was ruled out-of-bounds by the officials. The Bruins settled for a field goal on the drive and Mitchell explained after the game that [...] "I knew it was a touchdown, you knew it was a touchdown, everybody does. The ref knew it too because he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he was sorry." [...] On the next series, however, Mitchell caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Bennett. Mitchell finished the game with eight receptions for 158yards. In a 38–31 comeback win over Arizona State on September 30, he caught two touchdown passes from Cory Paus in the third quarter, one of which was for 80yards, and had four total catches for 125yards in the game. On October 14, in a triple-overtime loss to California, Mitchell made eight receptions for 167yards and caught a 35-yard touchdown from Paus in the fourth quarter.|$|E

2500|$|On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were {{announced}} {{as having been}} cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps. The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring [...] "a funny yet heartfelt side" [...] with [...] "a wily, dry-witted sort of voice." [...] Bateman described his character as [...] "a crafty, sarcastic schemer," [...] remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: [...] "'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I was an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{grew up in}} Chicago, Illinois, {{and moved}} with his parents to Santa Monica, California, at age 9.

After graduating UCLA, Wilson obtained a position working on marketing campaigns for movies and as a copywriter for a sponsor of the Los Angeles Film Festival, and watched over 200 movies per year in this capacity. In 2005, Wilson stated that he still worked in film marketing, and also worked on film trailers. His marketing work has included publicity for the Academy Awards: [...] "When {{they found out that}} I did the Razzies, they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I was a spy," [...] said Wilson to The Blade.|$|E

2500|$|Smith found that, at the time, nobody {{believed}} in her concept of stylish activewear. As she later recalled, even major brands like Nike {{did not have}} concept stores for their clothing in those days. When Bill Clarkson showed the products to major department store Myer, their fashion buyers were uninterested and unsure of how to position the garments. He recalls that when he explained the clothes should not be sold in the sports section, [...] "The buyer <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I was crazy. They had no box to put me in." [...] Eventually, Myer bought a small range for five of their stores and stocked it in a corner between swimwear and lingerie. The Lorna Jane corporate website {{goes so far as}} to credit Smith with coining the word [...] "activewear" [...] in 1989, although the Merriam-Webster dictionary notes the word's first known usage was in 1924.|$|E

60|$|The {{subject of}} brasses was {{unfolded}} to Lawrence Frith, {{and before the}} end of the week he had spent an entire day on his hands and knees, scrubbing away with the waxy black compound at a figure in the Cathedral--the office-work, as we declared, which Clarence gave him to do. In fact he became so thoroughly infected that it was a pity that he was going where there would be no exercise in ecclesiology--rather the reverse. Embarrassment on his side, and hostility on ours, may be said to have vanished under the influence of Sir Guy de Warrenne's austere countenance. The youth seemed to regard 'Mr. Winslow' in the light of a father, and to accept us as kindly beings. He ceased to contort his limbs in our awful presence, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> as an ordinary person, and even ventured on giving me an arm.
