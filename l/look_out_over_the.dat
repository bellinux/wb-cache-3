5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

25|$|The Agapemonites, {{who held}} decidedly {{unconventional}} views on {{marriage and the}} role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple.

500|$|The New Orleans house {{occupied}} by Delphine LaLaurie {{at the time}} of the 1834 fires stands today at 1140 Royal Street, on the corner of Royal Street and Governor Nicholls Street (formerly known as Hospital Street). At three stories high, it was described in 1928 as [...] "the highest building for squares around", with the result that [...] "from the cupola on the roof one may <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Vieux Carré and see the Mississippi in its crescent before Jackson Square". [...] The entrance to the building bears iron grillwork, and the door is carved with an image of [...] "Phoebus in his chariot, and with wreaths of flowers and depending garlands in bas-relief". [...] Inside, the vestibule is floored in black and white marble, and a curved mahogany-railed staircase runs the full three stories of the building. [...] The second floor holds three large drawing rooms connected by ornamented sliding doors, whose walls are decorated with plaster rosettes, carved woodwork, black marble mantle pieces and fluted pilasters.|$|E
2500|$|Farren {{continued}} at the Gaiety {{for the next}} 25 years, playing in comedies of all kinds and in Shakespearean dramas, first under Hollingshead and then under George Edwardes, performing the lead in dozens of shows, many also starring Edward Terry, Kate Vaughan, Fred Leslie and E. W. Royce. [...] She was most acclaimed in the [...] "principal boy" [...] roles. These roles permitted the actress to show her legs in tights, and Farren became very popular with the young men of the Gaiety audience, who would wear a coloured scarf to show support for their favourite actress. Farren's colours were dark blue, light blue and white, and she could <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> audience to compare the number of fans displaying her colours {{as compared to the}} colours of the other actresses. According to Hollingshead, Farren developed a [...] "spinal complaint, which troubled her in her early Gaiety career [...] developed into locomotor ataxy" [...] later.|$|E
2500|$|The Gest makes a {{specific}} {{reference to the}} Saylis at Wentbridge. Credit {{is due to the}} nineteenth century antiquarian Joseph Hunter, who correctly identified the site of the Saylis. From this location it was once possible to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Went Valley and observe the traffic that passed along the Great North Road. The Saylis is recorded as having contributed towards the aid that was granted to Edward III in 1346–47 for the knighting of the Black Prince. An acre of landholding is listed within a glebe terrier of 1688 relating to Kirk Smeaton, which later came to be called [...] "Sailes Close". Professor Dobson and Mr. Taylor indicate that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the Saylis that was so well known to Robin Hood is preserved today as [...] "Sayles Plantation". It is this location that provides a vital clue to Robin Hood's Yorkshire heritage. One final locality in the forest of Barnsdale that is associated with Robin Hood is the village of Campsall.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} they had reached a point about a hundred feet above the shelf of rocks they were so {{exhausted}} they had to sit down and rest.

60|$|He {{followed}} them out, {{and they came}} to a large pond outside the farm-house.

60|$|Virginia drew away, {{and the one}} searching glance {{she gave}} him he did not see. He was staring far beyond; tears started in her eyes, and she turned from him to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Arsenal grounds, still wet and heavy with the night's storm. The day itself was dark and damp. She thought of the supper cooking at home. It would not be eaten now.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{afternoon}} he awoke and rose to his feet. The warm sand, the desiccating air, and the sun had dried his clothes, and his nap had refreshed him. He was a sharp-faced, quick-eyed man, a Scotchman, and {{the first thing he did}} was to shade his face with his hands and <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sea. Then he turned, with a shrug of his shoulders and a grunt.|$|E
60|$|So {{they went}} down the winding walks again {{which led to the}} inn. There they found, on the front side of the house, a very {{pleasant}} dining room, with tables set in it, some large and some small. Mr. George and Rollo took their seats at a small front table near a window, where they could <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water. Here a waiter came to them, and they told him what they would have for breakfast.|$|E

60|$|I {{measured}} all the reigns {{exactly as}} many {{feet to the}} reign as there were years in it.

It gives the children a realizing sense of the length or brevity of a reign. Shall invent a violent game to go with it.|$|E
60|$|A short portage was {{necessary}} to reach Atlin Lake, and taking {{a part of our}} baggage upon our shoulders we hired the remainder packed on horses and within an hour were moving up the smooth path under the small black pines, across the low ridge which separates the two lakes. At the top of this ridge we were able to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> magnificent spread of Atlin Lake, which was more beautiful in every way than Tagish or Taku.

60|$|It was {{two days}} before Inkspot {{got out of the}} hands of the police.
