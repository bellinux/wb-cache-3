60|$|Every day, every hour, {{brought to}} him one more <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> of her nature, {{and to her}} one more of his. Tess was trying to lead a {{repressed}} life, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality.|$|E
60|$|The utter {{death of}} every tender {{sentiment}} in his wife, as {{brought home to}} him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of his portrait and gift, was the conclusive <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> required to demolish all sentiment in him. He paid the shilling, took the photograph away with him, and burnt it, frame and all, when he reached his lodging.|$|E

Suppose that we put it at three ten an ounce, which is nearly ten shillings under the mark. That makes, roughly, fifty-six pounds for a pound in weight. Now each of these ingots weighs thirty-six pounds, which brings their value to two {{thousand}} and a few odd pounds. There are five hundred ingots {{on each of these}} three sides of the room, but on the fourth there are only three hundred, on account of the door, but there cannot be less than two hundred on the floor, which gives us a rough total of two thousand ingots. So you see, my dear boy, that any broker who could get the contents of this chamber for four million pounds would be doing a nice <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> of business." ...|$|E

6000|$|His outlooks, {{it must be}} admitted, were {{sufficiently}} {{vague and}} overshadowed; neither the past nor {{the future of a}} too joyful kind. Public life, in any professional form, is quite forbidden; to work with his fellows anywhere appears to be forbidden: nor can the humblest solitary endeavor to work worthily as yet find an arena. How unfold one's little bit of talent; and live, and not lie sleeping, while it is called To-day? As Radical, as Reforming Politician in any public or private form,--not only has this, in Sterling's case, received tragical sentence and execution; but the opposite extreme, the Church whither he had fled, likewise proves abortive: the Church also is not the haven for him at all. What is to be done? Something must be done, and soon,--under penalties. Whoever has received, on him there is an inexorable behest to give.

60|$|I am thinking, {{lifting up}} my pen, what I {{can write to}} you {{which is likely to}} be {{interesting}} to you. After all I come to chaos and silence, and even old night--it is growing so dark. I live in London, to be sure, and except for the glory of it I might live in a desert, so profound is my solitude and so complete my isolation from things and persons without. I lie all day, and day after day, on the sofa, and my windows do not even look into the street. To abuse myself with a vain deceit of rural life I have had ivy planted in a box, and it has flourished and spread over one window, and strikes against the glass with a <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> from the thicker leaves when the wind blows at all briskly. Then I think of forests and groves; it is my triumph when the leaves strike the window pane, {{and this is not a}} sound like a lament. Books and thoughts and dreams (almost too consciously dreamed, however, for me--the illusion of them has almost passed) and domestic tenderness can and ought to leave nobody lamenting. Also God's wisdom, deeply steeped in His love, is as far as we can stretch out our hands.|$|E
60|$|Besides, here {{is another}} subject of distress, and a very serious one, which puts us again to a stand. The author may {{possibly}} not come into power (I only state the possibility): he may not always continue in it: and if the contrary to all this should fortunately for us happen, what insurance on his life {{can be made for}} a sum adequate to his loss? Then we are thus unluckily situated, that the chance of an American and Irish revenue of 300,000l. to be managed by him, is to save us from ruin two or three years hence at best, to make us happy at home and glorious abroad; and the actual possession of 400,000l. English taxes cannot so much as protract our ruin without him. So we are staked on four chances; his power, its permanence, the success of his projects, and the duration of his life. Any one of these failing, we are gone. Propria h√¶c si dona fuissent! This is no unfair representation; ultimately all hangs on his life, because, in his account of every set of men that have held or supported administration, he finds neither virtue nor ability in any but himself. Indeed he pays (through their measures) some compliments to Lord Bute and Lord Despenser. But to the latter, this is, I suppose, but a civility to old acquaintance: to the former, a <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> of politics. We may therefore fairly say, that our only hope is his life; and he has, to make it the more so, taken care to cut off any resource which we possessed independently of him.|$|E

6000|$|There was a moment's pause. She looked {{squarely}} {{into his}} face, her eyes alight {{with anger and}} contempt, and perhaps he flushed a <b>little.</b> He <b>stroked</b> his moustache, and by an effort maintained his cynical calm. [...] "Let us be reasonable," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|He had now {{news for}} them that would warm their hearts like grog. He had not {{discovered}} the Lair, but he had seen Stroke, he had spoken to him! Disguised as a boy he had tracked the Jacobite and found him skulking {{in the house of}} the unhappy Ailie. After blustering for a <b>little</b> <b>Stroke</b> had gone on his knees and offered not only to cease persecuting this lady but to return to France. Mr. Sandys had kicked him into a standing posture and then left him. But this clemency had been ill repaid. Stroke had not returned to France. He was staying at the Quharity Arms, a Thrums inn, where he called himself McLean. It had gone through the town like wildfire that he had written to someone in Redlintie to send him on another suit of clothes and four dickies. No one suspected his real character, but all noted that he went to the unhappy Ailie's house daily, and there was a town about it. Ailie was but a woman, and women could not defend themselves [...] "(Boatswain, put Grizel in irons if she opens her mouth)," [...] and so the poor thing had been forced to speak to him, and even to go walks with him. Her life was in danger, and before now Mr. Sandys would have taken him prisoner, but the queen had said these words, [...] "Noble Sandys, destroy the Lair," [...] {{and the best way to}} discover this horrid spot was to follow Stroke night and day until he went to it. Then they would burn it to the ground, put him on board the Ailie, up with the jib-boom sail, and away to the Tower of London.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the notable}} {{point in this}} Albert of Mainz was that of Leo X. and the Indulgences. [Pauli, v. 496-499; Rentsch, p. 869.] Pope Leo had {{permitted}} Albert to retain his Archbishopric of Magdeburg and other dignities along with that of Mainz; which was an unusual favor. But the Pope expected {{to be paid for}} it,--to have 30,000 ducats (15,000 pounds), almost a King's ransom at that time, for the [...] "Pallium" [...] to Mainz; PALLIUM, or little Bit of woollen Cloth, on sale by the Pope, without which Mainz could not be held. Albert, with all his dignities, was dreadfully short of money at the time. Chapter of Mainz could or would do little or nothing, having been drained lately; Magdeburg, Halberstadt, the like. Albert tried various shifts; tried a <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> of trade in relics,--gathered in the Mainz district [...] "some hundreds of fractional sacred bones, and three whole bodies," [...] which he sent to Halle for pious purchase;--but nothing came of this branch. The 15,000 pounds remained unpaid; and Pope Leo, building St. Peter's, [...] "furnishing a sister's toilet," [...] and doing worse things, was in extreme need of it. What is to be done? [...] "I could borrow the money from the Fuggers of Augsburg," [...] said the Archbishop hesitatingly; [...] "but then--?"--"I could help you to repay it." [...] said his Holiness: [...] "Could repay the half of it,--if only we had (but they always make such clamor about these things) an Indulgence published in Germany!"--"Well; it must be!" [...] answered Albert at last, agreeing to take the clamor on himself, and to do the feat; being at his wits'-end for money. He draws out his Full-Power, which, as first Spiritual Kurfurst, he has the privilege to do; nominates (1516) one Tetzel for Chief Salesman, a Priest whose hardness of face, and shiftiness of head and hand, were known to him; and--here is one Hohenzollern that has a place in History! Poor man, it was by accident, and from extreme tightness for money. He was by no means a violent Churchman; he had himself inclinations towards Luther, even of a practical sort, as the thing went on. But there was no help for it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was about}} to withdraw, after having promised that I would inform the Signora Serafina of my friend's condition, when her companion, who had risen from table and girded his loins {{apparently}} for the onset, grasped me gently by the arm, and led me before the row of statuettes. [...] "I perceive by your conversation, signore, {{that you are a}} patron of the arts. Allow me to request your honourable attention for these modest products of my own ingenuity. They are brand-new, fresh from my atelier, and have never been exhibited in public. I have brought them here to receive the verdict of this dear lady, who is a good critic, for all she may pretend to the contrary. I am the inventor of this peculiar style of statuette--of subject, manner, material, everything. Touch them, I pray you; handle them freely--you needn't fear. Delicate as they look, it is impossible they should break! My various creations have met with great success. They are especially admired by Americans. I have sent them all over Europe--to London, Paris, Vienna! You may have observed some little specimens in Paris, on the Boulevard, in a shop of which they constitute the specialty. There is always a crowd about the window. They form a very pleasing ornament for the mantel-shelf of a gay young bachelor, for the boudoir of a pretty woman. You couldn't make a prettier present to a person with whom you wished to exchange a harmless joke. It is not classic art, signore, of course; but, between ourselves, isn't classic art sometimes rather a bore? Caricature, burlesque, la charge, as the French say, has hitherto been confined to paper, to the pen and pencil. Now, it has been my inspiration to introduce it into statuary. For this purpose I have invented a peculiar plastic compound which you will permit me not to divulge. That's my secret, signore! It's as light, you perceive, as cork, and yet as firm as alabaster! I frankly confess that I really pride myself as much on this <b>little</b> <b>stroke</b> of chemical ingenuity as upon the other element of novelty in my creations--my types. What do you say to my types, signore? The idea is bold; does it strike you as happy? Cats and monkeys--monkeys and cats--all human life is there! Human life, of course, I mean, viewed with the eye of the satirist! To combine sculpture and satire, signore, has been my unprecedented ambition. I flatter myself that I have not egregiously failed." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him in wonder, and laughed. He made no answer. She came across to him, and with her <b>little</b> fingers <b>stroked</b> his hair. She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, smiling a <b>little</b> and <b>stroking</b> his chin, [...] "yes.

40|$|Background: urinary {{incontinence}} (UI) after stroke {{is associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. The UK National Sentinel Audits of Stroke have collected data on UI which has not previously been reported. Methods: data on standards relating to both organisations and process of care were extracted from the audits to look for trends in service provision, continence care planning and discharge destination of incontinent versus continent stroke survivors. In addition, 2004 data was analysed statistically {{to look for a}} link between stroke units meeting certain standards and the likelihood of patients having continence plans. Results: UI rates have changed little over the four audit cycles. The influence of UI on discharge destination has also altered <b>little.</b> <b>Stroke</b> unit care is more strongly associated with management planning for UI in stroke...|$|E

40|$|Research (R), develpment(D), and {{innovation}} {{takes place in}} stages, although not like the <b>little</b> <b>strokes</b> that fell big oaks and certainly not like the linear models of technical change suggest. Early recognition of the first stages opens up ooportunities to forecast the later ones. By "corporate technology forecasting" we understand the assessement of these early stages in order to anticipate commercial succes. Integrated networks of various technology indicators provide synergetic information and "orientation knowledge". Synergisms from the various indicator values give more credibility to the results. Indicators also may provide additional clues to give {{the way to a}} more qualitative interpretation of the finings - which is always needed.

50|$|The fire-capped tit is not shy. It {{is always}} active, giving <b>little</b> wing <b>strokes</b> like a warbler. It is {{reminiscent}} of the small tit Sylviparus modestus.

Most of the time, these groups, flying high above the bare hills, are monotypic, but they sometimes join mixed flocks when foraging.|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{know whether}} the reader has been as much struck with the above mysterious scene as the writer has; but the fancy of {{it strikes me as}} very fine; and the natural SUPERNATURALNESS is kept up in the best style. The shutter swaying to and fro, the fitful LIGHT APPEARING over the {{furniture}} of the room, and giving it an air of strange motion--the awful shadow which passed through the body of the timid young novice--are surely very finely painted. [...] "I rushed to the shutter, and flung it back: {{there was no one in}} the sacristy. I looked into the garden; it was deserted, and the mid-day wind was roaming among the flowers." [...] The dreariness is wonderfully described: only the poor pale boy looking eagerly out from the window of the sacristy, and the hot mid-day wind walking in the solitary garden. How skilfully is each of these <b>little</b> <b>strokes</b> dashed in, and how well do all together combine to make a picture! But we must have a little more about Spiridion's wonderful visitant.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{though we}} {{presently}} saw {{a squadron of}} aeroplanes flying across the southern sky we did not heed it. There it was--a line of little dots in the sky--and then more, dotting the southeastern horizon, and then still more, until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks. Now they were all thin <b>little</b> <b>strokes</b> of blue, and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light. They came rising and falling and growing larger, like some huge flight of gulls or rooks, or such-like birds moving with a marvellous uniformity, and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky. The southward wing flung itself in an arrow-headed cloud athwart the sun. And then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward, growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky. And after that we noted to the northward and very high Evesham's fighting machines hanging high over Naples like an evening swarm of gnats.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{touch-down}} after a 12 m {{free fall}} on lead cylinders, Gridunov experienced a record acceleration of 50 g (490 m/s2), which broke the related device. He recalls that episode as follows: [...] "I heard them engineers command me: ‚ÄúAttention!‚Äù ‚ÄúReady!‚Äù These are normally {{followed by the}} ‚ÄúDrop!‚Äù command.

He went and stood by the barrier and saw Doctor Lemon and his friends pull up {{at the entrance to}} the Row, where they apparently prepared to separate. The separation took some time and Jackson‚Äôs colleague became interested. Lord Canterville and his younger daughter lingered to talk with two gentlemen, also mounted, who looked a good deal at the legs of Lady Agatha‚Äôs horse. Doctor Lemon and Lady Barb were face to face, very near each other, and she, leaning forward a <b>little,</b> <b>stroked</b> the overlapping neck of his glossy bay. At a distance he appeared to be talking and she to be listening without response. ‚ÄúOh yes, he‚Äôs making love to her,‚Äù thought Sidney Feeder. Suddenly her father and sister turned away to leave the Park, and she joined them and disappeared while Jackson came up on the left again as for a final gallop. He hadn‚Äôt gone far before he perceived his comrade, who awaited him at the rail; and he repeated the gesture Lady Barb had described as a kiss of the hand, though it had not to his friend‚Äôs eyes that full grace. When he came within hail he pulled up.|$|R
