5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
25|$|The Saracens have invaded France and {{are laying}} siege to Paris. The Saracen king has a giant {{to whom he}} has promised the hand of his {{beautiful}} daughter Marsabelle if he can bring to her {{the head of the}} French king, Dagobert. At this moment, the giant is <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he is <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wall again and taunting them all once more.|$|E
25|$|A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set {{above the}} banqueting hall. Some {{soldiers}} are <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> balcony. To the right {{there is a}} gigantic staircase, to the left, at the back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze. The moon is shining very brightly.|$|E

25|$|Sweepers are trees {{fallen in}} or heavily <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> river, still rooted {{on the shore}} and not fully submerged. Its trunk and {{branches}} may form an obstruction in the river like strainers. Since it is an obstruction from above, it often does not contribute to whitewater features but may create turbulence. In fast water sweepers can pose a serious hazard to paddlers.|$|E
25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends {{to stay out of the}} saddle and be standing up with their knees bent and the upper body <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E
25|$|In an {{alternative}} method, {{a large piece}} of fuel wood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile. Then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuel wood, and the other resting on the ground, so that the kindling is <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tinder pile. This method is useful in very high winds, as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak.|$|E
60|$|He stopped short. Julian, who {{had been}} <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> towards <b>the</b> {{cigarette}} bog, glanced around at his friend. There was a frown on Furley's forehead. He withdrew his pipe from between his teeth.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly my {{attention}} was drawn toward Thuvia of Ptarth. The beautiful girl was <b>leaning</b> far <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} balcony, her eyes bright with excitement.|$|R
25|$|The {{first task}} that the earl gives to Sir Eglamour, {{in order to}} win the hand of his daughter, is to defeat a giant far to the west. Giants are commonplace in medieval romance. Florent kills one that has been <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> outer wall of the city of Paris, taunting its inhabitants, in the medieval romance Octavian. King Arthur kills one that lives on the top of Mont Saint-Michel, on his way to defeat a Roman army in the Alliterative Morte Arthure. Sir Yvain kills one in Chrétien de Troyes' Arthurian romance Yvain, the Knight of the Lion. Sir Gawain {{encounters}} one in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E
500|$|After the {{convention}} dealt with other matters, the nominations for president {{opened on the}} morning of Friday, June 11. Harding had asked Willis to place his name in nomination, and the former governor responded with a speech popular among the delegates both for its folksiness and for its brevity in the intense Chicago heat. Reporter Mark Sullivan, who was present, called it a splendid combination of [...] "oratory, grand opera, and hog calling". Willis confided, <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> podium railing, [...] "Say, boys—and girls too—why not name Warren Harding?" [...] The laughter and applause that followed created a warm feeling for Harding.|$|E
500|$|Back in Oak Brook, Mulder has {{followed}} Pincus {{to the house}} of VinylRight employee Gretchen Starns. [...] Mulder looks through the window and sees the monster <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> woman as she watches TV. [...] Mulder breaks the window and then kicks in the door. Inside the house he sees that Starns has been transformed into a zombie. Behind him, out of his sight, the monster walks across the ceiling. Mulder catches a glimpse of it crawling up the outside of the house. Later at the FBI office, Starns and Pincus complain to A.D. Skinner about Mulder's behavior. Mulder, seeing Pincus begin to transform into the creature again, draws his weapon. He is restrained by a disbelieving Skinner and then sedated in a hospital.|$|E
60|$|On {{going out}} into the garden next morning, with a strange sense of being another person than herself, she beheld Jim <b>leaning</b> mutely <b>over</b> <b>the</b> gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{else in the}} world," [...] she answered, {{her eyes}} fixed upon {{the figure of the}} man who was <b>leaning</b> now <b>over</b> <b>the</b> grey stone wall, gazing seaward.|$|R
60|$|They {{left him}} <b>leaning</b> disconsolately <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rails. The Professor and Quest sat {{side by side}} on one of the trunks which was piled up on the barge.|$|R
500|$|Each of {{the three}} Black Triptychs {{displays}} sequential views of a single figure, and each seems to be intended {{to be viewed as}} if stills from a film. The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon's usual intellectual sources; they do not depict Golgotha, Handes, or Leopold Bloom. In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer's own life and the artist's life, and presents him as a nameless, slumped, gathering of flesh, awaiting the onset of death. Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993, the art critic Juan Vicente Aliaga wrote that [...] "the horror, the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude. The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace have given way to the solitary figure <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> washbasin, standing firm on the smooth ground, neutral, bald-headed, his convex back deformed, his testicles contracted in a fold." ...|$|E
500|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Events with [...] "B" [...] in the code are for athletes with visual impairment, codes LW1 to LW9 are for athletes who stand to compete and LW10 to LW12 are for athletes who compete sitting down. For the 2006 Paralympics alpine skiing events grouped athletes in to sitting, standing and visually impaired. Wheelchair curling, making its first appearance at the Games in 2006, was open to athletes with a physical disability in {{the lower part of the}} body that required the everyday use of a wheelchair. Stones may be played by hand while <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side of the wheelchair, or pushed by a delivery stick.|$|E
500|$|Stage 5, {{with its}} summit finish at Abetone, was also {{won by a}} rider from a breakaway, this time Jan Polanc (...) , who {{attacked}} on the final climb and won {{by more than a}} minute. The general classification favourites attacked on the final climb; Contador was the first to attack and was followed by Aru and Porte. They were then joined by Mikel Landa, Aru's teammate, and gained time over all the other riders. Clarke lost over two minutes to Contador, Aru and Porte; he therefore lost the lead in the general classification and Contador became the new leader of the race, two seconds ahead of Aru and twenty ahead of Porte. Contador's lead came under threat the following day. The stage was won by Greipel in a sprint finish, but there was a large crash in the final metres. This was caused by a spectator who was <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crash barriers with a camera; Daniele Colli (...) collided with him and caused a large number of riders to crash behind him. Contador was among the riders to crash; although he finished the stage on the same time as Greipel, he was treated for a shoulder injury by his team doctor and was unable to put on the leader's jersey on the podium. Despite suffering from the injury, Contador started and finished the following day's stage. This was won in a sprint finish by Diego Ulissi (Lampre-Merida), while Contador retained the race lead.|$|E

6000|$|... "Curse this!" [...] said Evans suddenly. [...] "It's too slow." [...] And, <b>leaning</b> dangerously <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{fore part}} of the canoe, he began to suck up the water with his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{she goes}} easier now, Dan," [...] he said, {{as the boat}} resumed her course; but Dan, who was <b>leaning</b> helplessly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side of the boat, could see no difference.|$|R
2500|$|Harriman {{was born}} Florence Jaffray Hurst on July 21, 1870 in New York City to {{shipping}} magnate F.W.J. Hurst {{and his wife}} Caroline. [...] When she was three years old, her mother, then 29, died. [...] She and her two sisters (Caroline Elise and Ethel) were raised in and around New York City by her father and maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Somerville Jaffray. At age six, she watched her first political torchlight parade, part of the 1876 presidential campaign. [...] "She later told of <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bannister of her home at 615 Fifth Avenue, to hear visitors such as John Hay, President James A. Garfield, and President Chester A. Arthur." ...|$|E
2500|$|The same {{daughter}} who allegedly saw the ghost on the staircase also reported seeing two phantom men apparently fighting on another staircase {{on the southwest}} side earlier in the 19th century. [...] Early in the 20th century, she also reported an [...] "immensely evil" [...] presence in the southwest bedroom, moving {{around the room and}} then <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bed. [...] In the same room, a visitor to the house once observed a floating hand, not attached to any arm, attaching itself to her four-poster bed and moving up and down it. [...] Another visitor later reported an identical experience, and also reported that the bed seemed to be shaking during the encounter. [...] The southwest side of the building was apparently a focus for paranormal activity: strange noises, objects being moved, dresses being cut with regular patterns of holes, and doors opening and shutting were all reported there.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday 13 October {{experienced}} sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden {{volunteered to}} accompany Crowhurst {{on his last}} leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst {{had fallen into the}} water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, [...] "We had to keep <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> counter to do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the fixings welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!" [...] Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was [...] "certainly nippy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{too hot for}} anger, father," [...] a voice said; and Dom Pedro, turning, saw his {{daughter}} <b>leaning</b> languidly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> balustrade. She, too, was watching the hammock with a curious expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do promise it," [...] John Girdlestone {{answered}} in a deep voice. He was standing up now, and <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> to catch <b>the</b> words of the dying man.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{want to ask}} you something," [...] he said, <b>leaning</b> halfway <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{little table}} between them. [...] "How much {{do you know about the}} lady who came into my brother's flat when we were there?" ...|$|R
60|$|The oldest Rover boy did as requested, <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> from <b>the</b> {{back seat}} to do so, and thus leaving Tom free to {{manipulate}} the steering wheel. Dick also set the hand brake a notch tighter, but this did little good, since it was the bands that were worn.|$|R
