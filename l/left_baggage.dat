5000|$|The great Irish {{rebellion}} {{began on}} 23 October 1641, and in December Inchiquin accompanied {{the president in}} an expedition against the Leinster rebels who were harassing Waterford and Tipperary. All the prisoners taken in a fight near Carrick-on-Suir were executed by martial law. [...] In April 1642, during the siege of Cork by Viscount Muskerry with four thousand men, Inchiquin, [...] "one of the young and noble-spirited commanders," [...] led a sally of two troops of horse and three hundred musketeers, which broke up the Irish camp for a time. Muskerry <b>left</b> <b>baggage</b> and provisions behind, and Inchiquin was able to ship guns and to take two castles {{on the west side}} of Cork harbour which had annoyed the navigation. St. Leger died on 2 July, and Inchiquin became the legal governor of Munster, as he announced to the lords justices before the end of the month. David Barry, 1st Earl of Barrymore, was associated with him in the civil government, but died on Michaelmas day. Alexander Forbes, 11th Lord Forbes, with Hugh Peters as his chaplain, landed at Kinsale early in July with forces provided by adventurers in England; but he paid no attention to Inchiquin's request for help, and he effected nothing. On 20 August Inchiquin, accompanied by Barrymore, Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky, and Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, with only two thousand foot and four hundred horse, overthrew General Garret Barry at Battle of Liscarrol with seven thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse; but he lacked means to improve his victory, though seven hundred are said to have fallen on one side and only twelve on the other. He was himself wounded in the head and hand.|$|E
60|$|Picking up the two valises, Richard {{made his}} way through the crowd, looking for Mr. Joyce. It seemed rather queer that the gentleman who had <b>left</b> his <b>baggage</b> in the boy's care was nowhere to be found.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I <b>left</b> my <b>baggage</b> on the wharf-boat {{and went}} {{looking around the}} town and out a piece in the country, {{to put in the}} time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way." ...|$|R
50|$|This train, {{with only}} the third modular van <b>left</b> {{available}} for <b>baggage,</b> and steel box wagons built at Addington between 1978-1982for parcels, ran until Sunday, 10 December 1989.|$|R
60|$|From the station-master {{they learned}} that their train was two hours behind time, and would not reach Butte until late that night. This being so, they <b>left</b> their <b>baggage</b> on check at the depot and took a stroll around, looking at the sights. Then they found a small {{restaurant}} and got what they called supper, {{although it was not}} a very good meal.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a grand sight. My {{father and}} I had <b>left</b> the <b>baggage,</b> which {{remained}} by the sea, and had ridden up on to a sand hill, {{from which we}} had {{a view of the}} whole of the battleground. It was astonishing to see the line of English infantry advancing, under that tremendous fire, against the rising ground occupied by the dense masses of the enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "It looks mighty {{suspicious}} to me-- {{the bill}} unpaid and <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> behind," [...] murmured Tom. Then {{of a sudden}} he drew a sharp breath. [...] "Oh, Dick, do you think----" [...] And then Tom stopped short.|$|R
50|$|Relying on {{the money}} from the robbery, they fled to Spain, then to Morocco, Bada's {{original}} home. Their travels together ended, however, when Fanger was detained for questioning by Greek customs authorities in Athens. <b>Left</b> without money, <b>baggage,</b> or friends, she struggled to survive alone in Greece.|$|R
50|$|On 29 December 1895, 600 men, led by Dr Leander Starr Jameson, duly {{invaded the}} Transvaal. However, the ground had been insufficiently prepared; the uitlander risings failed to {{materialise}} and the invading troops were quickly subdued and arrested. Telegrams and notes found in Jameson’s <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> Rhodes thoroughly implicated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{suppose we}} shall march to-night. But if we do, the {{quartermaster}} will detail {{a party to}} collect all the <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> behind {{and put it in}} store. We needn't bother about that; especially when, for aught we know, we may never come back to claim it." ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{a severe}} and sudden {{conclusion}} {{to a war}} that had begun under such excellent auspices for the Pontificals. Yet, notwithstanding that defeat, which had <b>left</b> guns and <b>baggage</b> {{in the hands of}} the enemy, the Pope was the gainer by the campaign, having won eleven strongholds from the Orsini in exchange for one battle lost.|$|R
60|$|The Hotel Bonair {{proved to}} be a nine-hundred-room fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore. Everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side dining-room and given only a terrapin and {{champagne}} table d'hôte. The bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen. The Corsair anchored there the day we arrived. I saw Mr. Morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel. Still, it was a very inexpensive place. Nobody could afford to pay their prices. When you went away you simply <b>left</b> your <b>baggage,</b> stole a skiff, and beat it for the mainland in the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make your basket, or bag, or {{whatever}} you take your provisions in, as small as possible, mother. I saw lots of <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> behind on the platform. You see, there are no seats to stow things under. I should say that a flat box which you can sit on {{would be the best}} thing. And you will want your warmest cloak and a thick rug for night." ...|$|R
60|$|We encamped {{again the}} next night as before, and still our good caterer had plenty of food for us; but I {{observed}} that the next morning, when we set forward, our tents were <b>left</b> standing, the <b>baggage</b> mules tied together to graze, and our company lessened by all my patron's servants, which, when I inquired about, {{he told me he}} hoped we should have good quarters quickly without them.|$|R
50|$|By June 1513, most of {{the western}} part of the duchy of Milan had been {{occupied}} by the French. After marching to Novara the night before, the French were surprised at dawn by a Swiss relief army of some 12,000 troops. The German Landsknecht, pike-armed like the Swiss, were able to form up into heavy squares and offered stiff resistance to the Swiss attack, while the French were able to deploy some of their artillery. Despite this, the Swiss onslaught, sweeping in from multiple directions due to forced marches which achieved encirclement of the French camp, took the French guns, pushed back the Landsknecht infantry regiments, and destroyed the Landsknecht squares. Caught off guard, the French heavy cavalry was unable to properly deploy, fled the field, and <b>left</b> the <b>baggage</b> train to the Swiss.|$|R

60|$|Accordingly, {{the next}} morning at daybreak the troop divided and rode off in {{different}} directions. The greater part of the gathering had scattered the evening before, and determined to return home and wait events. Four days' rapid travelling took Sidi and his companions back to the oasis, which they found exactly as they had left it, the tribes in the neighbourhood having been all too busy in following the French army, and picking up <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> behind by the break-down of the horses, to attend to other matters.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} after this {{conversation}} took place, Mr. George {{and the boys}} bade Stirling farewell, and set off in the cars, {{on the way to}} Loch Leven. After riding about an hour they left the train at the station called Dunfermline, where there was a ruin of an abbey, and of an ancient royal palace of Scotland. They <b>left</b> their <b>baggage</b> at the station, and walked through the village till they came to the ruin. It was a very beautiful ruin, and the party spent more than an hour in rambling about it, and looking at the old monuments, and the carved and sculptured windows, and arches, and cornices, all wasted and blackened by time and decay. A part of the ruin was still in good repair, and was used as a church, though it was full of old sepulchral monuments and relics. There was a woman in attendance at the door, to show the church to those who wished to see the interior of it.|$|R

60|$|Finally {{everything}} was settled {{to the satisfaction}} of the two male parties to the bargain,--although the old lady thought of a hundred things she would yet like to do,--and one fine frosty afternoon a cart-load of furniture and <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> the door, the old lady and her son took leave of the old place, and Mr. Tolman was left sitting behind the little counter, the sole manager and proprietor of a circulating library and a stationery and notion shop. He laughed when he thought of it, but he rubbed his hands and felt very well satisfied.|$|R
25|$|Hardee {{established}} {{a line of}} defense across the three roads leading into Perryville {{from the north and}} west. Until reinforcements could arrive, he was limited to three of the four brigades of Buckner's division. Brig. Gen. Sterling A. M. Wood was placed at the north of town. Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson was to Wood's right, east of the Chaplin River near the Harrodsburg Pike. Brig. Gen. St. John R. Liddell's Arkansas Brigade formed on the crest of Bottom Hill, just east of Bull Run Creek, a tributary of Doctor's Creek, with one regiment, the 7th Arkansas, sent forward to Peters Hill {{on the other side of}} the creek. On the evening of October 7 the final Confederate forces began to arrive. The first of Patton Anderson's four brigades reached the area around 3 p.m. Brig. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's brigade, the remainder of Buckner's division, followed. Around midnight, three brigades of Frank Cheatham's division arrived, moving quickly and enthusiastically, having <b>left</b> their <b>baggage</b> train behind; his fourth brigade, under Brig. Gen. Preston Smith, received orders to return to Harrodsburg.|$|R
6000|$|This was true, when, having <b>left</b> his <b>baggage</b> at the Junction, {{he drove}} another mile {{into the country}} to see the farmer of the gentleman who had his summer-house here, and who had once bantered Bartley to sell him his colt. The farmer was away, {{and would not be}} at home till the up-train from Boston was in. Bartley looked at his watch, and saw that to wait would lose him the six o'clock down-train. There would be no other till eleven o'clock. But it was worth while: the gentleman had said, [...] "When you want the money for that colt, bring him over any time; my farmer will have it ready for you." [...] He waited for the up-train; but when the farmer arrived, he was full of all sorts of scruples and reluctances. He said he should not like to buy it till he had heard from Mr. Farnham; he ended by {{offering}} Bartley eighty dollars for the colt on his own account; he did not want the cutter.|$|R
60|$|At New York, Tom wrote a {{short letter}} to {{announce}} his safe arrival, and then pushed on by railway into Indiana. Winter had completely set in; and when he at length arrived at Winiamac, he found that a sleigh was a far readier mode of conveyance to Massissauga than the wagons used in summer. His drive, through the white cathedral-like arcades of forest, hung with transparent icicles, and with the deep blue sky above, becoming orange towards the west, was enjoyable; and even Massissauga itself, when its skeleton trees were like their neighbours, embellished by the pure snowy covering, looked less forlorn than when their death contrasted with the exuberant life around. He stopped at the hotel, <b>left</b> his <b>baggage</b> there, and after undergoing a catechism on his personal affairs, was directed to Mr. Muller's house, {{and made his way}} up its hard-trodden path of snow, towards the green door, at which he knocked two or three times before it was opened by a woman, whose hair and freckled skin were tinted nowhere but in Ireland.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} years of the Third Samnite War (298-290 BC), when Etruscans city-states rose against Rome, the Faliscans {{remained}} loyal to Rome. In 298 BC, after a fight with Volerrae (Volterra), a city-state in northern Etruria, the Romans went to the Faliscan territory, <b>left</b> their <b>baggage</b> in Falerii and proceeded to ravage enemy territory. In 297 BC envoys for the Faliscan cities of Sutrium, Nepete, and Falerii went to Rome to inform the Romans that the city assemblies of Etruria were discussing suing for peace. In 295 BC, before the Battle of Sentinum, where the Romans faced a combined force of Samnites, Etruscans, Umbrians and Senone Gauls, the Romans stationed a reserve army in Faliscan territory. [...] However, in 293 BC the Faliscans made common cause with the Etruscans. Rome declared war on them. They seized the city of Troilum and then took five strong fortresses by storm. The Faliscans sued for peace and were granted a one-year truce after paying an indemnity of 100,000 asses of bronze coinage and year's pay for the troops of the consul who campaigned in Etruria.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Baxter, [...] "you'd {{better get}} rid of the most of that as soon as you can, for if you travel with that sort of heavy weight in the Mediterranean countries, you might as well write home and get your house mortgaged. All along the lines of travel, in the south of Europe, you find the hotels piled up with American <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> there by travellers, who'll never send for it. It reminds one of the rows of ox skeletons that used to mark out the roads to California. But I guess you'll be able to stick it out. Good bye. Let me hear from you." ...|$|R
60|$|General Hunter started next day, at noon, {{with two}} of his brigades and the mounted troops; the other two brigades following, at nightfall. The {{previous}} night {{had been one of the}} most unpleasant Gregory had ever spent. The long-expected rain had come at last. It began suddenly; there was a flash of lightning, and then came a violent burst of wind, which tore down the tents and the flimsy shelters of the Egyptians and Soudanese. Before this had ceased, the rain poured down in a torrent; lightning, wind, and rain kept on till morning, and when the start was made, everyone was soaked to the skin. The Egyptian <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> at the same time, in native craft.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told them}} to let the column pass nearly {{to the head of}} the valley before they opened fire," [...] the count said. [...] "Had they begun soon after the enemy entered the valley, they would have <b>left</b> all their <b>baggage</b> behind under a guard, and the {{infantry}} would have been free to attack the hills at once. Now they are all crowded up in the valley--horse, foot, and baggage. The wounded horses will become unmanageable, and there is sure to be confusion, though perhaps not panic. See, they are answering our fire! They might as well save their powder, for they are only throwing away ammunition by firing away at the hillside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, {{you still}} {{stare at me}} and doubt? Good, I have been telling you lies. I was not {{awaiting}} you upon the quay, and that porter with whom I seemed to quarrel was not charged to seize your baggage {{and bring it to}} my house. No spies watched your movements from England to Beirut. Only since you have been at dinner I visited your room and read some writings which, foolishly, you and John have <b>left</b> among your <b>baggage,</b> and opened some books in which other names than Peter and John were written, and drew a great sword from its scabbard on which was engraved a motto: 'Meet D'Arcy, meet Death!' and heard Peter call John Wulf, and John call Peter Godwin, and so forth." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Historia {{places the}} battle {{shortly after the}} death of García and Ramiro's father, Sancho the Great (18 October 1035), while García was {{returning}} from a pilgrimage to Rome. Taking advantage of his brother's absence, Ramiro is said to have invaded Navarre with the intention of expanding his own Kingdom of Aragon or seizing García's throne, despite his vow to his father to maintain peace with his brothers. García returned in time to ally with their other brother, surprise and surround Ramiro, who had to flee the field shamefully, barefoot atop a horse without spurs or a bit, according to the later chronicler Lucas de Tuy. He <b>left</b> behind his <b>baggage,</b> arms, tents, and that black horse captured by the Navarrese alférez.|$|R
25|$|The {{encounter}} was sudden {{for both}} parties. Faced with superior {{numbers and the}} <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> in the rear, Cao Cao's lightly armoured men became afraid. The Wuhuan, on the other hand, were evidently unprepared for battle as they were not in proper formations, nor did they attempt {{to take the initiative}} by harassing Cao Cao's march. Undaunted, Cao Cao climbed a slope to observe the enemy's formations. He saw that the Wuhuan were unordered, and immediately unleashed his soldiers to exploit this weakness. With general Zhang Liao leading the offensive, the light force swiftly defeated the Wuhuan cavalry, and Cao Chun's brigade captured Tadun. Within a short time, Tadun and many of his men were killed and the battle was over. Over 200,000 Chinese settlers and Wuhuan tribesmen surrendered to Cao Cao.|$|R
60|$|By the way, Mrs. Becky, not to {{be behind}} hand in sentiment, had got a {{miniature}} too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amusement of most people, and the delight of the original, who was no other than our friend Jos. On her first coming to favour the Sedleys with a visit, the little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably small shabby kit, was perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and bandboxes, and often spoke with great respect about her <b>baggage</b> <b>left</b> behind at Leipzig, which she must have from that city. When a traveller talks to you perpetually about the splendour of his luggage, which he does not happen to have with him, my son, beware of that traveller! He is, ten to one, an impostor.|$|R

500|$|So William of Champlitte and Geoffry of Villehardouin [...] {{departed}} from the host, and took with them about a hundred knights, and {{a great number of}} mounted sergeants, and entered into the land of Morea, and rode onwards till they came to the city of Modon. Michael heard that they were in the land with so few people, and he collected together a great number of people, a number that was marvellous, and he rode after them as one thinking they were all no better than prisoners, and in his hand. And when they heard tell that he was coming, they refortified Modon, where the defences had long since been pulled down, and there <b>left</b> their <b>baggage,</b> and the lesser folk. Then they rode out a day's march, and ordered their array with as many people as they had. But the odds seemed too great, for they had no more than five hundred men mounted, whereas on the other part there were well over five thousand. But events happen as God pleases; for our people fought with the Greeks and discomfited and conquered them. And the Greeks lost very heavily, while those on our side gained horses and arms enough, and other goods in very great plenty, and so returned very happy, and very joyously, to the city of Modon.|$|R
6000|$|The {{country through}} which they passed was {{extremely}} beautiful, particularly {{in the eyes of}} our hero, for whom the magnificence of tropical vegetation never lost its charms. The three sportsmen had that morning <b>left</b> their <b>baggage,</b> in a wagon drawn by oxen, in charge of Hicks the trader, who had agreed to allow them to accompany him on a trading expedition, and to serve them in the capacity of guide and general servant. They had made a detour through the forest with a party of six natives, under the guidance of a Caffre servant named Mafuta, and were well repaid for the time thus spent, by the immense variety of insects and plants which the naturalists found everywhere. But that which delighted them most was the animal life with which the whole region teemed. They saw immense herds of wolves, deer of various kinds, hyenas, elands, buffalo, and many other wild beasts, besides innumerable flocks of water-fowl of all kinds. But they passed these unmolested, having set their hearts that day on securing higher game. As Wilkins said, [...] "nothing short of a lion, an elephant, a rhinoceros, or hippopotamus" [...] would satisfy them and that they had some chance of securing {{one or more of these}} formidable brutes was clear, because their voices had been several times heard, and their footprints had been seen everywhere.|$|R
