40|$|Stomach samples (proventriculus and gizzard) of <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> (Accipiter nisus), crow (Corvus corone) and sparrow (Passer domesticus) were {{investigated}} in this study. In histochemical investigations, strong sulfated mucins were not determined in compound glands of proventriculus, {{but a little}} reaction to AB (pH 0. 5) in compound glands was observed in proventriculus of <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> and crow. While weak AB (pH 1. 0) (+) character was found in sparrow gizzard, it was found as dense in superficial glands of <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk.</b> However, it was not observed in crow gizzard. While AF (+) character (sulfated mucins) was detected as dense in epithelium and as weak in glands of gizzard of <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk,</b> this character was not observed in glands of gizzards of crow and sparrow. Any reactivity to Periodic Acid-Shiff (PAS) staining was not observed in both epithelium and glands of sparrow proventriculu...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the poem}} the lover expresses erotic desire and the longing for {{fulfillment}} through his {{wish to be}} a <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> or, which was more prized, a goshawk {{so that he could}} fly to her. In the Middle Ages, the value of a <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> was proportional to its resemblance to the goshawk in size, strength and beauty. The symbolism of the male lover as hunting bird reoccurs in the troubadour lyric and in the Middle High German Minnesang, beginning a century later. The apposition of joy (joi) and grief (dolor) would become a mainstay of the troubadours.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of predator recognition in birds hasn't been understood well yet. There {{are two main}} hypotheses: recognition by components and particulate feature theory. We examined these theories in two-feeder experiment under natural conditions on wild untrained birds. We tested reactions of great tit (Parus major), blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), marsh tit (Poecile palustris), willow tit (Poecile montanus) and Eurasian nuthatch (Sitta europaea) to dummies of scrambled <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> (Accipiter nisus) compared to control complete <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> and pigeon (Columba livia f. domestica). Our results suggested that birds assesss all scrambled dummies equally as a real unscrambled sparrowhawk. Therefore our results support rather the particulate feature theory...|$|R

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the {{structurally}} related polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} associated with chronic neurotoxicity involving reduced motor activity and impaired attentiveness. Such neurobehavioral effects indicate that the central nervous system may represent an important target organ for the action of these persistent contaminants in wildlife. As a consequence, the brain of different terrestrial and aquatic birds collected in Switzerland was analysed for PCBs and PBDEs. In parallel, the same contaminants were examined in the accompanying adipose tissue. After clean-up by means of glass columns containing acidified silica, deactivated alumina and anhydrous sodium sulphate, the samples were analysed by high resolution gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS/MS). Median PCB concentrations in the brain (sum of PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 101, PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180) ranged between 13 ng g(- 1) wet weight (ww) in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and 428 ng g(- 1) ww in <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawks</b> (Accipiter nisus). Median PBDE concentrations in the brain (sum of BDE 28, BDE 47, BDE 99, BDE 100, BDE 153, BDE 154 and BDE 183) ranged from below the decision limit in buzzards (Buteo buteo) and blackbirds, to 14 ng g(- 1) ww in <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawks.</b> After correction for the respective lipid content, higher PCB or PBDE concentrations in brain compared to adipose tissue, were found in three <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawks,</b> four buzzards and in all investigated blackbirds. These results suggest that a deficit in the neuroprotective function of the blood-brain barrier may cause unexpected levels of PCBs and PBDEs in the central nervous system...|$|R
