40|$|Software {{engineers}} are humans {{and so they}} make <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Typically 1 out of 10 to 100 tasks go wrong. The only way to avoid these mistakes is to introduce redundancy in the software engineering process.

This number is hardly influenced by the size of a programming endeavour. Training software engineers does have some effect as non trained software engineers require a double amount of redundant tasks to deliver software of a desired quality. More compact programming, for instance by using domain specific languages, only reduces the number of redundant tasks by a small constant...|$|R

40|$|Back in 2009, while {{finishing}} my Computer Science degree, I {{woke up in}} {{the middle}} of the night with an idea. The idea that semantics, that true semantics, could only be found in the relations among entities. Indeed, for me a book is defined by concepts like page, reading, paper, word, author, library, burn, “I, Robot”, and many others. And the removal of any of those concepts from my mind would change what a book actually means. The simplicity and clarity of this idea (the semantics are in the relations!) has haunted me for six years. My wife, who was with me on that fateful 2009 night and had to endure six years of the same conversation topic, is witness. Gràcies Sara. In 2009 I believed that idea was key for the development of AI. And after finishing my CS degree, doing a master on AI, and writing this thesis, I still believe it. My faith, my obsession with this idea is the only reason why this thesis exists. It’s a piece of myself. This thesis is not the answer to AI however, not even close.

40|$|Abstract Background Cambodia is {{affected}} by antibiotic resistance but interventions to reduce the level of resistance require knowledge of the phenomena that lead to inappropriate prescribing. We interviewed physicians working in public hospitals to explore the drivers of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Methods Hospitals participating in a knowledge, attitudes and practices survey prior to this study were purposively selected and physicians were randomly recruited to participate in focus group discussions. Nvivo version 10 was used to inductively code the qualitative transcripts and manage thematic data analysis. Results Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was a common practice and driven by seven factors: prescribing habit, limited diagnostic capacity, lack of microbiology evidence, non-evidence-based clinical guidelines, perceived patient demand, poor hygiene and infection control, and perceived bacterial resistance to narrow spectrum antibiotics. “Every day, doctors are not performing appropriately. We have made <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> with our antibiotic prescribing. ” When a patient’s clinical condition was not responsive to empiric treatment, physicians changed to a broader spectrum antibiotic and microbiology services were sought only after failure of a treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This habitual empirical prescribing was a common practice regardless of microbiology service accessibility. Poor hygiene and infection control practices were commonly described as reasons for ‘preventive’ prescribing with full course of antibiotics while perception of bacterial resistance to narrow-spectrum antibiotics due to unrestricted access in the community resulted in unnecessary prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics in private practices. Conclusions The practice of prescribing antibiotics by Cambodian physicians is inappropriate and based on prescribing habit rather than microbiology evidence. Improvement in prescribing practice is unlikely to occur unless an education program for physicians focuses on the diagnostic capacity and usefulness of microbiology services. In parallel, hygiene and infection control in hospital must be improved, evidence-based antibiotic prescribing guidelines must be developed, and access to antibiotics in community must be restricted...|$|R
