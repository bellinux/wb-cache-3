5|$|One of the {{principal}} French diversionary operations during 1806 was by a force that {{had been sent to}} sea in October 1805 as a diversion during the Trafalgar campaign, which by then was almost over. Sailing from Lorient to West Africa, L'Hermite {{was supposed to have been}} reinforced by a squadron under Jérôme Bonaparte and attack and capture British forts on the West African coast, thus forcing the detachment of British forces from the main campaign in pursuit. The events of the end of the Trafalgar campaign cancelled these plans, and the scheduled reinforcements were instead attached to Willaumez's squadron. Despite this setback, L'Hermite continued with elements of the original plan and attacked British merchant ships and slave ships off West Africa during the spring of 1806, inflicting some <b>local</b> <b>damage</b> but failing to capture a trading post or to affect the wider strategic situation. In June, L'Hermite sailed to Cayenne for supplies and then returned to Europe the following month, encountering part of the British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis on his return and losing the frigate Président.|$|E

40|$|Time domain {{structural}} condition assessment {{methods have been}} studied extensively {{in the last two}} decades due to their effectiveness in dealing with limited and short duration measurements from a structure under operational conditions. The sensitivity-based method is revisited in this paper with an enhancement in the sensitivity with respect to <b>local</b> <b>damages</b> via the singular spectrum analysis technique. The measured response of the structure is decomposed and the sensitivity vectors as well as the computed response vectors are projected into the corresponding decomposition subspace.

The enhanced sensitivity-based method is shown to be capable of yielding more accurate identified results with noisy measurement in a planar truss structure compared to conventional sensitivity-based method.
