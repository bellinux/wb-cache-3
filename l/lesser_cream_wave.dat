40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect that the}} taste of certain metals has on the perception of food. Four spoons plated with different metals (gold, copper, zinc, and stainless steel) were used to taste cream samples having different tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and plain. The results revealed that the zinc and copper spoons, in addition to transferring a somewhat metallic and bitter taste, enhanced to a greater or <b>lesser</b> extent, each <b>cream's</b> dominant taste. Contrary to our expectations, the metallic taste of the copper and zinc spoons did not seem to affect the pleasantness of the samples significantly. These findings reveal that the effect that the metals from which cutlery can be made have on food perception differs from that found when the metal salts are added to the composition of the food itself. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Producers of super-premium ice cream, such as Häagen-Dazs, offer {{a smaller}} {{assortment}} of flavors than {{the producers of}} <b>lesser</b> quality ice <b>cream.</b> Examples of this phenomenon {{can be found in}} other industries as well. In many industries, the producers of higher-quality products offer a smaller assortment of flavors, colors, sizes, patterns, textures, fragrances, tones, styles, models, designs, types or other options. This paper explores when and why producers of super-premium products should find it profitable to offer a smaller assortment than the producers of nonpremium products. We derive a Nash equilibrium both on prices and product assortments for a triopoly. At the Nash equilibrium, we show that additional product quality, increased consumer price-sensitivity and greater assortment costs discourages product assortment. We also show that a larger market potential, greater competitive costs and sharper competition encourage more assortment by the super-premium producer. marketing, competition...|$|R
40|$|A {{microchip}} CE-based {{method for}} the quantification of the thiols mercaptoethanoic acid (MAA) and 2 -mercaptopropionic acid (2 -MPA) in depilatory <b>cream</b> and cold <b>wave</b> lotions was developed. The thiols were first derivatized with the fluorogenic reagent ammonium- 7 -fluorobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole- 4 -sulfonate (SBD-F). The derivatives were separated within only 20 s by microchip CE and detected by their fluorescence. Conventional CE with {{diode array detection}} and LC with fluorescence detection were used for validation. The internal standard 3 -mercaptopropionic acid (3 -MPA) provided RSDs of multiple injections of only 4 % or less for the MCE approach. LOD is 2 µM, LOQ 6 µM, and the linear range comprises nearly three decades of concentration starting at the LOQ...|$|R
30|$|The {{classification}} and labelling {{of personal}} care products was derived by application of the criteria given in the CLP Regulation. Bridging principles were not relevant as no information about comparable cosmetic products tested and classified as mixtures was available. 41 cosmetic products were selected {{from a wide range}} of product groups (e.g. [27, 28]): baby skin product (2), after shave (2), shaving cream, deodorant (4), toothpaste (2), shampoo (2), hand and body lotion, shower gel, liquid soap and syndet, eye zone cream, massage oil, carotene skincare gel, all purpose cream, basic cream, hand cream, emulsion with panthenol, massage oil, hair spray (2), oxidative hair dye formula, bleaching lotion, depilatory <b>cream,</b> cold <b>wave</b> solution, mascara (2), lipstick (2), face make up remover, nail glue, perfume, alcohol free cologne, insect repellent (2). The number of ingredients ranged from 41 (perfume) to a single one (nail glue). The formulas are basic recipes for standard products and correspond to lists of ingredients of products in German retail shops and cosmetic frame formulations [8]. The present selection of products is meant to illustrate the situation with some examples and it is not meant to be complete nor representative. The information on properties necessary for {{classification and labelling}} of all ingredients were compiled from data accessible to the general public. Preferentially harmonized classifications were used in the current C&L Inventory [9]. The classifications of substances registered according to REACH were compared with the classifications in the C&L Inventory. Most substances which are used more or less exclusively in cosmetics have not been registered according to REACH, whereas cosmetic ingredients used also in other applications like e.g. glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, isododecane, isopropanol, or phosphoric acid are registered. The recently installed cosmetic products notification portal according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [6] is not open for the general public and could not be used. The names used here are the INCI names [29].|$|R
60|$|Yet even Canaletto, in {{relation}} to the truths he had to paint, is spiritual, faithful, powerful, compared to the Dutch painters of sea. It is easily understood why his green paint and concave touches should be thought expressive of the water on which the real colors are not to be discerned but by attention, which is never given; but it is not so easily understood, considering how many there are who love the sea, and look at it, that Vandevelde and such others should be tolerated. As I before said, I feel utterly hopeless in addressing the admirers of these men, because I do not know what it is in their works which is supposed to be like nature. Foam appears to me to curdle and <b>cream</b> on the <b>wave</b> sides and to fly, flashing from their crests, and not to be set astride upon them like a peruke; and waves appear to me to fall, and plunge, and toss, and nod, and crash over, and not to curl up like shavings; and water appears to me, when it is gray, to have the gray of stormy air mixed with its own deep, heavy, thunderous, threatening blue, and not the gray of the first coat of cheap paint on a deal door; and many other such things appear to me which, as far as I can conjecture by what is admired of marine painting, appear to no one else; yet I shall have something more to say about these men presently, with respect to the effect they have had upon Turner; and something more, I hope, hereafter, with the help of illustration.|$|R
