5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

Beth tries to control it <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> else in her life. She and Conrad were, Calvin notes, the only people not to cry at Buck's funeral.|$|E

Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E
500|$|In May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral.

500|$|D.A.N. Jones, {{writing in}} The New York Review of Books thought The Man with the Golden Gun was [...] "an {{innocuous}} run-of-the-mill adventure story of 1911 vintage", Anthony Lejeune, {{writing in the}} National Review, thought that it [...] "is undeniably slight, but, <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> Fleming wrote, intensely readable... In a sense Fleming's job was finished. He had irrevocably transformed the genre in which he worked".

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stop" [...] was shot on 27 January 1998 in Ireland, and was {{directed}} by James Byrne. About the concept, Melanie Brown commented: [...] "There wasn't a storyboard for this video—it was more trial and error. It wasn't planned {{down to the last}} detail and was quite a free-for-all. It's <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> we do—complete chaos! [...] And we all want to get our bit in, so the director {{has to be able to}} encompass us all, plus put his ideas on top of it, and make it all flow.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} were greeted with somewhat less enthusiasm than the episode as a whole, and given mixed to positive reviews.

Saskin wrote that [...] "Rachel sings Jason Mraz, <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> else, beautifully", while Rolling Stone Erica Futterman credits her for having made a [...] "sappy ballad mildly more tolerable". Strecker gave the performance a [...] "B+" [...] grade and called it a [...] "classic Berry power ballad"; [...] "B" [...] grades were given by Slezak and Washington Post Jen Chaney, who also noted Rachel's [...] "vocal power".|$|E

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Danielle Cheesman of MSN {{opined that}} [...] "the song sounds <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> else Mike WiLL's touched and turned to gold {{so it will be}} a smash but, much to Miley's chagrin, it won't be because of her", and criticized Cyrus' verses for [...] " [...] whole flow." [...] Tony Maglio from The Wrap also {{questioned}} her lyrical content, specifically criticizing the lyrics [...] "I back it up, cause I don’t give a fuck" [...] and [...] "I’m MC Hammer fly." [...] Jordan Sargent from Spin called the track [...] "far from Mike Will's best work" [...] and negatively compared Cyrus' delivery to that of Lil Debbie.|$|E

I <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> about him." [...] On the other hand, Dallas Stewart, trainer of rival Commanding Curve, dismissed California Chrome's chances due to his pedigree and the supposed lack of competition in his prior races. Others doubted his ability because the colt had never raced outside California. In contrast to the critics, reports surfaced that the owners had turned down a new offer of $10million.|$|E

500|$|... "Never Too Far" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Billboard's Chuck Taylor gave a positive review for the song, {{calling it a}} [...] "shimmering ballad" [...] that showcases the singer [...] excelling at what made her a famous: [...] "singing {{the hell out of}} a straight ahead love song free of gimmicks, gymnastics and self-conscious attempts at targeting any particular demographic"; he also said that [...] "Never Too Far" [...] would relieve fans that think Carey had been [...] "relying more upon samples and guest vocalists lately than melody and artful performing". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song another [...] "syrupy-sweet" [...] ballad on the album and that it [...] "harbors over-the-top performances worthy of [...] "Star Search" [...] (more than fitting considering the film's '80s-era rags-to-riches storyline)". Harry Guerin from Raidió Teilifís Éireann wrote that [...] "Never Too Far" [...] showcased [...] "her four octave range but sound roughly <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> else she's committed to tape during her career".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{appreciated}} many of Guitar Hero 5s features, {{but found}} the soundtrack {{to be the}} weakest feature of the game. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the track list [...] "extremely diverse", and Arthur Gies of GameSpy felt that the song selection was based on [...] "careful consideration for the most part", to avoid songs with short-lived appeal. However, the variety of songs [...] was found to also work against the game. Reviewers noted that players would find songs they liked, {{but at the same}} time, would find songs they loathed. Erik Brudvig of IGN noted that while [...] "the goal was to include a bit of everything", the range of songs on the track list [...] "ensure that nobody will <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> on the disc". The soundtrack's diversity also affected the Career progression; while the guitar difficulty progression in the Career mode was considered better than in previous games, it left the vocals and drummer progression [...] "all over the place".|$|E
500|$|Dave Simpson of The Guardian {{described}} {{the opening of}} the show during his review: [...] "Some while after Beyoncé is due on stage, a voice announces that the support act won't be appearing and that Beyoncé will be with us 'in a moment'. <b>Like</b> <b>everything</b> else – hits, boots, hair and sponsorship deals – moments are very big in Beyoncé world. An age later, cheers erupt for the raising of a curtain which revealed, er, a roadie fiddling with a drum kit. An hour later, the piped music is getting gradually louder to drown boos and the cries of small children whose parents are moaning it's getting past their bedtime." [...] The show opens with [...] "Baby Boy" [...] which Beyoncé sang while being lowered onto the stage upside down. A highlight for many fans was her performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love 2". During the tour, a special 8-minutes rendition of the song was performed.|$|E

500|$|Doctors {{observed}} that Trott continually stood in one place, showing {{little interest in}} events around him. [...] A doctor noted on Trott's file: [...] "Refuses to converse not appearing {{to be able to}} follow what is said to him. Answers questions in monosyllables. Does not rouse up when subjects are spoken of that formerly he was interested in." [...] Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket, which he did in a [...] "mechanical, indifferent fashion". In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him. [...] A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: [...] "Here is a well-known cricketer, whom we once treated as a hero.

500|$|The Nightfly was {{met with}} almost universally {{positive}} reviews. Billboard labeled it their top album pick {{in the first month}} of its release, calling it a [...] "stunning debut" [...] and praising its [...] "typically blue chip crew of crack players and crisp digital production." [...] David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone that [...] "Donald Fagen conjures a world where all things are possible, even to a kid locked in his bedroom." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, gave the album an A and commented, [...] "these songs are among Fagen's finest [...] his acutely shaded lyrics puts the jazziest music he's ever committed to vinyl into a context that <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> here is loving but very clear-eyed." [...] Robert Palmer of The New York Times called The Nightfly a [...] "vivid and frequently ingenious look back at a world that is gone forever. Its sound is glossy and contemporary, but references to both the spirit and the music of the years when Mr. Fagen was growing up can be found in almost every song." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E
