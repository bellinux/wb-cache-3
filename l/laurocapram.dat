40|$|Promoting {{effect of}} cyclic monoterpenes on {{percutaneous}} absorption of antiarrhytmic drugs disopyramide, lidocaine and trimecaine {{was investigated in}} the rats. <b>Laurocapram</b> (Azone) {{was used as a}} standard comparator of penetration enhancement. The absorption of trimecaine was significantly enhanced by addition of limonene, trans-p-menthane and Azone in 1 % concentration. Lidocaine and disopyramide penetrated across the skin only when 1 % of limonene was used. Other cyclic monoterpenes showed no effect on percutaneous absorption of examined drugs...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the formulation effects of <b>laurocapram</b> and iminosulfurane derived penetration modifiers on human stratum corneum using thermal and spectral analyses. Firstly, formulations of penetration modifiers were assessed as enhancers/retardants using the model permeant, diethyl-m-toluamide followed by investigation of their mechanisms of action using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy. The penetration modifiers investigated were <b>laurocapram,</b> 3 -dodecanoyloxazolidin- 2 -one (N- 0915), S,S-dimethyl-N-(4 -bromobenzoyl) iminosulfurane (DMBIS), S,S-dimethyl-N-(2 -methoxycarbonylbenzenesulfonyl) iminosulfurane (DMMCBI) and tert-butyl 1 -dodecyl- 2 -oxoazepan- 3 -yl-carbamate (TBDOC) that were formulated in either water, propylene glycol (PG), ethanol or polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400). The results explain the mechanism {{for the first time}} why an enhancer can become a retardant or vice versa depending upon the vehicle in which it is applied to the skin. DSC indicated that penetration modifier formulations enhanced permeation of active mainly by disruption and fluidization of the stratum corneum lipid bilayers while IR data indicated characteristic blue shifts with decreases in peak intensity. On the other hand, DSC of penetration modifier formulations showing retardation depicted elevated Tm 2 with a strengthening of lipid–protein complex while IR results indicated formation of multiple peaks around 1, 738  cm− 1 transition in stratum corneum spectra suggesting retardation may be caused by organization of SC lipids by increased H-bonding...|$|E
40|$|The {{permeability}} coefficient of 5 -fluorouracil through human abdominal and hairless mouse skins {{was used as}} an indicator of the relative effects of 12 -h pretreatment of the skins with either penetration-enhancer mixtures [including <b>laurocapram</b> (Azone), decylmethylsulfoxide, oleic acid, and propylene glycol] or saline (control). After treatment with saline, fluxes of 5 -fluorouracil through the two skin types were similar, but the mouse skin showed exaggerated responses to all the penetration-enhancer formulations. There was no consistent relationship between enhancer effects on the two skin types, and we conclude that the hairless mouse model should not be used to predict the effects of penetration enhancers in human skin. After treatment with saline, hairless mouse skin sharply increased in permeability after approximately 50 h hydration, suggesting that the stratum corneum had started to disrupt, whereas the flux through human skin remained unchanged...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to provide further {{understanding}} of skin barrier function from a chemical point of view. The main barrier {{is known to be}} located in the outermost layer of the skin, stratum corneum, composed of cornified flattened cells in conjunction with an extracellular lipid-water matrix. From literature it is evident that the lipids of this matrix are arranged as bilayers, aligned parallel to the skin surface, preventing penetration of both polar and non-polar substances. However, the complex mixture of significantly different lipids in skin implies phase-separation to be reasonable expectation. The well-known penetration enhancer Azone® (<b>laurocapram)</b> was used to study the effects on lipid morphology and any transformation into non-lamellar structures was believed to reflect a higher permeability of polar and/or non-polar substances. Azone was added to several different lipid-water systems, some of them chosen because they are previously well characterised while others show a closer resemblance to the actual lipid composition of stratum corneum. The fatty acid and the fatty acid-cholesterol systems showed multiple phase co-existence at body temperature and below. The effects observed from adding penetration enhancers like azone were formation of reversed types of phases in liquid crystals and phase separation into a separate oil phase and water-enriched phases, due to the ability of azone to dissolve protonated fatty acids as well as cholesterol. The presence of cholesterol in fatty acid-soap-water mixtures maintained the lamellar liquid crystal, while azone caused a swelling of the bilayer to a certain level. Azone was observed to solubilize gel phases, but no significant effect on the crystals in pure fatty acid-soap-water mixtures was observed. A thorough investigation on the swelling behaviour of bicontinuous lyotropic mesophases was undertaken and the theory obtained here was applied to SAXD-data from the glycerol monooleate (GMO) -water system, containing azone. The obtained results indicate about 19 % of the weakly polar, and water immiscible, azone to be anchored at the lipid-water interface. This corresponds to an effective surfactant parameter, cpp, of azone well over one (i. e. azone clearly favours reversed types of phases in liquid crystals). These observations clearly indicate that one reason for the enhanced permeability through skin of several substances by adding azone (or other substances such as oleic acid) may be the formation of non-lamellar structures in the extracellular lipid matrix. In addition, the occurrence of multiple phases, both liquid crystalline and gel/crystalline, support the idea of the matrix being non-homogeneous in lipid composition. Phase co-existence has also been observed in skin lipids and in stratum corneum in vitro by others. This domain mosaic organisation of the lipids would also contribute to the barrier efficiency...|$|E
