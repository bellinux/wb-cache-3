5|$|In {{accordance}} with the family's tradition, Scott {{and his younger brother}} Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services. Scott spent four years at a <b>local</b> <b>day</b> school before being sent to Stubbington House School in Hampshire, a cramming establishment that prepared candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth. Having passed these exams Scott began his naval career in 1881, as a 13-year-old cadet.|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a <b>local</b> <b>day</b> during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E

25|$|Yokneam Illit's {{accelerated}} {{demand for}} {{day care and}} Kindergartens led to a shortage of space in <b>local</b> <b>day</b> care and Kindergartens {{at the same time}} that there was a shortage of children at some of the Kibbutzim. In order to avoid sending their children to other small communities in the area, Kibbutz children's houses and Kindergartens began accepting children from nearby Yokneam Illit, and in some cases the number of children from Yokneam Illit outnumbered the Kibbutz children. This phenomenon later extended to the elementary and secondary schools until the building of new schools in Yokneam Illit was able to catch up with demand.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Lynsey became {{attracted}} to widower Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) {{and they began}} a short relationship. After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a <b>local</b> <b>day</b> spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would have to wait {{to see what would happen}} between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph.|$|E

5000|$|Gethen orbits {{its primary}} star once every 0.96 Earth years (8401 Earth hours). The planet rotates around its axis in 23.08 earth hours, so a Gethenian year {{consists}} of 364 <b>local</b> <b>days.</b> The only natural satellite {{of the planet}} revolves around it in 26 <b>local</b> <b>days,</b> which constitutes a month. The year is divided into 14 of these lunar months. By fortunate coincidence, the deviation between this lunisolar calendar and the true solar year is small enough to require a correction only once every 200 years. Thus the days are synchronized with the moon phase every month. Each day in a month has a unique name. Days are not grouped in weeks, but the month is evenly divided in two halves of 13 days each (the names of the days {{in the second half}} are derived regularly from those of the first half). [...] Gethenians further divide each day into ten parts or [...] "hours", the first one starting at noon.|$|R
