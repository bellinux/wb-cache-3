A parcel in a <b>logistic</b> <b>process</b> would no longer be a simple item to be transported from A to B. Instead it exerts direct influence on its own path. Based on the approach of the “Internet of Things”, the parcel is equipped with “intelligence”. By using e.g. RFID-labels, it recognizes its destination within the logistic system by itself. All means of transportation integrated into a <b>logistic</b> <b>process</b> are equipped with RFID-Readers 1 and are thus able to read out the parcel’s label. The information stored on the RFID-label can now be used to control the <b>logistic</b> <b>process.</b> The decision on the exact path of the parcel is no longer made by a central control system or a human being but by the means of transport in cooperation with the parcel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Logistic</b> <b>processes</b> are {{inherently}} dynamic and hence require {{the ability to}} plan and re-plan in complex situations, under rigid time constraints, and in light of uncertain, incomplete, and false information. Standard scenarios of <b>logistic</b> <b>processes</b> typically have been modeled {{on the basis of}} static graphtheoretic representations. The well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), the vehicle routing problem (VRP), or the pickup & delivery problem (PDP) reduce the complex task of transportation to a route optimization problem. They neglect both the important role of knowledge and communication in real-world <b>logistic</b> <b>processes</b> (cf.

40|$|International audience—The <b>Logistic</b> <b>processes</b> {{generally}} lead {{to complex}} physical flows dealing with various logistic elements. It {{has been widely}} observed {{that the quality of}} uncontrolled processes decline with the evolving complexity. It may make them incoherent and quasi obsoletes. Thus, the continuous optimization of <b>logistic</b> <b>processes</b> is essential for the consistent continuity of logistic activities, and henceforth, it supports their desired growth. In this paper, we propose a reasoning system that uses the conceptual domain of logistics and their optimization. The proposed approach is mainly based on the definition of logistic terminologies using ontology. We intend, that a logistic expert may use defined terms to specify a problem. These can be matched to extract the involved <b>logistic</b> <b>processes.</b> It may assist a logistics expert to identify and/or precisely specify the logistic problem. Furthermore, it may identify the <b>logistic</b> <b>processes,</b> that can be executed, to resolve the problem and consequently to resolve the inherent optimization problems.

These developments are caused through the evolution of virtual organisations and the increasing maturity of new ICT technologies like RFID and ubiquitous computing. The rising complexity of organisational structures leads to an increasing utilisation of existing processes [1]. To coordinate all these processes, an increasing demand of required information for just in time deliverables is needed. These requirements exceed the abilities of existing standard <b>logistic</b> <b>processes.</b> To fulfil future needs in logistics, the development of adaptive, self controlled <b>logistic</b> <b>processes</b> is necessary. This can be realised through autonomous, decentralised control systems, which select alternatives autonomously and decide within a given framework of goals.
