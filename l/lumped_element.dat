5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII. <b>Lumped</b> <b>element</b> analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology {{can be found in}} several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Methods {{to model}} {{metamaterial}} structures consisting of <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> embedded into transmission lines using multiresolution time-domain (MRTD) {{are presented in}} this paper. Specifically, this paper presents the modeling of <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> in MRTD, including elements that are smaller than a cell (subcell modeling). Using this technique, several <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> in any configuration can be modeled within a cell. The technique presented here {{is based on a}} deconstruction/reconstruction algorithm originally developed for subcell PEC modeling, and is here extended to <b>lumped</b> <b>elements.</b> MRTD is particularly well suited to metamaterial modeling due to its adaptive gridding. In addition, as a time domain method, properties such as negative group delay can be observed directly in the time domain response. I...|$|R

5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
40|$|The Whitney-elements time-domain (WETD) {{method is}} a very {{powerful}} full-wave EM field solver in time domain. The WETD method is here applied to solve a coupled problem of EM fields and circuits, which are characterized by <b>lumped</b> <b>elements,</b> distributed elements and independent sources. The method consists in the variation of the finite element functional to include circuit elements in the computational domain. By locating the terminals of the <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> in two nodes delimiting an edge of the FEM mesh, a simple computational procedure is obtained. The distributed elements are modeled as a series of <b>lumped</b> <b>elements.</b> The proposed full-wave method is a suitable tool to analyze electrical circuits and EM fields in complex configurations...|$|R

25|$|There is a {{long history}} of work {{attempting}} to build ontologies for a variety of task domains, e.g., an ontology for liquids, the <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model widely used in representing electronic circuits (e.g.,), as well as ontologies for time, belief, and even programming itself. Each of these offers a way to see some part of the world.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model, for instance, {{suggests}} that we think of circuits in terms of components with connections between them, with signals flowing instantaneously along the connections. This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises {{if we need to}} attend to the electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have {{to be thought of as}} an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.|$|E
25|$|The {{commitment}} made selecting one {{or another}} ontology can produce a sharply different view of the task at hand. Consider the difference that arises in selecting the <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.|$|E

500|$|Waveguide filter designs {{frequently}} {{consist of}} two different components repeated a number of times. [...] Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit. [...] Often, the filter type will take {{its name from the}} style of this component. [...] These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer. [...] The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance. [...] The net result is a <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> equivalent circuit of a ladder network. [...] <b>Lumped</b> <b>element</b> filters are commonly ladder topology, and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs. [...] Figure 4 shows such a ladder. [...] Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be LC resonators instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as prototype filters {{with the use of a}} band-pass or band-stop transformation.|$|E
500|$|Some {{important}} {{advances in}} network theory were needed before filters could be advanced beyond wartime designs. One {{of these was}} the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards. Commensurate lines are networks {{in which all the}} elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. Richards' transformation allows a <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> design to be taken [...] "as is" [...] and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{limit to}} the {{applicability}} of this <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model. [...] The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant, or equivalently, if there is no significant phase difference in the wave either side of the component. [...] What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be, but a common rule of thumb is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a wavelength. [...] Since wavelength decreases with frequency, this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design. [...] This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain. [...] This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths (mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6,000m/s, electromagnetic waves in common cable types propagate at about [...] ). [...] For instance, traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600kHz (although MEMS devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size). [...] In the electrical domain, on the other hand, the transition from the <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model to the distributed element model occurs in the hundreds of megahertz region.|$|E
