5|$|Birds of {{variable}} size with slender bodies and long tails. Some species are <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> {{eggs in the}} nests of other birds. There are about 141 species worldwide, one of which breeds in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs on it, leaving it in place, or carry {{it back to}} their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, {{digging into}} the {{petioles}} and stems. After emerging in late summer, they pupate in soil.|$|E
50|$|Green Sea Turtles {{can be seen}} <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> eggs on {{the beaches}} between February and September.|$|R

5|$|A female may lay {{from several}} dozen to several {{thousand}} eggs during her lifetime, {{depending on the}} extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by scarab beetles, which house, feed and protect their young. The Attelabidae roll leaves and <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs inside the roll for protection.|$|E
5|$|Adult frogs <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once {{the eggs}} hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, {{one at a}} time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E
5|$|Adult males vigorously defend territories near water; {{these areas}} provide {{suitable}} habitat for the larvae to develop, and for females to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs. Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to prey on swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites.|$|E
60|$|Here, now, are {{two great}} whales, <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> heads {{together}}; let us join them, and lay together our own.|$|R
25|$|For instance, an entropic {{argument}} has been recently proposed for explaining the preference of cave spiders {{in choosing a}} suitable area for <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> eggs.|$|R
50|$|Spawning {{takes place}} in spring, when a seaweed nest is built and guarded by the male, {{with one or more}} females <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> {{adhesive}} eggs in it.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs on land.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, pairs {{are known}} to select and clean {{generally}} flattened horizontal or vertical surfaces on which to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> 1,000 to 3,000 eggs. Like most cichlids, A. ocellatus practices brood care, although the duration of brood care in the wild remains unknown.|$|E

50|$|If {{a player}} fails {{to begin their}} play with a pluck or end their play with a discard, {{including}} when <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> hand, there is a 50 point penalty.|$|R
5|$|Natural predators {{of black}} bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae devour their hosts from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave {{in this way}} and may provide a measure of control of the aphids.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E
5|$|The Viduidae is {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to Africa that includes indigobirds and whydahs. All species are brood parasites, which <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs in the nests of estrildid finches. Species usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage.|$|E
60|$|As they {{approached}} the village, they heard a deep, hollow sound, and stopping to listen, and <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> ears to the ground, could distinguish the rumble of heavy carriages.|$|R

5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring. Some temperate region butterflies, such as the Camberwell beauty, <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs {{in the spring and}} have them hatch in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs in water.|$|E
5|$|The flesh-footed shearwater, which breeds {{in large}} numbers on the main island in spring-autumn, used to have its chicks {{harvested}} for food by the islanders. The wedge-tailed and little shearwaters breed on the main island and surrounding islets; though {{only a small number}} of the latter species can be found on the main island. Breeding white-bellied storm petrels were another discovery by Roy Bell. Masked boobies are the largest seabirds breeding on Lord Howe and can be seen nesting and gliding along the sea cliffs at Mutton Bird Point all year round. Sooty terns can be seen on the main island at Ned's and Middle Beaches, North Bay, and Blinkey Beach; the most numerous of the island's breeding seabirds, their eggs were formerly harvested for food. Common and black noddies build nests in trees and bushes, while white terns <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> single eggs precariously in a slight depression on a tree branch, and grey ternlets <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs in cliff hollows.|$|E

50|$|Silphids {{are usually}} not {{considered}} a nuisance to humans. They help the environment by <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> eggs on carcasses and the larvae break down the detritus, which prevents accumulation of deceased organisms.|$|R
50|$|Emersonella is a genus of {{hymenopteran}} insects of {{the family}} Eulophidae. Several species {{are known to be}} phoretic parasitoids of female tortoise beetles, <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> eggs in the eggs of the beetle host.|$|R
5|$|Thrips lay {{extremely}} small eggs, about 0.2mm long. Females of the suborder Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their ovipositor, and insert their eggs, one per slit. Females of the suborder Tubulifera <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs singly {{or in small}} groups on the outside surfaces of plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} leisure spots and {{conservation}} areas are available around Sandakan. The Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary {{is a place}} where orphaned or injured orangutans are brought to be rehabilitated to return to forest life. Established in 1964, it is one of only four orangutan sanctuaries in the world. Other conservation areas are the Malaysian Turtle Islands where many turtles <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs on the islands. They cover an area of 1,740 hectares which includes the surrounding reefs and seas. The islands are also ideal for swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

25|$|Many {{birds are}} {{also able to}} detect changes {{in the number of}} eggs in their nest and brood. Parasitic cuckoos are often known to remove one of the host eggs before <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|R
50|$|These tubenoses fly like shearwaters, with stiff {{wings and}} {{shearing}} technique across wave fronts. This technique saves energy. During breeding season they utilize coastal cliffs on islands, <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> single egg in a burrow.|$|R
