25|$|McLaren Automotive {{introduced}} a seven speed dual clutch on MP4-12C made in Italy by Oerlikon Graziano. The design {{comes with a}} feature called Pre-Cog that lets the driver preselect the next highest or <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> decreasing shift times.|$|E
25|$|This {{term has}} no {{generally}} accepted meaning. Originally it {{referred to a}} gearing arrangement which had one especially low gear (for climbing Alpine passes); this low gear often had a larger than average jump to the next <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> In the 1960s the term was used by salespeople to refer to then current 10-speed bicycles (2 chainrings, 5-sprocket cogset), without any regard to its original meaning. The nearest current equivalent to the original meaning {{can be found in}} the Shimano Megarange cogsets, where most of the sprockets have roughly a 15% relative difference, except for the largest sprocket which has roughly a 30% difference; this provides a much lower gear than normal at the cost of a large gearing jump.|$|E
500|$|While skate skiing, {{the skier}} {{provides}} propulsion on a firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis {{away from one}} another at an angle, {{in a manner similar}} to ice skating. Skis are waxed with a glide wax over their entire length, making them faster than classic skis. Freestyle events take place on smooth, wide specially groomed courses. With the skating technique double-poling is usually employed with alternating skating strides or with every skate stride. The following table puts these poling sequences into order according to the speed achieved as a progression of [...] "gears". In the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> (rarely used in racing), one is poling on the side of the sliding ski, similar to diagonal stride. In the highest gear, the athlete skates without poles. There are equivalent terms in other languages; for example in Norwegian, skating is likened to paddling or dancing, depending on the tempo.|$|E
50|$|It was {{programmed}} {{to start in}} <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> providing a gear ratio of 1.765:1 plus the additional low-speed multiplication of the torque converter. The shift pattern was Park-Reverse-Neutral-Drive-Low. In Drive at full throttle, it would upshift from <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> to high gear at 60 - 65 mph.|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} table {{provides some}} {{comparison of the}} various methods of measuring gears (the particular numbers are for bicycles with 170mm cranks, 700C wheels, and 25mm tyres). Speeds for several cadences in revolutions per minute are also given. [...] On each row the relative values for gear inches, metres of development, gain ratio, and speed {{are more or less}} correct, while the front/rear values are the nearest approximation which can be made using typical chainring and cogset sizes. Note that bicycles intended for racing may have a <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> of around 45 gear inches (or 35 if fitted with a compact crankset).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Insight had {{a conventional}} manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT {{variant of the}} Insight was available; the CVT {{is similar to that}} used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it upon movement). Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an [...] "Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the Power control Unit, the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, dc-to-dc converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the cargo floor of the vehicle, behind the seats.|$|E

50|$|Gear inches is one {{of several}} {{relative}} measures of bicycle gearing, giving an indication of the mechanical advantage of different gears. Values for 'gear inches' typically range from 20 (very <b>low</b> <b>gearing)</b> via 70 (medium gearing) to 125 (very high gearing); as in a car, <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> is for going up hills and high gearing is for going fast.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a {{tractive effort}} of 14,300 lb in <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> which enabled it to move loads {{of up to}} 1000 tons in <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> at walking speed. In a higher gear, the locomotives could haul a lighter load at speeds of up to 30 mph, a respectable figure for a locomotive that had relatively small (39¾") driving wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Ratio 19:19, <b>Low</b> <b>gear</b> 12600 lbf kN, High gear 4705 lbf kN (68154-68179 and 68184-68185) ...|$|R

50|$|The IGR, hub {{revolutions}} per sprocket {{revolution of}} the Speedhub, lies between 0.279 and 1.467 depending on the gear chosen. The Speedhub has a 526&thinsp;% range between the highest and <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> Gear 11, with a ratio of 1.0, is called the neutral gear.|$|E
50|$|A bicycle with a 26-inch wheel, a 48-tooth chainring, and a {{cassette}} with gears ranging from 11 to 34 teeth has a <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> of 26 &times; 48 / 34 = 37 gear inches and a highest gear of 26 &times; 48 / 11 = 113 gear inches.|$|E
50|$|A two plate dry disk {{diaphragm}} spring clutch drove Fuller four-speed main and three-speed auxiliary transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive <b>gears.</b> The <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> allowed several very <b>low</b> <b>gears</b> for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|R

50|$|The crawl {{ratio is}} aptly named because when a vehicle is driven using the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> (i.e. first gear), it moves the slowest (i.e. crawl speed) {{at a given}} engine rpm, and thus {{produces}} the highest output torque (i.e. crawl torque) at the road wheels due to conservation of power.|$|E
50|$|If {{the ring}} gear is held {{stationary}} and the sun gear is used as the input, the planet carrier will be the output. The gear ratio {{in this case will}} be 1/(1 + N/N). This is the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> ratio attainable with an epicyclic gear train. This type of gearing is sometimes used in tractors and construction equipment to provide high torque to the drive wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Autobike {{was equipped}} with a system of centrifugal weights on the rear wheel with a rear derailleur attached to them. When the rider started pedaling it would cause the weights to spin outwards, which shifted the derailleur to a higher gear. When the rider stops pedaling and the bike comes to a stop, the weights {{would return to the}} centre position, shifting the bike into its <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> to get started.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{diesel engines}} in {{locomotives}} and some watercraft use diesel-electric drive. This eliminates {{the complexities of}} extremely <b>low</b> <b>gearing,</b> as described below.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> the {{sprocket}} {{drives the}} annulus (in red above) {{and the planet}} carrier (in green above) drives the hub, giving a gear reduction.|$|R

50|$|The Rohloff Speedhub is an {{epicyclic}} internal {{hub gear}} for bicycles, developed and patented by Rohloff AG. It has been manufactured and marketed by that company since 1998. The Speedhub 500/14 has 14 equally spaced sequential non-overlapping gear ratios {{operated by a}} single twistgrip. The overall gear range is 526%, meaning the highest gear is 5.26 times {{as high as the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> Individual gear shifts when shifting up give an increase of about 13.6% (equivalent to a decrease of about 12.0% when shifting down).|$|E
50|$|The Wilson gearbox was {{produced}} {{with a variety}} of clutches. The best-known is the fluid flywheel, used for touring cars such as the Daimler and the Armstrong-Siddeley. Sports cars used a Newton centrifugal clutch. This was a multiple plate dry clutch, similar to racing manual clutches of the time, but with the pressure plate centrifugally actuated to engage at around 600rpm. Pure racing cars, such as the ERA, avoided a clutch altogether and relied on the progressive engagement of the gearbox's band brake on <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> when starting.|$|E

5000|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{can include}} both synchronized and unsynchronized gearing. For example, reverse gear is usually unsynchronised, {{as the driver}} is only expected to engage it when the vehicle is at a standstill. Many older (up to 1970s) cars also lacked synchronisation on first gear (for various reasons—cost, typically [...] "shorter" [...] overall gearing, engines typically having more low-end torque, the extreme wear on a frequently used first gear synchroniser ...), meaning it also could only be used for moving away from a stop unless the driver became adept at double-declutching and had a particular need to regularly downshift into the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{electronic}} controls allow the motorcycle {{to be operated}} in three modes: Drive, Sport and Manual. In Drive and Sport, it functions much like a CVT scooter, with infinitely variable gearing upshifted and downshifted automatically for what the system determines to be optimal performance. Unlike a scooter, engine braking is always available when decelerating. The difference between Drive and Sport modes is that Drive is optimized for economy while Sport is more responsive. In Manual mode, the transmission operates in one of six discrete gears chosen by the rider by pushing a plus/minus button on the left handlebar. It feels much like a normal motorcycle, including hitting the rev limiter {{at the top of}} each gear, but the ECU prevents upshifting and downshifting too soon. In all modes, it automatically returns to the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> when stopped. It is also possible to switch into neutral while stopped, unlike a scooter.|$|E
