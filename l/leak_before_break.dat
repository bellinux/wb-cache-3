40|$|The Steam Generators (SG) decides the {{capacity}} factor in Sodium cooled Fast breeder Reactor (SFR) plants and hence {{they are designed}} with high reliability. One of the critical locations in SG is the shell nozzle junction. This junction is subjected to an end bending moment and internal pressure. Since the shell nozzle junction is the critical location of SG a double-ended guillotine rupture will result in leakage of large quantity of sodium, which is not desirable. The material of construction is modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo. Hence safety equirements demand that <b>Leak</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Break</b> criteria with assumed initial flaw have to be demonstrated. To demonstrate LBB, the basic requirement is to predict the state of stress precisely in the shell nozzle junction under various loading conditions. An efficient finiteelement modeling for shell nozzle junction has been presented in which shell elements are employed to idealize the whole region. These results are used {{for the analysis of}} <b>leak</b> <b>before</b> <b>break</b> concept...|$|E
40|$|The SKI {{regulation}} SKIFS 2004 : 2 {{allows for}} the use of <b>Leak</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Break</b> (LBB) as one way to provide assurance that adequate protection exists against the local dynamic consequences of a pipe break. The way to demonstrate that LBB prevails relies on a deterministic procedure for which a leakage crack is postulated in certain sections of the pipe based on the leak detection capability of the plant. It shall then be demonstrated that certain margins exist against the critical crack length at which a pipe break can be expected. It is well-known that the crack morphology has a large influence on the leakage flow rate and hence on the LBB-margins. SKI has therefore initiated a project to investigate the influence of the crack morphology on LBB-margins applied on pipe systems in a Swedish PWR-plant. Purpose The purpose of the project is to evaluate the deterministic LBB-margins for different pipe systems in a Swedish PWR-plant and using different crack morphology parameters. Results- The influence of crack morphology on <b>Leak</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Break</b> (LBB) margins is studied. The subject of the report is a number of LBB-submittals to SKI where deterministic LBB-margins are reported. These submittals typically uses a surface roughness o...|$|E

The susceptibility of Steam Generator (SG) Tubes (particularly tubes manufactured from Inconel 600) {{to primary}} water {{stress corrosion cracking}} (PWSCC) {{has been a major}} concern to the nuclear industry since 1971, when this phenomenon was first observed outside the laboratory. Since the susceptibility of Inconel 600 to PWSCC in pure water was first established as a certainty, various electricity utilities have devoted considerable resources to determining the exact nature of this degradation phenomenon and to predicting its consequences. Whereas, the study of the nature of this degradation mechanism has led to many conflicting conclusions, the predictive methods developed have been more successful. Initially, the establishment of the <b>Leak</b> <b>Before</b> Risk of <b>Break</b> principle has allowed various utilities to justify SG operation with cracked tubes. Later, the development of probabilistic simulation methods, most notably by EdF and the Jozef Stefan Institute (JSI), have led to further justification of the existing maintenance regimes and also allowed the ability to do sensitivity studies with regards to various influencing parameters. The current maintenance regime at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (near Cape Town, South Africa) utilises tube plugging (when cracks exceed a certain length limit) and online leak detection (based on detection of radioactive Nitrogen 16) as the main means of ensuring safe SG operation. However, the plugging limit used is based on a conservative deterministic analysis, which may be penalising in some situations. Thus, the need for risk-based SG life-time optimisation was evident...|$|R

Safety of the modified criteria application of <b>Leak</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Break</b> when a residual stress {{is found in the}} vessel material is analysed. Design criterion is based on a critical crack length which must be less than the thickness of the vessel wall. Superposition of residual stress, which occurs in the production of a vessel by impact extrusion, and the hoop stress caused by the internal pressure significantly affects the life and conditions of technical use. Size and character of the distribution of residual stresses were determined experimentally by use of the hole-drilling method.

Thin wall and low work hardening material are features of piping of JSFR. Detectability of coolant sodium is very high, the target leak detection performance of leak detector of JSFR is 100 g/hr. Internal pressure of JSFR piping is very low, and large through wall crack is allowable to satisfy LBB condition. The existing COD evaluation method {{cannot be applied to}} the piping of JSFR which has above-mentioned features. Finite element analysis (FEA) were performed to evaluate COD for thin wall and low work hardening material piping with a circumferential through wall crack.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} leak rate through cracks {{is crucial in}} applying the <b>leak</b> <b>before</b> <b>break</b> (LBB) concept to pipeline design in nuclear power plants. Because of its importance, several programs were developed based on the several proposed flow models, and used in nuclear power industries. As the flow models were developed for a homogeneous pipe material, however, some difficulties were encountered in estimating leak rates for bimaterial pipes. In this paper, a flow model is proposed to estimate leak rate in bimaterial pipes based on the modified Henry–Fauske flow model. In the new flow model, different crack morphology parameters can be considered in two parts of a flow path. In addition, based on the proposed flow model, a program was developed to estimate leak rate for a crack with linearly varying cross-sectional area. Using the program, leak rates were calculated for through-thickness cracks with constant or linearly varying cross-sectional areas in a bimaterial pipe. The leak rate results were then compared and discussed {{in comparison with the}} results for a homogeneous pipe. The effects of the crack morphology parameters and the variation in cross-sectional area on the leak rate were examined and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are used}} to store gases under high {{pressure}} onboard spacecraft. These are used {{for a variety of}} purposes such as propelling liquid fuel etc, Kevlar, glass, Carbon and other more recent fibers have all been in use to overwrap the vessels. COPVs usually have a thin metallic liner with the primary purpose of containing the gases and prevent any leakage. The liner is overwrapped with filament wound composite such as Kevlar, Carbon or Glass fiber. Although the liner is required to perform in the <b>leak</b> <b>before</b> <b>break</b> mode making the failure a relatively benign mode, the overwrap can fail catastrophically under sustained load due to stress rupture. It is this failure mode that is of major concern as the stored energy of such vessels is often great enough ta cause loss of crew and vehicle. The present paper addresses some of the reliability concerns associated specifically with Kevlar Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels. The primary focus of the paper is on how reliability of COPV's are established for the purpose of deciding in general their flight worthiness and continued use.

On the inner {{surface of the}} cylinders U-shaped notches of different depths were machined by electro discharge machining technique. The initial notch sizes were designed based on a two stage fatigue predictive model based on fracture mechanics to develop through wall cracks in the deepest notches after about 50, 000 hydraulic cycles together with crack propagation of the intermediate notches and crack initiation in the smallest. The cylinders were cycled between the nominal pressure of 2 MPa and the WP until <b>leak</b> <b>before</b> <b>break</b> (LBB).
