2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New York Times in September 2013, Kenneth Leedom, an {{assistant}} of Horowitz for five years before 1955, laid claim to having been in a closeted relationship with him as his lover, saying, [...] "We had a wonderful life together...He was a difficult man, to say the <b>least.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> an anger in him that was unbelievable. The number of meals I've had thrown on the floor or in my lap. He'd pick up the tablecloth and just pull it off the table, and all the food would go flying. He had tantrums, a lot. But then he was calm and sweet. Very sweet, very lovable. And he really adored me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, with it looking {{unlikely}} that Ben's body {{would be found}} in the cave, the McDaniels began considering the possibility that he had died not in a diving accident but as a result of foul play, and that the disappearance might have been staged to cover that up (or at the very <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been found dead by the dive shop staff, who feared the consequences of that discovery). They hired a Florida private investigator, Lynn-Marie Carter, who found that other people associated with Vortex Spring besides Kelly had criminal records. [...] "There is just as much reason to look above the water for Ben's body as there was to look below it in the cave," [...] she told the Commercial Appeal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first task}} for the attackers {{was to take the}} {{outlying}} redoubt of La Cachotte, which covered the approaches to Fort William. The trench was opened on 8 June; a major assault – consisting of seven battalions, accompanied by the Kings’ Musketeers – followed on 12 June. La Cachotte fell, and Vauban turned to seizing Fort William, which was personally defended by Coehoorn. The fort was well sited, just over the crest of the rise, obscuring the stronghold from the attackers until they were almost upon it, and masking its walls from artillery fire. French sappers approached from two directions, but the recent heavy rain had made the whole operation extremely difficult. In a dramatic gesture, Coehoorn ordered his own grave dug to symbolise his commitment to defend the position to the end, but although his grave was not needed, the Dutch engineer was wounded in the head by a shell that killed his valet. The final assault on Fort William came on 22 June; despite Coehoorn’s resolute defence, he and the 200 men who had garrisoned the fort, capitulated. Vauban greeted his rival the next day, consoling him that at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had, [...] " [...] … the honour of being attacked by the greatest king in the world." [...] To which Coehoorn replied that his real consolation was in {{the fact that he had}} forced his great rival to move his siege batteries seven times during the assault.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{been washed}} once,' said Mrs. King; 'but he's so queer; I hope <b>he</b> will <b>have</b> no fancies, and will behave himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not {{finished}} dressing yet, Master Clinton; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{not come out}} of his room. But I expect he is pretty near dressed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid he}} doesn't care {{for me in}} that way. At <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> said nothing. You {{understand}} that I am only telling you this because----" ...|$|R
60|$|Reggie {{grew more}} cheerful. At <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{an answer for}} that.|$|E
60|$|He {{may have}} drowsed; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a vision, {{very real and}} plain, a vision very {{different}} from any dream of Utopia.|$|E
60|$|He was dizzy with rage. For {{the first}} time in his life he had been trampled upon, and could not, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not, struck his assailant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly," [...] said Paula; [...] "at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had {{supper at}} St. Kenelm's Vicarage with Lady Flight, and luncheon at Carrara with Captain and Mrs. Henderson." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hal {{went off}} on another tack. [...] "Well, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> set me down by this time; and Papa will have me up to London for my outfit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Frances, {{adopting}} {{the manner of}} her brother, [...] "Harvey Birch is not without good feelings; at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the appearance of them at times." ...|$|R
60|$|WHEN {{she came}} out, the sandy whiskered gentleman {{was sitting on}} a log reading the newspaper--at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.|$|E
60|$|Wulf {{thought as}} he looked at the speaker that at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no second thought in his mind. It was a frank honest face, martial in its outline, but {{softened}} by a pleasant smile.|$|E
6000|$|He left her, and {{happiness}} {{went out of}} his life as at nightfall the daylight goes out of the day. Well, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his work to go to. But Beatrice, poor woman, what had she? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean his niece, I suppose," [...] {{answered}} Roswell, colouring. [...] "The deacon {{never had}} any child himself, I believe--at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> none living. Mary Pratt is his niece." ...|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty whilst acting as observer to offensive patrols. On four occasions, at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> shot down enemy scouts {{and has also}} had numerous indecisive combats, in all of which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> displayed the greatest gallantry.|$|R
6000|$|... "At <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{not tried}} to escape," [...] Quest remarked. [...] "French here brought news of him. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> {{been living with}} his niece very quietly, but without any {{particular}} attempt at concealment or any signs of wishing to leave the city." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll send him, but {{to chase}} him off is an ill turn. At <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{the sense to}} fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One did not say, {{acquiring}} merit.' ...|$|E
60|$|Satisfied or not, he {{had time}} to get very angry with her again before the sermon was over. She had never once looked his way; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been so lucky as to {{encounter}} a glance.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} {{at him through}} the darkness, yet he could see that one thing at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> achieved. Her bosom was rising and falling quickly, her voice shook as she {{answered}} him. For {{the first time he had}} penetrated that intolerable reserve.|$|E
6000|$|... "The good God {{seems to}} think so," [...] {{returned}} the priest, seriously. [...] "At <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> put the gold in the rocks so that you cannot get it out. What would you give the devil to help you?" [...] he asked, with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "At <b>least</b> <b>he</b> might <b>have</b> said if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{heard from}} Uncle Barnaby," [...] grumbled Paul. [...] "More particularly, {{as we were}} just dying to know." ...|$|R
60|$|Better {{would it}} have been for him, perhaps, could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> kept his courage; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> been spared much added shame and misery.|$|R
60|$|Next morning, as I went to {{the early}} fishing, Chigwooltz, the patient, sat by the same stone, his fore feet {{at the edge of}} the same bronze lily leaf. At noon he was still there; in twenty-four hours at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not moved a muscle.|$|E
60|$|Now Morella's {{advocate}} rose to cross-examine, {{asking him}} {{who had made}} the arrangements for the marriage. He answered that the marquis had never spoken to him directly on the subject--at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never mentioned to him the name of the lady; the Señora Inez arranged everything.|$|E
60|$|Cordemais was {{the name}} of the {{original}} Scaramouche, who had so unfortunately twisted his ankle. That Binet should refer to him by his secular designation was a sign that in the Binet company at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fallen for ever from the lofty eminence of Scaramouche.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, he {{received}} a MacArthur Fellowship and, since the early 1990s at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been frequently cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. American literary critic Harold Bloom named {{him as one of}} the four major American novelists of his time, along with Don DeLillo, Philip Roth, and Cormac McCarthy.|$|R
50|$|Since at <b>least</b> 2014, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{been working}} for Hillary Clinton´s 2016 presidential {{campaign}} in Iowa.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015 British lawmaker John McDonnell said, [...] "The case of Shaker Aamer {{is one of}} {{the worst}} cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in the last three decades at <b>least</b> ... <b>He</b> <b>has</b> endured harsh, and brutal and inhuman treatment," [...] in a debate in which members of all major political parties called for Aamer's release.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{should think}} she was not," [...] said the girl, gravely. She looked hurt, {{as if she had}} been unfairly forced to the logic of her postulate, and Hewson was not {{altogether}} pleased with himself; but at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had his revenge in making her realize the man's vacuity.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Bakery's closed, y'reince!" [...] the Chancellor said, more {{loudly and}} clearly {{than he had}} spoken yet. He was emboldened by the {{consciousness}} that here, at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> evidence to produce: and he placed in the Warden's hands a few printed notices, that were lying ready, with some open ledgers, on a side-table.|$|E
60|$|A wave of morbid introspection {{swept over}} her soul. She {{realised}} {{in a moment}} how petty and base had been her thoughts and how purposeless her actions. She would have given her life at this moment to eradicate from Déroulède's mind the knowledge of her own jealousy; she hoped that at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not guessed her love.|$|E
6000|$|... "So he swears," [...] she {{answered}} slowly; [...] "and {{as for the}} reason, why, I suppose you must seek it in my face, which by ill-fortune has pleased his lordship since first he saw it a month ago. At the <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> asked me in marriage of my father, who jumped at him like a winter pike, and so I'm betrothed." ...|$|R
50|$|By 1901 {{and until}} at <b>least</b> 1926 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> offices first at 22 and later at 28 Park Row, Nottingham.|$|R
50|$|Since at <b>least</b> 2011, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} to record and release new music from his current hometown of Los Angeles.|$|R
