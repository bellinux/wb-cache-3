25|$|The Normans {{also were}} {{fortunate}} to have leaders of the calibre of the Butler, Marshall, de Lyvet (Levett), de Burgh, de Lacy and de Braose families, as well as having the dynamic heads of the first families. Another factor was that after the loss of Normandy in 1204, John had a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to devote to Irish affairs, and did so effectively even from afar.|$|E

500|$|Soundgarden {{began working}} on its fourth album after touring in support of Badmotorfinger. Cornell said that while working on the album, the band allowed each other more freedom than on past records, and Thayil {{observed}} that the band spent a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> working on the recording of the songs than on previous records. Released on March 8, 1994, Superunknown became the band's breakthrough album, driven by the singles [...] "Spoonman", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live", [...] "Black Hole Sun", [...] "My Wave", and [...] "Fell on Black Days"; Superunknown debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart.|$|E

Songs of the GI Resistance vinyl album of 1970), Barbara Dane said, [...] "I was too stubborn to hire one of the greed-head managers, probably because I'm a woman who likes to speak for herself. I always made my own deals and contracts, and after figuring out the economics of it, I was free to choose when and where I worked, able to spend <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> with my three children and doing political work, and even brought home more money in the end, by not going for the [...] "bigtime." [...] I did make some really nice records, because I was able to choose and work with wonderfully gifted musicians." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot {{scored the}} game a 7 out of 10 and said: [...] "As much as I enjoyed my online time with Killzone: Shadow Fall--and {{as much as}} I will enjoy <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> with it, {{unlocking}} perks that allow me to personalize my weapons--I missed Killzone 3s jump pack, which brought a nifty nimbleness to the battlegrounds. I missed it in Shadow Falls disappointing single-player campaign, too, which sorely needed a shot of adrenaline. Where I look back fondly on Killzone 2s finest single-player moments, the moments I recall here are those in which I wandered through corridors and rocky meadows wondering where the bad guys were. Luckily, Guerrilla Games remembered what drew me and many others {{to the front lines}} of online war, and it's here that Shadow Fall emerges from the rubble and flies into the electric skies." ...|$|R
500|$|Soundgarden {{began work}} on the album about two months after {{finishing}} its stint on the 1992 Lollapalooza tour. The individual band members would work on material {{on their own and}} then bring in demos to which {{the other members of the}} band would contribute. Frontman Chris Cornell said that the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records. Thayil observed that even though the band spent as much time writing and arranging as it had on previous albums, it spent a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> working on recording the songs. [...] After two albums with producer Terry Date, the band decided to seek another collaborator, as guitarist Kim Thayil said, [...] "We just thought we'd go for a change." [...] Eventually they settled on producer Michael Beinhorn, who [...] "didn't have his own trademark sound which he was trying to tack on to Soundgarden" [...] and had ideas the band approved.|$|E
500|$|The band {{first began}} writing songs at their {{rehearsal}} space in their hometown of Minneapolis, which they nicknamed the [...] "Dungeon", {{due to its}} ability to [...] "suck the life and energy out of the band." [...] For Pierre, the album came at {{the brink of a}} transitional period for him, in which he began to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. He left the band during the writing stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Afterwards, the band rejoined Pierre in Los Angeles to begin recording demos for a month; the change of scenery brought about new energy for the group, according to Pierre. Commit This to Memory would be the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. In addition, the band had more time and funds to spend time working on the album. [...] "It was also the first time we had a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> and money to go in and feel like we were making a real record this time, whereas I Am the Movie was recorded in little segments here and there and eventually pieced together," [...] said drummer Tony Thaxton.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time,</b> I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

50|$|After making {{just eight}} league {{appearances}} {{in the first half}} of the 13/14 Serie A season, all of them as a substitute, Belfodil joined fellow Serie A club Livorno on loan for the remainder of the 2013-14 season on 31 January 2014.

2500|$|In March 2012 Gooch {{took the}} {{full-time}} role as England Batting coach which {{came in the}} wake of the disappointing three-match Test series against Pakistan, in which England were beaten 3–0, largely down to the failure of their batsmen.

2500|$|All {{the riders}} had flown from Lorient to Bordeaux {{on the evening}} of July 9 and now spent their rest day in Bordeaux or some place nearby. Important news on this day came from Floyd Landis, as he {{announced}} that he seriously injured his hip, during training in 2003, which still hinders him while riding due to a bad position on the bike and also causes sleeping problems. He has decided to undergo surgery to receive an artificial hip after the Tour which would hopefully relieve him of these problems. However this also means that it is very well possible that he {{will never be able to}} ride at a professional level again. As a conclusion he mentions this is an extra motivation for him to try to win this Tour. Floyd's teammate Axel Merckx on this day signed a new contract with [...] for one extra season. Merckx, who is now 33 years old, announced that the 2007 season will be his last season, as he wants to spend a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> with his family thereafter. The Phonak team will be called iShares next season.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic site {{rated the}} album 3 stars stating [...] "There doesn't {{seem to be}} as much thought put into the sequel; though a number of moments are every bit as good as the {{material}} found on the first album, there's also a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> meandering this <b>time</b> around, and some real puzzlers".|$|R
5000|$|Rodgers {{described}} Bowie's attitude {{during the}} recording of this album as [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> relaxed this <b>time</b> than {{he was at the}} Let's Dance sessions, a hell of a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> philosophical and just in a state of mind where his music was really, really making him happy." [...] Overall Rodgers said the album took [...] "one year, more or less" [...] to record, a long time compared to Let's Dances three weeks.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|R
50|$|Character point-based systems, such as Hero System, allow {{complete}} {{freedom of}} concept. The downside is that, in many cases, character creation {{is much more}} complex, making the GM spend a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> examining and approving each character concept.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, {{he earned}} a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> game <b>time</b> and had nailed down the {{starting}} halfback spot for the Blues {{by the end of}} the season, dislodging the far more experienced Weepu. However, all the momentum he'd built up through 2014 was lost when a broken foot picked up playing club rugby forced him to miss the entire 2015 campaign, but, fully fit in 2016, new head-coach Tana Umaga made him the franchise's first choice number 9 once more and he went on to play in all 15 of their matches during a slightly disappointing season which ended with them in 11th place in the overall standings.|$|R
50|$|Tapp {{was drafted}} by the Seattle Seahawks {{in the second round}} (63rd overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. As a rookie, Tapp was a special teamer and part of the Seahawks' {{defensive}} end rotation. He recorded 33 tackles, three sacks, one forced fumble, one interception, and one defensive touchdown. In 2007, he saw a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> playing <b>time,</b> as the Seahawks' former starting left end Grant Wistrom was cut from the team, and the right end Bryce Fisher was traded to the Titans. As a result, he started all 16 games for the Seahawks with new arrival Patrick Kerney as the other defensive end. In 2007, Tapp made 49 tackles, seven sacks, and one interception.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{learned the}} new {{material}} and recorded the album within a two-week period, leaving {{little time to}} rehearse the songs. In addition to the time constraint, they had lost the rehearsal space they had shared with Black Flag, and until {{the first day of}} recording were unable to practice with all of their equipment plugged in. As a result, the songs had much more of a pop sound on the album than they did when the band performed them live. [...] "We could've put a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> practice <b>time</b> into it," [...] said Aukerman during the album's supporting tours, [...] "but I think that the songs themselves are just really good songs. We play them all better now." ...|$|R
