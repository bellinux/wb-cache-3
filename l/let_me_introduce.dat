40|$|Jiangnan, meaning “South of the River,” {{refers to}} the Yangtze Delta region in East China. For the last millennium, this region {{has been at the}} heart of the most dynamic and {{sophisticated}} area of the country. The mere mention of Jiangnan evokes lyrical images of a Chinese water town, with white houses and willows growing along riverbanks, where poets wandered and romantic encounters took place. This photo essay documents the contemporary urban and human landscape of my hometown, Shengze, once a quintessential and prosperous water town of Jiangnan. In doing so, I hope to show what has become of Jiangnan—its space and its people—at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Before you plunge into the images, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>introduce</b> the history of Shengze—a history that resonates well beyond the confines of this small town...|$|R

40|$|If {{one thinks}} about {{accessing}} and reusing qualitative data {{with an international}} and interdisciplinary perspective, this topic also contains organisational and networking tasks beyond the field of qualitative archiving in the narrow sense—some of them necessarily relying on the Internet and its tools. I {{had the chance to}} gain experiences within international networking while editing the online journal FQS and I would like to summarise some aspects, hopefully helpful also for the planned networking of qualitative archives within INQUADA. So <b>let</b> <b>me</b> first shortly <b>introduce</b> FQS—its origin and its current state—, and afterwards I will stress some opportunities and also some challenges, FQS and similar networking projects confront.

40|$|Frances Brill, who {{completed}} her MSc in Sociology in 2014, reflects {{on what she}} learned during that year. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> beginning by <b>introducing</b> my background and myself. I graduated from an undergraduate course trained in classical economics, law and normative urban planning processes. I spent {{the final year of}} my undergrad writing a dissertation on the intersection of class and gender and I was desperate to study Sociology. All of my friends are brilliant people who have worked very hard to get their degrees and their corporate jobs but as I was awarded my degree, I was unaware of how little I questioned the texts we read or the privilege I was surrounded by. A year in the Sociology department has changed me, it’s an ongoing process and I am not going to pretend I can fully comprehend my own privilege (or classical Sociology’s writing styles) but I am making progress...|$|R

40|$|Niklas Luhmann is {{probably}} the most important living German theoretician in sociology, i and there is good reason for science studies to pay attention to a specific study from his hand which focusses on science (see also: Krohn et al. 1990). However, since Luhmann's general thesis is macro-sociological (Luhmann 1984), the sociology of science is only {{one of a number of}} special sociologies. Therefore the frame of reference is different from that of most other studies in our specialty. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>introduce</b> the general framework, and then return to the study of the sciences from this perspective. The author summarizes his sociological systems theory in the first hundred pages (two chapters) of the present study. The essential point is that society is constituted not of human beings, but of communications. Of course, communications are generated by human beings and have to be understood by human beings, but society is the network which is added to the actors as the nodes. The network differs in nature and in operation from the individual systems: individual "consciousness systems " process thoughts on the basis of perceptions; society processes communications. The two systems are structurally coupled, i. e., they presuppose each other, but the one is not an aggregate of the other. In addition to the four billion or s...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{the role of women in}} the works of Jan Rokycana. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>introduce</b> briefly his life. There is not much {{information}} about his youth left, but there are quite a few documented reports related to his life after the year 1415 when he became a Bachelor of Arts. While studying at University in Prague, he met Magister Jakoubek of Stříbro, after whose death he took over the leadership of the moderate fraction of Hussites. The 1430 s affected significantly Rokycana's life. At their beginning, he became a Magister of Arts, then at the Council of Basil he argued for an article on necessity of Holy Communion of both kinds for laymen, later those years he was elected as the Archbishop of Prague, and at end of 1430 s, he left active church and political life and took shelter in Hradec Králové. His stay in Eastern Bohemia is related to Hync Ptáček of Pirkštejn and to Jiří of Poděbrady, thanks to whom he was restaured to the position of the Archbishop of Prague and of the spiritual leader of all Hussites. The main tasks of Rokycana's life were defending the Communion of both kinds for lay people and establishment of the organized Hussite Church, which would co-exist with the general church. That one, however, was his chief rival in completing his tasks, as it never acknowledged Rokycana as the [...] ...|$|R
