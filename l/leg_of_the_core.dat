40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} has an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} research community and among the politicians. Therefore {{it is important to}} find the right solutions to meet the environmental and commercial requirements to give offshore wind power a promising future. This thesis are proposing a new converter topology for offshore wind parks. Since the topology is based on DC transmission in stead of AC transmission it is better suited for use in this type of parks. All the converters are located in the wind turbines and the turbines are connected in series directly connected to shore without any transformation stages. The one-phase AC to three-phase AC converter with the new switching pattern is explained and a method to calculate the losses in the converter is given. The loss calculation method is based on the characteristics of the switch found in the data sheet, which in this case is a RB-IGBT. The conduction losses, turn-on, turn-off and recovery losses for one switch are calculated and multiplied with the number of switches in the converter. An equation of the total losses per switch is given and there are performed loss simulations for the converter in PSCAD with good results. In the AC-AC converter there are bidirectional switches, in this case two reverse-blocking IGBTs. The RB-IGBT is compared to other types of bidirectional switches which is made of IGBTs and diodes in anti parallel. The comparison shows that with the RB-IGBTs the on-state voltage drop is halved since a RB-IGBT has the same on-state voltage drop as a normal IGBT. This also reduces the on-state losses. The architecture of the RB-IGBT is almost the same as the IGBT but with an extension of the p+ layer on the edges up to the gate isolation. This separates the sides from the active region of the chip so the leakage currents from the side surfaces of the device are blocked. A design of a high power high frequency transformer for the converter topology in the nacelle of the wind turbine is proposed. A design method is used and a program to calculate the necessary values is made. The transformer should be a double E-core with a centre leg of 4. 5 cm made of the ferrite material N 27. Both primary and secondary windings, which will be copper foils, should be wound on the centre <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> using a bobbin. The primary windings will be separated in two sections each section having 12 layers with two turns per layer. The secondary windings will be sandwiched between the primary sections and will consist of 24 layers with two turns per layers. Each foil conductor has a height of 4. 5 cm and a thickness of 0. 3165 mm. The new converter topology reduces the converter losses due to fewer converter stages, a new type of reverse-blocking IGBT and a new switching pattern. It also reduces the weight of the converter system because of no capacitors and a lighter transformer. This is important for floating wind turbines. A prototype of the converter topology with protection should be made to verify the results of this thesis. Simulation studies for the whole park during operation and faults should also be carried out to see if the topology fits the harsh conditions offshore. </p...|$|E

40|$|A two-inductor boost {{converter}} topology has conduction loss and transformer utilization advantages in converting low-voltage higher current inputs to high output voltages. In this letter, a new zero-voltage switching (ZVS) two-inductor {{boost converter}} with integrated magnetics is proposed. In the new topology, the two current source inductors, a resonant inductor and a two-winding transformer, are integrated into one single magnetic core with three windings. Two windings simultaneously perform <b>the</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current source inductors and the transformer primary. The transformer leakage inductance forms the resonant inductance. This {{leads to a}} much more compact converter design with {{a significant reduction in}} <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>core</b> and winding components.

40|$|Nearly {{half of all}} H-alpha macrospicules in polar coronal holes {{appear to}} be {{miniature}} filament eruptions. This {{suggests that there is}} a large class of X-ray jets in which the jet-base magnetic arcade undergoes a blowout eruption as in a CME, instead of remaining static as in most solar X-ray jets, the standard jets that fit the model advocated by Shibata. Along with a cartoon depicting the standard model, we present a cartoon depicting <b>the</b> signatures expected <b>of</b> blowout jets in coronal X-ray images. From Hinode/XRT movies and STEREO/EUVI snapshots in polar coronal holes, we present examples of (1) X-ray jets that fit the standard model, and (2) X-ray jets that do not fit the standard model but do have features appropriate for blowout jets. These features are (1) a flare arcade inside the jet-base arcade in addition to the small flare arcade (bright point) outside that standard jets have, (2) a filament of cool (T is approximately 80, 000 K) plasma that erupts from <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jetbase arcade, and (3) an extra jet strand that should not be made by the reconnection for standard jets but could be made by reconnection between the ambient unipolar open field and <b>the</b> opposite-polarity <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filament-carrying flux-rope <b>core</b> field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erupting jet-base arcade.

40|$|Debris {{generated}} during <b>the</b> blowdown phase <b>of</b> a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) is a {{big concern}} in <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Light Water Reactors under such accident scenarios. Debris transported by the water flow through the reactor containment floor may reach the sump strainers. During the long-term cooling phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> debris in <b>the</b> sump screens could impact <b>the</b> Emergency <b>Core</b> Cooling System (ECCS) performance. Small size debris could also pass through the debris bed and sump strainers and be injected in the primary system, reducing <b>the</b> <b>core</b> cooling capabilities (downstream effects). A typical Westinghouse 4 -loop Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) was modeled using RELAP 5 - 3 D to simulate the reactor system response during <b>the</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, under different LOCA scenarios. To account for the multi-dimensional flow behavior, <b>the</b> main regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor vessel were simulated using multi-dimensional components. The present work provides <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulations performed for a LOCA in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main break locations of interest, such as the cold and the hot <b>leg.</b> <b>The</b> main objectives <b>of</b> these calculations are: • To validate a new RELAP 5 - 3 D nodalization, used to model the reference nuclear power plant, in which have been entered multi-dimensional components that provide a better estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow path inside the reactor vessel and through <b>the</b> <b>core</b> during long-term cooling when strong asymmetries are expected due to the different possible break-injection location combinations. • To study <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant during selected accident scenarios and to provide important information and boundary conditions for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> other project models, such as the break jet boundary conditions and reactor containment calculations. • To analyze <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor system during a hypothetical core blockage, due to <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> small sizes debris at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> inlet that could preclude <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> water flow into <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> <b>The</b> simulations were repeated for three different break sizes (2 and 6 inch, and Double-Ended Guillotine) as representative cases for small, medium and large break respectively, to provide a complete spectrum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system behavior. Moreover, since <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calculation {{was to provide a}} best estimate evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system behavior, all <b>the</b> safety features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor were assumed to be available during the transient and the boundary conditions defined in the input deck (including initial operating conditions, scram, injection and other setup points, ECCS flow rates, auxiliary injection rate and temperature, etc.) were assumed to be realistic. Basic thermal-hydraulic parameters such as primary pressure, break and SI flow rates, core coolant temperatures and maximum cladding temperature were selected to monitor the system behavior during the transient. The liquid inventory in the steam generators tubes, the refilling time and, subsequently the potential circulating flow through the cooling loops were found {{to play an important role}} during <b>the</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. The results obtained also showed important features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coolant flow paths inside the reactor vessel during the long term cooling phase, when different safety injection configurations (cold and/or hot leg injection) are possible. For a specific break size, the HL break cases showed a higher flow rate through <b>the</b> <b>core</b> since <b>the</b> flow is forced by the SI trains to pass through <b>the</b> <b>core</b> from <b>the</b> injecting cold legs to reach <b>the</b> break. <b>The</b> <b>core</b> mass flow rate for the CL break scenarios was observed to be limited since most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injected flow left the vessel through the broken cold leg from <b>the</b> upper section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downcomer. A decrease in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> flow rate was usually predicted at the HL injection switchover, as a result of a different injection path. As a consequence, an increase in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> coolant and peak cladding temperatures is expected during <b>the</b> early stage <b>of</b> this phase. Such features should be considered when studying <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debris transport and deposition inside the reactor vessel during the long-term cooling phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, when water from the containment sump is pumped by the safety injection system into the primary system. Assuming an excessive accumulation <b>of</b> debris at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> inlet, a full blockage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> and core bypass was imposed at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-term cooling phase. Under such conservative conditions, scenarios that did not lead to potential core damage were identified. The peak cladding temperature was selected as representative thermal-hydraulic parameter to define whether possible core damage was achieved. For all the break sizes analyzed, hot leg break scenarios were found not to lead to core damage due to the alternative coolant flow path through the steam generators (from the cold leg injection site to the SG U-tubes and to the hot <b>leg</b> and top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>core)</b> which guarantees <b>the</b> decay heat removal under core blockage. For medium and large break size, cold leg break was found to lead potential core damage due to <b>the</b> unavailability <b>of</b> alternative flow paths to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> at <b>the</b> time or immediately after <b>the</b> <b>core</b> blockage. It has to be marked that <b>the</b> <b>core</b> damage, when achieved during the simulations, was found to occur within a short period <b>of</b> time from <b>the</b> sump switchover time (approximately 1000 s), while the HL injection switchover occurring much later in the transient. To take into account also <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross flows existing inside <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> a new nodalization was developed replacing the two pipe components which constituted <b>the</b> <b>core</b> (<b>the</b> average and hot channel) with four multi-dimensional components with which the fuel assemblies were individually simulated. First, preliminary simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blowdown and long-term cooling phases were performed with the same boundary conditions used in the previous simulations to validate the new nodalization. Analyzing <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 D <b>core</b> model for small, medium and large break LOCA, in both cold and hot leg, the results obtained with <b>the</b> 1 D <b>core</b> model described above were confirmed. After, additional simulations were performed assuming again <b>the</b> total blockage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> and <b>core</b> bypass at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-term cooling, focusing on those scenarios that lead potential core damage and particularly on the 6 -inch cold leg break. Also this case showed what was previously found: the peak cladding temperature steadily increases reaching the maximum limit, confirming that <b>the</b> full <b>core</b> and core bypass blockage assumption may lead to core damage...|$|R
