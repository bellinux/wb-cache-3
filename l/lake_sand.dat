The lake is a shallow, wide section of the Athabasca River. This has been the site of many CN {{publicity}} photographs—including of the Super Continental—through the years, and it is still popular with photographers, railfans, the present-day Canadian and its advertisers and passengers. The Jasper <b>Lake</b> <b>Sand</b> Dunes are on the northwest shore of Jasper Lake and {{can be seen from the}} train. They are the only sand dunes eco-system in the Canadian Rockies. Parts of the mainline have been built on causeways away from the shore, which have created several mini lakes. This adds to the effect of being out on the water, creating additional views of the lake, its waters and the forests and mountains surrounding it. The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, many of which can be seen the train from various places along the lake. They include: ...|$|E

There are only a few occurrences of sandy beach around the lake shoreline due largely to runoff water erosion carrying sand from creeks from the surrounding elevated rocky terrain.
