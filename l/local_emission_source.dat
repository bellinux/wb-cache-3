40|$|A major {{challenge}} in traffic-related air pollution exposure studies {{is the lack}} of information regarding pollutant exposure characterization. Air quality modeling can provide spatially and temporally varying exposure estimates for examining relationships between traffic-related air pollutants and adverse health outcomes. A hybrid air quality modeling approach was used to estimate exposure to traffic-related air pollutants in support of the Near-Road Exposures and Effects of Urban Air Pollutants Study (NEXUS) conducted in Detroit (Michigan, USA). Model-based exposure metrics, associated with local variations of emissions and meteorology, were estimated using a combination of the American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) and Research LINE-source dispersion model for near-surface releases (RLINE) dispersion models, <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> information from the National Emissions Inventory, detailed road network locations and traffic activity, and meteorological data from the Detroit City Airport. The regional background contribution was estimated using a combination of the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) and the Space-Time Ordinary Kriging (STOK) models. To capture the near-road pollutant gradients, refined “mini-grids” of model receptors were placed around participant homes. Exposure metrics for CO, NOx, PM 2. 5 and its components (elemental and organic carbon) were predicted at each home location for multiple time periods including daily and rush hours. The exposure metrics were evaluated for their ability to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of multiple ambient air pollutants compared to measurements across the study area...|$|E

PM 1 filters (N= 90) were sampled from 2010 to 2012 in busy {{streets in the}} urban centre of Madrid and Barcelona (Spain) at ground-level and at roof sites. In both urban areas, biomass burning was {{not expected to be}} an important <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>source,</b> but regional emissions from wildfires, residential heating or biomass removal may influence the air quality in the cities. Although both areas are under influence of high solar radiation, Madrid is situated in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, while Barcelona is located at the Mediterranean Coast and under influence of marine atmospheres. Two extraction methods were applied, i. e. Soxhlet and ASE, which showed equivalent results after GC-MS analyses. The ambient air concentrations of the organic tracers for biomass burning increased by an order of magnitude at both sites during winter compared to summer. An exception was observed during a PM event in summer 2012, when the atmosphere in Barcelona was directly affected by regional wildfire smoke and levels were four times higher as those observed in winter. Overall, there was little variation between the street and roof sites in both cities, suggesting that regional biomass burning sources influence the urban areas after atmospheric transport. Despite the different atmospheric characteristics in terms of air relative humidity, Madrid and Barcelona exhibit very similar composition and concentrations of biomass burning organic tracers. Nevertheless, levoglucosan and its isomers seem to be more suitable for source apportionment purposes than dehydroabietic acid. In both urban areas, biomass burning contributions to PM were generally low (2 %) in summer, except on the day when wildfire smoke arrive to the urban area. In the colder periods the contribution increase to around 30 %, indicating that regional biomass burning has a substantial influence on the urban air quality. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAmbient {{measurements}} of elemental species concentrations were made using an online elemental monitor at an air pollution monitoring station in Gwangju, Korea {{to evaluate the}} performance of the monitor for near–real time PM 2. 5 elemental monitoring and identify possible sources of the observed elements. This study also demonstrates the utility of integrating hourly elemental data with the meteorological data to better understand the sources of elements. Good agreement between the online and filter–based measurements was obtained for the elements studied, with an R 2 of 0. 73 – 0. 97 and regression slopes of 0. 84 – 2. 37, suggesting the potential use of the online monitor to observe temporal variations in anthropogenic aerosol particles. Atmospheric element concentration levels studied were 2 – 20 times greater than their background levels when pollution plumes coming from industrial areas had impacted the site. Examination of the elements data revealed several short spikes of elements that are associated with local industrial emissions and road dusts. For the haze episodes observed over the study period, the element K was significantly influenced by biomass burning emissions with some impacts from soil dusts and industrial activities. Based on the wind direction and wind speed data, As/Se, Se/SO 42 −, and correlations among Se, As, Pb, SO 2, and SO 42 −, it is suggested that the observed As and Se were significantly impacted by local anthropogenic sources and long–range transport of aerosols, rather than local coal combustion or coke emissions. Conditional probability functions were applied to identify likely <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> locations of the elements observed at the site, indicating that the elements contributions were from the southwest and northeast directions, where two industrial areas and an express highway are located. Results from principal component analysis indicate that the observed concentrations of the element species were likely attributed to road dust/local industrial emissions, oil combustion, and metal processing...|$|E

The PM 10 {{samples were collected}} during the winter time study. The highest concentrations of carbonaceous species were observed in Skawina (36. 9 μg·m- 3 of OC and 9. 6 μg·m- 3 of EC). The lowest OC and EC concentrations were reported in Krakow (15. 2 μg·m- 3 and 3. 9 μg·m- 3, respectively. The highest concentration of carbonaceous species and the highest wind velocities in Skawina influenced the highest values of the dry deposition fluxes. Correlations between OC, EC and chemical constituents and meteorological parameters suggest that a) Krakow was influenced by <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and temperature inversion occurrence; b) Bialka was {{under the influence of}} <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and long-range transport of particles; c) Skawina was impacted by <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R

The WSOC fraction in OC also shows a clear spatial variation. The Saraikela Kharsawan site has the lowest WSOC fraction, whereas the industrial site Adityapur has the highest WSOC fraction in any a given season. This {{may be explained by}} the relative contribution of primary and secondary organic aerosols. At the Adityapur, the aerosol loadings are heavily influenced by the industrial, <b>local</b> vehicular <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and other primary <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> (e.g. cooking fumes).

40|$|Industrial {{development}} in China has accelerated {{rapidly in the}} last few decades. This has led to a range of environmental problems. Deposition of trace metals to forest ecosystems via the atmosphere is a potential regional concern. In this study, levels of trace metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Mn, Pb, Sn, V and Zn) have been measured in the soil samples from A and B horizons in acid-sensitive forest soils at 3 different sites in China. Two of these sites, Tie Shan Ping (TSP) and Liu Chong Guan (LCG), are located close to the large cosmopolitan city of Chongqing and the less developed city of Guiyang, respectively. The third site, Lei Gong Shan (LGS), is situated in a remote region of Guizhou province with no large <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>source.</b> Total Hg concentrations have been determined using a Direct Mercury Analyzer. For the other trace metals, total content of each element has been determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry after microwave digestion. With a few exceptions, the metal concentrations can be characterized as moderate. Compared with the soil environmental background values and Chinese Class I standards, Cd, Pb, Hg, and to some extent As, show higher concentrations in the upper horizon; Cd, Pb and Hg with median values 0. 25, 47 and 0. 28 mg kg- 1; 0. 17, 30 and 0. 39 mg kg- 1; and 0. 42, 28 and 0. 37 mg kg- 1 at TSP, LCG and LGS respectively, and As with median concentrations 14 and 16 mg kg- 1 at TSP and LGS respectively. Average metal concentrations in this study are generally similar to results available from studies in China and Europe. Significantly higher concentration of Cd (0. 59 mg kg- 1) in a previous study in the same area may be due to poor accuracy of the semi-quantitative analytical method used in the previous study. Metal concentrations are rather similar among the studied sites. High contents of Cd and Pb at TSP and Pb and V (in a couple of samples) at LCG may be related to proximity to the big cities Chongqing and Guiyang and large emission sources. At the remote site (LGS), metal levels are fairly similar or even higher than at the other sites; this can be mostly associated with higher metal content in the minerals (shale). In addition, there may be some contributions from long-range transport of trace metals and high deposition flux due to high precipitation at this site. Evaluation of variations among and within the macroplots (10 m x 10 m area) generally shows the lowest variations for As and Cd with RSD% 25 %. Investigation of the behavior of metals in the soil profile and association with soil characteristics using statistical approaches (Principal Component Analysis and t-test) indicates accumulation of Hg, Pb and Cd at TSP and Hg at LCG in the A horizons. Accumulation of metals in the upper horizon can be related to high atmospheric deposition due to proximity to urban areas. Since Pb and Hg are strongly complexed to organic matter, their accumulation might be associated with higher organic content of A horizons. However, the PCA shows only a weak correlation between Hg and Pb and soil organic content. This could be affected by the significantly different depositions of these metals among the studied sites which are not considered in the PCA. Accumulation of Co, Mn and Ni in the B horizon is found at TSP and {{may be the result of}} mobilization at low pH-values in the A horizon. At the remote site (LGS), most of the investigated metals (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn) show higher concentrations in the A horizon than in the B horizon. Except for Cd, the differences are rather small. Increased mobilization of Cd due to acidification in combination with high Cd levels in the studied area can be a potential concern as mobilization of Cd may lead to ecotoxicological impacts...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols, in {{particular}} {{those related to}} anthropogenic activities, including black carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate aerosols, {{have been found to}} affect the Asian monsoon through direct and indirect aerosol radiative forcing. In this work, we use the coupled regional Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to understand how aerosol changes from <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> could modulate the Asian monsoon precipitation through aerosol direct and indirect radiative effects. Our modeling results with the consideration of the <b>local</b> <b>emissions</b> show an improvement in simulated monsoon precipitation, when compared to reanalysis data and satellite observations. Aerosols generally induce a reduction in pre-monsoon and monsoon precipitation in East Asia. Over the Indian region, <b>local</b> anthropogenic <b>emissions</b> tend to reduce precipitation in the source regions while slightly increasing precipitation outside of the <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> regions. The increase in precipitation corresponds to a decrease in the cloud base level or lifting condensation level. Analysis of vertical cloud properties suggests that the increased cloud droplet number and prolonged cloud lifetime/reduced precipitation efficiency due to the <b>local</b> aerosol <b>emissions</b> are responsible for the precipitation reduction over East Asia. Aerosols from <b>local</b> <b>emissions</b> also play a very important role in the simulated surface temperature, radiation, and monsoon circulations...|$|R

30|$|Upslope flow on {{isolated}} mountains {{results from}} two primary mechanisms: mechanically forced lifting and buoyant upslope flow. Mechanically forced lifting {{is caused by}} the deflection of strong winds by a mountain slope. The importance of this mechanism differs among mountains and depends mainly on the height of the mountain and the mean speed of the wind. Buoyant upslope flow {{is caused by the}} daytime solar heating of air near the surface of the mountain. During the day, warmed air masses rise toward the summit. At night, flows down the mountain occur due to radiative cooling of the ground surface. Both the upslope and downslope flows are important for mountain meteorology and the transport of local pollution (e.g., Furger et al. 2000). In practice, however, determination of baseline concentrations is difficult because the nature and magnitude of such local influence depend on the mountain topography, local wind patterns, and the characteristics of <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources.</b>|$|R

It has been hypothesized that the intake of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients may ameliorate various respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollution through reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation.

30|$|The use of LDA {{enables a}} {{separation}} of moss sampling sites regarding their contribution to the correlation level in dependency on urban, agricultural and forestry land use around the sampling location. LDA and LR help explaining spatial patterns of ELCE-specific correlation levels by identifying most relevant land uses and radiuses around the sampling sites. A very valuable indicator for this was that moss sampling sites classified by LDA as A within ELCE B units defined by below element-specific average correlations show stronger correlations than the whole set of sampling sites within ELCE B units (Hg, As, Cr, Cu, Pb, V). Vice versa, category B sites from ELCE A units reveal lower correlations than the whole subsample from ELCE A units (As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni). This means that the ELCE-specific correlation levels are more strongly dependent on land use within the specified radii around the sampling sites and less on the spatial assignment to specific ELCE units, which per se have high or low correlations. For example: Each random subsample within regions showing low correlations between Hg concentrations in moss and respective atmospheric deposition is expected to reveal low correlations. If LDA selects a subsample indicating high correlations within regions showing low correlations, {{the importance of the}} predictors for Hg can be graded as high. Best LDA models with error rates[*]<[*] 40 % were found for As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and V. Similar error rates were found by means of LR, confirming the validity of LDA models, which are more graphic and less difficult to interpret. This supports our approach to use LDA in conjunction with a confirmation by LR, which is in any case recommended for multivariate statistics, especially since predictors are not normally distributed. Likewise, relevant factors for predicting potential correlation levels are element specific. While density of forestry land use might characterize a seclusion of sampling locations, urban and agricultural land use around the sampling sites might indicate pronounced influences of <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources.</b> For Cd, Cu, and Ni, small radiuses are relevant. For Cd and Cu, the relevance of agricultural land use within a small range of 0 – 5  km could be caused by fertilizers (Cd) and copper-containing pesticides [46]. For Cd and Ni, the relevance of urban land use within a radius of 5  km might be connected to <b>local</b> industrial <b>emission</b> <b>sources.</b> By contrast, large radiuses of 75 – 100  km are most relevant for As, Hg, Cr and V, which predominantly show the weakest statistical relations to modelled atmospheric deposition. At least for Hg, this could be a result of long residence times of Hg components in the atmosphere and correlated long-range transport [47, 48]. Regarding As and Cr, high density of forestry land use within a 100  km radius, which might indicate a low influence of <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> seems to be a crucial factor. Regarding As, Hg, Cr and V, this study indicates that the radius for examining the influence of different spatial land use density around the sampling sites could be even more enlarged (e.g. 150, 200 or 250  km) for a probably better consideration of the long-range transboundary air pollution.|$|R

40|$|The Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) {{region has}} been {{suffering}} from the most severe fine-particle (PM 2. [*] 5) pollution in China, which causes serious health damage and economic loss. Quantifying the source contributions to PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations has been a challenging task because of the complicated nonlinear relationships between PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations and emissions of multiple pollutants from multiple spatial regions and economic sectors. In this study, we use the extended response surface modeling (ERSM) technique to investigate the nonlinear response of PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations to emissions of multiple pollutants from different regions and sectors over the BTH region, based on over 1000 simulations by a chemical transport model (CTM). The ERSM-predicted PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations agree well with independent CTM simulations, with correlation coefficients larger than 0. 99 and mean normalized errors less than 1  %. Using the ERSM technique, we find that, among all air pollutants, primary inorganic PM 2. [*] 5 makes the largest contribution (24 – 36  %) to PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations. The contribution of primary inorganic PM 2. [*] 5 emissions is especially high in heavily polluted winter and {{is dominated by the}} industry as well as residential and commercial sectors, which should be prioritized in PM 2. [*] 5 control strategies. The total contributions of all precursors (nitrogen oxides, NO x; sulfur dioxides, SO 2; ammonia, NH 3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; intermediate-volatility organic compounds, IVOCs; primary organic aerosol, POA) to PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations range between 31 and 48  %. Among these precursors, PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations are primarily sensitive to the emissions of NH 3, NMVOC + IVOC, and POA. The sensitivities increase substantially for NH 3 and NO x and decrease slightly for POA and NMVOC + IVOC with the increase in the emission reduction ratio, which illustrates the nonlinear relationships between precursor emissions and PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations. The contributions of primary inorganic PM 2. [*] 5 emissions to PM 2. [*] 5 concentrations are dominated by <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> which account for over 75  % of the total primary inorganic PM 2. [*] 5 contributions. For precursors, however, emissions from other regions could play similar roles to <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> in the summer and over the northern part of BTH. The source contribution features for various types of heavy-pollution episodes are distinctly different from each other and from the monthly mean results, illustrating that control strategies should be differentiated based on the major contributing sources during different types of episodes...|$|R

This paper presents the results of fine (PM 2. 5) and coarse (PM 10 – 2. 5) particulate matter monitoring in Ulaanbaatar from 2004 to 2008 and receptor modelling to determine the sources contributing to particulate matter pollution. Ion Beam Analysis was used to determine elemental concentrations in the two size fractions and black carbon was measured with a light reflectance device. Mass contributions to ambient particle concentrations from <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> were estimated by positive matrix factorisation and air mass back–trajectory analysis was used to assess probable source locations. The results show that crustal matter sources are the primary contributors to the coarse particle fraction. Combustion sources (coal combustion, biomass burning, and motor vehicles) dominate the fine fraction of particulate matter in the Ulaanbaatar airshed, primarily from <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> but forest fires to the north can be a significant contributor to biomass burning concentrations at times. Analysis of seasonal differences showed that coal combustion processes were largely responsible for fine particle air pollution episodes during winter. Temporal trends show an increase in the coal combustion contributions over the monitoring period. We suggest that this is linked to the increase in the Ulaanbaatar population and a consequent increase in the use of coal for power generation and domestic heating purposes...|$|R

Results from air quality modeling at regional grid scale resolutions are optimized using country-level emission inventories at a minimum. Alternatively, pre-gridded inventories for regional applications are required at resolutions commensurate with the air quality modeling grid. Spatial, temporal, and chemical data describing the <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are also required to characterize the local air quality problems. This paper presents a case study of building a multi-pollutant emission database for the Middle East. The issues addressed include the development and preparation of the list of inventories for capturing the range of emissions sectors in the region, preparing spatial, temporal, and chemical information for representing the <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> patterns, and methods to evaluate the air quality-model ready emissions for {{a part of the world}} where comparable data are sparse. Particular challenges in this work included developing accurate emissions for a modeling domain that covers over 50 countries on three continents, integrating spotty localized inventories with global emissions datasets, and evaluating the accuracy of the model-ready emissions. This paper presents an emissions modeling framework for conducting multi-pollutant air quality modeling with CMAQ. The framework includes SMOKE version 2. 4 with a set of utilities for converting pre-gridded inventories of natural and anthropogenic emissions into vertically-resolved emissions for simulating ozone, PM 2. 5, SOA, air toxics, mercury, sea salt, and wind-blown dust...|$|R

The {{present study was}} carried out to characterize three aldehydes of most health concern (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein) in a central Beijing site {{in the summer and}} early fall of 2008 (from June to October). Measurements were made before, during, and after the Beijing Olympics to examine whether the air pollution control measures implemented to improve Beijing's air quality during the Olympics had any impact on concentrations of the three aldehydes. Average concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein were 29. 34 &plusmn; 15. 12 μg/m 3 , 27. 09 &plusmn; 15. 74 μg/m 3 and 2. 32 &plusmn; 0. 95 μg/m 3 , respectively, for the entire period of measurements, all being the highest among the levels measured in cities around the world in photochemical smog seasons. Among the three measured aldehydes, only acetaldehyde had a substantially reduced mean concentration during the Olympic air pollution control period compared to the pre-Olympic period. Formaldehyde and acrolein followed the changing pattern of temperature and were each significantly correlated with ozone (a secondary product of photochemical reactions). In contrast, acetaldehyde was significantly correlated with several pollutants emitted mainly from <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> (e. g., NO 2 , CO, and PM 2. 5 ).

Rains over the coastal zone had different concentrations of total mercury, they ranged from 8. 6 to 118. 0 ng L − 1, out of which about 32 % were labile, inorganic forms, easily reducible in a SnCl 2 solution. Over the southern Baltic two maxima of concentrations were observed: first, in the heating season and second, in the non-heating season. Elevated concentrations of mercury in precipitations during heating seasons {{were the result of}} the activity of <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> (intensive combustion of fossil fuels in domestic furnaces and individual power and heat generating plants). During the warm season, precipitation over the southern Baltic could clean the air from Hg reemitted from sea and land surfaces. Precipitations, which purified marine and continental air masses were responsible for the comparable input of mercury to the coastal zone. The wet deposition value in 2008 was estimated to be 28. 9 μg m − 2. In the coastal zone of the southern Baltic, acid precipitations with the elevated Hg concentrations are very frequent...|$|R
40|$|The {{mixing layer}} height (MLH) {{is a crucial}} {{parameter}} in order to investigate the near surface concentrations of air pollutants. The MLH can be estimated by measurements of some atmospheric variables, by indirect estimates based on trace gases concentration or aerosol, or by numerical models. Here, a modelling approach is proposed. The developed modelling system {{is based on the}} models WRF-ARW and CALMET. This system is applied on Firenze-Prato-Pistoia area (Central Italy), during 2010, and it is compared with in situ measurements. The aim of this work is to evaluate the use of MLH model estimates to characterize the critical episodes for PM 10 in a limited area. In order to find out the meteorological conditions predisposing accumulation of PM 10 in the atmosphere’s lower level, some indicators are used: daily mean wind speed, cumulated rainfall, and mean MLH estimates from CALMET model. This indicator is linked to orography, which has important consequences on local weather dynamics. However, during critical events the <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are crucial to the determination of threshold exceeding of PM 10. Results show that the modelled MLH, together with cumulative rainfall and wind speed, can identify the meteorological conditions predisposing accumulation of air pollutant at ground level...|$|R

In this work we {{describe}} a monitoring and modeling study of ambient CO 2 concentrations in two industrial park areas in Taiwan in 2011 and 2012. We used 1 –minute high time resolution measurements to help better resolve time–varying plumes of air abundant in CO 2 than the traditional one–hour average data. The inclusion of span–one and span–two CO 2 calibration air {{traced back to the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) primary standards in the measurement system enabled us to persistently produce consistently calibrated CO 2 measurements over various industrial parks. We use a small scale Lagrangian model and two–dimensional (2 D) observational winds to associate ambient CO 2 measurements with <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources.</b> Given the closeness of our monitoring sites to the industrial parks, our 2 D Lagrangian calculation can genuinely represent direction of pollution dispersion from the <b>emission</b> <b>source.</b> We focused on cases when vertical transport is weak and the emissions from the industrial parks are kept close to the surface. These much polluted cases were the targets of our 2 D Lagrangian calculations. The model simulations with emissions from industrial park areas showed close resemblance between peak modeled results and observed CO 2 levels at measurement sites. These comparisons revealed both the local and non–local effects on the dispersion of CO 2 from industrial park areas. Our results vindicate the values of deploying high time–resolution CO 2 analyzers combined with high resolution modeling to determine the relative importance of local and long–distance sources of CO 2 emissions...|$|R

Monthly trends in aerosol characteristics are {{examined in the}} context of the local meteorology, regional and <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> and air mass back-trajectory data. Dust strongly affects the region during the late spring and summer months (May– August) when aerosol optical depth (AOD) is at its peak and precipitation accumulation is at a minimum. In addition, the peak AOD that occurs in July is further enhanced by a substantial number of seasonal wildfires in upwind regions. Conversely, AOD is at a minimum during winter; however, reduced mixing heights and a stagnant lower atmosphere trap <b>local</b> aerosol <b>emissions</b> near the surface and lead to significant reductions in visibility within Tehran. The unique meteorology and topographic setting makes wintertime visibility and surface aerosol concentrations particularly sensitive to local anthropogenic sources and is evident in the noteworthy improvement in visibility observed on weekends.

In this paper, multi-scale tracer and full-chemistry simulations with the STEM atmospheric chemistry model are {{used to assess the}} contribution of <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> to SC O 3 and evaluate the impacts of transported sulfur and <b>local</b> <b>emissions</b> on the SC sulfur budget during the ARCTAS-CARB experiment period in 2008. Sensitivity simulations quantify contributions of biogenic and fire emissions to SC O 3 levels. California biogenic and fire emissions contribute 3 – 4 ppb to near-surface O 3 over SC, with larger contributions to other regions in CA. Long-range transport from Asia is estimated to enhance surface SO 4 over SC by ~ 0. 5 μg/sm 3 , and the higher SOx levels (up to ~ 0. 7 ppb of SO 2 and ~ 6 μg/sm 3 of SO 4 ) observed above ~ 6 km did not affect surface air quality in the study region. Enhanced near-surface SOx levels over SC during the flight week were attributed mostly to <b>local</b> <b>emissions.</b> Two anthropogenic SOx emission inventories (EIs) from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are compared and applied in 60 km and 12 km chemical transport simulations, and the results are compared with observations. The CARB EI shows improvements over the National Emission Inventory (NEI) by EPA, but generally underestimates surface SC SOx by about a factor of two.

40|$|The {{results of}} the current {{exposure}} of the U. S. population from fish consumption indicate that most of the population consumes fish and is exposed to methylmercury as a result. Approximately 85 % of adults in the United States consumer fish and shellfish {{at least once a month}} with about half of adults selecting fish and shellfish as part of their diets at least once a week (based on food frequency data collected among more than 19, 000 adult respondents in the NHANES III conducted between 1988 and 1994). This same survey identified 1 - 2 % of adults who indicated they consume fish and shellfish almost daily.
