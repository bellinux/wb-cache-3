As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto {{the side of the house}} (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed. By the next morning, the entire house has collapsed except for one wall that announces the date over and over.|$|E

Before Netley had finished taking her prisoners on board, she spotted another privateer, and the privateer's prize. At 1am on 25 January Netley retook the bark Dutchess of Gordon which had been transporting 7,600 quintals of salt fish from Newfoundland to Oporto.

Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked <b>like</b> <b>from</b> the first film.
