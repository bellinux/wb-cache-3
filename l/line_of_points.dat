25|$|Mongols under Genghis Khan practiced an {{equivalent}} of swarming, partially because their communications, which used flags, horns, and couriers, were advanced for the time. Also one of the standard tactics of Mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from larger groups and defended positions for ambush and counterattack. Genghis Khan used the Yam system, which established a rear <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> for supplies and for remounts of fast-moving couriers. The remount system allowed horsemen to move much faster than the couriers of opponents without them. These couriers kept the Mongol senior and subordinate commanders informed, such that they could make fast decisions based on current information. In modern terms, the courier system provided the means of getting inside the opponent's OODA loop. With fast communications, the Mongols could make decisions not just on what they could see locally, but with that information oriented within the overall situation. They could then decide and act while the enemy were still waiting for information. Outnumbered Mongols could beat larger forces by faster communications, which allowed units to withdraw and regroup while other groups continually stung the enemy, withdrew in turn, while the earlier group again hit the enemy.|$|E

The man Markiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his own bedroom (the doors and windows securely fastened on the inside), dead; and on his breast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging his friends to suspect no innocent person of having any thing to do with his death, for that it was the work of his own hands entirely. Yet the jury brought in the astounding verdict that deceased came to his death [...] "by the hands of some person or persons unknown!" [...] They explained that the perfectly undeviating consistency of Markiss's character for thirty years towered aloft as colossal and indestructible testimony, that whatever statement he chose to make was entitled to instant and unquestioning acceptance as a lie. And they furthermore stated their belief that he was not dead, and instanced the strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he was dead--and beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long as possible, which was done. And so in the tropical climate of Lahaina the coffin stood open for seven days, and then even the loyal jury gave him up. But they sat on him again, and changed their verdict to [...] "suicide induced by mental aberration"--because, said they, with penetration, [...] "he said he was dead, and he was dead; and would he have told the truth if he had been in his right mind? No, sir." ...|$|E

50|$|This {{instrument}} {{is composed of}} five cameras disposed side by side, each equipped with a pushbroom spectrometer. These spectrometers use two-dimensional CCDs. One of {{the sides of the}} detector is oriented perpendicular to the trajectory of the satellite and simultaneously collects, through the front optics, observations for a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> at the Earth's surface (or in the atmosphere). The displacement of the platform along its orbit, combined with a short integration time, generate data that can later be used to create two-dimensional images. A light dispersing system separates the various wavelengths (colors) composing the incoming radiation at the entrance of the instrument and directs these on the detector along the second dimension, i.e., along track. These spectrometers acquire data in a large number of spectral bands, but for technical reasons only 16 of them are actually transmitted to the ground segment (one of which is required for the low-level processing of the raw data). This instrument thus provides useful data in 15 spectral bands, which are actually programmable in position, width and gain. In practice these technical characteristics are kept constant most of the time to allow a large number of systematic or operational missions.|$|E

40|$|Given an {{estimate}} of the binocular disparity between a pair of points and {{an estimate}} of the viewing distance, or knowledge of eye position, {{it should be possible to}} obtain {{an estimate of}} their depth separation. Here we show that, when points are arranged in different vertical geometric configurations across two intervals, many observers find this task difficult. Those who can do the task tend to perceive the depth interval in one configuration as very different from depth in the other configuration. We explore two plausible explanations for this effect. The first is the tilt of the empirical vertical horopter: Points perceived along an apparently vertical line correspond to a physical <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> tilted backwards in space. Second, the eyes can rotate in response to a particular stimulus. Without compensation for this rotation, biases in depth perception would result. We measured cyclovergence indirectly, using a standard psychophysical task, while observers viewed our depth configuration. Biases predicted from error due either to cyclovergence or to the tilted vertical horopter were not consistent with the depth configuration results. Our data suggest that, even for the simplest scenes, we do not have ready access to metric depth from binocular disparity. © 2012 Copyright The Experimental Psychology Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} induction field {{due to the}} Earth only would, if undisturbed by any outside agency, resemble macroscopically the field due to a magnetic dipole. Hcwever the field is disturbed by the interplanetary magnetic field, of which the most important component {{is that of the}} Sun. If the Sun's magnetic field were effectively steady, it would also be a dipole field, and approximately constant in the region within about twenty earth radii from the earth. Also, if we treat the Sun as a dipole, its dipole axis is roughly normal to the ecliptic plane. The Earth, treated as a dipole, has an axis which is inclined to the normal to the ecliptic plane at an angle which varies daily from a few degrees to nearly a third of a right angle. However, in this paper, it is proposed to treat both dipole axes as contra-parallel and effectively normal to the ecliptic plane, so that a general idea of the combined field can be obtained. Then the effect of a steady field due to the Sun, on the Earth's field would be the formation of a "neutral ring" surrounding the Earth; that is, a closed "neutral line", this being a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> at each of which the net nagnetic induction is zero.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, mP will denote a {{projective}} space of dimension m, and (m,n) P will denote a doubly-{{projective space}} of dimension m+n, namely {{the space of}} all pairs of points (x¦y), where x varies in mP and y in nP. Just so, (m,n,s) P will denote a triply-projective space of dimension m+n+s, and so on. A variety V of dimension d in mP has just one degree g, namely the number of points of intersection of V with d generic linear hyperplanes (ux) = 0, where (ux) means ∑uixi. On the other hand, a variety V' of dimension d in (m,n) P has several degree ga,b (a+b=d), defined as follows: ga,b {{is the number of}} points of intersection of V' with a hyperplanes (ux) = 0 and b hyperplanes (vy) = 0. Let xo, …, xm, yo, …, yn be the homogeneous coordinates of a point in m+n+ 1 P. It sometimes happens that the equations of a variety V in m+n+ 1 P are not only homogeneous in all variables x and y together, but even homogeneous in the x's and in the y's. In this case the same set of equations also defines a variety V' in the doubly-projective space (m+n) P. If d is the dimension of V', the dimension of V is d+ 1, for to every point (x¦y) of V' corresponds a whole straight <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> (xα, yβ) in V. In some cases it is easier to determine the degrees ga,b of V' than to determine the degree g of V. For this reason, it is desirable to have a rule that enables us to calculate g from the ga,b's. Such a rule will be proved here. It says:The degree g is the sum of all ga,b with a+b=d. In the case of multiply-projective spaces (m,n,…) P the same rule holds: g is the sum of the ga,b,… with a+b+…=d. Examples of applications of this rule will be given at the end...|$|E
