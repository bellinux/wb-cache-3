25|$|The Writing and <b>Language</b> <b>Test</b> of the SAT {{is made up}} of {{one section}} with 44 multiple-choice {{questions}} and a time limit of 35 minutes. As with the Reading Test, all questions are based on reading passages which may be accompanied by tables, graphs, and charts. The test taker will be asked to read the passages, find mistakes or weaknesses in writing, and to provide corrections or improvements. Reading passages on this test range in content from topic arguments to nonfiction narratives in a variety of subjects. The skills being evaluated include: increasing the clarity of argument; improving word choice; improving analysis of topics in social studies and science; changing sentence or word structure to increase organizational quality and impact of writing; and, fixing or improving sentence structure, word usage, and punctuation.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} German {{speakers}} in Hong Kong is about 5000, significant {{enough for the}} establishment of the German Swiss International School (Deutsch-Schweizerische Internationale Schule), which claims to number more than 1,000 students, at The Peak of Hong Kong Island. Many institutions in Hong Kong provide German courses. The most well-known one is the Goethe-Institut, which is located in Wan Chai. After spending a certain period in learning German, students can take the German Test as a Foreign <b>Language</b> (<b>Test</b> Deutsch als Fremdsprache; TestDaF for short) and Start German A1-C2. There are currently two test centres for TestDaF in Hong Kong: the Goethe-Institut and the Hong Kong Baptist University. The latter one also offers a European Studies degree course of German Stream, Bachelor of Social Science in European Studies (German Stream), in parallel with the French stream. A minor program of German is offered at the Language Centre of HKBU. The Hong Kong University offers a Major in German after 4 years of study. The Chinese University offers a Minor in German and popular summer courses. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology offers German for science and technology.|$|E

Clearly, these applied linguistic artefacts, especially <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> (which are the focus of this article) have far-reaching, sometimes negative, effects on our students. As applied linguists what is there in the literature on <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> to guide the work we do, to ensure that our designs have some positive effect? What have the experts in the field of <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> presented us with to ensure that important questions related to the social dimension in testing (issues related to transparency, integrity, accountability, fairness and ethics) are not ignored in the design and administration of <b>language</b> <b>tests?</b> What this article will attempt to do is to show that questions about the social dimension of <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> cannot be adequately answered by Messick (1980; 1989 a; 1989 b), a conventionally accepted expert in the field. Instead these questions can be answered in a “third idea, other than validity” (Weideman 2009 : 239), as outlined by Weideman, an idea that does not foreground one concept but rather identifies a number of fundamental considerations for <b>language</b> <b>testing.</b> [URL]...|$|R

2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission.

[...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete.

[...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests.

40|$|<b>Language</b> <b>testing</b> {{has been}} defined as one of the core areas of applied {{linguistics}} be - cause it tackles two of its fundamental issues: the need to define and reflect on the appropria - teness of Second Language Acquisition models and constructs by data analysis from <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> and the importance of facing the ethical challenge deriving from the social and political role <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> play nowadays. <b>Language</b> <b>testing</b> has thus a twofold impact in a variety of con - texts. In the first instance, it constitutes a scientific impulse for which research is needed to de - velop and implement the technical design of <b>tests.</b> Secondly, <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> has also become subject of debating because the use and interpretation of test results introduce ethical issues concerning the concept of ‘fairness’ in the construction, administration, evaluation and interpre - tation of <b>language</b> <b>tests.</b> In fact, <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> are always designed and used to make decisions {{on the basis of a}} process in which information about test takers is gathered from an observed performance under test conditions.

30|$|Test {{validation}} {{methods are}} an important part of <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> research. Validation methods have generally been predisposed in three domains (Rahimi et al. 2016): developments in psychometric and statistical methods in education (Bachman 2004; Bachman and Eignor 1997), qualitative methods in <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> influenced by second language acquisition (Banerjee and Luoma 1997; Bachman & Cohen 1998), conversation analysis and discourse analysis (Lazaraton 2002), and cognitive psychology research studies amalgamated into <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> research (Green 1997). The 1950 s and 1960 s witnessed studies on validation of discrete-point <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> while the research shifted attention to communicative <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> during the 1970 s (Clark 1975). This illustrates the fact that validity studies in earlier times was confined to limited concepts such as content and construct validity rather than score interpretations as the basis for predictions (Sackett et al. 2017). Additionally, test-taking processes and strategies and test consequences were ignored.|$|R
