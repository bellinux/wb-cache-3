25|$|People of pure Spanish descent {{living in}} the Philippines who were born in Spanish America were {{classified}} as 'americanos'.

25|$|This {{legal system}} of racial {{classification}} based on patrilineal descent had no parallel {{anywhere in the}} Spanish-ruled colonies in the Americas. In general, a son born of a sangley male and an indio or mestizo de sangley female was classified as mestizo de sangley; all subsequent male descendants were mestizos de sangley {{regardless of whether they}} married an India or a mestiza de sangley. A daughter born in such a manner, however, acquired the <b>legal</b> <b>classification</b> of her husband, i.e., she became an India if she married an indio but remained a mestiza de sangley if she married a mestizo de sangley or a sangley. In this way, a chino mestizo male descendant of a paternal sangley ancestor never lost his legal status as a mestizo de sangley no matter how little percentage of Chinese blood he had in his veins or how many generations had passed since his first Chinese ancestor; he was thus a mestizo de sangley in perpetuity.|$|E

The basic problem faced in national income accounting with respect to functional share classifications is that the supplying of productive services is associated with a monetary transaction involving an actual purchase and sale only in the case of wage and salary payments and a limited number of rents. In most cases, physical assets are owned and controlled directly by business firms and no monetary payment cor-responds with their current use.
