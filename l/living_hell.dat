25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, Bajević {{returned}} to AEK. Fans were bitterly divided among those who accepted him and those who couldn't forgive his defection to Olympiacos. The latter made his life a <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> In the 2002–03 Champions League, AEK became {{the first and only}} team to collect six ties out of six games in the group phase and ended up at third position. A notable match was the 3–3 draw against reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Nikos Goumas Stadium and another 2–2 draw against Real Madrid coming back from 2–0 down at the Bernabeu in Madrid.|$|E

500|$|Like {{the other}} poems {{making up the}} Four Quartets, Little Gidding deals with the past, present, and future, and humanity's place within them as each {{generation}} is seemingly united. In the second section, there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets, including Dante, Swift, Yeats, and others. When the ghost joins the poet, the narrator states [...] "Knowing myself yet being someone other". This suggests that the different times merge {{at the same time}} that the different personalities begin to merge, allowing a communication and connection with the dead. Later, in the fourth section, humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London; redemption or destruction. God's love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the <b>living</b> <b>hell</b> through purgation by fire. The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet. He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society.|$|E

500|$|Little Gidding {{was started}} after The Dry Salvages but was delayed because of Eliot's declining health and his dissatisfaction with early drafts of the poem. Eliot {{was unable to}} finish the poem until September 1942. Like the three {{previous}} poems of the Four Quartets, the central theme is time and humanity's place within it. Each generation is seemingly united and the poem describes a unification within Western civilisation. When discussing World War II, the poem states that humanity is given a choice between the bombing of London or the Holy Spirit. God's love allows mankind to redeem themselves and escape the <b>living</b> <b>hell</b> through purgation by fire; he drew the affirmative coda [...] "All shall be well" [...] from medieval mystic Julian of Norwich. The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help {{the world as a}} poet, and he parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the incident, it was learned that at least three additional drivers had been approached to try for the $5 million challenge prize. One was Scott Speed, who previously ran open-wheel Formula One cars for Scuderia Toro Rosso and who had raced on the reconfigured LVMS track in the Craftsman Truck Series for Morgan-Dollar Motorsports in 2008 and for Team Red Bull in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in 2009 and 2010. Speed, in an interview he gave to Inside Edition on October 18, 2011, said that he declined to take the offer saying that the track conditions were too dangerous for Indy-type cars. Likewise, A. J. Allmendinger, who also had previous open-wheel experience, had expressed early interest, though he later declined, recalling, [...] " [...] we raced CART at Vegas...it scared the <b>living</b> <b>hell</b> out of me." [...] Finnish media reported that [...] Formula One World Champion Kimi Räikkönen, who was splitting time between the World Rally Championship and NASCAR in 2011, had also been approached {{to take part in}} the race, but Räikkönen rejected the offer as he was not confident of having a competitive car, rather than having concerns over safety.|$|E

2500|$|Despite breathless {{speculation}} {{then and}} {{later that the}} Communist mobilizing slogan [...] "Self-Determination for the Black Belt" [...] was a call for national secession, Allen later claimed that [...] "we weren't stupid." [...] For all the brashness of the [...] "self-determination" [...] slogan, historian Mark Solomon believed the actual meaning of the phrase was rather more modest: [...] Self-determination was defined as democracy at its essence: self-government, self-organization, social and economic equality, the right of blacks to run their own lives without the relentless terror and racism that dogged their steps and made every waking day a <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Much {{had to be}} {{done before}} the Leningrad première could take place. The Leningrad Radio Orchestra under Karl Eliasberg was the only {{remaining}} symphonic ensemble. The orchestra had survived—barely—but it had not been playing and musical broadcasts had ceased. Music was not considered a priority by Party officials. Political appeals took {{a significant part of the}} broadcast time. Even then, there were hours of silence because of the lack of agitators. As for the city itself, Leningrad surrounded by the Nazis had become a <b>living</b> <b>hell,</b> with eyewitness reports of people who had died of cold and starvation lying in doorways in stairwells. [...] "They lay there because people dropped them there, the way newborn infants used to be left. Janitors swept them away in the morning like rubbish. Funerals, graves, coffins were long forgotten. It was a flood of death that could not be managed. Entire families vanished, entire apartments with their collective families. Houses, streets and neighborhoods vanished." ...|$|E
2500|$|After that, DX {{remained}} unseen {{and largely}} unmentioned until Shawn Michaels returned to WWE in 2002. With {{the acquisition of}} Triple H being persuaded by Michaels, and then Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff to sign a contract to join Raw {{as part of the}} [...] "Brand Extension" [...] at Vengeance. The following night on the July 22 episode of Raw at Shawn Michaels' 37th birthday, a week after the breakup of the nWo, Triple H handed Michaels a DX T-shirt and stated he [...] "had an idea", suggesting that the two reform the group and make Eric Bischoff's life a <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> The duo later came out that night to their old music and crotch chops, and pyro to the delight of the crowd. However, Triple H turned on Shawn Michaels that same night; he had teased the reunion as a ploy to appease Michaels and lure him to the ring before giving him a Pedigree, making Triple H a villain once again. This act led to the in-ring return of Michaels at SummerSlam and was the genesis of a long feud between the two that ended with a Triple H victory during a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|With his {{ownership}} reinstated, McMahon {{shifted his}} sights to, then babyface, Test, who was kayfabe dating Shane's sister, Stephanie. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating [...] "beneath the family's standards", {{and wound up}} feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test's life a <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> At SummerSlam, McMahon met Test in a [...] "Love Her or Leave Her" [...] match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie {{could no longer see}} each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test was able to get the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally. As his father, Vince, then feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and D-Generation X (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned heel, siding with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction began, {{and all of the other}} McMahons disappeared from television.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw rated the film {{five out of}} five stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing debut film" [...] and [...] "a horror movie of {{extraordinary}} focus and courage". He ended his review writing: [...] "Nemes's film {{has found a way}} to create a fictional drama with a gaunt, fierce kind of courage...." [...] Writing for Time Out, Dave Calhoun also gave the film five out of five stars. Indiewires Eric Kohn awarded the film an A- rating, calling it [...] "a remarkable refashioning of the Holocaust drama that reignites the setting with extraordinary immediacy". In his review written for The Hollywood Reporter, Boyd van Hoeij praised the cinematography and the soundwork of the film. He writes: [...] "Shot (and shown in Cannes) on 35mm, often in sickly greens and yellows and with deep shadows, Erdely's cinematography is one of the film's major assets, but it wouldn't be half as effective without the soundwork, which plays a major role in suggesting what is happening around Saul, with audiences often forced to rely on the sound to imagine the whole, horrible picture". Writing for The Film Stage, Giovanni Marchini Camia gave the film an A rating, and called it [...] "a towering landmark for filmic fictionalizations of the Holocaust". A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film an A- rating, and praised the movie's unique perspective: [...] "Son of Saul is the rare Holocaust drama that finds actual drama, and not just despair, in the <b>living</b> <b>hell</b> of a concentration camp". [...] "Son of Saul sees humanity in effort, identity in action; it watches someone with nothing, a man reduced to a statistic, get a piece of himself back, mostly by finding some meaning in a place of meaningless evil".|$|E
2500|$|Stone Cold Steve Austin, who {{had turned}} heel at WrestleMania and formed an {{alliance}} with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed {{from the threat of}} The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince a cowboy hat as a present. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Austin played [...] "Kumbaya" [...] and [...] "We Are the Champions" [...] for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him hugs and gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold who was a [...] "beer-swilling, foul-mouthed SOB" [...] and the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold that [...] "didn't take shit from anyone". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, [...] "If you want Stone Cold to beat the <b>living</b> <b>hell</b> out of Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!" [...] to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, shook his head and proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of homosexual life in Rome, particularly {{the requirements of}} secrecy and clandestinity of the love act, is a staple of Bellezza's poetic and prosaic writing. In Bellezza's first novel, L'innocenza (Innocence, 1971), Nino, the protagonist, consciously chooses the perdition and corruption of a <b>living</b> homosexual <b>hell.</b> In Bellezza's infernal world, homosexuality can be nothing else but prostitution and neurotically masochistic obsessions: in Lettere da Sodoma (Letters from Sodom, 1972), his conclusion is that everything is Hell {{and that the only}} salvation is the systematic refusal of the self.|$|R
50|$|Soon after Masuda's arrival, one of {{the other}} geisha in the okiya, Takemi, died of {{peritonitis}} caused by gonorrhea, and her refusal to seek medical treatment in the hopes of hastening her death greatly influenced Masuda's perception of <b>living</b> as <b>hell</b> and dying as paradise. Takemi's death caused Karuta to drink very heavily, leading to confrontations {{with the head of the}} okiya. During one such confrontation, Masuda intervened on Karuta's behalf; for this, she was thrown down the stairs and her right leg was broken. This injury landed her in the hospital, where she learned her real name.|$|R

60|$|Bear with me {{a moment}} {{and look at the}} problem. Here were {{thirteen}} beasts of us over half a thousand other beasts. It was a <b>living</b> <b>hell,</b> that prison, and it was up to us thirteen there to rule. It was impossible, considering the nature of the beasts, for us to rule by kindness. We ruled by fear. Of course, behind us, backing us up, were the guards. In extremity we called upon them for help; but it would bother them if we called upon them too often, in which event we could depend upon it that they would get more efficient trusties to take our places. But we did not call upon them often, except in a quiet sort of way, when we wanted a cell unlocked in order to get at a refractory prisoner inside. In such cases all the guard did was to unlock the door and walk away {{so as not to be}} a witness of what happened when half a dozen hall-men went inside and did a bit of man-handling.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{before the}} fire, her eyes fixed upon the burning coals. She heard muffled {{voices in the}} hall, she heard Powers enter an {{adjoining}} room, {{and close the door}} behind him. Her fingers clutched the sides of her chair, her eyeballs were hot. For the first time a spasm of physical fear seized her. He had gone to make ready. What if it should be death? She had spoken boldly of it but a moment before. Yet she was young, for good or evil her life was as yet unlived. Then with a rush came back the memory of the last ten months. The hopeless weariness of those days behind the counter, the miserable humiliation of it, the web of bitter despair drawn so closely and inevitably around her. All the petty tyrannies to which she had been subject, all the fettering restrictions which had gone to turn servitude into slavery were suddenly fresh in her mind. A hideous vista of dreary days and lonely nights--nowhere a ray of hope; the same, yesterday, to-day, and all other days. The fear passed away from her. Death might have its terrors, but a return to Bearmain's would be a <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> She heard the door open without a single tremor. She even smiled as she saw Powers standing upon the threshold.|$|E
