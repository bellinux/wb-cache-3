40|$|Much prior {{research}} has shown that if students have a poor command of the language in which they are taught and assessed, they experience a complex and deep <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantage</b> (Barton & Neville-Barton, 2003). Abedi (2006) mentions, in particular, that unnecessary linguistic complexity can threaten the validity of examination items and thus compromises the fairness of the assessment for English language learners. In Clarkson’s (1991, p. 31) research it was found that for the English language learners in the study “comprehension errors [made] up a high proportion of the errors made when…students attempt[ed] to solve mathematical word problems”. In an attempt to explore whether this was the case for a group of National Certificate (Vocational) [NC(V) ] students at an FET college, the research conducted in this study focused on describing the cognitive and linguistic complexity of Level 4 Mathematical Literacy examination items as well as the types of responses from a sample of students. A mixed-methods case study design was selected. Student errors were classified as either due to mathematical literacy-related sources, or language-related sources and the question was asked as to how the cognitive and linguistic complexity of items might be related to the types of errors made. Statistically significant correlations were found between the linguistic complexity of items and language-related errors, and between the cognitive complexity of items and all types of errors. It was also possible to identify which language features, in particular, were statistically significantly correlated with linguistic complexity, namely: prepositional phrases; words of 7 letters or more and complex/compound sentences. As was expected, the majority of errors were categorised as mathematical literacy-related. However, as many as 19. 22 % of all errors made were identified as language-related. While the scope of the study prevents any generalisations from being made, the results indicate a need for a larger-scale study of this nature to determine if the complex and deep <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantage</b> mentioned by Barton and Neville-Barton (2003) does exist with regard to the assessment of Mathematical Literacy for NC(V) students who are English language learners (Barton & Neville-Barton, 2003) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPerceptual {{learning}} of motion direction discrimination is generally thought {{to rely on}} the middle temporal area of the brain (MT/V 5). A recent study investigating {{learning of}} motion discrimination when MT was psychophysically suppressed found that learning was possible with suppressed MT, but only when the task was sufficiently easy [Lu, H., Qian, N., Liu, Z. (2004). Learning motion discrimination with suppressed MT. Vision Research 44, 1817 – 1825]. We investigated whether this effect was indeed due to MT suppression or whether it could be explained by task difficulty alone. By comparing learning of motion discrimination when MT was suppressed vs. un-suppressed, at different task difficulties, we found that task difficulty alone could not explain the effects. At the highest difficulty, learning was not possible with suppressed MT, confirming [Lu, H., Qian, N., Liu, Z. (2004). Learning motion discrimination with suppressed MT. Vision Research 44, 1817 – 1825]. In comparison, learning was possible with un-suppressed MT at the same difficulty level. At the intermediate task difficulty, there was a clear <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantage</b> when MT was suppressed. Only for the easiest level of difficulty, did learning become equally possible for both suppressed and un-suppressed conditions. These findings suggest that MT {{plays an important role in}} learning to discriminate relatively fine differences in motion direction...|$|E
40|$|Course {{management}} {{systems such as}} Blackboard include two distinct modes of web-based discussion, [...] real-time and delayed-timed. Both communication formats are promoted as having both advantages and disadvantages with respect to student learning and satisfaction. Ninety-three university students discussed two case studies using two real-time Blackboard chat and two case studies using delayed-time Blackboard discussion. Mastery of case study content was determined via objective examination items and student preference for CMC mode was surveyed. An ABAB research design allowed for comparison of student achievement across communicative conditions (e. g., A = delayed-time discussion followed by an examination; B = real-time discussion followed by an examination). In every contrast of real-time and delayed-time CMC mode, student achievement on objective examination items was equivalent. Many students (43 % of the sample) reported the perception that real-time CMC facilitated their learning more than delayed-time CMC. However, such students were at a <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantage,</b> as measured by objective examination test performance, when using that CMC mode. Consequently, {{results of the current}} investigation do not support the educational implementation of real-time CMC without corresponding implementation of delayed-time CMC and mechanisms to ensure that students do not rely entirely on real-time text-based communication to master course content...|$|E
40|$|Equity {{policies}} enable {{individuals from}} low SES backgrounds to enter University, yet do not facilitate their engagement {{as members of}} groups. These selected individuals enter a broader cohort, where they are expected (with support) to meet the same graduate attributes as everyone else. Rather than the diverse experiences of such students being seen as strengths to be built on, the focus tends {{to be placed on}} remedying their <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantage.</b> Thus, university poses as a neutral pathway to jobs and status, and effectively, a pathway out of low SES communities, rather than a gateway into greater community involvement. This paper presents a case study of a graduate certificate which offered fee scholarships to a group of overseas skilled refugees and migrants. In contrast to usual equity experiences, these students progressed as a cohort, were often the majority group in class, bent the curriculum to their own needs and applied the learning to their community involvements. Such engagement constituted a rich adult learning experience, which challenged conventional teaching-learning processes and curriculum, and raised questions about academic standards.

A considerable body of research has shown that school libraries are positively related to learning outcomes in children, as well as to their reading behavior and attitude toward reading, factors that correlate positively with reading and language skills. However, on the basis of existing research, it is hard to draw firm conclusions about the effect of school libraries on students from migrant families in particular.

Our analysis, however, should not be interpreted as the long-term effect on the probability of first graders going to college. Instead, we estimate the effect of delaying school entry on high school graduates aiming to join an elite institution. Our regression-discontinuity (RD) design shows that, among boys, delaying school entry by 1 year increases the admission test score by 0.5 standard deviations (sds) and the probability of college admission by 15 percentage points (p.p.). Importantly, due to the higher repetition rates among early entrants, the age difference between students born on December 31 and those born on January 1 practically disappears {{by the time they}} graduate from high school. Therefore, the effect on college admission cannot be attributed to differences in age at the test but rather to <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantages</b> that persist over time.

40|$|There are two {{essays in}} this dissertation. The first essay {{addresses}} {{the following research}} question. Given that direct feedback from its own filing is not available to a firm when it initially files for {{an initial public offering}} (IPO), what motivates it to file for an IPO when indirect feedback is limited or non-existent? The results show that insiders 2 ̆ 7 diversification needs, the firm 2 ̆ 7 s capital requirements, and firm/offer characteristics influence the decision to file for an IPO at a <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantage.</b> However, the results are influenced by the measure of learning and specification of industry. This study accounts for the learning from future filings, incorporates different measures of learning, and isolates indirect learning from direct learning. ^ In the second essay, it is argued that the time following an amendment in which demand is revealed has a cost. So, why do some firms take longer than others to go public following the amendment? It is hypothesized that the delay to the offer results from overestimation of demand and risk. As a result, underpricing predicted at the amendment is not indicative of the final level of underpricing. The firm and its investors bear the costs of the delay. This study highlights the distinction between partial and full information and the costs associated with SEC requirements. ...|$|E

30|$|According to Elder and Lubotsky (2009), two {{potential}} mechanisms {{could explain}} why later entrants outperform their peers. One is that greater maturity at school entry improves children’s learning ability at primary school and this effect persists over time. The other is that starting school later implies more human capital accumulated from parenting. To the extent that well-educated parents provide more human capital accumulation at home, the relationship between school-entry age and future outcomes should be weaker {{for the children of}} less-educated parents. We find, however, that the effect of delaying school entry on test scores is stronger among candidates with less parental education. If parents do not have a college degree, the enrollment delay increases the admission test score of boys by 0.73 – 0.86 sds and of girls by 0.14 – 0.57 sds. These findings imply that the difference in college admission scores comes from candidates’ learning ability at primary school, rather than from previously accumulated knowledge. Our findings are consistent with the ideas that <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantages</b> at an early age have a persistent impact on adults (Cunha and Heckman 2007; Cunha et al. 2010) and that grade retention is not an effective way to remedy this distortion (Manacorda 2012).|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{stability}} promotes intelligence In {{the research}} {{field of the}} relationship between intelligence and personality factors, one of the most consistent findings is that intelligence is positively correlated with emotional stability. However, few studies have considered this relationship in children, and very few have differentiated between types of intelligence as well as underlying differences in working memory capacity when explaining the relationship between intelligence scores and emotional stability. In this study, the level of emotional stability and performance in a proxy for fluid and crystallized intelligence as well as in two working memory tasks was assessed in a sample of 397 primary school children. Results reveal that emotional stability is significantly positively related to vocabulary (crystallized intelligence), moderated by high working memory performance, but unrelated to abstract reasoning (fluid intelligence). This was interpreted as indicating that the positive relationship between intelligence and emotional stability is mainly due to learning advantages starting in early age, due to high working memory performance, rather than to higher general intelligence. This bears the important implication that emotionally labile children (high level of neuroticism) should be supported to regulate their negative emotions, intrusive thoughts and anxiety as early as possible to eliminate progressive <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> One approach to do so is by specific working memory training targeting the improvement of emotional regulation skills...|$|R

40|$|Circadian clocks of {{adolescents}} typically run lateincluding sleep timesyet adolescents generally are expected at school {{early in the}} morning. Due to this mismatch between internal (circadian) and external (social) times, adolescents suffer from chronic sleep deficiency, which, in turn, affects academic performance negatively. This constellation affects students' future career prospects. Our study correlates chronotype and examination performance. In total, 4734 grades were collected from 741 Dutch high school students (ages 11 - 18 years) who had completed the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire to estimate their internal time. Overall, the lowest grades were obtained by students who were very late chronotypes (MSFsc > 5. 31 h) or slept very short on schooldays (SDw < 7. 03 h). The effect of chronotype on examination performance depended {{on the time of}} day that examinations were taken. Opposed to late types, early chronotypes obtained significantly higher grades during the early (0815 - 0945 h) and late (1000 - 1215 h) morning.

Late types also obtained lower grades than early types when tested at the same internal time (hours after MSFsc), which may reflect general attention and <b>learning</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of late chronotypes during the early morning.

50|$|Low {{working memory}} is {{becoming}} more of an issue today with children {{in the public school}} system. The education system plays a substantial part in developing the children’s mind for working memory. However, families who are in the low socio-economic status can’t always afford private school to provide the children with the highest quality of teachers and <b>learning.</b> A <b>disadvantage</b> to having children in public school system is that educators don’t have time, the right tools or proper techniques to train the children to develop better working memory. Public schools are at a disadvantage when it comes to receiving the best education for working memory.
