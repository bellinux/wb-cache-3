50|$|The Limmer & Trinidad <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company {{became the}} first {{contractor}} to use asphalt from the Lake for road surfacing. In the early 1970s the UK market switched to Coal tar, asphalt became a much less popular product and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago took ownership of the asphalt extraction business in 1978.|$|E
50|$|The Asphalt {{industry}} in Trinidad {{is located at}} the Pitch Lake at the town of La Brea in southwestern Trinidad and it has gained a reputation for itself as the world's largest deposit. The Pitch Lake is considered a tourist attraction and attracts about 20,000 visitors annually. It is also mined for asphalt by <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|In La Brea {{the main}} and largest {{industry}} is the <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company. Small-scale farming and fishing are {{other sources of}} income. However, many residents work outside the community either in the neighboring towns of Point Fortin and San Fernando or even further. Proposals {{for the construction of}} a smelter plant in the area have been the subject of protests due to the harmful effects such an industry may pose for residents.|$|E
50|$|Major tar pits include Binagadi <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake,</b> the La Brea Tar Pits, the Carpinteria Tar Pits, the McKittrick Tar Pits, Pitch Lake, and Lake Bermudez.|$|R
50|$|New sub-types of -philes are {{identified}} frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life {{lives in the}} liquid <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake,</b> Pitch Lake. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells/gram. Likewise, until recently boron tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of Bacillus boroniphilus, borophiles came into discussion. Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.|$|R

50|$|In 1919 James left Tobago for Trinidad, {{where he}} worked in the oil fields and later as a stevedore, working for Brighton <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt,</b> which {{produced}} and exported asphalt from the Pitch Lake in La Brea. He initially joined the Trinidad Workingmen's Association led by A. A. Cipriani and later the Federated Workers Trade Union led by Albert Gomes and Quintin O'Connor. James became a union organiser and represented oil and asphalt workers.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{was founded}} circa 1881 as the Limmer & Trinidad <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company with the {{objective}} of undertaking road contracting using high quality asphalt from Limmer in Germany and from the Pitch Lake in Trinidad. The company was based in Carnwarth Road in Fulham and secured major contracts for surfacing the roads of London. The asphalt was imported and the stone came by barge from Scotland. The Company was acquired by Tarmac in 1971.|$|E

50|$|Promoted to Captain in 1854, he {{was given}} command of HMS Horatio at Sheerness and then of HMS Niger in which he {{took part in the}} {{destruction}} of the Chinese Fleet in October 1856 during the Second Opium War. He later commanded HMS Warrior and then HMS Cumberland. He was appointed Superintendent of Sheerness dockyard in 1869 and Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station in 1873. He retired in 1886. In retirement he was involved in managing the Trinidad <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} {{was founded in}} 1851 by the tenth Earl of Dundonald who took out a patent {{for the use of}} asphalt from the Lake at La Brea. J.W. Previte and A.L Barber later joined the team and in 1888 secured a 21-year concession for the exploitation of the Lake. In 1949 the {{business was}} renamed The Trinidad <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company. Ownership remained with the Previte Company based in the UK which comprised a network approximately 24 public companies around the world through which the asphalt was sold.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} on 28 October 1968, five minutes before his twin sister Tracey, to Sheila McGinty (housewife) and Ted <b>Lake</b> (<b>asphalt</b> technician). He grew up in Haughton Green in Lancashire (now Greater Manchester), though both his parents came from Ardwick. The twins were the younger {{siblings}} of Susan (born 1962), David (1964), and Michael (born 1966). He spent all of his free time during childhood playing football. He grew up supporting Manchester City, as {{he was taken to}} games at Maine Road by the local milkman. His great-uncle George was on the books of Manchester City prior to the First World War.|$|E
50|$|Bitumen {{was used}} by ancient Egyptians to embalm mummies. The Persian word for asphalt is moom, which {{is related to the}} English word mummy. The Egyptians' primary source of bitumen was the Dead Sea, which the Romans knew as Palus Asphaltites (<b>Asphalt</b> <b>Lake).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> has {{a surface}} area of about 445 ha and the depth varies between 1.5 to 2 m. [...] Even though Lake Guanoco is larger in area than Trinidad's Pitch Lake, it is smaller in volume; {{nevertheless}} its tar is purer.|$|R
50|$|Lake Guanoco {{is one of}} {{the five}} natural <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> areas in the world, the others being Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago and La Brea Tar Pits (Los Angeles), McKittrick Tar Pits (McKittrick) and Carpinteria Tar Pits (Carpinteria) all located in the US state of California.|$|R
5000|$|La Brea {{is famous}} for its natural wonder of the world, [...] "The Pitch Lake", which is {{actually}} the largest of three in existence. It is located on an area of depression in the landscape; with some pools, reeds and grayish asphalt everywhere. The asphalt is so soft in some areas that an individual can slowly sink if he/she stands on the surface too long. In some places one can put a stick through the asphalt and remove liquid tar. During the rainy season, the pools collect water, which becomes sulphurous due to the gases that are being released through the asphalt layers. These pools of water become breeding places for Aedes aegypti and other mosquitoes, thereby creating a health risk for workers of <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company and tourists as well as the local villagers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1878, {{he became}} {{actively}} involved with asphalt pavement {{work with his}} brother-in-law John J. Albright, a Buffalo industrialist. In 1880, Barber partnered with U.S. Senator John Sherman for the purchase and sale of the [...] "Stone" [...] property, then {{on the outskirts of}} Washington D.C. This led to an interest in asphalt for paving city streets, after a government study determined it to be the best available method. He incorporated Barber Asphalt Paving Co. in 1883 to produce asphalt, and in 1887, secured a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake in Trinidad, the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. He was also managing director of Trinidad <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Co., Limited, incorporated in London in 1898. Barber moved the Washington-based business to New York City, and it continued to expand, becoming, against Barber's wishes, part of an asphalt trust. By 1900, he had laid over 12 million square yards of Trinidad asphalt pavement in 70 American cities at a cost of $35 million. [...] Barber retired from the business in 1901, just before the trust collapsed, but returned to the industry in 1904.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{conditions}} of the research in both civil and aboard, and thinking of the northeast region's climate characteristics, we research performance of the bitumen with different dosage <b>Lake</b> <b>asphalt.</b> And we also analyze the <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> mixtures with two representative kinds of aggregates. Pave test-road and summarize the construction technology of the <b>lake</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture...|$|E
50|$|A tar pit, or more {{accurately}} an asphalt pit or <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake,</b> {{is the result}} of a type of petroleum seep where subterranean bitumen leaks to the surface, creating a large area of natural asphalt. This happens because, after the material reaches the surface, its lighter components vaporize, leaving only the thick asphalt.|$|R
50|$|The Carpinteria Tar Pits {{are one of}} {{the five}} natural <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> areas in the world, the others being Tierra de Brea in Trinidad and Tobago, Lake Guanoco in Venezuela and the La Brea Tar Pits (Los Angeles) and McKittrick Tar Pits (McKittrick) both also located in the US state of California.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} The Pitch Lake {{is related to}} deep faults in {{connection}} with subduction under the Caribbean Plate related to Barbados Arc. The lake has not been studied extensively, but {{it is believed that}} the lake is at the intersection of two faults, which allows oil from a deep deposit to be forced up. The lighter elements in the oil evaporate under the hot tropical sun, leaving behind the heavier asphalt. Bacterial action on the asphalt at low pressures creates petroleum in asphalt. The researchers indicated that extremophiles inhabited the <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells/gram. The Pitch Lake is one of several natural <b>asphalt</b> <b>lakes</b> in the world. The La Brea Tar Pits (Los Angeles), McKittrick Tar Pits (McKittrick) and Carpinteria Tar Pits (Carpinteria) are all in the U.S. state of California. Lake Guanoco is in the Republic of Venezuela.|$|R
