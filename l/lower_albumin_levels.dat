40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} {{predictive}} value of inflammatory biomarkers and lipids for vascular and non-vascular mortality in older men. Methods and results: The relevance of inflammatory biomarkers and lipids for vascular and non-vascular mortality was assessed in a prospective study of 5360 men (mean age 77 years) followed for 7 years. Vascular mortality was {{positively associated with}} log C-reactive protein (InCRP), fibrinogen and total/HDL 0 C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and inversely associated with albumin [age adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per 2 -SD higher usual level (approximately {{the difference between the}} top and the bottom thirds of the distribution) : 2. 09 for InCRP; 1. 70 for fibrinogen; 0. 50 for albumin and 1. 45 for total/HDL-C]. The associations with the inflammatory markers were attenuated after adjustment for established risk factors, including lipids [adjusted HRs: 1. 86 (InCRP); 1. 44 (fibrinogen); 0. 51 (albumin) ], and further attenuated (and, for fibrinogen, no longer predictive) after adjustment for each other [fully adjusted HRs: 1. 60 (InCRP); 1. 01 (fibrinogen); 0. 61 (albumin) ]. Higher CRP and <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were also associated with significantly raised non-vascular mortality independently of other characteristics [fully adjusted HRs: 1. 62 (InCRP); 0. 65 (albumin) ]. Conclusion: In this cohort of older men, higher CRP and <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> strongly predicted both vascular and non-vascular mortality, independently of other characteristics.

40|$|Chronic nonsurgical skin wounds such as venous stasis and {{diabetic}} ulcers {{have been}} associated with a number of comorbid conditions; however, the strength of these associations has not been compared. We utilized the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) system to identify a cohort of 637 patients with chronic skin ulcers. Preliminary analysis () showed that 49. 7 % of the patients had a poor prognosis such as amputation or a nonhealing ulcer for at least a year. Factors significantly associated () with these outcomes included diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease, and need for systemic antibiotics. Patients with poor outcomes also tended to have lower hemoglobin levels (), higher WBC levels (), and <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (). On multivariate analysis, however, only diabetes mellitus (OR 5. 87, 1. 36 – 25. 3), need for systemic antibiotics (OR 3. 88, 1. 06 – 14. 2), and albumin levels (0. 20 per unit, 0. 07 – 0. 60) remained significant independent predictors of poor wound-healing outcomes.

40|$|Background:Cancer {{incidence}} {{is increasing}} in the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} on a global basis. Biochemical parameters, such as C-reactive protein and albumin (combined to form the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, mGPS), alkaline phosphatase (Alk phos), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and serum calcium have been reported to be associated with cancer and non-cancer mortality. Therefore, to definitively examine the interrelationships between the above biochemical parameters, the mGPS and the presence of cancer, the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study was undertaken. The aim of this initial {{study was to examine the}} effect of cancer on markers of systemic inflammation induced by the liver (mGPS) and on levels of routine biochemical parameters. Methods:Patients (n= 223 303) who had a single incidental sample taken for C-reactive protein, albumin, calcium and serum liver function tests where available, between 2000 and 2008 were studied. Those with a pathological diagnosis of cancer (n= 22 715) were identified. The mGPS was constructed and liver function tests classified in accordance with the local reference ranges. Results:Patients with cancer had higher C-reactive protein and <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (and thus a higher mGPS), higher adjusted calcium, Alk phos and GGT levels, but lower aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (all P/= 0. 3) in both the non-cancer and cancer groups were found between albumin, C-reactive protein and Alk phos, AST and ALT, AST and GGT and ALT and GGT (all P< 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, the associations with the presence of cancer remained with age, deprivation, C-reactive protein, albumin, adjusted calcium, Alk phos and GGT (all P< 0. 01). Patients following a diagnosis of cancer had <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and thus higher mGPS (all P< 0. 001). Also, post-diagnosis patients were more likely to have lower adjusted calcium, bilirubin, Alk Phos, AST, ALT and GGT levels (all P< 0. 05). When the cancer diagnoses were ranked from those with the lowest proportion of mGPS 1 or 2 to those with the highest, the percentage of cases with a mGPS of 1 or 2 ranged from 21 % in breast cancer to 46 % in prostate cancer and to 68 % in pulmonary cancer. Compared with breast cancer the mGPS was significantly higher in those diagnosed with dermatological, bladder, endocrinological, gynaecological, prostate, musculoskeletal, gastroesophageal, haematological, renal, colorectal, head and neck, pancreaticobiliary and pulmonary cancers (all P< 0. 001). Conclusion:The results of the present study indicate that the systemic inflammatory response is common in a large patient cohort, increased by the presence of cancer and associated with the perturbation of a number of biochemical parameters previously reported to be associated with mortality. There is a striking parallel between the proportions of cases with a mGPS of 1 or 2 and reported survival rates in these tumours...|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the relationship among aortic artery calcification (AAC), cardiac valve calcification (CVC), and mortality in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Methods: All MHD patients in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital in July 2011 were included. To follow up for 42 months, clinical data, predialysis blood tests, echocardiography, and lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography results were collected. Plasma FGF 23 level was measured using a C-terminal assay. Results: Totally, 110 MHD patients were involved in this study. Of which, 64 (58. 2 %) patients were male, the mean age was 55. 2 ± 1. 4 years old, and the median dialysis duration was 29. 85 (3. 0 - 225. 5) months. About 25. 5 % of the 110 MHD patients had CVC from echocardiography while 61. 8 % of the patients had visible calcification of aorta from lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography. After 42 months follow-up, 25 (22. 7 %) patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with AAC or CVC had a significant greater number of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths than those without. In multivariate analyses, the presence of AAC was a significant factor associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 3. 149, P = 0. 025) in addition to <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and <b>lower</b> 25 -hydroxy Vitamin D (25 (OH) D) level. The presence of CVC was a significant factor associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3. 800, P = 0. 029) in addition to <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and <b>lower</b> 25 (OH) D level. Conclusion: Lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography and echocardiography are simple methods to detect AAC and CVC in dialysis patients. The presence of AAC and CVC was independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by X-ray and echocardiography could be a useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD patients...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess whether}} chronic glycemic control and stress-induced hyperglycemia, {{determined}} by the gap between admission glucose levels and A 1 C-derived average glucose (ADAG) levels adversely affects outcomes in diabetic patients with pyogenic liver abscess (PLA). Methods: Clinical, laboratory, and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) findings of 329 PLA patients (2004 – 2010) were retrospectively reviewed. HbA 1 C levels {{were used to determine}} long-term glycemic control status, which were then converted to estimated average glucose values. For the gap between admission glucose levels and ADAG levels, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the optimal cut-off values predicting adverse outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of adverse outcomes. Results: Diabetic PLA patients with poorer glycemic control had significantly higher Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infection rates, <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels,</b> and longer hospital stays than those with suboptimal and good glycemic control. The ROC curve showed that a glycemic gap of 72 mg/dL was the optimal cut-off value for predicting adverse outcomes and showed a 22. 3 % relative increase in adverse outcomes compared with a glycemic gap, 72 mg/dL. Multivariate analysis revealed that an elevated glycemic gap$ 72 mg/dL was important predictor of adverse outcomes.

40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the contribution of ABCB 1 expression to the risk of clopidogrel resistance (CR). Platelets functions were measured using the Verify-Now P 2 Y 12 assay. Applying Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was tested. Using bisulphite pyrosequencing assay, we investigated the association of the ABCB 1 DNA methylation levels and CR. It was shown that female, hypertension, and <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> increased the risk of CR (P< 0. 05). If patients did not have hypoproteinaemia or had hypertension, the SNP in rs 1045642 was associated with CR (CC vs. TT: albumin ≥ 35, P = 0. 042; hypertension, P = 0. 045; C vs. T: albumin ≥ 35, P = 0. 033; hypertension, P = 0. 040). Additionally, the platelet inhibition of the CT+TT genotype in rs 1128503 was larger than that of the CC genotype (P = 0. 021). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male, higher albumin and hsCRP decreased the risk of CR, and the stent size maybe positively correlated with CR. The SNP in rs 1045642 was related to all-cause mortality (P = 0. 024). We did not find any relationship between the methylation levels of the ABCB 1 promoter and CR. In conclusions, our study indicated that ABCB 1 polymorphisms might be useful in further evaluating the pathogenesis of CR...|$|E

The aims of this study were to determine the association of serum levels of CA 19 - 9 at diagnosis with other clinical data and serum liver function tests and to identify possible factors that influence the survival rates during follow-up. Methods: Retrospective observational study of 89 patients with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma followed at the Department of Gastroenterology during 5 years. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20. 0. Results: Patients were followed up for a median time of 127 days (IQR: 48 - 564), and the median age at diagnosis was 71. 0 years (IQR: 62. 0 - 77. 5). The median survival rate was 14. 0 months (IQR: 4. 3 - 23. 7), and the mortality rate was 79 %. Patients with CA 19 - 9 levels ≥ 103 U/L had <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and higher levels of alanine aminotransferase and &#x 03 B 3;-glutamyltransferase.

40|$|Several {{case studies}} have {{reported}} a possible drug interaction between warfarin and tramadol where tramadol coadministration enhanced the antithrombotic effects of warfarin. To assess this drug interaction, changes in prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) before and after tramadol coadministration were investigated in patients receiving warfarin. For this study, we examined 54 patients (male/female: 22 / 32, 68. 4 ± 12. 7 years) who were being treated with warfarin for deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, arteriosclerosis obliterans, congestive heart failure, and other vascular diseases. Significant increases in PT-INR were observed 9. 5 (1 - 118) d after coadministration of tramadol (1. 81 ± 0. 56 vs. 2. 47 ± 1. 10, p< 0. 01). Twenty-eight patients (PT-INR increased group) with PT-INR elevation of greater than 0. 5 or dose reduction of warfarin after coadministration of tramadol were compared with other groups of patients to find drug interaction risk factors. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower levels of albumin (3. 5 g/dL or less) [odds ratio (OR) 22. 1; 95 %CI 2. 9 - 169. 9]; lower eGFR (50 mL/min or less) (OR 7. 7; 95 %CI 1. 4 - 42. 0); and PT-INR before tramadol coadministration (OR 38. 2; 95 %CI 3. 7 - 397. 6) were characteristic of the PT-INR increased group.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that it is {{possible}} for patient experience to be influenced by factors that are not attributable to health-care. Therefore, if patient experience is to be used as an accurate indicator of clinical performance, then {{it is important to understand}} its determinants. We used data from 840 dialysis patients who completed a validated patient experience survey. We created a potential theoretical framework based on available clinical knowledge to hypothesize the relationships between 13 demographic, socio-economic and health status factors and three outcome measures: global rating of the dialysis centre and the patient experience with the nephrologists and nurses care. The theoretical framework guided the selection of confounding variables for each determinant, which were then entered as terms in multivariable linear regression models. Patients who were of older age, of non-European decent, and who had a lower educational level, lower albumin level, with better self-rated health and who were without co-morbidities reported higher global ratings with the dialysis centre than their counterparts. Past myocardial infarction and better self-rated health were found to be determinants of a more positive experience while in the nephrologists care. A more positive experience with nurses care was associated with factors including older age, Dutch origin background, lower educational level, <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and better self-rated health. Several characteristics of dialysis patients influence the way they rate and experience their care.

40|$|AIMS: Hypoalbuminemia {{is common}} in heart failure (HF), {{especially}} in elderly patients. It is {{associated with an increased}} risk of death. The present study sought to examine the prognostic significance of serum albumin level in the prediction of hospital mortality in patients admitted for acute non-ischemic HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association between albumin and hospital mortality in a cohort of 546 patients admitted for acute non-ischemic HF. None of the patients had infectious disease, severe arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation), required invasive ventilation, or presented with acute coronary syndrome or primary valvular disease. Thirty-six patients (7 %) died during the hospital stay. These patients were significantly older (78 +/- 9 vs. 72 +/- 12 years; P = 0. 006), had higher heart rate (P < 0. 0001), increased creatinine level (P = 0. 01), lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P < 0. 05), elevated leucocyte count (P = 0. 001), and <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (31. 3 +/- 5. 6 g/L vs. 36. 9 +/- 4. 1 g/L; P < 0. 001). With multivariable analysis, age (P = 0. 01), heart rate (P < 0. 0003), diastolic blood pressure (P < 0. 01), leukocyte count (P = 0. 009), and serum albumin level (P < 0. 0001) emerged as independent predictors of hospital mortality. Hypoalbuminemia (< 34 g/L) yielded the best sensitivity (78. 8 %) and specificity (75 %) for predicting hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Serum albumin level measured at admission can serve as a simple prognostic factor in acute non-ischemic HF. Hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased risk of hospital mortality, especially in elderly patients. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This study aims to evaluate the impact of demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics on the treatment outcome and mortality of TB/HIV co-infected patients in a TB tertiary center in Iran. Materials and methods: The study was conducted at Iran's National Referral Center for Tuberculosis. In total, 111 patients were recruited between 2004 and 2007. Mycobacteriology studies were performed for all patients. Demographic, clinical, and lab data of all patients were analyzed, and predictors of unsuccessful outcomes, as well as mortality, were determined. Results: The mean age for all 111 TB/HIV patients was 38 ± 9 years (range 22 – 70) and 107 patients (96. 3 %) were male; 104 patients (93. 7 %) {{had a history of}} drug abuse, and 96 patients (86. 4 %) had a history of imprisonment. The route of transmission of HIV was intravenous drug use in 88 of the patients (79. 3 %); 23 patients (20. 7 %) had a history of Category 1 (CAT- 1) (5. 4 %) and CAT- 2 treatment. Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) was given to 48 patients (43. 2 %). There was no significant association found between treatment outcome or mortality with sex, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, imprisonment, route of transmission, history of CAT- 1 and CAT- 2, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD 4), and adverse effects (p > 0. 05).

We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of L-PAC and S-PAC patients. The clinicopathological characteristics of S-PAC were investigated to clarify the prognosis predictive factors of S-PAC. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-nine PAC patients, aged 16 - 93 years (median, 59. 0 years) with a tumor at the pancreatic head undergoing intentional curative resection were investigated. The S-PAC and L-PAC patients had similar demographic data, clinical features, and tumor markers (a similar positive rate of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9). There were also similar rates of lymph node metastasis, portal vein invasion, stage distribution, tumor differentiation, positive resection margin, surgical morbidity and mortality observed between the two groups. During a follow-up period ranging from 1. 0 to 122. 7 mo (median, 10. 9 mo), S-PAC and L-PAC patients had a similar prognosis after resection (P = 0. 4805). Among the S-PAC patients group, patients with higher albumin level (> 3. 5 g/dL) had more favorable survival than those with <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels,</b> which was the only favorable predictive prognostic factor.

No correlation was found between proteinuria and MAG 3 /hippurate clearance ratio nor between serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> GFR, FF, ERPF and the MAG 3 /hippurate clearance ratio. We therefore conclude that there is no correlation between proteinuria and <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and the MAG 3 /hippurate ratio.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe risk {{of death}} is {{significantly}} higher in TB/HIV-infected patients than in those patients with just one disease or the other. This study aims to evaluate the impact of demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics on the treatment outcome and mortality of TB/HIV co-infected patients in a TB tertiary center in Iran. Materials and methodsThe study was conducted at Iran’s National Referral Center for Tuberculosis. In total, 111 patients were recruited between 2004 and 2007. Mycobacteriology studies were performed for all patients. Demographic, clinical, and lab data of all patients were analyzed, and predictors of unsuccessful outcomes, as well as mortality, were determined. ResultsThe mean age for all 111 TB/HIV patients was 38 ± 9 years (range 22 – 70) and 107 patients (96. 3 %) were male; 104 patients (93. 7 %) {{had a history of}} drug abuse, and 96 patients (86. 4 %) had a history of imprisonment. The route of transmission of HIV was intravenous drug use in 88 of the patients (79. 3 %); 23 patients (20. 7 %) had a history of Category 1 (CAT- 1) (5. 4 %) and CAT- 2 treatment. Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) was given to 48 patients (43. 2 %). There was no significant association found between treatment outcome or mortality with sex, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, imprisonment, route of transmission, history of CAT- 1 and CAT- 2, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD 4), and adverse effects (p> 0. 05). Administration of HAART led to a significantly higher rate of good outcome (p< 0. 001). <b>Lower</b> <b>Albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and body weight were significantly associated with mortality.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether ertapenem, being highly protein bound, is less effective than other carbapenems in the presence of hypoalbuminemia. In a prospective cohort study, we included adults with clinically and microbiologically documented infections caused by carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae who were hospitalized in a tertiary medical center from March 2010 to September 2012. We tested whether hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 2. 5  g/dL) had a larger effect on 30 -day mortality in subjects treated with ertapenem compared to those treated with meropenem or imipenem (I/M). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for death including the carbapenem drug and the interaction between albumin and the carbapenem. Of 279 individual subjects included, 173 were treated with ertapenem and 106 with I/M. The odds ratio (OR) for 30 -day mortality with hypoalbuminemia was 4. 6 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 1 – 10. 1) among subjects with ertapenem versus 1. 2 (95 % CI 0. 5 – 2. 70) with I/M (p =  0. 02 for difference between groups). In the regression model, the interaction between carbapenem type and albumin levels was significant (p =  0. 03); for ertapenem <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with increased 30 -day mortality (OR 2. 45, 95 % CI 1. 19 – 5. 05), while for I/M the change was not significant (OR 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 31 – 1. 41). The model suggests that the risk of death for ertapenem-treated subjects quintupled when albumin was 2  g/dL compared to 4  g/dL. Hypoalbuminemia was associated with mortality significantly more among subjects treated with ertapenem compared to subjects treated with I/M. The effectiveness of current dosing schemes of ertapenem in subjects with significant hypoalbuminemia should be revisited...|$|E

There were 91 coronary heart disease deaths, 113 myocardial infarction patients, and 405 controls matched to cases within 5 years of age, treatment group, and clinic site. There was a highly significant inverse {{relation between}} serum albumin level and risk of coronary heart disease. Individuals with a baseline level of serum albumin> 4. 7 g/dl had an odds ratio of 0. 45 as compared with individuals with a baseline level of serum albumin < 4. 4 g/dl. The relation persisted after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, smoking, and serum cholesterol). The association was stronger for coronary heart disease deaths than for surviving myocardial infarction patients, and for cigarette smokers as compared with cigarette nonsmokers. The deaths studied occurred in the time period at least 6 years after the sera had been obtained and up to 10. 5 years of follow-up, and the myocardial infarctions studied occurred within the first 6. 5 years of follow-up.

We analyzed whether MINS {{was a risk}} factor for weaning failure in critical patients who underwent major abdominal surgery. This retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Peking University People's Hospital. The subjects were all critically ill patients who underwent major abdominal surgery between January 2011 and December 2013. Clinical and laboratory parameters during the perioperative period were investigated. Backward stepwise regression analysis was performed to evaluate MINS relative to the rate of weaning failure. Age, hypertension, chronic renal disease, left ventricular ejection fraction before surgery, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, pleural effusion, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, duration of mechanical ventilation before weaning and the <b>level</b> of <b>albumin</b> after surgery were treated as independent variables. This study included 381 patients, of whom 274 were successfully weaned. MINS was observed in 42. 0 % of the patients. The MINS incidence was significantly higher in patients who failed to be weaned compared to patients who were successfully weaned (56. 1 % versus 36. 5 %; P< 0. 001). Independent predictive factors of weaning failure were MINS, age, lower left ventricular ejection fraction before surgery and <b>lower</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> after surgery. The MINS odds ratio was 4. 098 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 07 to 15. 6; P = 0. 04).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: An {{elevated}} {{level of}} serum C-reactive protein (CRP) {{is widely considered}} an indicator of an underlying inflammatory disease and a long-term prognostic predictor for dialysis patients. This cross-sectional cohort {{study was designed to}} assess the correlation between the level of high-sensitivity CRP (HS-CRP) and the outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: A total of 402 patients were stratified into 3 tertiles (lower, middle, upper) according to serum HS-CRP level and and followed up from October 2009 to September 2011. During follow-up, cardiovascular events, infection episodes, technique failure, and mortality rate were recorded. RESULTS: During the 24 -month follow-up, 119 of 402 patients (29. 6 %) dropped out from PD, including 28 patients (7. 0 %) who died, 81 patients (20. 1 %) who switched to hemodialysis, and 10 patients (2. 5 %) who underwent kidney transplantation. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test demonstrated {{a significant difference in the}} cumulative patient survival rate across the 3 tertiles (the lowest rate in upper tertile). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, only higher HS-CRP level, older age, the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), <b>lower</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> and the occurrence of cardiovascular events during follow-up were identified as independent predictors of mortality. Every 1 mg/L increase in HS-CRP level was independently predictive of a 1. 4 % increase in mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis also showed that higher HS-CRP level, the presence of DM, lower hemoglobin <b>level,</b> <b>lower</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> higher dialysate/plasma creatinine ratio, and the occurrence of infective episodes and cardiovascular events during follow-up were independent predictors of technique failure.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} sub-centimeter-sized nodules (SCSNs) detected during surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients at risk. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 142 patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B or C without a prior history of HCC in whom a SCSN was detected during HCC surveillance. We calculated the rate of HCC development from SCSNs in the study population and analyzed {{the differences in the}} baseline clinical characteristics and imaging features between the patients with SCSNs that eventually developed into HCC and patients with SCSNs that did not develop into HCC. RESULTS: During 667 person-years of follow-up, HCC developed in 33 patients. The calculated HCC development rate was 4. 9 % per year. The cumulative one-, two-, three- and five-year HCC development rates were 5. 6 %, 10. 6 %, 14. 1 % and 20. 4 %, respectively. Upon baseline comparison, the HCC group was older (54. 4 1; 8. 3 years vs 48. 9 1; 9. 4 years; P = 0. 003) and had <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (3. 56 1; 0. 58 g/dL vs 3. 84 1; 0. 55 g/dL; P = 0. 012) and higher baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (8. 5 ng/mL vs 5. 4 ng/mL; P = 0. 035) compared to the non-HCC group. Nodule pattern and initial radiologic diagnosis also differed between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that age [P = 0. 012, odds ratio (OR) = 1. 075, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 016 - 1. 137], sex (P = 0. 009, OR = 3. 969, 95 % CI: 1. 403 - 11. 226), and baseline AFP level (P = 0. 024, OR = 1. 039, 95 % CI: 1. 005 - 1. 073) were independent risk factors for developing HCC. CONCLUSION: The overall risk of HCC development in patients with SCSNs is similar to that in liver cirrhosis patients.

40|$|AbstractGangrenous {{cholecystitis}} {{is difficult}} to diagnose clinically and carries risk {{of morbidity and mortality}} if not treated urgently. Complex scoring systems exist to predict the condition. C reactive protein may be a single independent predictor as suggested in this small study. BackgroundGangrenous cholecystitis (GC) is a serious sequel of acute cholecystitis occurring in 2 – 30 % patients and has a mortality of 0. 2 – 0. 5 %. Urgent surgical intervention is important to reduce morbidity and mortality therefore it is important to identify patients with GC from non-severe cholecystitis. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine biochemical and radiological markers, which is associated with the development GC and the value of C-reactive protein (CRP) at different cut-offs in predicting GC. MethodsThis is an observational cohort study of all consecutive patients who presented with biliary symptoms to the emergency department in a large NHS Hospital in the UK, from January to December 2012. They had cholecystectomies performed either during index admission or electively at later date by a team of 4 upper gastrointestinal surgeons. The gangrenous nature of the gallbladder was determined by operative findings and/or histopathology results. Parameters including age, gender, albumin, jaundice, gallbladder wall thickness on ultrasound scan, highest preoperative white blood count (WBC) and CRP value, were examined for their predictive value. Results 141 patients presented with acute biliary problems. 22 underwent emergency cholecystectomy and 119 were discharged and called back for elective surgery. Of these, 16 were gangrenous (11 %). Patients with GC were significantly older (p =  0. 016), had significantly higher CRP (p <  0. 001) and WBC (p =  0. 001), significantly <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (p <  0. 001) and higher percentage with thick walled gallbladder (p <  0. 001). We found that a CRP value of more than 200  mg/dL has a 50 % positive predictive value and 100 % negative predictive value in predicting gangrenous cholecystitis with 100 % sensitivity and 87. 9 % specificity. ConclusionsIn this study CRP on its own has been shown to have high predictive value in predicting GC, but larger studies are needed to validate this finding.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{mortality}} of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) has decreased 3. 5 % per decade {{in the last}} 50 years to a current rate of 40 %- 50 %. Reports have indicated that endovascular repair (EVAR) is feasible for rAAA and may offer potential benefits over open repair. We examined the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to compare 30 -day multicenter outcomes for EVAR vs open rAAA repair. MethodsPatients that underwent rAAA repair in the NSQIP database from 2005 to 2007 were identified {{through a combination of}} Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision (ICD- 9) diagnoses. Preoperative comorbidities, operative duration and transfusion, and 30 day outcomes were evaluated using t tests or Chi-squared tests depending on the variable. A separate multivariable regression was performed for each outcome adjusting for all independently predictive preoperative and intraoperative risk factors. ResultsA total of 427 patients were identified and 76. 8 % of patients underwent open repair. The open repair groups exhibited <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and higher percentage of patients with preoperative hematocrit (Hct) < 38 % and need for preoperative ventilation. The requirement for preoperative blood transfusion was similar. Patients undergoing open repair had much higher intraoperative transfusion requirements (11. 8 ± 8. 9 vs 4. 2 ± 6. 0 red blood cell units, P <. 001). After adjustment for preoperative mortality risk factors, the mortality risk was higher for open repair versus EVAR (odds ratio 1. 67, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 91 - 3. 05, P =. 096) but did not reach significance. After similar adjustment the composite morbidity odds ratio for open repair versus EVAR was 1. 82 (95 % CI 1. 11 - 2. 99, P =. 018) and the pulmonary adverse events odds ratio was 1. 99 (95 % CI 1. 22 - 3. 25, P =. 006). Risks for the other outcomes were not significant. ConclusionsComposite 30 -day morbidity risk is lower after EVAR vs open repair of rAAA. Open repair is associated with increased transfusion requirements. Performance of EVAR in rAAA patients with favorable anatomy could potentially result in improved outcome as compared with open repair...|$|E

However, little has been documented in the literature regarding the outcomes of HCC patients presenting with variceal bleeding. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of this specific group of patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database comprising 2, 928 HCC patients managed from January 1989 to December 2002 identified 78 patients who had presented with variceal bleeding. Their clinical outcomes were compared to those patients who did not present with variceal bleeding, and a multivariate analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for their survival. RESULTS: HCC patients who presented with variceal bleeding had more severe cirrhosis {{than those who did}} not, with a significantly higher serum bilirubin <b>level,</b> <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> <b>lower</b> platelet count, and longer prothrombin time. They had significantly smaller HCCs but more frequent portal vein thrombosis. There was {{a significant difference in the}} overall survival between HCC patients who presented with variceal bleeding and those who did not (median 3. 5 months vs 7. 5 months, p < 0. 001). In the variceal bleeding group, by multivariate analysis, treatment with transarterial chemoembolization was the only significant independent prognostic factor for survival (odds ratio 17. 16, 95 % CI: 2. 81 - 104. 91, p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: HCC patients who presented with variceal bleeding can be expected to have a significantly worse survival outcome than the general HCC patients. However, transarterial chemoembolization may offer some survival benefit to a selected group of HCC patients presenting with variceal bleeding. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recurrence or {{metastasis}} of {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} (HCC) is mainly intrahepatic after curative resection, demonstrating that the peritumoral environment is important but often neglected. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L 1) in intratumoral liver tissues {{is a poor}} prognosis factor whose impact is removed after curative resection. However, PD-L 1 expression remains in the peritumoral liver tissues and its distribution and prognostic value are still not clear. METHODS: We assessed the expression of PD-L 1 by immunohistochemistry in peritumoral liver tissues from 90 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. The results were validated in an independent cohort of additional 90 HCC patients. RESULTS: We found PD-L 1 positive expression in 31. 11 % (28 / 90) of peritumoral tissues. Peritumoral PD-L 1 expression {{was associated with a}} significantly worse overall survival (OS) (P = . 000) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = . 001) compared to the negative expression group. Additionally, peritumoral PD-L 1 positivity significantly correlated with vascular invasion and a <b>lower</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> (≤ 35 g/L). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models both revealed peritumoral PD-L 1 as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR =  2. 853, P = . 002) and DFS (HR =  2. 362, P = . 003). The prognostic value of PD-L 1 positivity was validated in the independent data set. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest PD-L 1 expression in peritumoral hepatocytes is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. This implies that future anti-cancer therapy should target not only residual tumor cells but also the “soil” for promoting tumor growth. Peritumoral PD-L 1 could be a good target for adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy...|$|R
