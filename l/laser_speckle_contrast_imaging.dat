Although <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> technology is well accepted as a noninvasive methodology for assessing microvascular endothelial function, {{it has never been}} used to compare male patients with coronary artery disease with male age-matched healthy controls. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> could be used to detect differences in the systemic microvascular functions of patients with established cardiovascular disease (n= 61) and healthy age-matched subjects (n= 24). Cutaneous blood flow was assessed in the skin of the forearm using <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> coupled with the transdermal iontophoretic delivery of acetylcholine and post-occlusive reactive hyperemia. The maximum increase in skin blood flow induced by acetylcholine was significantly reduced in the cardiovascular disease patients compared with the control subjects (74 vs 116 %; P< 0. 01). With regard to post-occlusive reactive hyperemia-induced vasodilation, the patients also presented reduced responses compared to the controls (0. 42 ± 0. 15 vs 0. 50 ± 0. 13 APU/mmHg; P= 0. 04). In conclusion, <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> can identify endothelial and microvascular dysfunctions in male individuals with cardiovascular disease.

RESULTS: Of the 1445 studies found in the first search, thirteen cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 857 subjects. Resting blood flow was similar between healthy control subjects and diabetes patients. In contrast, the microvascular response to local skin heating was reduced in diabetic patients compared to healthy control subjects [pooled effect of - 0. 78 standardised mean difference (95 % CI - 1. 06, - 0. 51) ]. This effect is considered large according to Cohen's effect size definition. The variability in effect size was high (heterogeneity 69 %, p < 0. 0001). However, subgroup analysis revealed no difference between the type and duration of diabetes and other health related factors, indicating that diabetes per se causes the microvascular dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis shows that diabetes is associated with a large reduction of dermal microvascular function in diabetic patients. The local thermal hyperaemia methodology may become a valuable non-invasive tool for diagnosis and assessing progress of diabetes-related microvascular complications, but standardisation of the technique and quality of study conduct is urgently required...|$|R

Emails with a link to the survey were sent to physicians from the European Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR), the EULAR Study Group on Microcirculation in Rheumatic Diseases (SG_MC/RD) and members of the pediatric rheumatology Email board. The main descriptive analysis related to physicians looking after adult patients, with some analysis also of opinions from paediatric rheumatologists. 106 'adult physicians' responded (a response rate of 25. 8 %), of whom 68. 9 % were European, and 81. 1 % practising for more than 10  years. Nineteen paediatricians responded. The most widely available technique was NVC (72. 7 %). Nailfold capillaroscopy was most frequently performed by the physician him/herself, using different types of equipment relating to availability. Most rheumatologists reported high levels of appropriateness for NVC in both clinical and research settings for global assessment and differential diagnosis of Rp. Other techniques were less used. Of all the different techniques, nailfold capillaroscopy was the one most used in both clinical and research settings by adult physicians, the majority of whom use NVC in their everyday practice.

40|$|International audienceLaser <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> (LSCI) is a full-field optical {{technique}} to monitor microvascular blood flow with high {{spatial and temporal}} resolutions. It is used in many medical fields such as dermatology, vascular medicine, or neurosciences. However, LSCI leads to {{a large amount of}} data: image sampling frequency is often of several Hz and recordings usually last several minutes. Therefore, clinicians often perform regions of interest in which a spatial averaging of blood flow is performed and the result is followed with time. Unfortunately, this leads to a poor spatial resolution for the analyzed data. At the same time, a higher spatial resolution for the perfusion maps is wanted. To get over this dilemma we propose a new post-acquisition visual representation for LSCI perfusion data using the so-called generalized differences (GD) algorithm. From a stack of perfusion images, the procedure leads to a new single image with the same spatial resolution as the original images and this new image reflects perfusion changes. The algorithm is herein applied on simulated stacks of images and on experimental LSCI perfusion data acquired in three different situations with a commercialized <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> imager.

40|$|The {{deterministic}} {{nature of}} scattering in turbid {{media and the}} advances in light control have opened the possibility of wavefront optimization to pre-compensate {{for the effects of}} multiple scattering. A major motivation for the development of new techniques is imaging and sensing in biological materials. These techniques have the potential to overcome tissue scattering, which usually limits the imaging depth to less than a millimeter. However, the dynamic nature of biological materials complicates the process exhibiting decorrelation times on the millisecond timescale. In this Thesis we investigate new techniques for high speed and blind imaging through complex media. We investigate the problem of optical non-invasively imaging through turbid media without the use of the so-called memory effect, namely allowing for thick and highly scattering obsta- cles. A photoacoustic signal, consisting of the integration of photoacoustic emissions from multiple speckle grains, is used as optimization feedback for focusing through such a scattering material. We demonstrate three-dimensional photoacoustic imaging behind a scattering material by scanning an absorbing object through the optimized focus. We also study the benefits of combining <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> and wavefront coding. We implement a <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging</b> system with extended depth of field for measuring flow rates in brain-mimicking microfluidic systems, resulting in more than a four-fold improvement in depth of field compared to traditional <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging.</b> Besides non-invasive techniques for imaging, we explore minimally invasive approaches using a single thin multimode fiber.

Materials and methods Using <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging,</b> cutaneous blood flow was assessed in the forearm at rest and during reactivity tests, including postocclusive reactive hyperemia and the iontophoresis of acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside with increasing currents of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 lA for 10 -s intervals spaced 1 min apart. Carotid intima–media thickness was evaluated using an ultrasound system and a 7. 5 MHz ultrasound transducer. Results The endothelium-dependent skin microvascular vasodilator responses that were induced by both acetylcholine and postocclusive reactive hyperemia were significantly reduced in patients with EOCAD compared with healthy individuals.

METHODS:: Blood perfusion in porcine eyelid flaps {{was measured using}} laser Doppler velocimetry and <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging,</b> whereas the tissue response was measured using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with a broad spectrum (450 – 1550 nm). Epinephrine was either injected cumulatively, 0. 1 (1 : 10, 000, 000), 1. 0 (1 : 1, 000, 000), 10 (1 : 100 000), and 100 μg/ml (1 : 10 000), to determine the dose–response relation, or given as a single dose (10 μg/ml). Control experiments were performed with saline or lidocaine. RESULTS:: Increasing concentrations of epinephrine resulted in a gradual decrease in tissue perfusion, measured by laser Doppler velocimetry and <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>imaging,</b> approaching a minimum after the injection of 10 μg/ml. Similar tissue response was observed with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The time from the injection of epinephrine (10 μg/ml) to the stabilization of hypoperfusion was 75 seconds.

Recent studies on combining ultrasound and light for biomedical imaging show new promises in improving imaging quality and/or providing complementary <b>imaging</b> <b>contrast.</b> Among {{a variety of}} the imaging modalities that simultaneously use ultrasound and light, this work focuses on optical detection of tissue responses to acoustic radiation force (ARF). The applications include optical shear wave elastography and ultrasound modulated optical tomography. The {{first half of the}} thesis provides a systematic study on tracking shear waves in optical turbid media using CCD-based <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> analysis. The theory, simulation and experiment are developed and cross-validated. The simulation quantitatively relates CCD <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> signal with shear waves, providing useful information to understand the underlying physics. In addition, multiple shear waves are tracked using <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> detection. Results show that two counter-propagating shear waves produce a modulation pattern in the optical signal, and the modulation pattern was suggested by simulation {{as a result of the}} dual shear wave interference. Shear wave speed measurements in phantoms suggest that the dual shear wave approach is more accurate than the single shear wave approach as that the standard deviation of the speed measurement is reduced by a factor of at least 2. The the dual shear wave approach also provides a reduced boundary effect. Both factors suggest that the dual shear wave approach should improve the accuracy of elasticity measurements. In the second half of the thesis, instead of detecting ARF response in the late phase, the study is motivated by detecting ARF response in the early stage for enhancement of ultrasound modulation of light. A pilot study on incorporating perfluorocarbon-based phase change contrast agent with ultrasound modulated optical tomography is explored. To understand the phase transition process, a quantitative measurement of acoustic nanodroplet vapourisation is developed. A preliminary result also showed that a single ultrasound burst can simultaneously vaporise the nanodroplets and sonify the converted microbubbles to provide additional ultrasound modulation of light. This additional light modulation was shown to increase the <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> signal detected on a CCD camera. Open Acces...|$|R

The experimental {{as well as the}} numerical (Monte-Carlo simulation) studies are carried out. In this an intense acoustic burst of ultrasound (an acoustic pulse with high power within standard safety limits), instead of continuous wave, is employed to induce large modulation of the tissue materials in the ultrasound insonified region of interest (ROI) and it results to enhance the strength of the ultrasound modulated optical signal in ultrasound modulated optical tomography (UMOT) system. The intensity fluctuation of speckle patterns formed by interference of light scattered (while traversing through tissue medium) is characterized by the motion of scattering sites. The displacement of scattering particles is inversely related to the elastic property of the tissue. We study the feasibility of <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> analysis (LSCA) technique to reconstruct a map of the elastic property of a soft tissue-mimicking phantom. We employ source synchronized parallel speckle detection scheme to (experimentally) measure the <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> from the light traversing through ultrasound (US) insonified tissue-mimicking phantom. The measured relative image contrast (the ratio of the difference of the maximum and the minimum values to the maximum value) for intense acoustic burst is 86. 44 % in comparison to 67. 28 % for continuous wave excitation of ultrasound. We also present 1 -D and 2 -D image of <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> which is the representative of elastic property distribution...|$|R

The pattern of the vascular blood flow can be used to study the spatiotemporal activities of the somatosensory center and the diagnosis of the focal stroke or ischemia. In this present study, temporal <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> analysis is used to obtain the cortical blood flow information. By centerline modeling method based on ridge tracking, we extracted the cortical vessels. By fusing with the <b>laser</b> <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> results, we obtained the image of the cortical vascular blood flow pattern in which both the vessels and the blood velocity can be visualized.
