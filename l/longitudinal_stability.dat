5|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to re-engine the aircraft {{with the engine}} it was originally designed for, the Mikulin AM-37. This was designated the MiG-7, and one MiG-3 was converted to evaluate the engine in May 1941. It proved to have poor <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> and the powerplant itself still {{had a number of}} problems. The German invasion the following month caused the cancellation of the development of the AM-37 as Mikulin's resources were required for the AM-35 and AM-38 engines already in production.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} steady rolling on the <b>longitudinal</b> and {{directional}} <b>stability</b> of aircraft {{have been studied}} theoretically. Simplifying assumptions have been made {{with regard to the}} longitudinal and lateral motions of the airplane in order to obtain a solution which shows the principal effects of the rolling motion. Rolling has been found, to cause instability if the directional and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stabilities</b> are different when the rolling frequency exceeds the lower of the pitching and yawing natural frequencies of the nonrolling airplane. This instability lasts only during the time the airplane is rolling and would not, therefore, affect the normal flight of an airplane. In the case of airplanes of short span and high density, carrying most of their weight in their fuselages, and flying at hlgh altitudes, this instability might cause dangerous attitude changes during rapid rolls. If the directional and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stabilities</b> are about equal, the instability due to rolling will not occur. If the rate of roll exceeds both the pitching and yawing natural frequencies of the nonrolllng aircraft, the aircraft will be stable. A continuously rolling aircraft will be stable in this case even when the no__rolllng aircraft has a certain amount of instability about one axis. Applications of these conclusions to rolling airplanes and missiles are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The first XFR-1 {{made its}} first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine, but that was {{installed}} shortly afterward. The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944. Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> because {{the center of gravity}} had been miscalculated. In addition, the circular rear fuselage of the FR-1 gave less stability than the slab-style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that was used {{as a model for the}} stability calculations. A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal stabilizers was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes. The original Douglas double-slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing, but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single-slotted flap.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability,</b> the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} center {{plays an important}} role in analysis of the <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> of all flying machines. [...] It is desirable that when the pitch angle and angle of attack of an aircraft are disturbed (by, for example turbulence) that the aircraft returns to its original trimmed pitch angle and angle of attack without a pilot or autopilot changing the control surface deflection. For an aircraft to return towards its trimmed attitude, without input from a pilot or autopilot, it must have positive <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} center is the conceptual {{starting point for}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability.</b> The horizontal stabilizer contributes extra stability and this allows {{the center of gravity}} to be a small distance aft of the {{aerodynamic center}} without the aircraft reaching neutral stability. The position of the center of gravity at which the aircraft has neutral stability is called the neutral point.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a twin engine conventional geared mid-winged monoplane. Its primary feature was its corrugated metal construction, {{a new technique}} and different from the tube-and-fabric airplanes of the time. In addition, the internally supported cantilever wing developed for the Stout Batwing was employed. The {{aircraft was}} test flown successfully, however,the airplane showed signs of inadequate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E
25|$|American's {{engineers}} reworked {{the wing}} to a non-folding design, easing FAR Part 23 certification. Other changes included adding extended wing tips to improve rate-of-climb, an anti-servo tab {{on the elevator}} along with a centering spring system to increase <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> and stall strips to improve handling during a stall. The company designated the redesigned aircraft the AA-1 Yankee Clipper.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{population}} structured {{genetic algorithm}} (sGA) with embedded potential flow vortex ring panel method (VRM) {{has been developed}} to minimise induced and parasitic drag subject to constraints on lift, root bending moment, and <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability.</b> The optimisation architecture can activate up to four independent wing segments allowing up to 28 design variables. Minimum drag of wing tip extensions and winglet configurations are compared using the non-linear stochastic optimisation method. The optimiser identified joined box wings as offering the greatest induced efficiency followed by C-wings. With span and root bending moment constraints winglets offered best total drag reduction. C-wings are further investigated for potential to enhance <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> performance by staggering the horizontal extension of the winglet to balance moments around the wing’s centre of gravity. Preliminary results suggest that while <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> can be reached {{it would be very}} poor. Inclusion of more design constraints and additional analysis of the structural dynamics of C-wings, especially effecting the torsional mode, is necessary...|$|R

25|$|The {{performance}} of the An-10 and An-10A was relatively good and was shown to have lower seat/mile cost than the contemporary Tupolev Tu-104 jet airliner, but continued to exhibit control and stability problems, culminating in a fatal crash on 16 November 1959 when CCCP-11167 dived into the ground while on approach to L'vov airport, due to reduced stability, abrupt nose drops at low airspeed and reduced elevator authority at low airspeed. On 26 February 1960, again at L'vov, CCCP-11180 crashed at the same location due to reduced <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> and control authority caused by icing of the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact number}} of prototypes built is not clear, some sources say three, {{but at least}} two {{appear to have been}} built, based on {{photographic}} evidence. The prototype was first flown in 1945 and the engine's torque, coupled with the short rear fuselage, resulted in poor <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> characteristics. To correct the problem the second prototype had the rear fuselage lengthened , the area of the vertical tail was increased and the rudder was given a trim tab. These changes were successful in improving the aircraft's flight characteristics, but the engine proved troublesome and prolonged flight testing into 1946. Its problems proved intractable and the program was canceled in the summer of 1946.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study is}} carried out {{of the behavior of}} modern high-speed aircraft of inertially slender configurations in maneuvers involving large rates of roll. Inertia cross-coupling, as well as a linear variation of <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> (C/m-alpha/) with angle of attack, are considered. The steady-state solutions of the nonlinear equations of motion, based on principal inertia axes, are studied to obtain useful information on the response behavior of the state variables during roll maneuvers. It is shown that, in addition to the critical values of aileron deflection that have been previously found to limit a steady-state roll with constant <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability,</b> there can be two new critical values introduced by a linear decrease of the absolute value of <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> with angle of attack. For aileron deflections near these critical values, the response of the aircraft exhibits violent oscillations and dangerous peak loads, due to the cross-coupled motion accompanying a roll maneuver. These critical values define a new range of aileron deflections in which no steady-state roll is possible...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{estimation}} of aerodynamic derivatives from steady-state symmetric flight data is developed. The derivatives considered are the <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> and control derivatives, damping derivatives due to tail, and the derivatives expressing the speed effect on the lift and pitching moment coefficients. The method {{is an extension of}} the well known theory of <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> and control, and corresponding flight data interpretation. Measured data is assumed in the form of trim curves and lift vs angle of attack. The expressions for the derivative estimates are in the form of algebraic relationships containing known constants, and directly or indirectly measured quantities...|$|R
40|$|Observers {{have always}} been fascinated by soaring birds. An {{interesting}} feature of these birds is the existence of few feathers extending {{from the tip of}} the wing. In this paper, small lifting surfaces were fitted to the tip of a NACA 0012 wing in a fashion similar to that of wing tip feathers. Experimental measurements of induced drag, <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability</b> and trailing vortex structure were obtained. The tests showed that adding wing tip surfaces (sails) decreased the induced drag factor and increased the <b>longitudinal</b> static <b>stability.</b> Results identified two discrete appositely rotated tip vortices and showed the ability of wing tip surfaces to break them down and to diffuse them...|$|R
25|$|The D.8 was a {{tailless}} four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its constant chord wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming fixed side curtains that provided directional (yaw) stability. Wing tip elevons were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the side curtains allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|E
25|$|The Yankee was {{originally}} designed to minimize the number of airframe parts used, {{with the aim of}} simplifying production and saving money. As a result of this philosophy many parts were interchangeable. Due to the use of a non-tapered tubular spar, which doubled as the fuel tank, and the lack of wing washout, the wings could be exchanged left and right. The fin and horizontal stabilizers were interchangeable, as were the rudder and the elevators. The ailerons and flaps were similarly the same part. While it did succeed in making production easier, this design philosophy produced many aerodynamic compromises in the design. For instance, because the flaps were the same part as the ailerons they were too small to be effective as flaps. The lack of wing washout, necessitated by the wing interchangeability requirement, meant that stall strips had to be installed to produce acceptable stall characteristics for certification. Over time this philosophy of compromising the aerodynamics in favour of a minimized parts count was abandoned. For example, the redesign of the AA-1B into the AA-1C by Gulfstream involved wider-span elevators and horizontal stabilizers that produced better <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability,</b> but were no longer interchangeable with the rudder and fin.|$|E
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E

But the trials revealed a number of serious defects, including inadequate visibility when taxiing, poor-quality plexiglas in the canopy obscuring the pilot's view, heavy controls, poor <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability,</b> difficulty in opening the canopy, an excessively hot cockpit and a [...] "dangerous propensity to flick from a simple stall into a spin from which {{it was almost impossible}} to recover".|$|E
