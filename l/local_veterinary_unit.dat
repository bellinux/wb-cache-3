40|$|Bovine rabies remains endemic in Brazil {{and despite}} control efforts, the disease still spreads insidiously. The main vector is the hematophagous bat, Desmodus rotundus. The present work aimed {{to create a}} {{predictive}} qualitative model of the occurrence of bovine rabies in each municipality in 25 of the 27 Brazilian States. The risk of rabies transmission from bats to bovine was estimated using decision-tree models of receptivity and vulnerability. Questionnaires, which covered {{a number of questions}} related to the surveillance of possible risk factors, such as bovine rabies outbreaks in the previous year, the presence of bat roosts, bat rabies positivity and environmental changes, were sent to the <b>local</b> <b>veterinary</b> <b>units</b> of each State. The bovine density and geomorphologic features were obtained from national databases and geographic information systems. Of the 433 municipalities presenting bovine rabies outbreaks in 2010, 178 (41. 1 %) were classified by the model as high risk, 212 (49. 0 %) were classified as moderate risk, 25 (5. 8 %) were classified as low risk, whereas the risk was undetermined in 18 municipalities (4. 1 %). An ROC curve was built to determine if the risk evaluated by the model could adequately discriminate between municipalities with and without rabies occurrence in future years. The risk estimator for the year 2011 was classified as moderately accurate. In the future, these models could allow the targeting of rabies control efforts, with the adoption of control measures directed to the higher risk locations and the optimization of the field veterinary staff deployment throughout the country. Additionally, efforts must be made to encourage continuous surveillance of risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Protozoa of {{the genus}} Sarcocystis {{are among the most}} {{prevalent}} parasitic forms found in pork. In order to rapidly assess the risk that this protozoa produceÂ  in human population, a molecular method to detect and identify Sarcocystis suihominis needs to be implemented. The study aimed at characterizing the prevalence of Sarcocystis suihominis in pork obtained in the traditional households through PCR - RFLP method. The material was represented by seventy nine samples of diaphragmatic pillars collected between the periodÂ  October 2014 - December 2014 from two <b>local</b> sanitary <b>veterinary</b> <b>units</b> from Alba and Cluj. The samples were processed first by trichinelloscopic compression method. All the positive fragments for Sarcocystis spp. were examined through PCR-RFLP method. The method {{used in the present study}} utilized the AluI restriction enzyme and had successfully differentiate the Sarcocystis suihominis from other Sarcocystis spp. prevalent in pork meat. Â  The inspection of compressed muscle tissue has detected the presence of Sarcocystis suihominis in a high percentage of investigated samples. The prevalence of Sarcocystis suihominis in the examined samples was 26. 58 %. According to this result we can affirm that the risk of contamination in humans with Sarcocystis suihominis is high through consumption of contaminated pork meat, raised in the traditional system. In the present scientific research, we demonstrated that this method used for molecular identification of Sarcocystis suihominis has high accuracy and can be successfully applied for obtaining a certain diagnostic...|$|R

40|$|Case summary An {{approximately}} 3 -year-old, male domestic longhair cat {{was presented}} to a mobile <b>veterinary</b> <b>unit</b> for routine neuter. Preoperative physical examination revealed an approximately 5 cm × 2 cm scab on the craniolateral portion of the left antebrachium. The cat was anesthetized for the neuter using an injectable anesthesia protocol. After castration, the wound area on the antebrachium was clipped, copiously lavaged and the wound edges were surgically debrided. Injectable antibiotics and analgesic management were instituted. The wound was conservatively managed using sugar bandaging and antibiotic dressings until the progression of healing plateaued. Procedures for closing the defect were explored, and {{it was decided that}} a single-pedicle hinge flap would be ideal. The procedure was performed on the mobile <b>veterinary</b> <b>unit</b> and managed postoperatively with pain control and biweekly bandage changes. After 3 weeks, the single-pedicle hinge flap was released to create a skin graft, which successfully filled the defect. Relevance and novel information Single-pedicle hinge flaps performed in feline patients have been minimally reported. This case report serves to provide detailed information on the surgical procedure and aftercare required for a successful outcome. Furthermore, this procedure was performed by a shelter medicine team in a mobile <b>veterinary</b> <b>unit</b> with no specialty equipment or instruments. This report documents an alternative procedure that may be used in a shelter environment for distal forelimb wounds rather than amputation or euthanasia...|$|R

40|$|To allow {{students}} to reach the full potential of the three-ring agriculture education model, students must excel in all three categories: FFA (formally Future Farmers of America), Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) and the classroom/laboratory.

To tie these two to the classroom/laboratory component, the current companion animal care curriculum required addition of veterinary science standards.

Students will be well prepared for the veterinary science contest, volunteering at the <b>local</b> <b>veterinary</b> clinics and to further their education at the university level...|$|R
