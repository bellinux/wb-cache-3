5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} <b>lopsided</b> victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted outcome was a <b>lopsided</b> victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead {{at the end of the}} half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short field goal with 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E
5|$|Despite a <b>lopsided</b> {{start in}} the early 20th century, the Terps and Midshipmen were evenly matched {{for most of the}} history of the series. Between 1931 and 1965, Navy won six and Maryland five games. In the 2005 season opener, Navy was coming off one of its best seasons in history with a 10–2 record the {{previous}} year. Maryland struggled later in 2005, but proved a competitive match for Navy and achieved a last-minute win, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|FBS {{teams are}} allowed to {{schedule}} FCS teams, and one win against an FCS team can be counted towards their bowl-eligible status provided the FCS team meets certain scholarship requirements. FCS teams are often paid upwards of USD $500,000 for participating in games against FBS teams. This arrangement generally results in <b>lopsided</b> losses for FCS teams, but the money FCS schools earn from games against FBS teams helps fund their athletic departments, as well as offering broader exposure for their athletic programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Germany in May 1945 {{was followed}} by a rapid rundown of Coastal Command with the immediate disbandment of combat units and the transfer of aircraft to the RAF Transport Command. Commonwealth personnel were also sent home and the powerful Bristol Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito wings were reduced. The Command still maintained strong air-sea-rescue ASR and reconnaissance forces but its ASW was <b>lopsided.</b> With a few exceptions, only a handful of squadrons with ASW aircraft remained by January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a <b>lopsided</b> victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a {{detailed}} list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} opening their attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a <b>lopsided</b> victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly <b>lopsided</b> hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|Considering the <b>lopsided</b> {{score of}} the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen {{question}} why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and {{did not belong to}} any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D. Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, {{it may have been the}} political connections that Joe Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time, Clifford Sifton, that got Dawson City the series.|$|E
5|$|Heisman {{challenged}} Pop Warner's undefeated Pittsburgh team to {{a decisive}} national championship game, but he declined. In the next season of 1918, Tech lost a <b>lopsided</b> game to Pitt 320. Center Bum Day became the first player from the south selected for Walter Camp's first team. In 1919, Auburn upset Tech for the SIAA crown. By 1919, Heisman had divorced his wife and felt that he would embarrass his wife socially if he remained in Atlanta. Heisman moved to Pennsylvania, leaving Tech {{in the hands of}} William Alexander.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Mets won the National League Championship Series {{for their}} fifth pennant while the Phillies entered a rebuild phase. The Mets beat the Phillies 14 times and lost 5 for a <b>lopsided</b> season series. The season still {{provided}} contentious moments such as, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilling Phillies 2nd baseman Chase Utley {{in retaliation for}} Mets players getting hit by Phillies pitchers, a benches clearing argument between Phillies coach Larry Bowa in regards to a quick pitch by Hansel Robles and a bat flip by Daniel Murphy. Phillies star Chase Utley while, traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers mid-season, injured Mets shortstop Rubén Tejada on a legal slide during Game 2 of the National League Division Series.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss. Goss criticized Patton for announcing that, if elected, he would seek the governor's {{office at the}} {{expiration}} of his term. Goss insisted {{that he would not}} seek the governorship if elected, and maintained that using the lieutenant governor's post as a stepping stone to the governor's office was a betrayal of the office and its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to a <b>lopsided</b> victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a <b>lopsided</b> victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E
5|$|On September 23 at Giants Stadium, before 76,483 fans, the Giants met the Miami Dolphins for {{the first}} time since the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season. Miami held the ball for only 19:42, and totaled only 158yards of offense. The Giants' offense set the tone by holding the ball for 10:25 on the opening drive, leading to a field goal by Raul Allegre. Holding Dan Marino to 119 total yards, and 3.6yards per passing attempt, the Giants prevailed by a score of 20–3. Parcells was criticized by the local media for playing Taylor in the final moments, despite the <b>lopsided</b> score, after he had injured his hamstring.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year at Fenway Park, the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 22–1, handing Boston its most <b>lopsided</b> home loss ever. The Yankees scored 16 total {{runs in the}} 8th and 9th innings. The Yankees lost 15 of their final 18 games that season and finished {{with a record of}} 87–74, but the Red Sox failed to catch up and finished 2.5 games out of first to lose another division title to the Yankees. Despite having the lowest winning percentage of any postseason qualifier in 2000, the Yankees won their third consecutive World Series and 26th overall, in the first Subway Series since 1956, over their cross-town rivals, the New York Mets, in 5 games.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lopsided</b> victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren {{entered the}} game in the thirdquarter, {{replacing}} Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the midpoint of the fourthquarter. Since Colt McCoy was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005season, choosing to redshirt him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, Jevan Snead – ranked {{as one of the top}} high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from University of Florida to Texas.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most <b>lopsided</b> of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass. This may be because Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E
5|$|This {{match and}} the other <b>lopsided</b> {{victories}} in the qualification partially contributed towards the reintroduction of a preliminary round for smaller teams in the qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, {{in order to avoid}} these one-sided matches. The significant gap between the two top teams, Australia and New Zealand, {{and the rest of the}} teams in the Oceanian zone was one of the reasons behind Australia leaving the Oceania Football Confederation at the end of 2006 to join Asian Football Confederation in order to increase the competitiveness. Starting in the 2010 World Cup qualification, Australia participated in the Asian zone qualification rounds.|$|E
5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second half. Their defense (led by game MVP Ray Lewis) frustrated Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins turning {{in one of the}} worst playoff performances in Super Bowl history. Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} <b>lopsided</b> Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score came on a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown. On the very next kickoff, the Ravens countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable game of Heisman's career was the most <b>lopsided</b> victory in college {{football}} history. In 1916, Cumberland College ended its football program and attempted to cancel a scheduled game with Heisman's Jackets. Heisman, however, was seeking vengeance for a 22–0 baseball loss to Cumberland {{in the spring of}} 1916, a game in which Heisman suspected Cumberland of hiring professional players to pose as Cumberland students. Heisman refused the game's cancellation and Cumberland mustered up a group of commonfolk to play Tech. Tech won 222–0. Neither team achieved a first down other than a touchdown, as Cumberland either punted or turned the ball over before a first down and Tech scored on almost every play from scrimmage. Jim Preas, Tech's kicker, kicked 16 point after tries, which is still a record for a single game.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had {{the distinction of being}} the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly <b>lopsided</b> head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} with Pittsburgh, he was the subject of trade rumours. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette listed the Edmonton Oilers as the most likely candidate to deal for Näslund. However, on 20 March 1996, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for forward Alek Stojanov. The deal would be {{regarded as one of the}} most <b>lopsided</b> trades in NHL history once Näslund displayed his full offensive capabilities later in his career. Stojanov, who had been drafted eight spots ahead of Näslund in the 1991 Draft, went on to play 45 games, scoring two goals and four assists for the Penguins over the next two seasons. He became a career minor-leaguer and retired by age 29, while Näslund would eventually play 884 games with the Canucks in 12 seasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Auburn's Moon Ducote {{broke through the}} line toward the goal with {{blocking}} by Pete Bonner and William Donahue. After Guyon dove at Ducote and missed, Guyon gave chase and tackled him at the 26-yard line. For Auburn's only score Ducote circled around end for 17 yards and lateraled to Donahue, who ran down the sideline for a six-yard touchdown. Guyon was {{the star of the}} game, accounting for four touchdowns and having his best day passing. Strupper had touchdown runs of 62 and 50 yards. Auburn was considered a strong team, despite the <b>lopsided</b> score; Ducote and Bonner were the only non-Tech, unanimous All-Southern selections. Tech's starting lineup was Fincher (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Mathes (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Carpenter (right tackle), Bell (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Guill (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Joseph Conrad Étienne Dion (August 11, 1918 – November 7, 2014) was a {{professional}} ice hockey player who played two seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings. One of thirteen children, Dion got his start as a goaltender with the Junior Verdun Maple Leafs in 1937 and had his first full season as a senior with the team the following year. After several seasons in the Quebec Senior and Professional Hockey Leagues, he was recruited by the Red Wings in 1943 as a potential replacement for Johnny Mowers, who had enlisted to fight in World War II. He spent two years with the team, earning a win-loss-tie record of 23–11–4 and {{taking part in the}} most <b>lopsided</b> shutout (15–0) in NHL history as the goalie for the winning side.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1832, the militiamen {{caught up}} with the British Band near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen. The battle was a <b>lopsided</b> victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors. Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, {{including}} many women and children, to escape across the river. Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won every}} {{game in the}} 1948 season, a feat that went {{unmatched}} until the Miami Dolphins (coached by Brown disciple Don Shula) did it in 1972. Cleveland then won the AAFC championship {{for the fourth time}} in a row in 1949. By then, however, the league was struggling for survival, {{due in part to the}} Browns' dominance. Attendance at games dwindled in 1948 and 1949 as fans lost interest in <b>lopsided</b> victories, and at the end of the 1949 season the AAFC dissolved. Three of its teams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Baltimore Colts and the Browns, merged into the NFL. The Browns picked up a few good former AAFC players from other teams, including offensive guard Abe Gibron and defensive end Len Ford, but some observers saw Brown's team as the lone standout in an otherwise minor league.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{like many}} {{previous}} meetings {{between the two}} teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers {{got off to a}} quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter. Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But Stephen Jackson's back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away. Despite the <b>lopsided</b> score {{near the end of the}} game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a <b>lopsided</b> look.|$|E
5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These <b>lopsided</b> representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{originally}} believed Fay to {{have only}} briefly been a hurricane, but post-season reanalysis revealed that the system had actually strengthened into a Category1 hurricane by early on October12 and maintained that strength for 12 hours. The upgrade was confirmed by buoy and land observations and weather radar data. At 08:10UTC, the cyclone made landfall on Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), the hurricane's peak intensity. Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since Emily in 1987. Its satellite presentation improved as a mid-level eye feature formed, though the system remained <b>lopsided.</b> Fay then accelerated toward the east-northeast ahead of a shortwave trough to the north, which also acted to further enhance shear in the area. The hurricane finally succumbed to the persistent wind shear when the low-level center decoupled from the mid-level low and became elongated. By {{the early morning hours}} of October13, Fay started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone as it entered a baroclinic environment and ingested colder, drier air. The circulation rapidly deteriorated; consequently, the NHC issued its last operational advisory on the system at 21:00UTC on October12. Early the following day, the storm degenerated into an open trough, ending its existence as a tropical cyclone. Shortly after, the system became reestablished as a frontal cyclone, which lost its definition over the northeastern Atlantic on October 15.|$|E
5|$|Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer played {{each other}} on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt {{dominated}} Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a <b>lopsided</b> encounter in which Federer scored a bagel {{on both sides of}} a second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.|$|E
5|$|Miller Huggins, {{who served}} as the Yankees' manager through 1929, had {{attempted}} to acquire Ruffing from the Red Sox for the last couple years of his Yankees' tenure. When Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield, Huggins told him he should continue as a pitcher. Bob Shawkey, a former pitcher who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930, had convinced Ed Barrow, the Yankees' general manager, to acquire Ruffing. Shawkey believed he could change Ruffing's approach to pitching to obtain better results. Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery, so that Ruffing used his body more. This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later innings of the game. The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned {{as one of the most}} <b>lopsided</b> trades in baseball history; Durst was a reserve outfielder who always batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used. The 1930 season proved to be Durst's worst year in the majors. Ruffing had a 0–3 record with the Red Sox before the trade. He won 15 games for the Yankees after the trade, losing only five games.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) over the Gulf of Mexico and {{northern}} Yucatán Peninsula on June1. The TWO indicated {{the probability of}} the development of a low pressure area, which would have a 20% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next five days. By June3, a concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms developed in the western Caribbean Sea, resulting in an increasing probability of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. Despite land interaction with the Yucatán Peninsula and unfavorably strong wind shear, the system reached an 80% chance of developing in the next 48hours by early on June5. It then moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, but continued to organize. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the system developed a well-defined circulation, according to surface data and satellite imagery. Thus, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Three at 15:00UTC on June5, while located about 20mi (30km) north of Río Lagartos, Yucatán. The northward-moving depression was <b>lopsided,</b> with the circulation being well to the west of an elongated band of deep convection.|$|E
5|$|The game retains some {{platforming}} traits; {{the player}} may disembark {{from a vehicle}} and explore the environment {{in a manner similar}} to that of the previous games. On foot the duo can grab ledges, swim underwater, balance on tightropes and perform basic jumps. Kazooie's spanner can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle, in addition to levitating <b>lopsided</b> vehicles. Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first, but the duo can upgrade their speed, stamina and strength by visiting Boggy's gym in the game's hub world. Scattered around the game's six worlds are musical notes, which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as blueprints, parts, and access to advanced vehicles. Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour; gold, silver or bronze. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live. In addition, players can share their own vehicle designs and blueprints online.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} <b>lopsided</b> from the start. In {{the top of}} the first inning, Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single. Alexander {{encountered}} a minor setback in the fourth inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a triple into left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut down the Yankees {{for the rest of the}} inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3–1 lead. In {{the top of the}} fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was successful in advancing Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Dion, {{after being}} {{discharged}} from the army, was among those selected to help replace Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Johnny Mowers of the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings, who had enlisted in the army to fight in World War II. He played a total of 38 NHL games with the Red Wings between 1943 and 1945, exiting the league {{with a record of}} 23–11–4 and having allowed 119 goals. He recorded a 15–0 shutout against the New York Rangers on January 23, 1944, two days before being {{signed as a free agent}} with Detroit. This remains, as of 2015, the most <b>lopsided</b> shutout in NHL history. He also took part in all five of Detroit's games in the 1944 Stanley Cup playoffs, where the Red Wings were eliminated four games to one in the opening round by the eventual runner-up, the Chicago Black Hawks. Dion spent much of the 1944–45 season, meanwhile, with the Red Wings' AHL affiliate Indianapolis Capitals. In August 1945, after the Red Wings decided to replace Mowers permanently with Harry Lumley, Dion was traded to the St. Louis Flyers of the AHL, and then to the league's Buffalo Bisons just over two months later. He remained with the Bisons through 1951 and won the Harry Hap Holmes Memorial Award in 1950, given annually to goaltenders with the lowest goals-against average in the AHL. He was also selected to the league's Second All-Star Team three times.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland area showered {{support on}} the Browns from the outset. Meanwhile, the Browns {{unexpectedly}} had Cleveland to themselves; the NFL's Cleveland Rams, who had continually lost money despite winning the 1945 NFL championship, moved to Los Angeles after that season. The Browns' on-field feats only amplified their popularity, and the team saw average attendance of 57,000 per game in its first season. The Browns, however, became victims of their own success. Cleveland's dominance exposed a lack of balance among AAFC teams, which the league tried to correct by sending Browns players including quarterback Y. A. Tittle to the Baltimore Colts in 1948. Attendance at Browns games fell in later years as fans lost interest in <b>lopsided</b> victories, while attendance for less successful teams fell even more precipitously. The Browns led all of football during the undefeated season in 1948 with an average crowd of 45,517, but {{that was more than}} 10,000 less than the average per game the previous year. These factors – combined with a war for players between the two leagues that raised salaries and ate into owners' profits – ultimately led to the dissolution of the AAFC and the merger of three of its teams, including the Browns, into the NFL in 1949. The NFL does not acknowledge AAFC statistics and records because these achievements – including the Browns' perfect season – did not take place in the NFL or against NFL teams, and not in a league fully absorbed by the NFL.|$|E
