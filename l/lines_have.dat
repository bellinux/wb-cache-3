5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and Hammersmith & City <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{the winner}} of the contest is decided by 50% televote and 50% {{national}} jury vote. The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting. Between 2003 and 2005 viewers had around 10 minutes to vote after all the songs had been performed. Between 2006 and 2010 the televoting <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been open throughout the programme. Since 2011 viewers vote after all the songs had been performed. Profits made from the televoting during the 2007 and 2008 contests were donated to UNICEF.|$|E

5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines uses an automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony. The Titanomachy could {{have picked up}} elements of western Anatolian folk memory, as the tale spread westward. Hesiod's <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus's thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as a breach of the magma chamber, immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been tried, {{with the outcome}} varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E

5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E
5|$|In Northland, C.australis shows a {{great deal}} of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> endured. Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which {{botanist}} Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with C.pumilio, the dwarf cabbage tree. In eastern Northland, C.australis generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, C.obtecta, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These obtecta-like characteristics appear in populations of C.australis along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called tītī grows. When young, tītī are generally very spindly, and are common in young kauri forests. When growing in the open, tītī can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
50|$|Spherical {{geometry}} is not elliptic geometry, but {{is rather}} {{a subset of}} elliptic geometry.

In both cases, Burger King prominently used the names of the Kraft products, A1 Steak Sauce and Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce, in the names of the sandwiches. Kraft has supplied several of Burger King's children's products, including a Jell-O brand dessert during BK's Teletubbies promotion in 1999, and the Kraft macaroni and cheese used in its lower-fat kid's meals introduced in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Most major {{shipping}} <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> {{a permanent}} {{presence in the}} region with some combination of sales, distribution, and/or logistical offices, many of which are located in Norfolk. In addition, many of the largest international shipping companies have chosen Norfolk as their North American headquarters. These companies are either located at the Norfolk World Trade Center building or have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center office park. The French firm CMA CGM, the Israeli firm Zim Integrated Shipping Services, and Maersk Line Limited, a subsidiary of the world's largest shipping line, A. P. Moller-Maersk Group, have their North American headquarters in Norfolk. Major companies headquartered in Norfolk include Norfolk Southern, Landmark Communications, Dominion Enterprises, FHC Health Systems (parent company of ValueOptions), Portfolio Recovery Associates, and BlackHawk Products Group.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the system}} have been {{upgraded}} from light rail to metro standard. The Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines were converted in 1966, when the first sections of new metro line were opened. The Sognsvann and Røa Lines, {{as well as the}} western part of the Common Tunnel, were upgraded in 1993 and 1995. The Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines were upgraded and subsequently re-opened in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Following the upgrade, all T1000 stock can be retired and replaced by the new MX3000 trains. The Grorud and Lambertseter Lines serve the Groruddalen valley while the Østensjø and Lambertseter Line serve the southern areas of Nordstrand. These four <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> the highest ridership. In the west, the Kolsås, Røa, Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Lines serves less densely populated areas. The Ring Line serves the northern borough of Nordre Aker, while the Common Tunnel serves the city center.|$|E

5|$|The Grorud and Furuset Line head {{northeast}} into Groruddalen, {{while the}} other two eastern branches head south into Nordstrand. On the west side, the Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Line cover the northern boroughs of Oslo, along with the Ring Line that connects the northeastern and northwestern parts of town. The Kolsås and Røa Line reach deep into the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. All the lines run through the Common Tunnel before reaching out to different lines, or into the Ring. All <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> a base service of four trains per hour while line 2 and the eastern section of line 3 have eight trains per hour weekdays 7–19. The eastern section of line 2 also has eight trains per hour Saturdays 10–19. A reduced half-hourly service operates on all lines during early weekend mornings. Trains run from about 05:00 (06:00 at weekends) to 01:00 the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Marshlink Action Group is a {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 {{in the interests of}} passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all connecting <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> been electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains are now at capacity but there is no additional stock because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D.
