50|$|Nitrogen is {{essential}} for algal growth. Within a cell, nitrogen is involved in synthesizing amino acids, nucleic acids, chlorophyll, and other nitrogen-containing organic compounds. In a study in which 30 different microalgal strains were screened, one Nannochloropsis strain was shown to obtain 60% lipid content after nitrogen deprivation, up from 30% under normal growth conditions. This strain was selected for further scale-up experiments in a photobioreactor under natural sunlight. Lipid productivity increased to 204 milligram per liter per day(mg/L/day) under nitrogen starvation conditions, almost {{twice as much as}} the 117 mg/L/day under sufficient nutrition conditions. Based on these results, a two-phase cultivation process, with a nutrient sufficient phase to rapidly increase number of cells prior to a nitrogen deprived phase to boost <b>lipid</b> <b>content,</b> <b>was</b> found to produce more than 90 kg of lipid per hectare per day in outdoor cultures.

Information {{regarding}} hepatic function during total {{parenteral nutrition}} in rats is often extrapolated to the clinical situation, but the steatosis observed in that species may simply reflect choline deficiency and be irrelevant to man. The effect of choline supplementation on hepatic lipid content and triglyceride secretion was examined in parenterally fed rats.

40|$|Recently, several {{strains of}} microalgae {{have been studied}} as they contain high lipid content capable to be {{converted}} to biodiesel.

Factors responsible for good growing of microalgae such as CO 2 and nitrogen concentration were investigated. It was found that total <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> <b>was</b> increased after exposing to media with not enough nitrogen concentration. However, under this nitrogen depletion media, the growth rate was very slow leading to lower lipid productivity. The productivity could be increased by increasing CO 2 concentration.

The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the differential susceptibility of five wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties to the herbicide fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, as well as the performance of mefenpyr-diethyl on minimizing herbicide injury and on lipid contents. Varieties BRS 49, CD 104, CEP 24, IAPAR 78 and Rubi were sprayed with fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (69 g ha¹), fenoxaprop-p-ethyl + mefenpyr-diethyl (69 g + 18. 75 g ha- 1), or mefenpyr-diethyl (18. 75 g ha- 1).
