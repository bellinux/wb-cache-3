Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway." [...] The singer's first singles, [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Born to Die" [...] were described variously as [...] "quasi-cabaret balladry", [...] "woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul", [...] "pop", and [...] "indie pop".|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> gun again." ...|$|E

60|$|I mounted, and as I rode {{past her}} to take my place {{at the head of}} that company, I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> mace and bowed. She {{detained}} me a moment, setting her hand upon the glossy neck of my black charger.|$|E

60|$|I gaped foolishly in my amazement, {{a little}} dazzled, too, by the effulgence of her eyes, which were now {{raised to the}} level of my own.

60|$|So far, I must own, {{the effect}} on me of reading the Report was to depress my spirits and to <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> hopes.

6000|$|... 'I'm sure,' added Mrs. Smith {{in a more}} philosophic tone, and as a terminative speech, 'if there'd been so {{much trouble}} to get a husband in my time {{as there is in}} these days--when you must make a god-almighty of a man to get en to hae ye--I'd have trod clay for bricks before I'd ever have <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> dignity to marry, or there's no bread in nine loaves.' ...|$|E

60|$|I think I {{must have}} stepped over a {{grateful}} fairy at that moment, for who else could have reminded me so opportunely of my famous {{manipulation of the}} eyebrows, forgotten since I was in the fifth form? I alone of boys {{had been able to}} elevate and <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> eyebrows separately; when the one was climbing my forehead the other descended it, like the two buckets in the well.|$|R
60|$|One {{extremely}} warm night, {{during a}} calm, {{when it was}} so hot that only a skeleton could keep cool (from the free current of air through its bones), after being drenched in my own perspiration, I managed to wedge myself out of my hammock; and with what little strength I had left, lowered myself gently to the deck. Let me see now, thought I, whether my ingenuity cannot devise some method whereby I can have room to breathe and sleep at the same time. I have it. I will <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> hammock underneath all these others; and then--upon that separate and independent level, at least--I shall have the whole berth-deck to myself. Accordingly, I <b>lowered</b> away <b>my</b> pallet to the desired point--about three inches from the floor--and crawled into it again.|$|R
60|$|But {{with the}} morning cool repentance came. I felt, in the keenest manner, the {{violence}} and absurdity of my conduct, and was obliged to confess that wine and passion had <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> intellects even below those of Wilfred Osbaldistone, whom I held in so much contempt. My uncomfortable reflections {{were by no means}} soothed by meditating the necessity of an apology for my improper behaviour, and recollecting that Miss Vernon must be a witness of my submission. The impropriety and unkindness of my conduct to her personally, added not a little to these galling considerations, and for this I could not even plead the miserable excuse of intoxication.|$|E
60|$|And {{then through}} the last clump of waving ferns broke {{the figure of the}} {{foremost}} creature, which came leaping toward me on light feet as I stood with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at which I had expected it would emerge. I must have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and consternation were in any way reflected upon my countenance as I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> rifle and gazed incredulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding swiftly in my direction. But I did not have long to stand thus with lowered weapon, for as she came, I saw her cast an affrighted glance over her shoulder, and at the same moment there broke from the jungle at the same spot at which I had seen her, the hugest cat I had ever looked upon.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Put {{a ball in}} yer gun,' says Gaspard; for ye see, as we {{had been}} blazin' at small birds the day before, {{there was nothing but}} shot in it. So I put in a ball, and took aim at the beast, intendin' to give it a long shot. But I was mercifully {{prevented}} from firin'. Jist as I squinted along the barrel, the beast rose straight up, and held up both its fore paws. `Stop!' roars Gaspard, in an awful fright; and sure enough I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> gun, and the beast hailed us in the voice of a man, and began to walk to the shore. He seemed quite worn out when he landed, and I could understand enough of his jargon to make out that he had been blown out to sea on the floe, and that his name was Annatock.|$|E
6000|$|But Rose was not appeased, {{and gave}} a disdainful shrug as she {{answered}} with a {{look in her eyes}} that his lordship did not like, [...] "Thank you. I don't want admirers or slaves, but friends and helpers. I've lived so long with a wise, good man that I am rather hard to suit, perhaps, but I don't intend to <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> standard, and anyone who cares for my regard must at least try to live up to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Effoduh's {{family is}} Catholic, {{but he has}} {{mentioned}} that his childhood friends were Muslims from the north, so he enjoyed the food and culture there.Effoduh currently lives in Abuja, Nigeria. In a September 2012 interview where he is asked his relationship status, he replied, [...] "I am in a relationship and I don’t think it is distracting. It actually <b>lowers</b> <b>my</b> gaze and keeps me responsible." [...] In a January 2014 interview, he mentioned he was single and {{does not have a}} ring on his finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never heard}} tell {{of my name}} nor of me either," [...] said I, [...] "but I bring you a token from a friend that you know well. That you know well," [...] I repeated, <b>lowering</b> <b>my</b> voice, [...] "but maybe are not just so keen to hear from at this present being. And the bits of {{business}} that I have to propone to you are rather {{in the nature of}} being confidential. In short, I would like to think we were quite private." ...|$|R
6000|$|I read no farther, but stood stockstill in {{the center}} of the floor, and fell into a reverie. Twenty dollars! Somehow it seemed a mere trifle. Nine hundred and eighty dollars! I did not know there was so much money in the world. Twenty--no, eighty--one {{thousand}} dollars! There were big, black figures floating all over the floor. Incessant cataracts of them poured down the walls, stopped, and shied off as I looked at them, and began to go it again when I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> eyes. Occasionally the figures 20 would take shape somewhere about the floor, and then the figures 980 would slide up and overlay them. Then, like the lean kine of Pharaoh's dream, they would all march away and devour the fat naughts of the number 1,000. And dancing like gnats in the air were myriads of little caduceus-like, phantoms, thus--$$$$$. I could not at all make it out, but began to comprehend my position directly Old Hooker, without moving from his seat, began to drown the noise of countless feet on the stairs by elevating his thin falsetto: ...|$|E
60|$|At last black trees {{began to}} show upon my left, and, {{suddenly}} crossing the road, made a cave of unmitigated blackness right in front. I call it a cave without exaggeration; to pass below that arch of leaves was like entering a dungeon. I felt about until my hand encountered a stout branch, and to this I tied Modestine, a haggard, drenched, desponding donkey. Then I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> pack, laid it along the wall on {{the margin of the}} road, and unbuckled the straps. I knew well enough where the lantern was, but where were the candles? I groped and groped among the tumbled articles, and, while I was thus groping, suddenly I touched the spirit-lamp. Salvation! This would serve my turn as well. The wind roared unwearyingly among the trees; I could hear the boughs tossing and the leaves churning through half a mile of forest; yet the scene of my encampment was not only as black as the pit, but admirably sheltered. At the second match the wick caught flame. The light was both livid and shifting; but it cut me off from the universe, and doubled the darkness of the surrounding night.|$|E
60|$|One morning I made a rent in this mantle; and to {{show the}} islanders with what {{facility}} it could be repaired, I <b>lowered</b> <b>my</b> bundle, and taking from it a needle and thread, proceeded to stitch up the opening. They regarded this wonderful application of science with intense admiration; and whilst I was stitching away, old Marheyo, {{who was one of}} the lookers-on, suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead, and rushing to a corner of the house, drew forth a soiled and tattered strip of faded calico—which he must have procured some time or other in traffic on the beach—and besought me eagerly to exercise a little of my art upon it. I willingly complied, though certainly so stumpy a needle as mine never took such gigantic strides over calico before. The repairs completed, old Marheyo gave me a paternal hug; and divesting himself of his “maro” (girdle), swathed the calico about his loins, and slipping the beloved ornaments into his ears, grasped his spear and sallied out of the house, like a valiant Templar arrayed in a new and costly suit of armour.|$|E
5000|$|But as the {{tensions}} of World War II grew ever more fierce {{and with it}} the regulation of thinking, weak-willed as I was, I found myself unable to resist and could not but yield to some degree to the prevalent mood, which is a shame deeper than I can bear. The already blind militarism had led so many of our graduates precipitously to the battlefields; among the fallen were more than ten from philosophy, for which I feel the height of responsibility and remorse. I can only <b>lower</b> <b>my</b> head and earnestly lament my sin.|$|R
60|$|This anecdote {{she gave}} us with much wealth of discreditable detail and scant regard for either her daughter's {{presence}} {{or for the}} blushes that suffused the poor child's cheeks. In every way she was a pattern {{of the class of}} women amongst whom my youth had been spent, a class which had done so much towards shattering <b>my</b> faith and <b>lowering</b> <b>my</b> estimate of her sex. Lavedan had married her and brought her into Languedoc, and here she spent her years lamenting the scenes of her youth, and prone, it would seem, to make them matter for conversation whenever a newcomer chanced to present himself at the chateau.|$|R
