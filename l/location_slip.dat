30|$|Rupture {{velocity}} model {{tests show}} that both peak slip and slip <b>location</b> (<b>slip</b> depth) {{are dependent on}} Vr; peak slip reaches ∼ 55 m for the lowest rupture velocities, and ∼ 35 m for the fastest. The best-fitting solution is with Vr = 2.5 km/s, though all models explain the data at the 90 % level or higher. All models demonstrate up-dip rupture, indicating that the shallow nature of long period energy release is well constrained. Once rupture velocities reach 2.0 km/s, peak slips reach the top layers of the model, and expand bilaterally along the shallowest subfaults as rupture velocities increase further. Rupture lengths vary from ∼ 150 km with Vr = 1.0 km/s, to ∼ 300 km with Vr = 3.0 km/s.|$|E
40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} {{is considered one}} of the problems in the design of piled foundations in soft soil. The negative {{skin friction}} induces an additional compressive force on the pile called the dragload as well as, an additional pile movement called the downdrag. Ignoring the effect of negative skin friction in the design of piles leads to structural, and serviceability problems. The dragload depends on various factors such as, pile characteristics (method of installation, material, and surface treatment), soil properties (shear strength and compressibility), pile–soil relative movement, and degree of consolidation. In this paper, an axisymmetric finite element model was used to simulate, and analyze the pile–soil interaction problem of negative skin friction. The soft soil was simulated by the double hardening soil model, and the pile was described by a linear elastic model. A field case study for two instrumented end bearing driven pipe precast concrete piles in Bangkok soft clay was back analyzed. The various approaches to model the pile element, and load configurations were analyzed, and compared. An extensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of different factors on the dragload value, neutral plane <b>location,</b> <b>slip</b> length, and pile movement...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 8982 There {{are three}} kinds of strike-slip faults: pure strike-slip, transtensional and transpressional. They have been {{recognized}} in all geodynamic environments and {{are the most common}} fault type associated with volcanic activity. Many volcanic edifices are built in the vicinity of a fault with strike-slip motion. The impact of strike-slip fault movements on a volcanic cone has been addressed by several studies over the last decade. This study considers a broad range of fault and volcano geometries through three natural examples: the Guadeloupe volcanoes in the Lesser Antilles, Mt Cameroon in West Africa and Maderas volcano in Nicaragua. Detailed field and remote sensing studies are used to establish structural maps of these three little studied volcanoes. These maps are then compared with experimental structures that have developed in analogue cones deformed by strike-slip, transtensional and transpressional faults. The study of Guadeloupe volcanoes leads to a new interpretation of its constructional phases. A regional NW-SE striking sinistral transtensional fault on which the Guadeloupe volcanoes have been built is responsible for their alignment, for the dyke strikes and for the major collapse events. On Mt Cameroon, the rift zone and elongated morphology are controlled by the inactive strike-slip fault on which the volcano has been built. This study also reveals that Mt Cameroon volcano has spread over its weak sedimentary substratum. On Maderas volcano, the summit graben, vent alignment, lower flank half-grabens and summit lineaments are related to gravitational spreading and to regional tectonic movements. The orientation of these structures indicates that the Maderas volcano was built above a NW-SE striking dextral transtensional fault. The theoretical model of strike-slip motion and volcanic cone interaction established with the analogue models can be applied to these and to other volcanoes to determine the <b>location,</b> <b>slip,</b> kinematics and strike of structures hidden by recent eruptions and intense erosion...|$|E

The slip control system is implemented around the robot’s plow, and has two main components: a slip estimation subsystem and the slip controller. Slip estimation is performed through a visual odometry algorithm based on monocular optical flow. Two approaches were explored for the slip controller: PID and fuzzy logic control.

Peak ground motions and frequency content of seismic excitations effectively influence {{the behavior of}} structures. In regions of sparse ground motion records, ground-motion simulations provide the synthetic seismic records, which not only {{provide insight into the}} mechanisms of earthquakes but also help in improving some aspects of earthquake engineering. Broadband ground-motion simulation methods typically utilize physics-based modeling of source and path effects at low frequencies coupled with high frequency semi-stochastic methods. I apply the hybrid simulation method by Mai et al. (2010) to model several scenario earthquakes in the Marmara Sea, an area of high seismic hazard. Simulated ground motions were generated at 75 stations using systematically calibrated model parameters. The region-specific source, path and site model parameters were calibrated by simulating a 1 ̆d 440 w 4. 1 Marmara Sea earthquake that occurred on November 16, 2015 on the fault segment in the vicinity of Istanbul. The calibrated parameters were then used to simulate the scenario earthquakes with magnitudes 1 ̆d 440 w 6. 0, 1 ̆d 440 w 6. 25, 1 ̆d 440 w 6. 5 and 1 ̆d 440 w 6. 75 over the Marmara Sea fault.

A rigorous analysis of waveforms reveal that these parameters are critical for determining the behavior of ground motions especially in the near-field. Comparison of simulated ground motion intensities with ground-motion prediction quations indicates the need of development of the region-specific ground-motion prediction equation for Istanbul area. Peak ground motion maps are presented to illustrate the shaking in the Istanbul area due to the scenario earthquakes. The southern part of Istanbul including Princes Islands show high amplitudes of shaking. The study serves as a step towards dynamic risk quantification for the Istanbul area that integrates physicsbased ground-motion simulations into an innovative dynamic exposure model to quantify risk...|$|E

The expected seismic moment Mo e {{and the strength of}} ground shaking resulting from the entire rupture of each mapped fault (or fault segment) are estimated using empirical relations between seismic moment Mo, rupture length, source to site distance, and strong ground motion•s. Assuming a fault model. whereby the repeat time T of earthquakes on each fault equals Moe/M•o (where the moment rate Mo gis propor-tional to fault slip rate), it is observed that the moment-frequency distribution of earthquakes predicted from the geologic data agrees well with the distribution determined from a 150 -year histori-cal record. The agreement is consistent with the argument that the geologic record of Quaternary fault offsets contains information sufficient to predict the average spatial and size distribution of earth-quakes through time in California. The estimates of r for each fault are the foundation for con-structing maps that depict he average return period of> • 0. lg peak horizontal ground accelerations, and the horizontal components of peak acceleration, peak velocity, and the pseudovelocity response (at 1 -period and 5 % damping) expected to occur at the level of 0. 1 probability during a 50 -year period of time.

The <b>locations</b> and <b>slip</b> motions of the rupture zones were also manifested as interferogram fringe offsets in InSAR images. Coupled with the aftershock distribution, seismic and geodetic inversions from other studies, we found that slip-partitioned fault breaks occurred during the Kumamoto earthquake under a complex stress field, leading to oblique fault motion mixed with right-lateral shear and extension on the southern margin of the Beppu-Shimabara Rift Zone (BSRZ). The Kumamoto rupture is the second significant case of coseismic slip partitioning. Our simple dislocation model with a subsurface oblique-slip fault demonstrates that such a bifurcation into pure strike-slip and normal faults likely occurs near the surface for optimally oriented failure. This provides an insight into scale- and depth-dependent stress heterogeneity. In seismic hazard estimates, the Kumamoto case also provides an implication to estimate a single seismic source fault in multiple fault strands regardless of slip sense, which may influence the estimated size of the strong shaking areas.|$|R
