40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{securitization}} on two dimensions of consumer mortgage costs: coupon rates and <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees.</b> We find no evidence that securitization reduces the coupon rates on fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgages. Instead, securitization appears to lower mortgage <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> resulting in substantial savings for consumers. Securitization activity includes passthrough creation and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) creation. We test for differences between the effects of passthrough and CMO creation on primary mortgage costs. Surprisingly, these activities appear to have indistinguishable effects on <b>loan</b> rates and <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> suggesting that a large derivatives market for mortgage loans is not creating value for consumers.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Although {{previous}} {{studies have found that}} securitization reduces primary mortgage rates by 30 basis points or more, I find these benefits disappear when fixed and adjustable rate spreads are unbundled and measured separately. I find no evidence that securitization lowers primary mortgage spreads. Nor do I find evidence that tax and regulatory changes over the last 15 years have affected primary mortgage spreads. I find that securitization reduces <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> resulting in substantial savings for consumers. In 1993 alone, securitization produced consumer savings of more than $ 2. 8 billion in <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees.</b> This is the first study to test for differences between the effects of pass through and CMO creation on primary mortgage costs.

50|$|Their {{two primary}} sources of revenue are from <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> and <b>loan</b> {{servicing}} fees (provided {{they are a}} loan servicer). Many mortgage bankers are opting not to service the loans they originate. By selling them shortly after they are closed and funded, they are eligible for earning a service released premium.

50|$|There {{is concern}} in the U.S. that {{consumers}} are often victims of predatory mortgage lending http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/09/17/mortgage.fraud/. The main concern is that mortgage lenders and brokers, operating legally, are finding loopholes in the law to obtain additional profit. The typical scenario is that terms of the loan are beyond {{the means of the}} ill-informed and uneducated borrower. The borrower makes a number of interest and principal payments, and then defaults. The lender then takes the property and recovers the amount of the loan, and also keeps the interest and principal payments, as well as <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arnall was {{the billionaire}} owner of ACC Capital Holdings, {{the parent company}} of Ameriquest, which was once one of the United States's largest sub-prime {{mortgage}} lenders. By the end of 2005 two of Arnall's companies, Ameriquest and Argent, had funded almost $ 75 billion in subprime loans. A major factor of this development was Arnall's origination of the stated income loan, meaning loans were given without verification of income. In early 2006, the company announced a $325 million settlement with state attorneys general and law enforcement agencies and financial regulators in 49 states and the District of Columbia who had accused Ameriquest of misrepresenting and failing to disclose loan terms, charging excessive <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees</b> and inflating appraisals to qualify borrowers for loans.|$|R

50|$|Most {{private loan}} {{programs}} {{are tied to}} one or more financial indexes, such as the Wall Street Journal Prime rate or the BBA LIBOR rate, plus an overhead charge. Because private loans are based on the credit history of the applicant, the overhead charge varies. Students and families with excellent credit generally receive lower rates and smaller <b>loan</b> <b>origination</b> <b>fees</b> than those with poorer credit histories. Money paid toward interest is now tax deductible. However, lenders rarely give complete details of the terms of the private student loan until after the student submits an application, in part because this helps prevent comparisons based on cost. For example, many lenders only advertise the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers). Borrowers with bad credit can expect interest rates that are as much as 6% higher, loan fees that are as much as 9% higher, and loan limits that are two-thirds lower than the advertised figures.|$|R
50|$|Excess {{borrowing}} {{to acquire}} replacement property. Borrowing {{more money than}} is necessary to close on replacement property will not result in the taxpayer receiving tax-free money from the closing. The funds from the loan {{will be the first}} to be applied toward the purchase. If the addition of exchange funds creates a surplus at the closing, all unused exchange funds will be returned to the Qualified Intermediary, presumably to be used to acquire more replacement property. <b>Loan</b> acquisition costs (<b>origination</b> <b>fees</b> and other fees related to acquiring the loan) with respect to the replacement property should be brought to the closing from the taxpayerâ€™s personal funds. Taxpayers usually take the position that loan acquisition costs are being paid out of the proceeds of the loan. However, the IRS may take the position that these costs are being paid with Exchange Funds. This position is usually the position of the financing institution also. Unfortunately, at the present time there is no guidance from the IRS on this issue which is helpful.|$|R

However, an <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> usually varies from 3.0% to 10.0% {{of a given}} loan amount, {{depending on whether the}} loan was originated in the prime or the subprime market. For example, an <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> of 3% on a $200,000 loan is $6,000.

They can be taken out of the total loan amount or added on top of the total loan amount, often at the borrower's preference. Some lenders offer low-interest, 0-fee loans. Each percentage point on the front-end fee gets paid once, while each percentage point on the interest rate is calculated and paid throughout the life of the loan. Some have suggested that this makes the interest rate more critical than the <b>origination</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|R
