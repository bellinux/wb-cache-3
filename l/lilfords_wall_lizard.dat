5000|$|<b>Lilford's</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis lilfordi [...] ) is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Lacertidae. The species is endemic to the Balearic Islands, Spain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lilford's</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{native to}} the islands of Menorca and Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, the Cabrera Archipelago {{to the south of}} Mallorca, and the {{neighbouring}} rocky islets. However it has been extirpated from the two large islands and is now only present on the islets.|$|R
50|$|Local native {{plant species}} include holm oak (Quercus ilex) and various pine species. There are over 1,000 animal species; notable {{among them are}} the seabirds Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), various {{cormorants}} (Phalacrocorax), the common swift (Apus apus), and the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) as well as numerous reptiles, such as the endemic <b>Lilford's</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis lilfordi) found on several of the islets of the archipelago. The islets are also {{home to one of}} Spain's few colonies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni; other colonies are in Murcia and Almería).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} species of amphibia: green toad (Bufo viridis), marsh frog and stripeless tree frog (Hyla meridionalis).The common lizard seen {{all over the}} island is the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis siculus) {{although}} the Moroccan rock lizard (Scelaris perspicillata) also occurs. The Balearic endemic <b>Lilford's</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis lilfordi) {{can be found on}} many of the offshore islands. Two species of gecko can be found on Menorca, the Moorish (Tarentola mauritanica) and the Turkish (Hemidactylus turcicus) also called the Mediterranean house gecko.Four species of snake occur: the viperine snake (Natrix maura), grass snake, false smooth snake (Macroprotodon cucullatus) and the ladder snake (Rhinechis scalaris).|$|R
50|$|<b>Lilford's</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{grows to}} a maximum snout-to-vent length of 8 cm but adults are usually a little smaller than this. The tail is about 1.8 times {{as long as the}} body. It is a robust {{streamlined}} lizard with a short-head and rounded body with smooth, unkeeled scales. The dorsal surface is usually greenish or brownish but varies much between different island subpopulations. There is usually a pale dorso-lateral stripe and there may be several dark streaks or three dark lines running along the spine. The flanks may be slightly reticulated and the underside is white, cream or pinkish. The throat may be blotched with darker colour. Juveniles sometimes have a blue tail.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lilford's</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is a {{relatively}} tame lizard and easy to approach. It mainly feeds on insects, spiders and other arthropods, snails and some vegetable matter. This includes flowers and fruits, nectar and pollen. Some plants endemic to the Balearic Islands depend on this lizard for pollination. Other plants known to be pollinated by it include the mastic tree Pistacia lentiscus, rock samphire Crithmum maritimum, wild leek Allium ampeloprasum, clustered carline thistle Carlina corymbosa and the sea daffodil Pancratium maritimum. It is opportunistic around birds' nests {{in the use of}} scraps of food that have been regurgitated by gulls for their chicks. It also sometimes moves to the vicinity of nests of the Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) and feeds on the remains of its prey and the flies that accumulate around the nesting site. It is sometimes cannibalistic, eating juveniles and the tails of other lizards of its own species.|$|R
40|$|The body {{growth rate}} in small {{reptiles}} is modulated by per-capita food resources and recent evidences {{suggested that this}} constraint is the mechanism underlying differences between cohorts. Per-capita food resources depend on population size and climatic factors, but their relative role in explaining the variations in growth rate is unclear. We used morphological data collected over 6 years to model the body growth of an insular <b>lizard</b> (<b>Lilford’s</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>Lizard,</b> Podarcis lilfordi (Günther, 1874)). We used nonlinear equations to describe the appropriate length-at-age relationship. For each sex, seasonal growth was observed and the oscillatory von Bertalanffy curve was fitted to the data. Three age classes were recognized, and we investigated the relative role of density, spring rainfall, and temperature in explaining the variation of the growth rate in each sex-by-age class. Results showed that the relative role of density and climatic factors varied according to the age considered. While population size and temperature had {{a negative effect on}} the growth rate of juveniles, rainfall had a positive influence on the growth of subadults. Adult growth was near zero and constant over time. The different role of density-dependent and climatic factors in explaining age-dependent growth rate provides an important insight in understanding lizard population dynamics and life-history tactics.

50|$|Podarcis hispanica (Iberian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard)</b> {{is a small}} <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{species of}} the genus Podarcis.

50|$|Podarcis muralis (common <b>wall</b> <b>lizard)</b> is {{a species}} of lizard with a large {{distribution}} in Europe and well-established introduced populations in North America, where it is also called the European <b>wall</b> <b>lizard.</b> It can grow to about 20 cm in total length.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} endemic to Sicily and the Aegadian Islands, {{though it is}} absent from the northeastern part of Sicily. It frequents areas with lush {{vegetation}} {{on the edges of}} woodland, bushy slopes, pasture and cultivated land. It is often present in gardens, especially irrigated ones. In contrast to the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> it does not climb much and occupies more densely vegetated areas. It is the commonest <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> inland while the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is the more common near the coast.|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} lizard {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis taurica), the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and the green lizard (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand lizard and green lizard is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand lizard and green lizard. Furthermore sand <b>lizard</b> and balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> share roughly the same food source and moreover green lizard could possibly pass into a predator of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> juveniles also. Therefore sand lizard and green lizard became competitors (or predators) of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three lizard species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R

50|$|Bocage's <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{grows to}} a snout-to-vent length of about 7 cm with a tail {{twice as long}} as this, males being larger than females.

The dorsal surface is usually grey or yellowish-brown, but is sometimes green in males, copiously speckled with rows of dark markings. The flanks may be brownish or yellowish.

50|$|Podarcis is a genus of lizards. Its members {{look very}} similar to lizards of the genus Lacerta, {{to which they were}} {{considered}} to belong until the 1970s. While similar externally and ecologically, Podarcis form a distinct group differing from Lacerta by the construction of the skull and the hemipenis, and by the processes of the caudal vertebrae. They are commonly known as <b>wall</b> <b>lizards.</b> They are native to Europe and northern Africa, and most species are restricted to the Mediterranean region. The Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the common <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> have been introduced to North America.|$|R
