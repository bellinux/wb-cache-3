40|$|Throughout his career, Stephen King {{has created}} child protagonists and adults with a childlike {{acceptance}} of the world who represent “good. ” These children and adults are able to observe and fight evil, especially supernatural evil, on a level that close-minded adults are unable to because of their imagination. At the same, King also {{has a history of}} adhering to traditional representations of sex in his work, presenting heteronormative relationships as good and transgressive sexualities as evil. Often, these child protagonists are faced with sexuality as a threatening, evil force. In The Shining, Danny Torrance undergoes a forced sexual awakening that aids him in defeating the Overlook Hotel; in ’Salem’s <b>Lot,</b> <b>Mark</b> Petrie is represented as a virginal hero who helps Ben Mears in defeating vampires, yet suffers as a result; in It, King aligns seven children’s journey to defeat evil with their literal sexual awakenings, but at the cost of his female characters. These novels represent a disconnect between what appear to be King’s purpose in sexual representation and what their message to the reader actually are, which is indicative of the underlying problems of his traditional, black-and-white attitude toward sexuality in his fiction...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lot</b> {{numbers are}} <b>marks</b> that {{are applied to}} {{ammunition}} {{at the point of}} manu-facture, assembly, or modification. They identify a quantity of ammunition that has been assembled from uniform components and under similar condi-tions. These marks are applied to facilitate accounting and general manage-ment of ammunition. Marks may be applied on ammunition components themselves and/or on the packaging of the ammunition. Small arms ammunition is rarely <b>lot</b> <b>marked</b> on the ammunition itself, such as on the cartridge case. This chapter argues that applying <b>lot</b> <b>marks</b> di-rectly to small arms cartridges offers some security forces the prospect of in-creased logistical efficiency. In addition, <b>lot</b> <b>marking</b> of small arms ammuni-tion has proved to be an effective way of discouraging and detecting diversion from national stockpiles...|$|R

50|$|After {{the roof}} had been {{collapsed}} and the stadium abandoned, Red Bull produced {{a video of}} BMX rider Tyler Fernengel riding inside the Silverdome in 2015.

40|$|Long-term load {{forecasting}} aims at {{predicting the}} evolution of the electric consumption in a certain area in order to resize the grid in accordance. There are two components to study: the increment in existing consumption and the appearance of new clients. We focus here on the latter. With this purpose, we present an ongoing work that applies agent-based modelling to this end. Representing each existing electric customer by an agent, candidate agents will decide their settlement based on their inquiries to present agents on their likes and actual urban constraints obtained from real sources (e. g. prohibition to build upon a <b>lot</b> <b>marked</b> as a park). We will test this system with a Monte-Carlo simulation and compare the obtained results with real data to validate our approach...|$|R

2500|$|The Gemara {{explained}} how Moses selected {{the members of}} the Sanhedrin in [...] The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that when (in [...] ) God told Moses to gather 70 elders of Israel, Moses worried that if he chose six from each of the 12 tribes, there would be 72 elders, two more than God requested. If he chose five elders from each tribe, there would be 60 elders, ten short of the number God requested. If Moses chose six out of some tribes and five out of others, he would sow jealousy among the tribes. To solve this problem, Moses selected six prospective elders out of each tribe. Then he brought 72 lots, on 70 of which he wrote the word [...] "elder" [...] and two of which he left blank. He then mixed up all the lots, put them in an urn, and asked the 72 prospective elders to draw lots. To each prospective elder who drew a <b>lot</b> <b>marked</b> [...] "elder," [...] Moses said that Heaven had consecrated him. To those two prospective elders who drew a blank, Moses said that Heaven had rejected them, what could Moses do? According to this Baraita, some say the report in [...] that Eldad and Medad remained in the camp meant that their <b>lots</b> — <b>marked</b> [...] "elder" [...] — remained in the urn, as Eldad and Medad were afraid to draw their lots. Other prospective elders drew the two blank lots, so Eldad and Medad were thus selected elders.|$|R

Gershom French in 1783. On October 2, 1783, his survey party camped {{on the shores of}} the Rideau River {{at the head of the}} portage from the Ottawa River that led around Rideau Falls. He described the area as [...] "the soil everywhere good and deep, timbered with Maple, Elm and Butternut". The War of 1812 made evident the need for a safe military supply route from Montreal to Kingston so the Rideau Route was surveyed for the purposes of a canal, in 1816 by Royal Engineer Joshua Jebb and in 1823-24 by civil surveyor Samuel Clowes. In 1826, Lieutenant-Colonel John By was appointed to oversee its construction and he hired contractors that included Philemon Wright, who supplied much of the stone, mortar and labour, Thomas McKay, a mason, and staff such as John MacTaggart and Thomas Burrowes, surveyor, (Burrowes' created many paintings of early Bytown.) The Governor General George Ramsay, the Earl of Dalhousie took a great interest in the construction of the canal, as well as in establishing a settlement in the area. On September 26, 1826, Colonel By and Dalhousie had agreed that the canal's entrance was to be at Entrance Bay (its current location), and along with a letter authorizing Colonel By to divide the town into <b>lots,</b> <b>marked</b> the origins of what was to become the town of Bytown.|$|R
