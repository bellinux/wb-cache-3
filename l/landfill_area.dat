25|$|The Ciudad Deportiva is a {{construction}} that was begun in 1990, {{located on the}} edge of what was the Bordo de Xochiaca landfill. This was the first stage of the reclamation of the <b>landfill</b> <b>area,</b> building sports facilities for volleyball, tennis, soccer (for children and adults), baseball and other sports.|$|E
25|$|Expansion to {{the present-day}} park {{boundaries}} commenced in 1995 with {{closure of the}} paper mill, at which time the City of Monroe organized efforts to restore the entire battlefield site. The City, Historical Society, and property owner negotiated, acquired and facilitated clean up the former paper mill property and adjacent <b>landfill</b> <b>area</b> for future donation to the park service. In addition they transferred a large expanse of wetlands marsh to the State of Michigan for expansion of the adjacent Sterling State Park. Acquisitions were complete by 2006, the paper mill was demolished by 2009, the cleanup finished in 2010, and land transfers were completed in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, the <b>landfill</b> <b>area</b> also {{contains}} the expansion and {{completion of the}} Ciudad Deportiva. The facilities were finished in 2009 and stated by investors {{to be the most}} modern sports facility in Mexico. The facility was inaugurated in March 2009 by state Governor Enrique Peña Nieto and principal investor Carlos Slim Helú. It contains a nearly Olympic-sized stadium, a cycling track, two gymnasiums, 25 soccer fields, five for indoor soccer, two American football fields, four tennis courts, four basketball courts, four volleyball courts, two jai alai courts, two baseball fields, an aerobics floor, playgrounds and recreational areas. However, as of January 2010, it is closed to the public because state and municipal authorities have not regularized the title of the land on which it sits. Entrance to the facilities will be free, due to corporate sponsorship to cover administrative costs.|$|E

40|$|Carbon dioxide, methane and {{nitrous oxide}} {{are the major}} Greenhouse Gases (GHG’s), which emit from <b>landfill</b> <b>areas</b> and {{contribute}} significantly to global warming. Moreover, that the global warming potential of methane is 21 times {{higher than that of}} carbon dioxide and it has highest generation (60 %) than other gases. Therefore, there is immense concern for its abatement or utilization from <b>landfill</b> <b>areas.</b> Compared to the west, the composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) in developing countries has higher (40 % - 60 %) organic waste. This would have potential to emit higher GHG’s from per ton of MSW compared to developed world. Beside that <b>landfills</b> <b>areas</b> in India are not planned or en- gineered generally low lying open areas, where MSW is indiscriminate disposed. This leads to uncontrolled emission of trace gases, foul smell, bird menace, ground and surface water pollution etc. Due to scarcity of land in big cities, mu- nicipal authorities are using same landfill for nearly 10 - 20 years. Hence, the possibility of anaerobic emission of GHG’s further increases. In the present paper we had quantified the methane emission from three MSW <b>landfill</b> <b>areas</b> of Delhi i. e., Gazipur, Bhalswa and Okhla. The results showed that the range of methane emission various in winter from 12. 94 to 58. 41 and in Summer from 82. 69 - 293 mg/m 2 /h in these <b>landfill</b> <b>areas.</b> The paper has also reviewed the literature on methane emission from India and the status of <b>landfill</b> <b>areas</b> in India...|$|R

2500|$|The Munisport Landfill {{is located}} about [...] from Biscayne Bay. Natural soils in the <b>landfill</b> <b>area</b> {{had been removed}} prior to dumping, {{increasing}} risk of pollution seepage, especially into the Biscayne Aquifer, a primary source for drinking water in South Florida. The solid waste was disposed of {{without the use of}} a liner and with no leachate control mechanisms, so rainfall percolating through the solid waste has caused the release of elevated levels of ammonia and other contaminants into the underlying groundwater and discharges into adjacent surface water.|$|E

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} are {{the major}} ground water pollutant that {{affect the quality of}} drinking water due to the seepage of toxic substance from E-wastes, house-hold wastes, mechanic wastes, other agricultural wastes etc. This study was aimed at assessing the status of heavy metal and bacteria population in municipal borehole water in <b>landfill</b> and non-landfill <b>areas</b> in Calabar. Twelve boreholes were sampled in the <b>landfill</b> <b>areas</b> such as Atimbo, Anantigha, Ibom layout and GOM (Goldie, Orok-Orok and Mount-Zion) while the other twelve boreholes were also sampled in the non-landfill areas in Atimbo, Anantigha, Ibom layout and GOM. The water samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of heavy metals and microbial load. The result for the presence of heavy metals shows that there were no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the iron content of the borehole water samples in the <b>landfill</b> and non-landfill <b>areas,</b> while the manganese and ammonium content of the <b>landfill</b> <b>areas</b> were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than that of the non-landfill areas.

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} (C&D) waste has consumed a {{large portion}} of the <b>landfill</b> <b>areas</b> in Hong Kong. Among them, concrete occupies more than 70 % of the total C&D waste by volume. Thus it is necessary to recycle concrete waste to preserve <b>landfill</b> <b>areas.</b> Various governmental departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) are encouraging the use of recycled aggregate (RA) in the Hong Kong construction industry by issuing various guidelines and specifications. Owing to uncertainty in their properties, however, practitioners are sceptical in using it as a substitute. In this study, an attempt has been made to look at relations among six main parameters that describe the behaviour of RA: (1) particle size distribution; (2) particle density; (3) porosity and absorption; (4) particle shape; (5) strength and toughness; and (6 i) chloride and sulphate contents. RA samples were obtained from nine demolition sites with service lives ranging from 10 to 40 years and another set of samples was collected from the Tuen Mun Area 38 recycling plant. The behaviour of these samples was compared with that of normal aggregate samples. This study revealed that there is a strong correlation among various parameters, and by measuring three of them: either 'particle density' or 'porosity and absorption' or 'particle shape', and 'strength and toughness', and 'chloride and sulphate contents', it is possible to assess the behaviour of RA. This can significantly help by reducing RA testing time and cost before using it as recycled aggregate concrete. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|R

Punctual contamination with heavy metals Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Pb, Ba, Co and As, from pollution around industrial landfills, correlates to large-scale lixiviation in the different compartments of the environment. The compartments are delineated with interpretation of remote sensing images and DTM of the hydrographic basin as well as the fluxes between the landfills and the drainage system. It is suggested how patterns of contamination in the compartments may be modelled and used to prevent, remediate and manage industrial pollution. Pages: 4111 - 411...|$|R
