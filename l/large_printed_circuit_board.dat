Recovery of the valuable materials and their diversion from landfill where leaching of toxic materials may occur, is an expensive process because of the complexity of the product and the relatively small quantities present on each <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board.</b> This paper uses an LCA approach to examine the value of recycling various grades of PCB.

A straightforward extension to the maze routing algorithm that disallows via-rule incorrect routes may either cause a suboptimal route to be found, or more seriously, cause the failure to find any route even if one exists. We present a refined heuristic to this problem by embedding {{the distance to the}} most recently placed via in an extended connection graph so that the maze routing algorithm has a higher chance of finding a via-rule correct optimum path in the extended connection graph.

40|$|Very {{recently}} bioleaching {{has been}} used for removing metals from electronic waste. Most of the research has been targeted to using pulverized PCBs for bioleaching where precipitate formed during bioleaching contaminates the pulverized PCB sample and making the overall metal recovery process more complicated. In addition to that, such mixing of pulverized sample with precipitate also creates problems for the final separation of non metallic fraction of PCB sample. In the present investigation we attempted the use of <b>large</b> pieces of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> instead of pulverized sample for removal of metals. Use of large pieces of PCBs for bioleaching was restricted due to the chemical coating present on PCBs, the problem has been solved by chemical treatment of PCBs prior to bioleaching. In short, • Large pieces of PCB can be used for bioleaching instead of pulverized PCB sample. • Metallic portion on PCBs can be made accessible to bacteria with prior chemical treatment of PCBs. • Complete metal removal obtained on PCB pieces of size 4  cm ×  2. 5  cm with the exception of solder traces.
