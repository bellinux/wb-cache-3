40|$|With so many {{different}} theories regarding the development of life on earth, how does one determine which ones hold more merit and educators should focus on? In order to sort this out, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> first <b>begin</b> with the word theory itself. In everyday speech, a theory is likened to an opinion, assumption, speculation, or hypothesis. It gives a plausible {{answer to a question}} that many times can neither be proven nor disproved. Scientifically speaking, however, a theory is considered a fact supported by something known or observed (Moran 1993). Otherwise stated, a theory is a continually tested and retested scientific hypothesis that effectively determines how the natural world functions (Berra 2001). To be considered scientific, a theory must follow this description. A closer examination of the definitions and explanations of the theories of evolution, natural selection, and intelligent design will establish what types of theories they are and explain why they should not be given equal treatment in science classes. On the theory of evolution, many non-scientists think of it from a philosophical standpoint as opposed to a scientific one. Evolution has become widely accepte...|$|R

Many there are whose names will never be written on the roll of fame, whose graves will be unmarked in history.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{tell a story}} about what in the mid 1990 s {{happened}} to an action plan that was conceived according to an action research strategy. The objective of {{the plan was to}} improve the situation for the municipality of Ronneby 3 and its citizens. Our story sets off on the level of events, actions and agencies and here our story is simple and straightforward. Then we consider the structural level and begin to deliberate how the two levels interact. From then on our story develops into a social temporal analysis of the rather complicated relationship between action research approaches and such particular forms of social research that aim at policies for local and regional economic growth. Research problem and research questions <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> however <b>begin</b> with the action research approach. There are different schools within this field. 4 We agree, though, with Greenwood & Levin that action research in principle "is social research carried out by a team encompassing a professional action researcher and mem-bers of an organisation or community seeking to improve their situation. " We also agree with their statement that action research "promotes broad participation in the research process and supports action leading to more just or satisfying situation for the stakeholders". ...|$|R

60|$|Some of {{you here}} may not {{understand}} this text at all. Some of you, perhaps, may misunderstand it; for {{it is not an}} easy one. <b>Let</b> <b>us,</b> then, <b>begin,</b> by finding out the meaning of each word in it; and, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> first see what is the meaning of the spirit of bondage unto fear. Bondage means slavery; and the spirit of bondage means the spirit which makes men look up to God as slaves do to their taskmaster. Now, a slave obeys his master from fear only; not from love or gratitude. He knows that his master is stronger than he is, and he dreads being beaten and punished by him; and therefore, he obeys him only by compulsion, not of his own good will. This is the spirit of bondage; the slavish, superstitious spirit in religion, into which all men fall, in proportion as they are mean, and sinful, and carnal, fond of indulging themselves, and bearing no love to God or right things. They know that God is stronger than they; they are afraid that God will take away comforts from them if they offend Him; they have been taught that He will cast them into endless torment if they offend Him; and, therefore, they are afraid to do wrong. They love what is wrong, and would like to do it; but they dare not, for fear of God's punishment. They do not really fear God; they only fear punishment, misfortune, death, and hell. That is better, perhaps, than no religion at all. But it is not the faith which WE ought to have.|$|R
