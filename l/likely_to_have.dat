Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy.

40|$|Abstract Background Dental {{health is}} a {{neglected}} aspect of adolescent health globally but {{more so in}} low-income countries. Secondary analysis using the 2004 Zambia Global School-Based Health Survey (GSHS) was conducted in which we estimated frequencies of relevant socio-demographic variables and explored associations between selected explanatory variables and self-reported poor oral hygiene (not cleaning or brushing teeth) within the last 30 days of the completion of questionnaire. Findings Most of the 2257 respondents were males (53. 9 %) and went hungry (82. 5 %). More than 4 in 10 respondents drank alcohol (42. 2 %) while 37. 2 % smoked cannabis. Overall 10. 0 % {{of the respondents reported}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene. Male respondents were 7 % less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene compared to females. Compared to respondents who never drank alcohol, those who drank alcohol were 27 % more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene. Respondents who smoked cannabis were 4 % more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene compared to those who did not smoke cannabis. Finally, respondents who went hungry were 35 % more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene compared to those who did not go hungry. Conclusions Results from this study indicate that female gender, alcohol drinking, cannabis smoking, and going hungry were associated with self-reported poor oral hygiene. The identification of these factors should guide the design and implementation of programs aimed to improve oral health among adolescents. </p...|$|R
