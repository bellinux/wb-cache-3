25|$|The monuments {{themselves}} were listed and {{purchased by the}} State {{at the start of}} the 20th century to protect them against quarrymen, and while this was successful at the time, in the mid century redevelopment, changes to agricultural practices and increasing tourism bringing visitors to the stones led to rapid deterioration. The Ministère de la Culture et de <b>la</b> <b>Communication</b> (Heritage Ministry) re-examined the issue from 1984, and subsequently set up the ‘Mission Carnac’ 1991 with the aim of rehabilitating and developing the alignments. This involved restricting public access, launching a series of scientific and technical studies, and producing a plan for conservation and development in the area.|$|E

The Conseil Superieur de l’Audiovisuel et de <b>la</b> <b>Communication</b> (CSAC, Superior Council of Broadcasting and Communication) law stipulates that bloggers must obtain authorization from CSAC. Through the end of 2012 CSAC had not refused authorization to any bloggers. Private entrepreneurs make Internet access available at moderate prices through Internet cafes in large cities throughout the country. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), just 1.2% of individuals used the Internet in 2011. By the end of 2012 Internet use had risen to 1.7% of the population. This low use limits the impact that the Internet has on {{the economic and political}} life of the country.|$|E

Formal verification finds design errors and provides counterexamples while the Discrete Controller Synthesis technique attempts to enforce previously verified specifications {{which do not}} hold. It automatically produces control code, which is correct by construction {{with respect to the}} specification to enforce. This approach is presented and illustrated on a train controller subsystem...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the power of}} quantum communication protocols compared to classical probabilistic protocols. In our first result we describe a total Boolean function that has a quantum Las Vegas protocol communicating at most O(N^{ 10 / 11 + epsilon}) qubits for all epsilon > 0, while any classical probabilistic protocol (with bounded error) needs Omega(N/log N) bits. Then we investigate quantum one-way communication complexity. First we show that the VC-dimension lower bound on one-way probabilistic communication of [26] holds for quantum protocols, too. Then we prove that for one-way protocols computing total functions quantum <b>Las</b> Vegas <b>communication</b> is asymptotically as efficient as exact quantum communication, which is exactly as efficient as deterministic communication. We describe applications of the lower bounds for one-way communication complexity to quantum finite automata and quantum formulae...|$|R

This might occur during reactor operation (in case of a core meltdown accident with subsequent reactor pressure vessel breaching), under shutdown conditions with the upper head of the vessel removed, in spent fuel storage pools after accidental loss of cooling or during degraded transport situations. The fuel assemblies inadequately cooled, heat up and as a result, corrosion of Zircaloy claddings takes place.

International audienceIn this work, {{we address}} {{a method that}} is able to track {{simultaneously}} head and facial actions like lip and eyebrow movements in a video sequence. In a basic framework, an adaptive appearance model is estimated online by {{the knowledge of the}} monocular video sequence. This method uses a 3 D model of the face and a facial adaptive texture model. In order to increase the robustness of the tracking, we consider and compare two improved models. First, we use robust statistics in order to downweight the hidden region or outlier pixels. In a second approach, a mixture model provides better integration of occlusions. Each way will be tested separately within the basic framework...|$|R
50|$|The San La Muerte devotion is {{characterized}} by a moral code that must be obeyed. In the devotion of San La Muerte devotees have numerous obligation towards the saint, which they must honor in exchange for his protection. While followers request favors from other saints they demand them from San <b>La</b> Muerte. <b>Communication</b> with San <b>La</b> Muerte takes place through prayers that are passed on between believers. The San La Muerte devotion is based on punishment and submission and to be granted a favor the saint sometimes must even be threatened. Commons threats involve hunger or banishment to an uninhabited place until the favor is granted. When graces are granted, the saint will be rewarded and fed but never fully, in order to increase the chances of him soon being willing to grant another grace.|$|R
