On the abortion issue, he stated that he would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> {{with an open mind}} but would not state how he would rule on Roe v. Wade if that issue were to come up before the court. Some pro-life activists, however, claim Alito's confirmation as a victory for their cause.|$|E
25|$|At Judenplatz 11 is the {{building}} of the Austrian Administrative Court of Justice (Verwaltungsgerichtshofs) beside the Austrian Constitutional Court of Justice (Verfassungsgerichtshofs) in the former Bohemian Court Chancellery, (Böhmische Hofkanzlei). The building was erected from 1709 to 1714 to the designs of Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. After 1749, the remaining lots of the block were bought up and Matthias Gerl was put in charge of the expansion of the palace from 1751 to 1754, symmetrically doubling the construction westward. Further rebuilding took place in the 19th century, the palace essentially received its present-day <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time. The façade on Judenplatz was originally the back of {{the building}}, only since changes in the 20th century has the main entrance gate been found there. The female figures over the gates of this building represent the Cardinal virtues (moderation, wisdom, justice and bravery), and above are the coats of arms of Bohemia and Austria. In the middle of the attic line, an angel stands with trombone, at whose feet a Putto crouches. Four vases and two male figures who are presumably Bohemian Kings Wenceslaus I and Wenceslaus II are at the angel's sides.|$|E

500|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the session, which started at 15:00 local time (...) on Saturday afternoon, Lewis Hamilton took the third out of three possible pole positions of the season, narrowly beating his teammate by 0.04 seconds. Nico Rosberg was frustrated about the result, lamenting that his team had put unnecessary pressure on him by telling him to go faster during his last warm-up lap, saying [...] "e need to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> as that was not ideal to put me under pressure like that".|$|E

[...] A second post appeared shortly after; titled [...] "Sorry", it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through, but also contained a message to her parents: [...] "Fuck you.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage.

500|$|Robinson protested {{against the}} major leagues' ongoing lack of {{minority}} managers and central office personnel, {{and he turned}} down an invitation to appear in an old-timers' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969. He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game2 of the World Series at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also commented, [...] "I'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball." [...] This wish was only fulfilled after Robinson's death: following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson (no relation to Jackie), a Hall of Fame-bound player who {{would go on to}} manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give you another <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2015, McAdams starred with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Stanley Tucci as {{journalist}} Sacha Pfeiffer in Tom McCarthy's Spotlight, Academy Award's Best Picture winner drama, {{about the}} child-abuse scandal in Boston's Catholic Church. To prepare for her role, McAdams {{spent time with}} Pfeiffer. The movie garnered universal critical acclaim, mainly for its detailed story and the cast performances. Justin Chang of Variety felt she [...] "imbues Pfeiffer with sensitivity and grit." [...] Nonetheless, he was surprised by McAdams' subsequent Academy Award nomination: [...] " [...] has the sort of fine-grained subtlety that voters too rarely notice. Take another <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> scene in which she gently, skillfully encourages an abuse survivor to lay bare his most lacerating secrets—a small master class in how {{the simple act of}} listening can become a conduit for compassion." [...] For her role, McAdams received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations in the categories of Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.|$|E
500|$|The {{performers}} {{category is}} meant for recording artists and bands that have [...] "influence and {{significance to the}} development and perpetuation of rock and roll." [...] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years {{after the release of}} their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 600 [...] "rock experts" [...] who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. [...] "There was a lot of discussion about this," [...] said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. [...] "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> This is the result." ...|$|E
500|$|The Incredible Melting Man {{was written}} and {{directed}} by filmmaker William Sachs. The idea for the film came to him when his mother, working in the office of a spray paint company, showed him [...] "gooey stuff" [...] which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material. During writing, Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling. But the final film, with its structure changed by the producers in post-production, has been described by some sources – including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films – as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space. Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight. Sachs, however, had never seen either of those films, and his original screenplay had a very different structure. He had originally written the script for The Incredible Melting Man as a parody of horror films. According to Michael Adams, a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs, this was the reason that the film mixed horror with comedic moments, such as when Steve West's detached ear gets stuck on a tree, and when a janitor sweeps West's melted body into a garbage can {{at the end of the}} film. Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film, including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and say to each other, [...] "You think we've got trouble, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> dude". In Sachs' original version, the film opened with the wide-angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway; this would not have been in slow motion, unlike the final film, where the producers played it back slowed down. Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man. All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re-shot during post-production without influence by the director, and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film. There are logical problems in the final film due to the re-shot scenes; it is never fully explained how West's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed.|$|E
