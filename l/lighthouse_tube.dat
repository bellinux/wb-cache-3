50|$|By 1935 new tube {{technologies}} {{were required}} {{for the development of}} radar and telecommunications. UHF requirements severely limited the existing tubes, so radical ideas were implemented which affected how these tubes connected to the host system. Two new bases appeared, the acorn tube and the <b>lighthouse</b> <b>tube,</b> both solving the same problems but with different approaches. Thompson, G.M. Rose, Saltzberg and Burnside from RCA created the acorn tube by using far smaller electrodes, with radial short connections. A different approach was taken by the designers of the <b>lighthouse</b> <b>tube,</b> such as the octal-base 2C43, which relied on using concentric cylindrical metal contacts in connections that minimized inductance, thus allowing a much higher frequency.|$|E
5000|$|High-frequency {{performance}} {{is limited by}} (1) parasitic lead inductance and capacitance and skin effect, and (2) electron transit time (the time required to travel from cathode to anode). Transit time effects are complicated, but one simple effect is the phase margin; another one is input conductance, also known as grid loading. At extremely high frequencies, electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode. This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low-frequency [...] "open circuit" [...] characteristic. Acorn- as well as <b>Lighthouse</b> <b>tubes</b> and Nuvistors attempt to minimize this effect by arranging cathode, grid(s) and anode as closely spaced together as possible.|$|R
