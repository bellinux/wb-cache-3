40|$|The {{reliability}} of notched composite laminates {{is determined to}} find its worthiness for the intended application and it is affected by various factors, such as, application of fatigue <b>loading,</b> <b>notch</b> location, notch shape and size, etc. In the present work, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the effects of fatigue loading and notch location on the {{reliability of}} notched composite laminates. The reliability values of notched laminates are calculated by using the following parameters: the stress developed in the laminate due to external loading and the strength of the corresponding un-notched laminates. Since composite laminates exhibit stochastic variations in material properties, Stochastic Finite Element Analysis (SFEA) is used to calculate the stresses developed in the laminate. The ultimate strengths of the un-notched laminates are found out experimentally. Tests are conducted on specimens made of NCT 301 graphite/epoxy material to determine the material properties that are required for the SFEA. The material properties are modeled using Markov model based on the test data by two dimensional stochastic processes. Tests are also conducted on center-notched laminates subjected to fatigue loading conditions, Edge-notched laminates and un-notched laminates to determine their ultimate strength values. In practical applications, it is difficult to achieve a perfect circular profile during the drilling operation of notched composite laminates and {{there is a possibility that}} the drilled hole is offset from the desired location. These imperfections affect the reliability of the notched laminate. In the present work the perturbation in the circular profile of the hole is modeled using a hypotrochoid variation and the location of the hole center is modeled using a Gaussian random variable. The ultimate strength values of center-notched laminates subjected to fatigue loading conditions, Edge-notched laminates and un-notched laminates, obtained from experiments are used to determine the sets of characteristic length values for both the point stress criterion and average stress criterion. The distributions of the strength and characteristic length of laminates are determined. Stochastic simulations are performed on the laminates by subjecting them to tensile load. Probabilistic moments of the point stress and average stress parameters are found out for controlled hole and un-controlled hole laminates. The reliability values are calculated for the center-notched laminates subjected to fatigue loading conditions and Edge-notched laminates using point stress criterion and average stress criterion by combining the SFEA and experimental results...|$|E

40|$|In this work, crack {{initiation}} from a notch tip in elements {{subjected to a}} mixed mode loading was studied. Two phenomenological criteria, based on a concept of Leguillon, were proposed and applied to predict {{crack initiation}} from a V-notch tip in a brittle or quasibrittle material. The first criterion, called in this paper the G-σ criterion, makes use of the critical strain energy release rate and the ultimate tensile stress as the main parameters of fracture. It requires calculations of strain energy release rate after an infinitesimal crack kinking. By means of some numerical effort, we established the indispensable relationships between the strain energy release rate after crack kinking and the remote mixed mode loads. These relationships enabled us to apply directly the proposed criterion to mixed-mode <b>loaded</b> <b>notches.</b> We also modified the strain energy density criterion proposed by Sih {{on the basis of}} Leguillon’s concept to form a criterion capable of predicting the crack initiation from a V-notch tip. This criterion, which we call the S-σ criterion, benefits from its simplicity in applications. Confrontation with experimental data shows that both the criteria enable reasonably accurate prediction of fracture in elements with V-notches subjected to mixed mode loading. Consequently, they can be effectively applied in practical engineering applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of the}} Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) in estimating static strength of notched additively manufactured PLA as both notch sharpness and infill angle vary. The TCD takes as its starting point the assumption that the extent of damage under static loading can be assessed successfully by using two different material parameters, i. e. (i) a critical distance whose length is closely related to the material microstructural features and an inherent (i. e., a defect free) material strength. Plain and notched specimens of 3 D-printed PLA were manufactured horizontally by making the deposition angle vary in the range 0 °- 90 °. Using the TCD {{in the form of the}} Point Method, failures were predicted by directly post-processing the linear-elastic stress fields estimated through the well-known analytical solutions due to Glinka and Newport. Independently of the notch sharpness, the estimates being obtained were found to be highly accurate, falling within an error interval of about 20 %. This result fully supports the idea that the TCD can successfully be used in situations of practical interest to design against static <b>loading</b> <b>notched</b> components of additively manufactured PLA by directly post-processing the results from simple linear-elastic Finite Element (FE) models...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{reflected}} caustics {{was extended to}} evaluate the complex stress intensity factors at the roots of re-entrant comers in elastic plates under generalized plane-stress conditions. The plates were considered loaded under a general mode of loading creating asymmetric stress states at the corners and, thus, engendering complex stress intensity factors at these zones. For {{the evaluation of the}} complex stress intensity factors the coordinates of at least two points on the caustics are necessary whose polar coordinates on the respective initial curves on the specimen are defined in advance. These experimental data must be introduced into a system of six equations, four of which are linear and the remaining two non-linear. The solution of this system yields the components of the complex stress intensity factors with a high accuracy, independently of the form and shape of the caustics developed around the roots of the corners. This high accuracy was achieved among others by the fact that two terms in the asymptotic expansion of Muskhelishvili's complex stress function @(z) are taken into consideration for the evaluation of stress intensity factors. The method was applied first to a symmetric notch whose theoretical solution is known, so that the accuracy ofthe method could be checked, and afterwards to an asymmetrically <b>loaded</b> <b>notch</b> whose theoretical solution does not exist. For this case a recurrent procedure was applied for checking the accuracy of the experimental results. ...|$|R

40|$|The present paper summarises {{an attempt}} of reformulating the {{so-called}} Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) {{to make it}} suitable for estimating finite life of notched components subjected to variable amplitude (VA) uniaxial fatigue loading. In more detail, similar to the design strategy we have suggested as being followed under constant amplitude (CA) loading, the VA linear-elastic formalisation of the TCD proposed here takes {{as a starting point}} the assumption that the critical distance value is a material property whose length decreases with increasing of the number of cycles to failure. Through a systematic validation exercise done using ad hoc generated experimental results, it was shown that the TCD, applied in the form of both the Point (PM), Line (LM), and Area Method (AM), is successful in estimating VA lifetime of notched metallic materials by simply calculating an equivalent critical distance having length which depends not only on the features of the assessed load spectrum, but also on the profile of the post-processed stress field. The accuracy and reliability of this alternative formalisation of the TCD was checked by using numerous experimental results generated by testing, under fully-reversed VA axial <b>loading,</b> <b>notched</b> cylindrical samples of a commercial medium-carbon steel containing three different stress raisers. Further, in order to more accurately verify the sensitivity of the proposed definition for the VA critical length to the features of the assessed load history, two spectra were investigated: the first one was characterised by a conventional Rayleigh distribution, whereas the second was used to study the effect of those cycles of low stress amplitude. Such a validation exercise allowed us to prove that the TCD is highly accurate also in estimating fatigue damage in notched components subjected to VA loading: this result is definitely encouraging, fully supporting the idea that the TCD can safely be used to design real notched components damaged by in-service VA load histories...|$|R
