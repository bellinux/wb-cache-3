5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, <b>lymphedema,</b> or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and <b>lymphedema,</b> usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and <b>lymphedema</b> in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E

5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or <b>lymphedema.</b> Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
40|$|Limbedemas of lymphatic origin, either primary, or secondary, {{represent}} a chronic disease sometimes heavy to bear by patients {{who suffer from}} them. These <b>lymphedemas</b> imply specific care by physical therapists trained to the use of different therapeutic approaches. Until a few years, only the treatments of secondary <b>lymphedemas</b> after radiotherapy and/or complete nodal dissection for cancer were reimbursed by the national health insurance system in Belgium. The introduction of the primary congenital <b>lymphedemas</b> as a disease also reimbursed raised several problems and led to a redefinition of these situations and of their cares. The definition and classification of the <b>lymphedemas</b> in view of the reimbursement of their treatments by the national health insurance system are now officially based (not only on the sole clinical history but) mainly on their clinical severity and/or also on the result of their lymphoscintigraphic investigation (according to a methodological protocol and to diagnostic criteria adopted at the national level). The reimbursements of the treatments by the physical therapists were also adapted and improved. The lymphocintigraphic investigations of the limbedemas became so essential in the management of the lymphedematous situations and in the reimbursement of their physical treatments in Belgium. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|This study evaluates {{long-term}} {{results of}} the treatment of peripheral <b>lymphedemas</b> by the microsurgical reconstructive technique of interposed vein grafts. The technique consists {{of the use of}} autologous vein grafts to reconstruct lymphatic pathways where there is a block to the lymphatic circulation of the limb, whether of congenital or acquired etiology. The venous segment represents a sort of "bridge" between afferent and efferent lymphatic collectors (lymphatic-venouslymphatic plasty [LVLA]). The results also proved to have positive long-term effects after microsurgical operation. Follow-up evaluation was performed clinically by water volumetry and instrumentally by lymphangioscintigraphy. With this LVLA technique, peripheral <b>lymphedemas</b> can be treated when derivative lymphovenous shunts cannot be used because of impaired venous circulation in the same lymphedematous limb.

5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and <b>lymphedema,</b> along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E

25|$|Most studies {{investigating}} the effects exercise {{in patients with}} <b>lymphedema</b> or at risk of developing <b>lymphedema</b> examined patients with breast-cancer-related <b>lymphedema.</b> In these studies, resistance training did not increase swelling in patients with pre-existing <b>lymphedema</b> and decreases edema in some patients, {{in addition to other}} potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Moreover, resistance training and other forms of exercise were not associated with an increased risk of developing <b>lymphedema</b> in patients who previously received breast cancer-related treatment. Compression garments should be worn during exercise (with the possible exception of swimming in some patients). Patients who have or risk <b>lymphedema</b> should consult their physician or certified <b>lymphedema</b> therapist before beginning an exercise regimen.

On the opposite site it has it's significant morbidity including bladder and rectal dysfunctions, <b>lymphedemas,</b> and deterioration in patient's sexual life. Methods: Data of forty one patients undergoing radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer were used for analysis, as well as data of forty nine patients undergoing simple hysterectomy for benign gynacologic disease and fifty three healthy controls Participants filled out sexual function {{and quality of life}} questionnaires before surgery and three and six months postoperatively. Results: The most important finding was statistically significant worsening in objective arousal in cervical cancer patients (p = 0, 041).

40|$|The author reports his {{experience}} with 32 cases of lymphatic-venous-lymphatic anastomoses (LVLA), an alternative microsurgical solution, personally conceived, proposed {{for the treatment of}} chronic <b>lymphedemas</b> of limbs, particularly in those cases in which there exists a venous disease associated with the lymphatic one in the same limb and, therefore, in which the most common lymphatic-venous anastomoses (LVA) would not be indicated. The preliminary diagnostic investigations, including lymphoscintigraphy, lymphography, and above all, the venous flowmetry and manometry be Doppler's method, {{play an important role in}} a precise choice of the indications for this kind of microsurgical technique, for they allow the investigator to point out, besides the lymphatic stasis, a more or less disguised venous pathology. The author's microsurgical method consists in the interposition of venous grafts, more or less long and with a suitable caliber, between lymphatic vessels placed upon and below the obstacle to the lymphatic circulation of the limb. The results of this personal LVLA microsurgical technique proved to be very satisfactory.

40|$|The {{generation}} of new lymphatic vessels through lymphangiogenesis has {{been implicated in}} many disease states. This process has some overlap with the better studied angiogenesis pathway, but is under distinct molecular control. Specifically, {{it has been shown}} that VEGFR- 3 and neuropilin- 2 are important mediators of lymphangiogenesis. A greater understanding of this process could lead to new therapies for cancer and <b>lymphedemas.</b> We investigated lymphatic vessel growth in a mouse model with a focus on the effects of neuropilin- 2 knockout. First, we induced an immunogenic response via delayed-type hypersensitivity to examine lymphangiogenesis in the physiologic state. Our neuropilin- 2 knockout mouse model displayed a decreased ability to resolve inflammation on exposure to an allergen. Next, we subcutaneously injected a highly invasive melanoma to examine lymphangiogenesis in the pathologic state. We noted significantly reduced tumor growth in our neuropilin- 2 knockout. In addition, the neuropilin- 2 knockout mice displayed reduced vessel area in comparison to their wild-type littermates, suggesting that inhibition of neuropilin- 2 may prove a potent antitumor therapeutic strategy. These results highlight neuropilin- 2 's important role as a mediator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis...|$|R

30|$|Limb volume {{measurements}} {{are used for}} evaluating growth of muscle mass and effectivity of strength training. Beside sport sciences, it is used e.g. for detection of oedemas, <b>lymphedemas</b> or carcinomas or for examinations of muscle atrophy.

The aim of this paper is to determine and experimentally verify their accuracy and compare them among each other. Water Displacement Method (WD), three methods based on circumferential measures—Frustum Sign Model (FSM), Disc Model (DM), Partial Frustum Model (PFM) and two 3 D scan based methods Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were compared. Precise reference cylinders and limbs of two human subjects were measured 10 times by each method. Personal dependency of methods was also tested by measuring 10 times the same object by 3 different people. Accuracies: WD 0.3  %, FSM 2 – 8  % according person, DM, PFM 1 – 8  %, MRI 2  % (hand) or 8  % (finger), CT 0.5  % (hand) or 2  % (finger);times: FSM 1  min, CT 7  min, WD, DM, PFM 15  min, MRI 19  min; and more. WD was found as the best method for most of uses with best accuracy. The CT disposes with almost the same accuracy and allows measurements of specific regions (e.g. particular muscles), as same as MRI, which accuracy is worse though, but it is not harmful. Frustum Sign Model is usable for very fast estimation of limb volume, but with lower accuracy, Disc Model and Partial Frustum Model is useful in cases when Water Displacement cannot be used.|$|R

Voluntária de 27 anos, apresentava-se com uma equimose importante na região lateral da coxa esquerda (28 x 9, 5 cm), telangiectasias, microvaricosidades e petéquias em ambas as coxas e pernas, dor de forte intensidade e edema, após ter se submetido a um procedimento manual iatrogênico com finalidade estética há dois dias. As condutas fisioterapêuticas adotadas foram: Ultrassom 3 MHz, pulsado (2 ms on, 8 ms off), 0, 4 W/cm² SATP na região da equimose e DLM (Método Leduc) durante 20 minutos, na coxa esquerda.

40|$|Einleitung: Die Sentinel-Node-Biopsie (SLNB) ist eine anerkannte chirurgische Stagingmaßnahme und ein etabliertes minimal-invasives Verfahren bei der Behandlung des kleinen, unifokalen und klinisch nodalnegativen Mammakarzinoms. Die axilläre Lymphonodektomie, welche als bisherige Operationstechnik {{verwendet}} wurde, ist mit einer erheblichen Morbidität verbunden. Deshalb hat man verstärkt nach alternativen Operationsmethoden gesucht, welche die Morbidität vor allem beim nodalnegativen Mammakarzinom senken, ohne dabei die Staginggenauigkeit zu reduzieren. Fragestellung: Ziel dieser retrospektiven Studie war die Validität der SLNB beim Mammakarzinom zu untersuchen und zu prüfen, inwieweit die SLNB den bisher operativen Goldstandard der Axilladissektion von Level I und II ersetzen kann. Material und Methoden: Das Patientengut der Studie stammt aus der Gynäkologischen Abteilung des Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus in Stuttgart und umfasst 369 Patientinnen mit histologisch gesichertem Mammakarzinom, die sich im Zeitraum von Dezember 1997 bis Dezember 2003 einer operativen Behandlung unterzogen haben. Ergebnisse:. Die 5 -Jahres-Überlebensrate der Sentinelpatientinnen lag in Stadium I bei 96, 8 % und in Stadium II bei 94, 2 %, versus 85 % in Stadium I und 40 - 60 % in Stadium II aller Patientinnen mit Mammakarzinom. Die Prognose unserer Studienpatientinnen war damit deutlich besser als die Prognose aller Patientinnen mit Mammakarzinom Die 5 -Jahres-Überlebensrate der Sentinelpatientinnen wurde mit einer an Operationsjahr und T-Stadium angepassten Patientengruppe verglichen, welche allerdings nicht mit SLNB behandelt worden war. Bei diesem Vergleich war die 5 -Jahres-Überlebensrate der Sentinelpatientinnen nur minimal verbessert (87, 96 % beim Sentinelkollektiv und 84, 33 % in der zweiten Gruppe). Die Prognose der Patientinnen wird daher durch eine SLNB nicht benachteiligt. Mit einer Falsch-Negativ-Rate von 1, 8 % wies die SLNB in unserer Studie eine hohe Zuverlässigkeit für die Prädiktion des Nodalstatus auf (untersucht bei 111 Patientinnen wobei SLNB als auch konventionelle Axilladissektion angewendet wurden). Die postoperative Morbidität nach SLNB war mit 4, 7 % deutlich geringer als diese nach Axilladissektion (14 %). In der Studiengruppe sind bislang keine Lymphödeme aufgetreten, jedoch 2 axilläre Rezidive. Bei diesen Rezidiven handelte es sich allerdings um Patientinnen, welche nicht die Einschlusskriterien unserer Studie erfüllten und auf ihren Wunsch hin mit einer SLNB behandelt worden waren. Schlussfolgerung: Zusammenfassend halten wir die SLNB für eine sichere, zuverlässige und komplikationsarme Methode, die unter der Voraussetzung einer geeigneten Patientinnenselektion sowie einer standardisierten und qualitätsgesicherten Durchführung, eine geeignete Technik für das axilläre Staging beim Mammakarzinom darstellt und als Alternative zur konventionellen Axilladissektion angeboten werden kann. Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) is an acknowledged {{minimally invasive}} procedure in treatment of breast cancer and surgical staging of patients with small, unifocal and clinically nodal negative disease. Axillary lymph node dissection, the operative technique used so far, produces a significant postoperative morbidity. Therefore, an alternative technique, reducing the morbidity {{particularly in the case}} of nodal negative carcinoma without reduction of staging quality, must be found. Aim: In this retrospective study we tried to examine the validity of SLNB in cases of breast cancer and verify if axillary lymph node dissection (so called 'golden standard') of level I and II, can be replaced. Material and Methods: Based on the clinical records at Robert Bosch Hospital-Stuttgart (Department of Gynecology), all 369 patients had histologically proven breast cancer and were surgically treated from December 1997 to December 2003. Results: Compared to all breast cancer patients the prognosis of the study patients was clearly better. The five-year-survival rate of the sentinel patients was 96, 8 % at stage I and 94, 2 % at stage II versus 85 % and 40 - 60 % respectively for all breast cancer patients. Comparing the five-year-survival rate of our study group to a patient group with equally adapted year of operation and T-stage without SLNB treatment, only a minimal improved five-year-survival rate could be observed (87. 9 % study patients versus 84. 3 % adapted group). Although the prognosis of sentinel patients did not improve, it definitely did not get worse comparing to patients without SLNB. We conclude that SLNB with a false-negative-rate of 1, 8 % (examined at 111 cases who underwent both SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection), was highly reliable in predicting the nodal status in our breast cancer patients. After SLNB the postoperative morbidity was clearly reduced, i. e. 4, 7 % after SLNB versus 14 % after axillary lymph node dissection. No <b>lymphedemas</b> have occurred so far in our study group. Until now two axillary lymph node recurrences have occurred in the sentinel patients group. However, these were patients who did not fulfill the criteria to be included in our study, but who nevertheless decided to be treated with SLNB. Conclusion: We consider SLNB to be a safe, reliable and minimal invasive method for breast cancer staging. In clinical practice SLNB can be performed {{as an alternative to the}} axillary lymph node dissection if done after a careful selection of patients and a standardized quality controlled treatment protocol...|$|R
