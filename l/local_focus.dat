25|$|Hitherto {{railways}} in {{the region}} had had a <b>local</b> <b>focus,</b> but now the Great North of England Railway (GNER) obtained authorising Acts to build from Newcastle to York, forming part of a continuous trunk railway network to connect to London; the project was controlled by George Hudson, the so-called Railway King. At first the GNER was content {{to get access to}} the N Newcastle terminus, by connecting with the N at Redheugh and running over its line across the Tyne and up to the Spital. This had the advantage of avoiding a separate, and expensive, crossing of the river, but would have meant a steep descent to Redheugh as the GNER line approached on high ground from the Team Valley, only to climb once again to the Spital. Moreover William Brandling had made known his intention to reach Newcastle from his line by running at a high level through Gateshead. On 25 April 1837 the N decided to build to their south side, low level terminus at Redheugh, but to leave the issue of the Tyne crossing open.|$|E

40|$|Organizations contain {{multiple}} social foci – {{settings for}} interaction providing organizational members with occasions for structuring their social relations. In this paper we examine how identification with particular social foci within organizations influences the propensity of adviceseeking ties to cross-cut {{the boundaries of}} organizational sub-units. We propose and test a theory of relationship formation based {{on the strength of}} identification of organizational members with social foci. We expect that advice relations of organizational members identifying more strongly with <b>local</b> <b>foci</b> (organizational sub-units) {{will be more likely to}} be contained within their boundaries. By contrast, we expect that advice relations of organizational members identifying more strongly with a global focus (the organization as a whole) will be more likely to cross-cut the boundaries defined around <b>local</b> <b>foci.</b> We test these hypotheses on data that we have collected on advice-seeking relations among members of the top management team in an industrial multi-unit group which comprises five distinct subsidiary companies. Results show that identification with social foci affects the formation of cross-cutting network ties over and above the effect of the formal organizational boundaries that encircle the foci. More specifically, we find that organizational members who identify strongly with <b>local</b> <b>foci</b> (subsidiaries, in our case) tend to seek advice within such <b>local</b> <b>foci,</b> while organizational members who identify strongly with a global focus (corporate, in our case) tend to be sources of advice across the boundaries of the <b>local</b> <b>foci</b> in which they participate. Crossboundary advice ties are less likely to occur among managers who identify strongly with their subsidiaries, but only weakly with the corporate group. As a consequence, identification with <b>local</b> <b>foci</b> constrains knowledge transfer relations within the boundaries of such foci. On the contrary, cross-boundary advice ties are more likely to occur among managers who identify strongly with the corporate group, but only weakly with their subsidiary. As a consequence, identification with a global focus activates knowledge transfer across the boundaries of <b>local</b> <b>foci...</b>|$|R

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of the decade, the Australian heavy metal music scene was a {{well-established}} underground culture. Small metal labels like Modern Invasion in Melbourne and Warhead Records in Sydney were strong supporters of local acts and both cities had particularly flourishing live metal circuits with established venues for bands to play. The smaller centres also harboured well-developed metal scenes, although Brisbane and particularly Perth were cut off from the growing south-east coast touring circuit by immense distances, for this reason Perth band [...] made the relocation to Sydney after being signed to Warhead Records. Nevertheless, Australian metal bands were receiving more media coverage than ever before. As more local releases appeared, more were being added to the playlists of community radio and to 3 Hours of Power, and a second magazine with a metal focus had started to circulate. Hot Metal had become simply HM in the early 1990s in order to widen its coverage to include other alternative music styles in the wake of grunge and many metal fans had expressed a belief that the magazine no longer catered to their tastes. An offshoot of Sydney street paper On the Street, Rebel Razor was launched at the Alternative Nation Festival in 1995. Produced on news print at a cheaper cost than HM, Rebel Razor did not cover metal exclusively either but it had a more prominent <b>local</b> <b>focus.</b>|$|E

Deputy Mayor, Cllr Mc Kevitt said, ‘It {{is a great idea}} to give an issue that has an international perspective a <b>local</b> <b>focus.</b> All men need to look after their health and take advantage of the services and help that is out there, as we all do. But it is particularly good to see an event that looks at the barriers that young men may be facing and brings together people from all organisations across the district to look at {{what can be done to}} work together to make things better.' The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that are out there for young men today. Also in attendance was Jerome Burns, Assistant Director, Department for Social Development.

[...] This training program may be offered by private companies, by community colleges, or by some large EMS systems which are self-dispatching. [...] The minimum length of such training is 32 classroom hours, covering such topics as EMD Roles and Responsibilities, Legal and Liability Issues in EMD, National and State Standards for EMD, Resource Allocation, Layout and Structure of EMD Guidecards, Obtaining Information from Callers, Anatomy and Physiology, Chief Complaint Types, Quality Assurance & Recertification and Stress Management. [...] Certification in CPR is not mandatory, but {{upon completion of the}} training, students are required to sit a certification examination. [...] Upon completion of the training and certification, Emergency Medical Dispatchers are required to complete 24 hours of Continuing Dispatch Education every two years, in order to maintain certification. [...] This level of training and certification only satisfies the national curriculum, and in most cases, additional training will be required. [...] Additional training will have a <b>local</b> <b>focus,</b> and will deal with local geographical knowledge, dispatch procedures, local laws and service policy. [...] Additional training may be required to orient new emergency medical dispatchers to different forms of 9-1-1 telecommunication (if this will be a part of their job function). [...] This may also include (depending on the jurisdiction) EFD (Emergency Fire Dispatching), EPD (Emergency Police Dispatching), ETC (emergency telecommunication), ECE (Executive Certification Course), CMC (Communication Center Manager), when such services are jointly operated. [...] Similar courses are also generally available in Law Enforcement Dispatch (LED), Fire Service Dispatch (FSD), and Public Safety Dispatch (PSD), designed for those working in a multi-agency 9-1-1 call center that handles police, fire and EMS dispatching.|$|E
