40|$|Macroautophagy has {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} important catabolic process involved not only in innate immunity but also in adaptive immunity. Initially described to deliver intracellular antigens to MHC class II <b>loading</b> <b>compartments,</b> its molecular machinery has now also been described to enhance the delivery of extracellular antigens to MHC class II <b>loading</b> <b>compartments</b> by accelerating phagosome maturation. Therefore in pathological situations (viral or bacterial infections, tumorigenesis) the pathway might be involved in shaping CD 4 + T cell responses. In this chapter we describe three basic experiments for the monitoring and manipulation of macroautophagic antigen processing towards MHC class II presentation. Firstly, we will discuss how to monitor autophagic flux and autophagosome fusion with MHC class II <b>loading</b> <b>compartments.</b> Secondly, we will show how to target proteins to autophagosomes in order to monitor macroautophagy-dependent antigen processing via their enhanced presentation on MHC class II molecules to CD 4 + T cells.

MethodsSubjects from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study aged 50 – 79 years with or {{at high risk of}} knee osteoarthritis were studied. Full-limb radiographs were taken at baseline and hip–knee–ankle mechanical axis was measured. Baseline and 30 -month magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of knees (n =  1782) were semiquantitatively assessed for BMLs. Outcome was defined as a change in BML score in femoral/tibial condyle in medial/lateral compartments. Medial compartment in varus alignment and lateral compartment in valgus alignment were combined to form ‘more loaded’ compartment, while lateral compartment in valgus and medial compartment in varus were combined to form ‘less loaded’ compartment. Relative risk (RR) of BML score increase or decrease in relation to malalignment was estimated using a log linear regression model with the Poisson assumption, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, physical activity scale for the elderly, race and clinic site. Further, results were stratified by ipsilateral meniscal and cartilage status at baseline. ResultsBaseline varus alignment was associated with higher risk of BML score increase from baseline to follow-up in the medial compartment [adjusted RRs (95 %CI) : 1. 5 (1. 2 – 1. 9) ] and valgus alignment in the lateral compartment [1. 4 (1. 0 – 2. 1) ]. Increase in BML score was more likely in the more <b>loaded</b> <b>compartments</b> [1. 7 (1. 4 – 2. 0) ] in malaligned knees. Regardless of ipsilateral cartilage or meniscus status, adjusted RR for BML score increase was higher in the more <b>loaded</b> <b>compartments</b> of malaligned knees than those with neutral alignment.

40|$|Cross-presentation of IgG-containing immune {{complexes}} (ICs) is {{an important}} means by which dendritic cells (DCs) activate CD 8 + T cells, yet it proceeds by an incompletely understood mechanism. We show that monocyte-derived CD 8 −CD 11 b+ DCs require the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) to conduct cross-presentation of IgG ICs. Consequently, {{in the absence of}} FcRn, Fcγ receptor (FcγR) -mediated antigen uptake fails to initiate cross-presentation. FcRn is shown to regulate the intracellular sorting of IgG ICs to the proper destination for such cross-presentation to occur. We demonstrate that FcRn traps antigen and protects it from degradation within an acidic <b>loading</b> <b>compartment</b> in association with the rapid recruitment of key components of the phagosome-to-cytosol cross-presentation machinery. This unique mechanism thus enables cross-presentation to evolve from an atypically acidic <b>loading</b> <b>compartment.</b> FcRn-driven cross-presentation is further shown to control cross-priming of CD 8 + T-cell responses in vivo such that during chronic inflammation, FcRn deficiency results in inadequate induction of CD 8 + T cells. These studies thus demonstrate that cross-presentation in CD 8 −CD 11 b+ DCs requires a two-step mechanism that involves FcγR-mediated internalization and FcRn-directed intracellular sorting of IgG ICs. Given the centrality of FcRn in controlling cross-presentation, these studies lay the foundation for a unique means to therapeutically manipulate CD 8 + T-cell responses...|$|R
40|$|The HLA-DR {{hemizygous}} B-lymphoblastoid cell line, 10. 24. 6, has a {{mutation in}} DRα (Pro 96 →Ser) {{that creates a}} novel glycosylation site (Asn 94). The mutant DR molecules in 10. 24. 6 remain associated with peptide fragments of invariant chain, CLIP, instead of associating with antigenic peptides. In addition, the mutation impairs the interaction of DR dimers from 10. 24. 6 with HLA-DM. We analyzed the mechanism by which the mutation alters antigen presentation to elucidate steps in DR biosynthesis which are required for peptide loading and to determine steps in DR biosynthesis which require an interaction with DM. ^ We first determined which of the alterations to the DRα chain in 10. 24. 6, the amino acid substitution or the novel glycosylation, cause the observed phenotype. After inhibiting N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin, the differences in SDS-stability of HLA-DR molecules between progenitor 8. 1. 6 and mutant 10. 24. 6 are greatly reduced. In addition, a transfectant expressing mutant DRα with Pro 96 →Ala which does not undergo novel glycosylation has normal HLA-DR antigen presentation. Together these data indicate that the novel glycan is the primary factor in the disrupted antigen presentation by the mutant DR dimers in the 10. 24. 6 cells. ^ To evaluate whether the mutant DR molecules in 10. 24. 6 undergo altered maturation besides the impaired release of CLIP, we used metabolic labeling and subcellular fractionation. The DR molecules from 10. 24. 6 showed a slight delay in transit through the Golgi apparatus and into the peptide <b>loading</b> <b>compartment,</b> but no alteration in trafficking of the mutant DR molecules was detected.

These comparisons of progenitor 8. 1. 6, DMS-null 9. 5. 3, and DR-mutant 10. 24. 6 demonstrate that DM is not required for the formation of the peptide <b>loading</b> <b>compartment</b> and is not required for DR to access this compartment. ...|$|R

Usually the heavy wheeled vehicles are needed because of high own mass of buoyant segment and large gauges. The exploitation of such constructions is very expensive.

Strikingly, mice with disrupted DC ITAMs show defective T helper cell priming in vivo and are protected from experimental autoimmune encephalitis.

Therefore, MHC class II presentation of antigens that are targeted to autophagosomes {{can be used to}} investigate regulation events of the macroautophagy pathway. We fuse antigens to Atg 8 /LC 3 for targeting to autophagosomes, because this ubiquitin-like protein is selectively coupled to autophagosome membranes, and the portion that is coupled to the inner autophagosome membrane is degraded with this membrane in lysosomes. The localization of these fusion antigens in MHC class II <b>loading</b> <b>compartments</b> can be visualized by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, and used as a measure of autophagic amphisome generation.

Autoimmune gastritis is caused by CD 4 + T cells directed to the alpha (H/Kalpha) and beta (H/Kbeta) subunits of the gastric membrane protein the H+/K+ ATPase. H/Kalpha mRNA is expressed in the thymus, but H/Kbeta expression is barely detectable. In this study, we demonstrate that thymic H/Kalpha in wild-type mice or mice that overexpressed H/Kalpha did not result in negative selection of pathogenic anti-H/Kalpha T cells. However, negative selection of anti-H/Kalpha T cells did occur if H/Kbeta was artificially overexpressed in the thymus. Given that H/Kalpha cannot be exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and is rapidly degraded in the absence of H/Kbeta, we conclude that H/Kalpha epitopes are unable to access MHC class II <b>loading</b> <b>compartments</b> in cells of the normal thymus.

40|$|In {{response}} to inflammatory stimuli, dendritic cells (DCs) trigger {{the process of}} maturation, a terminal differentiation program required to initiate T-lymphocyte responses. A hallmark of maturation is down-regulation of endocytosis, which is widely assumed to restrict the ability of mature DCs to capture and present antigens encountered after the initial stimulus. We found that mature DCs continue to accumulate antigens, especially by receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis. Internalized antigens are transported normally to late endosomes and lysosomes, loaded onto MHC class II molecules (MHCII), and then presented efficiently to T cells. This occurs {{despite the fact that}} maturation results in the general depletion of MHCII from late endocytic compartments, with MHCII enrichment being typically thought to be a required feature of antigen processing and peptide <b>loading</b> <b>compartments.</b> Internalized antigens can also be cross-presented on MHC class I molecules, without any reduction in efficiency relative to immature DCs.
