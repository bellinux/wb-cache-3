The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the <b>learner</b> to a situation to help both the <b>learner</b> and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the <b>learner</b> to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the <b>learner</b> already knows.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this study is to develop an {{attitude}} scale toward Internet-based learning (IBL) and to investigate whether attitude levels of Turkish distance <b>learners</b> in an IBL environment differ according to their demographical characteristics (i. e. age, gender, marital status, parental status, employment status, grade point average (GPA). Research data were gathered from 804 (491 male and 313 female) <b>learners</b> in an IBL environment at Sakarya University, Turkey. Explanatory factor analysis identified three factors with eigenvalues > 1. The scale appears to be a reliable and valid instrument to assess the attitude levels of <b>learners</b> toward IBL. The analyses of demographical characteristic differences on the scale indicate that married <b>learners,</b> working <b>learners</b> and <b>learners</b> with children have significantly higher attitude levels toward IBL than those of unemployed and single <b>learners</b> and <b>learners</b> with no children. Male distance <b>learners</b> demonstrate significantly higher attitude levels than females do on the majority of the subscales. In general, <b>learners</b> over age of 26 have statistically higher attitude levels than those of younger <b>learners.</b> Attitude levels of <b>learners</b> with poor GPAs are significantly lower than those of <b>learners</b> with better GPAs. The findings are consistent with the related literature...|$|R

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on <b>learner</b> outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase <b>learner</b> motivation.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{language learning}} strategies used by Chinese {{as a foreign}} language (CFL) <b>learners</b> in Australia and English as a foreign language (EFL) <b>learners</b> in China through Oxford’s (1990.

Two cohorts of <b>learners,</b> namely Australian CFL <b>learners</b> (N = 101) and Chinese EFL <b>learners</b> (N = 100), participated in this study. It {{was found that the}} most frequently used strategies by the Chinese EFL <b>learners</b> were compensation strategies and the least frequently used strategies were memory strategies while the most frequently used strategies by the Australian CFL <b>learners</b> were social strategies and the least frequently used strategies were affective strategies. Australian female <b>learners</b> used slightly more strategies than male <b>learners,</b> but no difference was found in the strategies used by the Chinese EFL male and female <b>learners.</b> No significant difference was found either in the strategies used by <b>learners</b> of different grade levels, regardless of whether they were Chinese EFL or Australian CFL <b>learners.</b> Scores of some individual categories significantly differed between the three levels of the Australian CFL <b>learners</b> and the four levels of the Chinese EFL <b>learners.</b> In general the Chinese EFL <b>learners</b> used more strategies when compared with those used by the Australian CFL <b>learners.</b> Pedagogical implications of the findings were also discussed. This study contributes to the research in language learning strategies in that it considers the typological distance between learners’ L 1 and the target language for the first time. It also has clarified the seemingly inconsistent findings in the literature in terms of memory strategies use by Asian <b>learners</b> (Chinese <b>learners</b> in this case) : when compared with other categories of strategies, memory strategies were used the least frequently by the Chinese EFL learners; when compared with <b>learners</b> from other cultural backgrounds such as the Australian or American, the Chinese EFL <b>learners</b> used memory strategies more frequently...|$|R

30|$|The {{function}} (a) supports <b>learners</b> to naturally {{shift to}} RPS-based exercises. In general, <b>learners</b> start {{from a single}} problem exercise.

One is that <b>learners</b> consciously choose a RPS by its targeted knowledge and its educational effects. The other is that <b>learners</b> ask an intelligent tutoring system to choose an adequate RPS for the <b>learners</b> based on their solving problems.

25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the <b>learner</b> to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the <b>learner</b> plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the <b>learner</b> plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the <b>learner</b> (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the <b>learner</b> to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, it {{is argued}} that the {{responsibility}} of learning should reside increasingly with the <b>learner</b> (Glasersfeld, 1989). Social constructivism thus emphasizes the importance of the <b>learner</b> being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where the <b>learner</b> played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and reflect what they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world {{even in the absence of}} full or complete information.|$|E
25|$|The {{learning}} environment {{should also be}} designed to support and challenge the learner's thinking (Di Vesta, 1987).
