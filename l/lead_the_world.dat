A prior groin injury had also forced him out of a Panther's home game against the Canucks earlier in the season. During the season, he was named to the 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto, where he {{recorded}} an assist and the eleventh hat trick {{in the history of the}} All-Star Game. Of Bure's three goals, two were assisted by his brother Valeri, who played on the same line with him, along with his Panthers linemate, Viktor Kozlov. Helping <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> team to a 9–4 victory over North America, Bure was named the All-Star Game MVP.|$|E

25|$|Henry Ford's {{first attempt}} at a car company under his own name was the Henry Ford Company on November 3, 1901, which became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name. The Ford Motor Company was {{launched}} in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups {{of two or three}} men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade, the company would <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era.|$|E
25|$|While the {{achievements}} of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) {{pale in comparison to}} the milestones set by the former Soviet Union and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in space exploration. China has been the leader of Asia's space race {{since the beginning of the}} 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.|$|E
25|$|Devonshire took {{an active}} {{interest}} {{in the lives of}} Canadians, and conducted various tours of the country to meet with them. As a land owner himself, the Governor General was particularly focused on the development of farming in Canada and during his travels, at agricultural and horticultural fairs, shows, and sugaring-off parties in the Gatineau, he discussed agricultural issues with farmers and other people in the industry. His speeches often referred to Canada's potential to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in agricultural research and development, and one of his major projects while viceroy was to establish experimental farms, including the Crown's central one in Ottawa. At the same time, Devonshire acted as a patron of the arts; when not on tour or residing at La Citadelle the viceregal residence in Quebec City at which the Duke enjoyed spending time he frequently visited the National Gallery and hosted theatrical performances at Rideau Hall. There, {{on the grounds of the}} royal residence, during the winters, the Devonshires also hosted tobogganing and skating parties, as well as hockey matches. Officially, in 1918 Devonshire travelled to the United States to meet President Woodrow Wilson informally, and the following year, he was host to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, during his first tour of Canada.|$|E

2500|$|... "By {{the early}} 21st century, {{the issue of}} child sexual abuse has become a {{legitimate}} focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery {{of child sexual abuse}} that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> offers grounds for cautious optimism.

2500|$|Asked {{about the}} Australian federal election, 2007 at News Corporation's {{annual general meeting}} in New York on 19 October 2007, its {{chairman}} Rupert Murdoch said, [...] "I am not commenting on {{anything to do with}} Australian politics. I'm sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that." [...] Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: [...] "I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that – the editors." [...] In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was [...] "oversensitive". Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as [...] "...more ambitious to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> [...] than to lead Australia..." [...] and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis of 2008 as unnecessary. Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly [...] that [...] "the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven" [...] as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.|$|E
