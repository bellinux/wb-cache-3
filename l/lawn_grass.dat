5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of <b>lawn</b> <b>grass</b> was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
500|$|When not breeding, the Fiji parrotfinch is gregarious, and {{is usually}} found in small flocks of up to six birds. It feeds on seeds, usually at the [...] "milk" [...] (watery ripe) stage. A {{favourite}} is the Guinea grass, Megathyrsus maximus. The finch will also take seed from rice ears, and its spread into gardens has been aided by another preferred food plant, carpet grass, Axonopus compressus, which is a common <b>lawn</b> <b>grass</b> in Fiji. This finch readily takes insects, often extracted from under loose bark or tree crevices. It also feeds on nectar and small berries. In some areas, this finch's diet may bring it into conflict with rice growers, {{but there is no}} evidence that this protected species is seen as a serious agricultural threat either in Fiji, or in Australia, where it is kept in captivity in small numbers.|$|E

40|$|Premise of research. African grass {{communities}} {{are dominated by}} two distinct functional types: tall, caespitose bunch grasses and short, spreading <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses.</b> Functional type coexistence has been explained by differences in defoliation tolerance, because <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses</b> occur in intensively grazed areas while bunch grasses are less associated with heavy grazing. If different responses to tissue loss explain their distribution, expectations are that biomass production and leaf-level physiology will be negatively impacted in bunch relative to <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses.</b> Methodology. We tested the influence of defoliation on three lawn and three bunch grasses from Tanzania and South Africa by quantifying growth and measuring physiological response of these grasses to simulated herbivory in a glasshouse experiment. Specifically, we measured photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen, and leaf pigment concentrations in leaves of bunch and <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses</b> that were clipped or unclipped. Pivotal results. In contrast to our expectations, clipped <b>lawn</b> and bunch <b>grasses</b> {{did not differ in}} photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen, or biomass production, and both <b>lawn</b> and bunch <b>grasses</b> upregulated photosynthesis in response to clipping. However, defoliated bunch grasses had higher rates of stomatal conductance and transpiration compared with defoliated <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses.</b> Also, leaf carotenoid concentrations increased in response to clipping for both functional types but much more in bunch than in <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses.</b> An analysis of leaf-level physiological relationships with structural equation modeling showed that <b>lawn</b> and bunch <b>grasses</b> exert control over carbon gain in different ways. In bunch grasses, net carbon gain was associated with leaf-level structural properties (LDMC and SLA) that varied in response to defoliation, while in <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses,</b> increased carbon gain was the result of increased leaf [N] subsequent to defoliation. Conclusions.  The varied responses of <b>lawn</b> and bunch <b>grasses</b> to defoliation appear to arise from their different investments in defense and carbon assimilation subsequent to defoliation. Bunch grasses invest relatively more in carotenoid production, likely as a mechanism to enhance regrowth and protect costly leaves from photodamage. Moreover, bunch grasses maintain efficient carbon assimilation by structural adjustments in leaves (decreasing LDMC subsequent to defoliation), while <b>lawn</b> <b>grasses</b> maintain efficient water use by increasing leaf [N] subsequent to defoliation. Thus, we conclude that a key difference between <b>lawn</b> and bunch <b>grasses</b> is not defoliation tolerance per se but physiological adaptations that constrain them to environments with different moisture availability subsequent to defoliation.
