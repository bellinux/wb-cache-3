25|$|The Kindle Paperwhite (1st generation) was {{announced}} on September 6, 2012, and released on October 1. It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the hall effect sensor in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one will finish a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for page turning and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> place, which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{opened the}} case for the plaintiff, telling the jury that [...] "It is a simple question, aye or no, did Sir William Gordon-Cumming cheat at cards?" [...] After {{describing}} Gordon-Cumming's background and record, he explained the rules of baccarat, which he described as [...] "the most unintelligent mode of <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> own money, or getting somebody else's, I ever heard of". Clarke also outlined Gordon-Cumming's [...] system of placing bets which, he explained, could have been mistaken by the inexperienced players as cheating, rather than a correct method of gambling. After his opening speech, Clarke then questioned Gordon-Cumming, and his approach was to show that Gordon-Cumming [...] "was a man of honour who had been sacrificed to save the courtiers".|$|E
500|$|Madonna has {{received}} acclaim {{as a role}} model for businesswomen in her industry, [...] "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2billion in sales within the first decade of her career. Professor Colin Barrow from Cranfield School of Management described Madonna as [...] "America's smartest businesswoman... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself." [...] London Business School academics called her a [...] "dynamic entrepreneur" [...] worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that [...] "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> close ones. But that hardly mattered to her." [...] Hazel Blackmore and Rafael Fernández de Castro in the book ¿Qué es Estados Unidos? from the Fondo de Cultura Económica, noted: [...] "Madonna has been undoubtedly the most important woman in the history of popular music and a great businesswoman in herself; creating fashion, breaking taboos and provoking controversies." [...] According to Forbes, Madonna is the wealthiest woman in the music business.|$|E
2500|$|Newman {{retired from}} acting in May 2007, saying [...] "You start to <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> memory, {{you start to}} <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> confidence, you start to <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> invention. So I think that's pretty much a closed book for me." [...] He came out of {{retirement}} to record narration for the 2007 documentary Dale, {{about the life of}} NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, and for the 2008 documentary The Meerkats.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, {{the game}} {{supplement}} Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>Your</b> Mind won the Indie RPG Awards for Indie Supplement of the Year. Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>Your</b> Mind won the Silver ENnie for Best Writing, {{and was also}} nominated for Product of the Year.|$|R
500|$|The {{race was}} met by anti-Trump protests in the first-stage {{finishing}} town of New Paltz, New York, where demonstrators held placards reading [...] "Fight Trumpism", [...] "Die Yuppie $cum", [...] "The Art of the Deal = The Rich Get Richer" [...] and [...] "Trump = Lord of the Flies". The 1989 race was won by the Norwegian rider Dag Otto Lauritzen of the American team 7-Eleven, although there was some controversy about the result as Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden, who had won four stages and was expected {{to take the lead}} in the general classification in the final stage time trial in Atlantic City but took a wrong turn following a race motorbike. The Soviet rider Viatcheslav Ekimov, who took part as an amateur, won the first stage of the race (following a prologue time trial). Articles published the following year reported that Ekimov [...] "had had the nerve to win a stage as an amateur... and some pros reportedly rewarded him by jamming a feed bag into his wheel", and that he [...] "threatened to win the Tour de Trump last year as an amateur before the pros banded together to eliminate any chance he had of winning". Nonetheless, the first edition of the race was described as [...] "a smashing success" [...] in Sports Illustrated, which noted: [...] "If you could get past the name, the Tour de Trump, without <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> lunch, and if you could somehow divorce the sporting event from the excess baggage that went with it... what you had was a pretty nice bicycle race".|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the series}} began on 12 August 1986 with the first block of episodes—"An Instinct for Murder", [...] "Conversations with the Dead" [...] and [...] "Intelligent Listening for Beginners"—directed by Christopher Baker. This was {{followed}} by a block directed by Graeme Harper comprising [...] "Trivial Games and Paranoid Pursuits", [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" [...] and [...] "In Warm Blood". Christopher Baker then returned to the director's chair for [...] "A Double Life" [...] and [...] "Other People's Secrets". Both directors had differing visions for the overall look and feel {{of the series}}, with the initial block directed by Baker favouring a pristine, brightly lit approach. This contrasted with the look preferred by Graeme Harper who drastically reduced the light levels (leaving many scenes illuminated only by computer monitor screens) and whose designer, Malcolm Thornton, dressed the sets in a messier and dingier fashion. When Baker returned for his second block of episodes, he sought to return to the brighter, cleaner look which led to some continuity problems. Meanwhile, Evgeny Gridneff and Chris Boucher's professional relationship continued to be stormy with Gridneff deciding to introduce a new Star Cop, Anna Shoun, without consulting Boucher. The cast and crew were well aware of the behind the scenes conflicts and David Calder later recalled that there was [...] "uncertainty as to which direction this series should go in". Chris Boucher has been frequently critical {{of the way in which}} the series was realised and has since stated that, in retrospect, he wishes he had volunteered to produce the series himself. In response to Boucher's criticisms, Gridneff has said, [...] "I respect him as a writer and he's professional and, you know, it's his series and if it didn't quite go the way he thought, you know, that's unfortunate when you're dealing, you know, you're <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> baby".|$|E
2500|$|This [...] "opaque" [...] {{technique}} has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film {{there are moments}} when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something and you feel like you are <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lose</b> <b>Your</b> Marbles was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 [...] "Puzzle Game of the Year" [...] award, which {{ultimately}} went to Smart Games Challenge 2.

2500|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative condition that gradually destroys the abilities to remember, reason, {{and engage in}} meaningful social interaction. AD Caregivers report that most of their stress comes from unsuccessful attempts to communicate with their patients. In an effort to improve the communicative interaction between caregiver and patient, many clinicians advise caregivers to modify their speech when talking to the patient. [...] “The main task for a person with Alzheimer’s is to maintain {{a sense of self}} or personhood,” Dr. Williams said. “If you know you’re <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> cognitive abilities and trying to maintain your personhood, and someone talks to you like a baby, it’s upsetting to you.” (Leland, 2008) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 and 2008, Dormer played Anne Boleyn in {{the first}} two seasons of The Tudors, for which she {{received}} highly positive reviews. Robert Abele of LA Weekly wrote: [...] "Natalie Dormer presents a painterly exquisiteness and complexity in her portrayal of Anne Boleyn... her enigmatic, time-halting loveliness is a boon for The Tudors, and damn near worth <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> head over". After her character's death {{at the end of the}} second season, The Boston Herald noted: [...] "Dormer gave Anne Boleyn life, making her not just a beautiful schemer but a rebellious, defiantly independent tragic hero in the tradition of Rebel Without a Cause and Cool Hand Luke... her departure from The Tudors leaves a tremendous void." ...|$|E
