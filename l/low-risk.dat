5|$|<b>Low-risk</b> {{disease can}} {{frequently}} be observed without any treatment {{at all or}} cured with surgery alone.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a <b>low-risk</b> for ASD. Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting {{and the degree of}} risk in the family environment.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey has {{assessed}} the extinct Kohala as a <b>low-risk</b> area. The volcano is in zone 9 (bottom risk), while {{the border of}} the volcano with Mauna Kea is zone 8 (second lowest), as Mauna Kea has not produced lava flows for 4,500 years.|$|E
5|$|Treatment and {{outcomes}} {{depends on the}} risk group a person is in. Treatments may include observation, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. <b>Low-risk</b> disease in babies typically has a good outcome with surgery or simply observation. In high-risk disease chances of long term survival, however, are less than 40% despite aggressive treatment.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a <b>low-risk</b> manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{primatologist}} James Thorn used environmental niche modelling in Indonesia {{to supplement}} the poor population data gathered to date to predict the remaining available habitat for slow lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These estimates indicated that the Javan slow loris was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda slow loris from Sumatra. The Bornean slow loris was in a better situation since much of its range consists of <b>low-risk</b> areas. Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris are found in more than 20protected areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{has lived}} a {{controversial}} lifestyle, {{during and after}} his playing career. He admitted to using drugs such as cocaine as early as his second year in the NFL, and was suspended several times by the league for failing drug tests. His drug abuse escalated after his retirement, and he was jailed three times for attempted drug possession. From 1998 to 2009, Taylor lived a sober, drug-free life. He worked as a color commentator on sporting events after his retirement, and pursued a career as an actor. His personal life came under public scrutiny in 2011 when {{he pleaded guilty to}} sexual misconduct involving a 16-year-old girl. After Taylor was put on trial, he was registered as a <b>low-risk</b> sex offender.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict <b>low-risk</b> decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a <b>low-risk</b> level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{tests are}} {{available}} for diagnosis of high-risk HPV infections. Because genital warts are caused by <b>low-risk</b> HPV types, DNA tests cannot be used for diagnosis of genital warts or other <b>low-risk</b> HPV infections.|$|E
25|$|In {{screening}} {{a general}} or <b>low-risk</b> population, most Pap results are normal.|$|E
25|$|The OMB Circular A-133 {{uses the}} high and low risk {{determination}} to regulate the amount of auditing to be performed. Although the actual work necessary for a Single Audit is established by the auditor, the OMB has set a limit for auditing high-risk and <b>low-risk</b> recipients. For high-risk recipients, the auditor is required to audit not less than 40% of all the federal assistance received during the year. For <b>low-risk</b> recipients, that limit is decreased to 20%.|$|E
25|$|Usually when {{inside their}} own {{half of the}} field, an attacking team will use <b>low-risk</b> plays to attempt to gain metres while {{avoiding}} turning over possession.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to the forensic work, detectives were also tracing the origin of every piece of luggage that had been checked onto PA 103, either in London or through the Interline baggage system. Interline baggage is baggage checked onto a flight in one location and automatically routed by the airline to other locations. It is the weak link in airline security, because provided it is tagged correctly a bag not properly x-rayed by a <b>low-risk</b> airline in a <b>low-risk</b> airport may be routed without further checks through several other airports to high-risk airlines.|$|E
25|$|Most {{women with}} a PUL are {{followed}} up with serum hCG measurements and repeat TVS examinations until a final diagnosis is confirmed. <b>Low-risk</b> cases of PUL {{that appear to be}} failing pregnancies may be followed up with a urinary pregnancy test after 2 weeks and get subsequent telephone advice. <b>Low-risk</b> cases of PUL that are likely intrauterine pregnancies may have another TVS in 2 weeks to access viability. High-risk cases of PUL require further assessment, either with a TVS within 48 h or additional hCG measurement.|$|E
25|$|HPV is most {{commonly}} transmitted through penetrative sex. While HPV {{can also be}} transmitted via non-penetrative sexual activity, it is less transmissible than via penetrative sex. There is conflicting evidence {{about the effect of}} condoms on transmission of <b>low-risk</b> HPV. Some studies have suggested that they are effective at reducing transmission. Other studies suggest that condoms are not effective at preventing transmission of the <b>low-risk</b> HPV variants that cause genital warts. The effect of condoms on HPV transmission may also be gender-dependent; {{there is some evidence that}} condoms are more effective at preventing infection of males than of females.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{challenging}} to differentiate between <b>low-risk,</b> benign headaches and high-risk, dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar. Headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose.|$|E
25|$|This {{determination}} {{affects the}} entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the examination accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient tests and audit procedures (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, the auditor greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk auditees, to ensure their opinion is correct. For <b>low-risk</b> auditees, the auditor is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a <b>low-risk</b> recipient may still have compliance issues. Conversely, a high-risk determination doesn't mean the recipient is non-compliant, just that they're more likely to be.|$|E
25|$|Although not yet {{formally}} {{incorporated in}} the generally accepted classification systems, molecular profiling of myelodysplastic syndrome genomes has increased the understanding of prognostic molecular factors for this disease. For example, in <b>low-risk</b> MDS, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are associated with significantly worsened survival.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, in some <b>low-risk</b> populations, {{screening}} in {{the absence}} of symptoms would not outweigh the risks of the procedure. For example, the odds of developing colorectal cancer between the ages of 20 and 40 are only 1 in 1250. This procedure has a low (0.35%) risk of serious complications.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to providing care related to <b>low-risk</b> pregnancy and childbirth, CNMs are also able to attend to women’s reproductive health needs from puberty through menopause {{as well as for}} the care of their newborns. Additionally, they are able to prescribe some medications, use certain medical devices, and implement therapeutic and diagnostic measures.|$|E
25|$|Induction {{chemotherapy}} {{to bring}} about bone marrow remission. For adults, standard induction plans include prednisone, vincristine, and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or cyclophosphamide. For children with <b>low-risk</b> ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for {{the first month of}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a <b>low-risk</b> for ASD. Behavioural problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting {{and the degree of}} risk in the family environment.|$|E
25|$|In Sheffield, United Kingdom, {{incorrect}} {{risk assessments}} for Down syndrome {{were sent to}} 154 pregnant women and two abortions were carried out {{as a direct result}} of a Y2K bug (miscalculation of the mother's age). Four babies with Down syndrome were also born to mothers who had been told they were in the <b>low-risk</b> group.|$|E
25|$|For {{the smaller}} Type B {{programs}} {{which have been}} identified as high-risk, the auditor has two options: either audit half of all high-risk Type B programs, or audit one Type B high-risk program for every <b>low-risk</b> Type A program. Type B programs which have a low risk of not complying are not required to be audited.|$|E
25|$|Tranexamic acid, a {{medication}} to promote blood clotting, {{may also be}} used to reduce bleeding and blood transfusions in <b>low-risk</b> women, however evidence as of 2015 was not strong. A 2017 trial found that it decreased the risk of death from bleeding from 1.9% to 1.5% in women with postpartum bleeding. The benefit was greater when the medication was given within three hours.|$|E
25|$|Ubuntu {{is built}} on Debian's {{architecture}} and infrastructure, and comprises Linux server, desktop and discontinued phone and tablet operating system versions. Ubuntu releases updated versions predictably every six months, and each release receives free support for nine months (eighteen months prior to 13.04) with security fixes, high-impact bug fixes and conservative, substantially beneficial <b>low-risk</b> bug fixes. The first release was in October 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{pulmonary}} embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) helps assess people in whom {{pulmonary embolism}} is suspected, but unlikely. Unlike the Wells score and Geneva score, which are clinical prediction rules intended to risk stratify people with suspected PE, the PERC rule {{is designed to}} rule out risk of PE in people when the physician has already stratified them into a <b>low-risk</b> category.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in {{the genes}} {{encoding}} for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) occur in 10-20% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and confer a worsened prognosis in <b>low-risk</b> MDS. Because the incidence of IDH1/2 mutations increases as the disease malignancy increases, these findings together suggest that IDH1/2 mutations are important drivers of progression of MDS to a more malignant disease state.|$|E
25|$|As {{demonstrated}} in the Table below, individuals with stage III and IV disease have a significant risk of dying from thyroid cancer. While many present with widely metastatic disease, an equal number evolve over years and decades from stage I or II disease. Physicians who manage thyroid cancer of any stage recognize that {{a small percentage of}} patients with <b>low-risk</b> thyroid cancer will progress to metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|TST (tuberculin skin test) {{positive}} {{is measured}} by size of induration. The size of the induration {{considered to be a}} positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a <b>low-risk</b> patient must have a larger induration for a positive result than a high-risk patient. High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with immunosuppression.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Asō flew to Washington to {{meet with}} United States President Barack Obama in February 2009. He was the first foreign leader to visit the Obama White House; however, reports {{suggested}} that the new administration was interested less in giving Asō a political boost than in sending a message that Japan {{continues to be an}} important ally and partner – a <b>low-risk,</b> high-payoff gesture for both Asō and Obama.|$|E
25|$|For <b>low-risk</b> disease, {{radiation}} therapy (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulant {{therapy is}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as oxygen or analgesia, may be required. People are often admitted to hospital {{in the early stages}} of treatment, and tend to remain under inpatient care until the INR has reached therapeutic levels. Increasingly, however, <b>low-risk</b> cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT. Evidence to support one approach versus the other is weak.|$|E
25|$|Many men {{diagnosed}} with <b>low-risk</b> prostate cancer {{are eligible for}} active surveillance. This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, {{with the intention of}} treatment for a cure if there are signs of cancer progression. Active surveillance is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.|$|E
25|$|The Goldman model {{differs from}} the Kidd-Stubbs series {{decompression}} model in that the Goldman model assumes linear kinetics, where the K-S model includes a quadratic component, and the Goldman model considers only the central well-perfused compartment to contribute explicitly to risk, while the K-S model assumes all compartments to carry potential risk. The DCIEM 1983 model associates risk with the two outermost compartments of a four compartment series. The mathematical model based on this concept is claimed by Goldman to fit not only the Navy square profile data used for calibration, but also predicts risk relatively accurately for saturation profiles. A bubble version of the ICM model was not significantly different in predictions, and was discarded as more complex with no significant advantages. The ICM also predicted decompression sickness incidence more accurately at the <b>low-risk</b> recreational diving exposures recorded in DAN's Project Dive Exploration data set. The alternative models {{used in this study}} were the LE1 (Linear-Exponential) and straight Haldanean models. The Goldman model predicts a significant risk reduction following a safety stop on a <b>low-risk</b> dive and significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the PADI tables suggest).|$|E
