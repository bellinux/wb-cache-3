25|$|Colgate-Palmolive {{has long}} been in {{competition}} with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P introduced its Tide <b>laundry</b> <b>detergent</b> shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.|$|E
25|$|During the Manhattan Project {{to develop}} the nuclear bomb in the early 1940s the {{chemical}} toxicity of uranium was an issue. It was found that uranium oxides stick very well to cotton cloth, and did not wash out with soap or <b>laundry</b> <b>detergent.</b> However, the uranium would wash out with a 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate. Clothing can become contaminated with toxic dust of depleted uranium (DU), which is very dense, and hence used for counterweights in a civilian context, and in armour-piercing projectiles. DU is not removed by normal laundering; washing with about 6 ounces (170 g) of baking soda in 2 gallons (7.5 l) of water will help to wash it out.|$|E

25|$|The company {{moved into}} other countries, {{both in terms}} of {{manufacturing}} and product sales, becoming an international corporation with its 1930 acquisition of the Thomas Hedley Co., based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in Newcastle upon Tyne, until quite recently. Numerous new products and brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced Tide <b>laundry</b> <b>detergent</b> in 1946 and Prell shampoo in 1947. In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain fluoride, known as Crest. Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased Charmin paper mills and began manufacturing toilet paper and other tissue paper products. Once again focusing on laundry, Procter & Gamble began making Downy fabric softener in 1960 and Bounce fabric softener sheets in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{products}} are printed with numbers 1–7 {{depending on the}} type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, <b>laundry</b> <b>detergent</b> bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E
