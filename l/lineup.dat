5|$|Breaking Benjamin is an American {{rock band}} from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first <b>lineup</b> {{of the band}} also {{included}} guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This <b>lineup</b> released two albums, Saturate (2002) and We Are Not Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.|$|E

50|$|The results {{concerning}} sequential and simultaneous <b>lineups</b> were following:Correct identification rate: 80% for sequential <b>lineups</b> and 76% for simultaneous <b>lineups</b> (total). 78% for sequential <b>lineups</b> and 80% for simultaneous <b>lineups</b> when cues were strong. 84% for sequential <b>lineups</b> and 58% for simultaneous <b>lineups</b> when cues were weak.Mistaken rate in target-absent condition: 39% for simultaneous <b>lineups</b> and 19% for sequential <b>lineups.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{found that}} there is an 8% {{difference}} in suspect identification between sequential and simultaneous <b>lineups,</b> favoring simultaneous lineups; meaning that simultaneous <b>lineups</b> are more likely overall to identify the guilty suspect. This finding has decreased since 2001 where there was a 15% difference in favor of simultaneous <b>lineups.</b> They also replicated the findings that there is about a 22% difference between sequential and simultaneous <b>lineups</b> regarding errors in suspect identification; meaning that sequential <b>lineups</b> are less likely to identify the wrong suspect.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{pinpoint}} exactly when sequential <b>lineups</b> were first studied, the knowledge that simultaneous <b>lineups</b> often failed and convicted an innocent person has been common knowledge for many years. The advance of the popularity of sequential <b>lineups</b> {{can be traced to the}} Innocence Project and Gary Wells. He is a researcher of sequential <b>lineups</b> and has many studies that show that sequential <b>lineups</b> lead to less wrongful convictions. The early studies of sequential <b>lineups</b> found that there was a significant difference in the wrongful conviction of innocent persons. Since these early studies there has been a push to increase the accuracy of eyewitness memory even more.|$|R

Doggett's ex-wife, Barbara Doggett, meets up for a <b>lineup</b> at a police station. Barbara does not recognize Regali or anyone else on the <b>lineup.</b> Scully finds some similarities between Luke and the two dead bodies, but no forensic proof. Doggett comes to realize that Regali has had help from someone within the FBI all along. Follmer informs Reyes and Doggett that Cadet Hayes is really Stuart Mimms, a former mental patient. He also informs them that Mimms lived in New York City during the year of Luke's murder, hinting that Mimms is the murderer and not Regali. Doggett and Reyes assemble a SWAT team to raid Mimms apartment. Mimms is taken into police custody and at a new <b>lineup,</b> Barbara recognizes Mimms.|$|E

5|$|The new <b>lineup</b> {{made its}} live debut at the Helsinki Ice Hall on February 4. The 2008 Gigantour, with 29 North American dates, began shortly afterwards. Mustaine wanted a shorter <b>lineup,</b> {{allowing}} each band {{a chance to}} perform well. The third tour featured In Flames, Children of Bodom, Job for a Cowboy and High on Fire. Megadeth continued the Tour of Duty in South America and Mexico in May and June. A compilation album, , was released in September 2008.|$|E
30|$|There now exist three {{explanations}} for why simultaneous <b>lineups</b> induce superior performance to showups. We {{have focused on}} two, filler siphoning theory without criterial variability, and the greater adverse impact of criterial variability on showups than <b>lineups.</b> But {{we have yet to}} discuss the explanation Wetmore et al.

This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were {{compounded by the fact}} that there were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E

40|$|Eyewitness-identification {{studies have}} focused on the idea that unfair <b>lineups</b> (i. e., ones in which the police suspect stands out) make {{witnesses}} more willing to identify the police suspect. We examined whether unfair <b>lineups</b> also influence subjects’ ability to distinguish between innocent and guilty suspects and their ability to judge the accuracy of their identification. In a single experiment (N = 8, 925), we compared three fair-lineup techniques used by the police with unfair <b>lineups</b> in which we did nothing to prevent distinctive suspects from standing out. Compared with the fair <b>lineups,</b> doing nothing not only increased subjects’ willingness to identify the suspect but also markedly impaired subjects’ ability to distinguish between innocent and guilty suspects. Accuracy was also reduced at every level of confidence. These results advance theory on witnesses’ identification performance and have important practical implications for how police should construct <b>lineups</b> when suspects have distinctive features. ...|$|R

5|$|Booth was not {{cleared for}} full-contact {{practice}} with the team until January 25, 2010. Six days later, {{he returned to the}} <b>lineup</b> for a game against the New York Islanders after being sidelined for 45 contests.

The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth in the <b>lineup</b> on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E
5|$|Following a tour in 1997, Slash {{approached}} Griparic about {{forming a}} new <b>lineup</b> of Slash's Snakepit They {{began looking for}} a singer, receiving over 300 audition tapes from mostly unknown singers. Jon Stevens of Noiseworks, who had been recording with Slash, {{was seen as a}} potential singer in early 1998. However, he returned to Australia to continue his solo career. They eventually added singer Rod Jackson to the group after Griparic played a tape of him for Slash. Completing the <b>lineup</b> were guitarist Ryan Roxie, formerly of Alice Cooper, and drummer Matt Laug, also from Alice Cooper and the band Venice. They began rehearsing at Mates Studio before rehearsing and recording in Slash's new home studio in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses in 1996, Slash formed the cover band Slash's Blues Ball. After a tour in 1997, Slash approached Blues Ball bassist Johnny Griparic about forming a new <b>lineup</b> of Slash's Snakepit. The new <b>lineup</b> consisted of Slash, Griparic, singer Rod Jackson, guitarist Ryan Roxie and drummer Matt Laug (Roxie and Laug were both {{former members of}} Alice Cooper's solo band). They recorded and released their second album entitled Ain't Life Grand in 2000, which was preceded by a tour supporting AC/DC and followed by their own headlining tour. For the tour, Keri Kelli joined the group in place of Ryan Roxie, who departed following {{the completion of the}} album. However, after the final show, Slash disbanded Slash's Snakepit {{due to a lack of}} commitment from his band members.|$|E

The Soviets would not release their <b>lineup</b> until they had seen their opponents', the opposite order, considering they were the visitors. The official scorer {{had to return to}} the Soviets' dressing room and demand the <b>lineup.</b> To Sinden, he wanted to put the Ellis-Clarke-Henderson line on against Valeri Kharlamov's line. The Soviets did not start Kharlamov's line and Sinden named Phil Esposito's line for the opening face-off.|$|E
