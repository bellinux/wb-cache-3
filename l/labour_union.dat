40|$|The {{threat of}} HIV/AIDS on {{humanity}} still {{remains one of}} the most challenging issues of our time. In South Africa, <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> play a significant role in the economy. Their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS is therefore vital in workplace HIV/AIDS programmes. The research objective was to identify the impact that the partnership between business and <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> is having in these programmes. The role that <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> play is also assessed. The first phase of the interviews entailed conducting face to face semistructured interviews with fifteen large companies based in Gauteng province employing a minimum of 1000 employees. All the companies were and had to have union representation amongst their staff members. Phase two of the interviews involved interviewing representatives from the three largest <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> in South Africa. The findings clearly show that <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> have a role to play in the fight against the pandemic. It is evident that they are to a large extent being successful in their identified roles. The impact of the partnership between <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> and business has resulted in the objectives of the HIV/AIDS programmes being met. Areas for improvement are also suggested as the battle is yet to be won. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) unrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Questions {{of justice}} in the {{transition}} to a green economy have been raised by various social forces. Very few proposals, however, have been as focused and developed as the “just transition” strategy proposed by global <b>labour</b> <b>unions.</b> Yet, <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> are remarkably absent from discussions of the transition towards a green economy. This is surprising as <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> are arguably the largest organizations in the world fighting for basic rights and more just social relations. This paper tries to advance the potential contribution of <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> in this arena by asking: what is the full scope of “just transition” today and how have <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> developed and refined it over the years to render the move towards a green economy both environmentally and socially sustainable? The concept of just transition is hotly debated within <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> and has different interpretations, and hence different strategies. The last section assesses these interpretations by means of a normative framework, which seeks to fuse political economy and political ecology. Empirically, we add to the growing literature on labour environmentalism, as well as transitions more generally. Analytically, our goal is to place the various approaches to a “just transition” within a heuristic framework of environmental justice that is explicit about power relations when demanding justice, two themes central to this special issue...|$|R

The goal is to answer these questions: What factors {{influenced}} position of <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century? How did the position of <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> change during World War I? World War I was already a second experience with war economy in the history of the USA (remember American Civil War). For the first time, though, <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> played important role in the American economy. I have decided to analyze the effect of World War I on position of <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> because I consider it an important one. In Chapter one I will analyze the influence of war inflation on real wages of employees and on the ratio between wages of union workers and non-union workers. Chapter two is dedicated to labour conditions (social programs, safety, unemployment benefits) and to their modifications which took place because of World War I. Chapter three is about labour legislation development (regulation of hours and wages, yellow dog contracts, anti-trust and immigration legislation) and its adjustments during the war years.

25|$|Today, the world's {{highest rates}} of union {{membership}} are in the Scandinavian countries. In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union (<b>labour</b> <b>union</b> density) was 68.3% in Sweden and 54.8% in Norway, while it was 34.9% in Ireland and 18.4% in Germany. Excluding full-time students working part-time, Swedish union density was 69% in 2015 and 2016. In all the Nordic countries with a Ghent system—Sweden, Denmark and Finland—union density is about 70%. The considerably raised membership fees of Swedish union unemployment funds implemented by the new center-right government in January 2007 caused large drops in membership in both unemployment funds and trade unions. From 2006 to 2008, union density declined by six percentage points: from 77% to 71%.|$|E

40|$|Many Developing Countries {{ratified}} ILO Fundamental Conventions and authorized local <b>labour</b> <b>unions.</b> Multinational companies producing {{in these}} countries pay more when NGOs campaigns take place and reputation counts. However, whether this external pressure from NGOs benefit local workers outside MNEs affiliates in host countries remains an open issue. Segmented and weak local <b>labour</b> <b>unions</b> often rely on external funding from the North and technical assistance by labour NGOs. They need to increase their visibility in the labour intensive sectors targeted by Northern donations and activism. To address these issues we develop a bargaining model adapted to peculiarities of labour market institutions in developing countries, i. e. external funding and the complementarity with labour NGOs. This model is estimated on data on Indonesian manufacturing firms, {{before and after the}} authorisation of <b>labour</b> <b>unions,</b> in sensitive and non sensitive sectors. We find that, in sector with visibility for <b>labour</b> <b>unions,</b> the net outcome on wages of the presence of NGOs is negative. The external fundings imply a distortion in the objective of <b>labour</b> <b>unions,</b> confronted with the constraint of increasing the employment in the formal sector. ...|$|R
